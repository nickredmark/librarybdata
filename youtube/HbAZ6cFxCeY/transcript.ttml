<p begin="00:00:16.580" end="00:00:22.189" style="s2">represent my class and you might not</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.480" end="00:00:26.090" style="s2">know anything about this picture it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.189" end="00:00:29.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a picture of Jonah being thrown up</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.090" end="00:00:31.580" style="s2">out of whales belly after spending three</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.630" end="00:00:34.790" style="s2">days inside it it&#39;s an old biblical</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.580" end="00:00:36.650" style="s2">story it&#39;s a myth it&#39;s a fairy tale</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.790" end="00:00:39.290" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.650" end="00:00:42.860" style="s2">and and I don&#39;t mean that derogative</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.290" end="00:00:44.570" style="s2">manner we know for example that some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.860" end="00:00:46.970" style="s2">the Grimm&#39;s brothers fairy tales are</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.570" end="00:00:48.950" style="s2">perhaps fifteen thousand years old</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.970" end="00:00:51.710" style="s2">they&#39;ve been traced way back they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.950" end="00:00:54.410" style="s2">really really old and old stories are</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.710" end="00:00:55.790" style="s2">strange and they&#39;re strange because well</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.410" end="00:00:57.980" style="s2">they&#39;ve been told generation after</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.790" end="00:01:02.000" style="s2">generation after generation and so you</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.980" end="00:01:04.309" style="s2">could imagine that something retold over</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.000" end="00:01:07.310" style="s2">such an expand of expansive time has</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.309" end="00:01:09.979" style="s2">been reduced to its gist many many times</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.310" end="00:01:12.590" style="s2">and nothing that&#39;s in the story anymore</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.979" end="00:01:16.009" style="s2">is superfluous it&#39;s all meaningful in</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.590" end="00:01:18.619" style="s2">some sense it&#39;s sort of like a meta</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.009" end="00:01:20.380" style="s2">story that&#39;s one way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.619" end="00:01:22.729" style="s2">imagine that you took a hundred books</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.380" end="00:01:25.850" style="s2">hundred adventure books and you had to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.729" end="00:01:28.580" style="s2">extract out the central features of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.850" end="00:01:30.560" style="s2">adventure book now it&#39;s hard to do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.580" end="00:01:31.399" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re averaging across them</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.560" end="00:01:34.789" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.399" end="00:01:37.190" style="s2">distilling them in some manner then you</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.789" end="00:01:40.009" style="s2">get a meta adventure and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.190" end="00:01:42.590" style="s2">like a myth upon which all adventures</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.009" end="00:01:45.110" style="s2">are based and this story is actually one</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.590" end="00:01:48.110" style="s2">of those stories and I&#39;m going to tell</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.110" end="00:01:49.640" style="s2">you what I think the story means and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.110" end="00:01:52.910" style="s2">not saying that this is all it means</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.640" end="00:01:56.300" style="s2">because most stories of this sort are in</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.910" end="00:01:58.610" style="s2">some sense inexhaustible just like great</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.300" end="00:02:00.649" style="s2">works of art are inexhaustible there</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.610" end="00:02:02.750" style="s2">there&#39;s more information in them than</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.649" end="00:02:06.560" style="s2">you can possibly articulate that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.750" end="00:02:08.209" style="s2">makes them profound that&#39;s why you go</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:10.220" style="s2">look at them otherwise someone could</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.209" end="00:02:11.540" style="s2">just tell you about the painting and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.220" end="00:02:16.640" style="s2">that would be the end of that but that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.540" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work so so that Jonah is being</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.640" end="00:02:21.159" style="s2">spit up by this whale and of course on</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">the face of it that&#39;s an impossibility</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.159" end="00:02:28.480" style="s2">because well</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.959" end="00:02:30.730" style="s2">you can&#39;t live inside a whale that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.480" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible now you may remember and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.730" end="00:02:36.040" style="s2">likely do that you all know a story</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:40.030" style="s2">about someone who is inside a whale</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.040" end="00:02:42.519" style="s2">that&#39;s Pinocchio right and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.030" end="00:02:45.040" style="s2">go to that movie maybe even as an adult</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.519" end="00:02:46.989" style="s2">you watch that movie and Geppetto is</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.040" end="00:02:49.359" style="s2">down there in the whale in his little</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.989" end="00:02:51.099" style="s2">boat you know it&#39;s big cavernous inside</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.359" end="00:02:52.840" style="s2">you don&#39;t really care that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.099" end="00:02:55.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of things you don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.840" end="00:02:57.579" style="s2">about you don&#39;t care that those are</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.480" end="00:02:59.849" style="s2">drawings and not real people you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.579" end="00:03:03.419" style="s2">care about that and you don&#39;t care that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.849" end="00:03:05.439" style="s2">the inside of a whale isn&#39;t a cavern and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.419" end="00:03:07.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t care that Pinocchio is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.439" end="00:03:08.530" style="s2">puppet for that matter none of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.000" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">matters to you at all and that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.530" end="00:03:12.430" style="s2">you&#39;re really strange creatures and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.959" end="00:03:14.769" style="s2">don&#39;t even notice when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.430" end="00:03:16.900" style="s2">something absolutely absurd and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.769" end="00:03:18.129" style="s2">one of those times when you are but if</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.900" end="00:03:21.010" style="s2">someone taps you on the shoulder and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.129" end="00:03:24.669" style="s2">says you know you&#39;re just watching</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.010" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">drawings of a puppet puppets can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.669" end="00:03:29.049" style="s2">really move autonomously and now he&#39;s at</p>

<p begin="00:03:33.609" end="00:03:37.810" style="s2">you&#39;re okay with that and you&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.769" end="00:03:40.629" style="s2">shut up because I want to finish</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.810" end="00:03:43.239" style="s2">watching a movie and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.629" end="00:03:44.949" style="s2">interesting you see that tells you</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.239" end="00:03:48.159" style="s2">something about your unconscious if</p>

<p begin="00:06:59.970" end="00:07:05.320" style="s2">there are forms of communication that</p>

<p begin="00:07:22.750" end="00:07:28.330" style="s2">happens near the end and bed everything</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.660" end="00:07:30.490" style="s2">clicks together and it&#39;s cuz you&#39;ve sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.330" end="00:07:33.039" style="s2">of seen the thing as a whole and a lot</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.449" end="00:07:45.490" style="s2">is what peg lay is referring to is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.669" end="00:07:48.990" style="s2">and this is a psychoanalytic proposition</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.490" end="00:07:48.990" style="s2">I would say or a romantic proposition</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.650" end="00:07:57.010" style="s2">now the idea roughly is that way out in</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.270" end="00:07:59.199" style="s2">the periphery of reality are all those</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.010" end="00:08:01.210" style="s2">things that not only do you not know but</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.199" end="00:08:03.430" style="s2">you don&#39;t even know you don&#39;t know right</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.210" end="00:08:05.620" style="s2">there you&#39;re completely blind to their</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.430" end="00:08:07.539" style="s2">existence and then there&#39;s unknown</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.539" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">about and then there&#39;s unknown things</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:19.199" style="s2">act out and dramatize and so all of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.229" end="00:08:22.449" style="s2">is on the periphery of our knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.199" end="00:08:25.330" style="s2">that&#39;s a psychoanalytic dictum where the</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.219" end="00:08:41.829" style="s2">you enter into a reverie a dream state</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.439" end="00:09:58.579" style="s2">being in the world like maybe the mask</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.689" end="00:10:00.170" style="s2">is a wolf mask and so you act out the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.579" end="00:10:01.879" style="s2">wolf and there&#39;s music that goes along</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.170" end="00:10:03.230" style="s2">with that and you think well what are</p>

<p begin="00:10:21.709" end="00:10:27.980" style="s2">from them and so we play this strange</p>

<p begin="00:11:09.829" end="00:11:16.939" style="s2">science and then it emerged more</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.730" end="00:11:30.470" style="s2">very long like a blink blink to the eye</p>

<p begin="00:11:30.470" end="00:11:33.799" style="s2">engineers they could build things and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.389" end="00:11:36.259" style="s2">forth but they didn&#39;t know how to</p>

<p begin="00:11:41.179" end="00:11:48.410" style="s2">because science has seeped so far into</p>

<p begin="00:11:50.539" end="00:11:55.249" style="s2">it does make us believe that the</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.990" end="00:12:13.309" style="s2">designed to answer the question then</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.610" end="00:12:18.230" style="s2">that question is how should one conduct</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.309" end="00:12:20.319" style="s2">oneself in the world and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.230" end="00:12:22.699" style="s2">important thing since you&#39;re alive and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.319" end="00:12:25.009" style="s2">hypothetically you&#39;d rather stay alive</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.699" end="00:12:26.899" style="s2">and well you&#39;re alive you probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.009" end="00:12:29.480" style="s2">want to suffer any more than you have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.899" end="00:12:31.999" style="s2">and no more stupidly than you have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.480" end="00:12:33.139" style="s2">and it might also be good if some of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.999" end="00:12:35.209" style="s2">things that you want it actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.139" end="00:12:38.899" style="s2">happened and so you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.209" end="00:12:40.970" style="s2">motivated to know how to act and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.899" end="00:12:42.499" style="s2">people are always telling each other how</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.970" end="00:12:44.089" style="s2">to act we&#39;re sending each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.499" end="00:12:46.100" style="s2">information all the time about how to</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.089" end="00:12:48.199" style="s2">act we do that with our the expressions</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.100" end="00:12:49.850" style="s2">on our face and of course when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.199" end="00:12:52.129" style="s2">to people we always look at their face</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.850" end="00:12:53.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s because their face tells you</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.129" end="00:12:55.669" style="s2">what they&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.240" end="00:12:56.899" style="s2">you know if they&#39;re smiling and paying</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.669" end="00:12:59.720" style="s2">attention to you well then you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.899" end="00:13:02.779" style="s2">assume that you&#39;re doing something right</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.720" end="00:13:04.669" style="s2">and if they&#39;re looking annoyed or</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.779" end="00:13:07.160" style="s2">disgusted that&#39;s a particularly bad one</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.669" end="00:13:07.430" style="s2">then you might think you might take a</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.160" end="00:13:09.589" style="s2">hint</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.430" end="00:13:11.210" style="s2">from that especially if you know three</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.589" end="00:13:14.120" style="s2">or four people are doing it at the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.210" end="00:13:17.240" style="s2">time and so we&#39;re reflecting we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.120" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">reflecting some ideal to one another</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.240" end="00:13:24.890" style="s2">constantly and the more attentive you</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:27.380" style="s2">are the more likely you are to act in</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.890" end="00:13:29.180" style="s2">accordance with that ideal and the more</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.380" end="00:13:31.279" style="s2">like you likely you are to move towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.180" end="00:13:34.010" style="s2">it you may not even know what the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:35.240" style="s2">is in an articulated sense in fact you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.010" end="00:13:38.330" style="s2">probably don&#39;t you know you could come</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.240" end="00:13:40.010" style="s2">up with a well you know a good person is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.330" end="00:13:42.020" style="s2">nice and friendly and you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.010" end="00:13:45.649" style="s2">cooperative and yeah yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.020" end="00:13:47.420" style="s2">that&#39;s all just cliche but you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.649" end="00:13:48.980" style="s2">know your conception might be very</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.420" end="00:13:50.450" style="s2">Hollow it&#39;s very likely that it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.980" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">Hollow even though you may be able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.450" end="00:13:55.580" style="s2">act in a very sophisticated manner</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.240" end="00:13:59.270" style="s2">alright so anyways this is a story I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.580" end="00:14:00.649" style="s2">say oh it&#39;s a meta story it&#39;s it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.270" end="00:14:02.330" style="s2">would happen if you collected a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.649" end="00:14:04.610" style="s2">stories and then you extract it out a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.330" end="00:14:06.649" style="s2">story from them and it&#39;s sort of a story</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.610" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">about destiny and it&#39;s couched in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.649" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">religious language but that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:18.020" style="s2">because most of these distilled stories</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:20.930" style="s2">are form the foundation of religious</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.020" end="00:14:23.330" style="s2">texts and religious texts and myth and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.930" end="00:14:27.260" style="s2">myths and stories are as I said part of</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.330" end="00:14:29.839" style="s2">the outer perimeter of our society they</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.260" end="00:14:33.050" style="s2">have a they have a coherent nature and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.839" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">it&#39;s all and they form a foundation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.050" end="00:14:39.170" style="s2">it&#39;s on that foundation that everything</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:41.510" style="s2">that you take for granted rests even if</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.170" end="00:14:43.910" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand the foundation so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.510" end="00:14:46.190" style="s2">can give you an example there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.910" end="00:14:48.950" style="s2">metaphysical idea that underlies Western</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.190" end="00:14:52.820" style="s2">civilization and that metaphysical idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.950" end="00:14:55.430" style="s2">is that the individual has transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.820" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">worth that&#39;s that&#39;s the idea from which</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.430" end="00:15:00.410" style="s2">the notion of natural rights is derived</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:02.000" style="s2">and of course our legal system is</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.410" end="00:15:04.760" style="s2">predicated on the idea that you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.000" end="00:15:09.410" style="s2">certain natural rights they&#39;re enshrined</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.760" end="00:15:11.270" style="s2">in the Bill of Rights for example and in</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.410" end="00:15:15.230" style="s2">the in the states when the bills Bill of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.270" end="00:15:17.029" style="s2">Rights was being formulated when the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.230" end="00:15:17.959" style="s2">legislation Ridge the legislation that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.029" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">found that the state was being</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.959" end="00:15:21.260" style="s2">formulated the formulators said we hold</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.260" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.260" end="00:15:25.300" style="s2">truths to be self-evident what does that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.260" end="00:15:28.580" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.300" end="00:15:32.030" style="s2">they&#39;re axioms of faith right there</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.580" end="00:15:34.760" style="s2">they&#39;re propositions and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.030" end="00:15:37.070" style="s2">proof for them there they&#39;re a mode of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.760" end="00:15:40.640" style="s2">operation in the world and so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.070" end="00:15:42.110" style="s2">hypothesis is something like well if I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.640" end="00:15:44.620" style="s2">treat you like there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.110" end="00:15:47.060" style="s2">you that has transcendent value implicit</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.620" end="00:15:49.310" style="s2">intrinsic value whatever that might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.060" end="00:15:51.020" style="s2">and there are stories about that and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.310" end="00:15:53.960" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about that and you do the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.020" end="00:15:56.840" style="s2">same to me and then we set up a body of</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.960" end="00:15:59.240" style="s2">laws that recognizes the sovereignty of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.840" end="00:16:03.410" style="s2">the individual so that the law itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.240" end="00:16:05.090" style="s2">has to act with respect towards every</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.410" end="00:16:06.980" style="s2">individual even if that individual has</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.090" end="00:16:09.160" style="s2">done something reprehensible which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.980" end="00:16:13.570" style="s2">very weird if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.160" end="00:16:19.160" style="s2">then our society will work better and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.570" end="00:16:22.760" style="s2">well perhaps that&#39;s true but for better</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.160" end="00:16:24.740" style="s2">or worse that is what this society is</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.760" end="00:16:29.660" style="s2">predicated on and that&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.740" end="00:16:31.640" style="s2">very very very very old idea and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.660" end="00:16:34.760" style="s2">idea that people came to with great</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.640" end="00:16:37.100" style="s2">difficulty because it was over thousands</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.760" end="00:16:39.320" style="s2">of years that people learned how to take</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.100" end="00:16:41.030" style="s2">their little tribal groups which are</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.320" end="00:16:42.440" style="s2">always squabbling with one another right</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.030" end="00:16:45.110" style="s2">because there&#39;s human beings they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.440" end="00:16:48.320" style="s2">very violent and tribal groups are by no</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.110" end="00:16:50.900" style="s2">means civilized it&#39;s there&#39;s no noble</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.320" end="00:16:52.730" style="s2">savage like the Europeans thought if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.900" end="00:16:53.750" style="s2">study tribal groups in the world today</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.730" end="00:16:55.220" style="s2">the murder</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.750" end="00:17:00.710" style="s2">the death rate by violence is</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.220" end="00:17:03.020" style="s2">unbelievably high so something unites a</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.710" end="00:17:04.730" style="s2">tribe within a tribe it&#39;s often kinship</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.020" end="00:17:06.380" style="s2">but then tribes come together to form</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.730" end="00:17:09.530" style="s2">larger civilizations and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.380" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">determine some sort of meta principle</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.530" end="00:17:12.709" style="s2">that guides them so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:14.449" style="s2">cooperate and come together without</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.709" end="00:17:16.730" style="s2">destroying one another and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.449" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">extract out a principle by which the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.730" end="00:17:21.680" style="s2">society might function and that has to</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:22.760" style="s2">work and then as societies get bigger</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.680" end="00:17:24.170" style="s2">and bigger and bigger and bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.760" end="00:17:27.020" style="s2">bigger they have to bring more and more</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.170" end="00:17:29.270" style="s2">of these diverse traditions together and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.020" end="00:17:32.840" style="s2">extract out something from them that has</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.270" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">power and functional utility and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.840" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">allows people to unite</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:42.460" style="s2">and so this is one of the stories that</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.440" end="00:17:46.100" style="s2">talks about that it&#39;s a story about</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.460" end="00:17:51.140" style="s2">individual responsibility and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.100" end="00:17:53.720" style="s2">happens when it&#39;s not heated so you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.140" end="00:17:58.070" style="s2">because we could say you are a social</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.720" end="00:17:59.690" style="s2">creature right to the core and most of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.070" end="00:18:01.850" style="s2">your environment is other people and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.690" end="00:18:04.610" style="s2">those other people want something from</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.850" end="00:18:06.740" style="s2">you and you want something from them so</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.610" end="00:18:07.820" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna play games with them you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.740" end="00:18:09.740" style="s2">either gonna be good at it you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.820" end="00:18:13.700" style="s2">be bad at it but you&#39;re gonna play games</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.740" end="00:18:16.640" style="s2">with them and so the game might have</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.700" end="00:18:19.370" style="s2">rules really sophisticated rules in fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.640" end="00:18:21.530" style="s2">and you&#39;d expect that because as your</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.370" end="00:18:25.360" style="s2">behavior more and more approximates an</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.530" end="00:18:27.710" style="s2">ideal assuming such a thing exists then</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.360" end="00:18:29.330" style="s2">you&#39;re more and more sophisticated and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.710" end="00:18:32.330" style="s2">the nature of the ideal is perhaps more</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.330" end="00:18:35.050" style="s2">and more complex and and difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.330" end="00:18:37.970" style="s2">understand you get a hint of this though</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.050" end="00:18:40.460" style="s2">you can get a hint of this because you</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.970" end="00:18:45.260" style="s2">will see if you pay attention to your</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.460" end="00:18:46.850" style="s2">own soul your psyche your unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.260" end="00:18:49.580" style="s2">you&#39;ll see that there are people that</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.850" end="00:18:51.770" style="s2">you admire and that there are people</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.580" end="00:18:53.960" style="s2">that you have contempt for and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.770" end="00:18:55.250" style="s2">and it isn&#39;t necessarily that you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.960" end="00:18:58.580" style="s2">hundred percent accurate in your</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.250" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">judgment you know it&#39;s not such a bad</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.580" end="00:19:08.000" style="s2">idea to criticize your first impressions</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:10.490" style="s2">but those states exist and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.000" end="00:19:11.900" style="s2">reason you admire someone and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.490" end="00:19:13.790" style="s2">reason you have contempt for someone</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.900" end="00:19:16.010" style="s2">there may be multiple reasons and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.790" end="00:19:17.870" style="s2">a hint to your intrinsic value structure</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.010" end="00:19:19.370" style="s2">it&#39;s a hint about your intrinsic value</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.870" end="00:19:21.980" style="s2">structure right you wouldn&#39;t admire</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.370" end="00:19:24.170" style="s2">someone unless there was something about</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.980" end="00:19:25.940" style="s2">them that you valued and perhaps that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.170" end="00:19:28.490" style="s2">you would also like to be able to do and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.940" end="00:19:30.830" style="s2">he wouldn&#39;t despise someone or have</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.490" end="00:19:32.450" style="s2">contempt for them if you didn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.830" end="00:19:34.760" style="s2">that something they were doing was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.450" end="00:19:37.220" style="s2">and that it would be wrong if you did it</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.760" end="00:19:40.070" style="s2">too and so you&#39;re bringing to bear on</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.220" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">the situation an implicit morality and</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.070" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">you have to do that because as I said</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.190" end="00:19:50.230" style="s2">you can&#39;t act without a morality because</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.910" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna act you&#39;re gonna try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.230" end="00:19:56.830" style="s2">make things better that otherwise why</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:58.270" style="s2">bother and if you&#39;re acting to make</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.830" end="00:19:59.500" style="s2">things better than some things have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.270" end="00:20:01.930" style="s2">be better and some things have to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.500" end="00:20:04.260" style="s2">worse and that&#39;s a value structure so</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.930" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">you have one</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.260" end="00:20:14.020" style="s2">all right so Jonah he gets a call from</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.200" end="00:20:17.620" style="s2">God and God tells them that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.020" end="00:20:22.290" style="s2">city Nineveh that&#39;s falling into moral</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.620" end="00:20:26.110" style="s2">disarray now what does that mean well</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.290" end="00:20:28.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a universal story it&#39;s like all</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.110" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">cultures are always falling into</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.510" end="00:20:35.290" style="s2">disarray it&#39;s their nature just entropy</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:37.180" style="s2">does that right things change the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.290" end="00:20:38.860" style="s2">changes the environment changes and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.180" end="00:20:40.390" style="s2">culture doesn&#39;t keep up very well and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.860" end="00:20:43.600" style="s2">then of course it has corrupt elements</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.390" end="00:20:46.930" style="s2">and so it&#39;s an interior eternal story</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.600" end="00:20:48.760" style="s2">the individual is always placed in</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.930" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">relationship to a culture that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.760" end="00:20:54.790" style="s2">somewhat corrupt and then the question</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:57.070" style="s2">is well what do you do about it and if</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.790" end="00:20:59.140" style="s2">the answer is nothing well then it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.070" end="00:21:01.720" style="s2">just get more corrupt and if the answer</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.140" end="00:21:05.700" style="s2">is be corrupt - then it will just get</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.720" end="00:21:10.330" style="s2">more corrupt so the answer has to be to</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.700" end="00:21:13.510" style="s2">oppose the corruption because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.330" end="00:21:16.480" style="s2">only way it&#39;s going to stop now god</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.510" end="00:21:20.380" style="s2">threatens to destroy this city because</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.480" end="00:21:23.530" style="s2">of its corruption and I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.380" end="00:21:25.920" style="s2">need to presume anything particularly</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.530" end="00:21:29.590" style="s2">metaphysical about that to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.920" end="00:21:31.060" style="s2">it&#39;s very straight forward that the more</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.590" end="00:21:33.340" style="s2">corrupt the culture is and the less</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.060" end="00:21:35.380" style="s2">Trust is possible between individuals</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.340" end="00:21:37.810" style="s2">the less productive of the culture is</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.380" end="00:21:39.430" style="s2">going to be because why do anything if</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.810" end="00:21:41.770" style="s2">some corrupt person is just gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.430" end="00:21:43.360" style="s2">and take it you know it might even be</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.770" end="00:21:46.110" style="s2">that the culture is so corrupt that if</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:48.550" style="s2">you are good for something and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.110" end="00:21:50.380" style="s2">produce resources you&#39;re actually more</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.550" end="00:21:52.780" style="s2">likely to get killed because you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.380" end="00:21:54.310" style="s2">something of value so like this just</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.780" end="00:21:56.350" style="s2">you&#39;re just not going anywhere with that</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.310" end="00:21:59.020" style="s2">and why would you work if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.350" end="00:22:01.210" style="s2">have any sense that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.020" end="00:22:04.090" style="s2">store up the value of your work for some</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.210" end="00:22:05.800" style="s2">reasonable time in the future so if the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.090" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">society is corrupt and there&#39;s no trust</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.800" end="00:22:10.540" style="s2">its degenerating and you know it might</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:12.220" style="s2">live for a while but isn&#39;t it last very</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.540" end="00:22:18.160" style="s2">long and so that&#39;s the idea corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.220" end="00:22:20.890" style="s2">societies collapse that leaves open what</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.160" end="00:22:24.430" style="s2">corruption means anyways Jonah</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.890" end="00:22:26.620" style="s2">thanks no no bloody way I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.430" end="00:22:27.880" style="s2">that City they can go to hell as far as</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.620" end="00:22:30.310" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned and that&#39;s really what he</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.880" end="00:22:32.650" style="s2">thinks and why in the world should I do</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.310" end="00:22:35.170" style="s2">anything about it anyways and these are</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.650" end="00:22:37.810" style="s2">good objections it&#39;s like why would you</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.170" end="00:22:41.380" style="s2">do that and you&#39;ll face this believe me</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.810" end="00:22:43.530" style="s2">in your life you will face this in fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.380" end="00:22:46.990" style="s2">you already do always constantly</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.530" end="00:22:48.490" style="s2">continually in small ways perhaps when</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.990" end="00:22:50.710" style="s2">you&#39;re interacting with people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.490" end="00:22:52.180" style="s2">aren&#39;t treating you properly and when</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.710" end="00:22:53.530" style="s2">you&#39;re acting and those might be your</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.180" end="00:22:55.390" style="s2">parents they might be your friends they</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.530" end="00:22:59.380" style="s2">might be people at your workplace they</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.390" end="00:23:02.130" style="s2">might be professors they&#39;re playing a</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.380" end="00:23:03.880" style="s2">crooked game and you don&#39;t like it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.130" end="00:23:06.670" style="s2">you know it&#39;s crooked</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.880" end="00:23:08.620" style="s2">and so then the question is well what</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.670" end="00:23:10.690" style="s2">should you do about it well if you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.620" end="00:23:12.490" style="s2">you&#39;re correct know it&#39;s crooked it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.690" end="00:23:14.050" style="s2">not so good to play along with it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.490" end="00:23:15.880" style="s2">we&#39;ll say that you know it&#39;s crooked by</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.050" end="00:23:17.980" style="s2">your own standard of values it D</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.880" end="00:23:21.960" style="s2">degrades you to play along with it</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.980" end="00:23:24.880" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna stand up and oppose it well</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.960" end="00:23:27.490" style="s2">no probably not</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.880" end="00:23:29.380" style="s2">you&#39;re probably gonna do what Jonah did</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.490" end="00:23:32.470" style="s2">jump on a ship and get the hell out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.380" end="00:23:34.210" style="s2">there and you know that&#39;s a logical</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.470" end="00:23:36.700" style="s2">thing to do but it doesn&#39;t solve the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.210" end="00:23:39.400" style="s2">problem and I think this has something</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.700" end="00:23:43.090" style="s2">to do with human ethical responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.400" end="00:23:45.940" style="s2">because there are other old stories and</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.090" end="00:23:51.610" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you one likely where the son</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.940" end="00:23:54.760" style="s2">of the king the Lion King the son of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.610" end="00:23:57.430" style="s2">king he goes off and he&#39;s some pathetic</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.760" end="00:23:59.380" style="s2">adolescent and then he&#39;s shamed by the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.430" end="00:24:01.720" style="s2">reappearance of his old girlfriend into</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.380" end="00:24:04.030" style="s2">turning into something vaguely useful</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.720" end="00:24:08.050" style="s2">and he opens his eyes and he goes back</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.030" end="00:24:09.760" style="s2">and he fights scar and you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.050" end="00:24:12.760" style="s2">scene of hell right because there&#39;s fire</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.760" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">everywhere and he fights scar finds</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.760" end="00:24:17.290" style="s2">skaar killed his father he casts him</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">into the pit roughly speaking and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.290" end="00:24:23.220" style="s2">the rain comes and then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:26.950" style="s2">movie returns to its beginning</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.220" end="00:24:29.590" style="s2">fundamentally it&#39;s a paradise paradise</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.950" end="00:24:33.820" style="s2">lost&#39; Paradise Regained that&#39;s the movie</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.590" end="00:24:35.470" style="s2">and and I mean that&#39;s the story of human</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.820" end="00:24:37.900" style="s2">beings you know you&#39;re in a place that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.470" end="00:24:39.490" style="s2">working out pretty well something</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.900" end="00:24:41.740" style="s2">happens to knock you off your perch</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.490" end="00:24:43.510" style="s2">you&#39;re down in the chaos for a good</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.740" end="00:24:45.610" style="s2">amount of time and maybe you never get</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.510" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">out but maybe you learn something down</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.610" end="00:24:51.549" style="s2">there maybe a strength in your character</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:55.090" style="s2">then you pop up to a new place and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.549" end="00:24:57.280" style="s2">it&#39;s better better aim better you now</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.090" end="00:24:59.040" style="s2">I&#39;m not being overly optimistic about</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.280" end="00:25:04.360" style="s2">this I know perfectly well that people</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.040" end="00:25:06.790" style="s2">encounter impediments during their life</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.360" end="00:25:10.120" style="s2">that they find almost impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.790" end="00:25:15.880" style="s2">recover from but it&#39;s the best shot you</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.120" end="00:25:17.500" style="s2">have so anyways Jonah runs away but God</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.880" end="00:25:20.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t very happy about that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.500" end="00:25:23.770" style="s2">actually Jonah&#39;s destiny it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.080" end="00:25:27.190" style="s2">for Jonah to repair the city so God</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.770" end="00:25:29.770" style="s2">sends a storm and you know the waves are</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.190" end="00:25:31.840" style="s2">high and and and I think what that means</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.770" end="00:25:33.700" style="s2">is because the water is often a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.840" end="00:25:35.410" style="s2">for the unconscious and that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.700" end="00:25:37.090" style="s2">things lurk down there in the water and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.410" end="00:25:39.070" style="s2">that you could pull up that that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.090" end="00:25:40.750" style="s2">useful monstrous things that you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.070" end="00:25:42.610" style="s2">pull up they&#39;re useful you can fish for</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.750" end="00:25:44.710" style="s2">them you can go fishing in your own</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.610" end="00:25:46.630" style="s2">being for answers which is what you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.710" end="00:25:49.540" style="s2">when you try to think right you ask</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.630" end="00:25:51.610" style="s2">yourself a question and you wait maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.540" end="00:25:53.590" style="s2">an answer appears it&#39;s like where did</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.610" end="00:25:55.809" style="s2">that come from you didn&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.590" end="00:25:58.830" style="s2">answer was before it appeared but it</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.809" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">just popped into being out of nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.830" end="00:26:07.299" style="s2">who knows so you fish so anyways the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:09.100" style="s2">waves come and the boats gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.299" end="00:26:10.510" style="s2">knocked over it and that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.100" end="00:26:13.570" style="s2">I think when you know when you know you</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.510" end="00:26:16.030" style="s2">should do something I mean everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.570" end="00:26:17.320" style="s2">the this experience I believe perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.030" end="00:26:19.360" style="s2">you would be willing to put up your</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.320" end="00:26:21.630" style="s2">hands if this experience is foreign to</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.360" end="00:26:24.250" style="s2">you okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.630" end="00:26:26.540" style="s2">just part of your telling you you should</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.250" end="00:26:28.670" style="s2">do something and it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.540" end="00:26:30.380" style="s2">to do it effortful and maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.670" end="00:26:32.900" style="s2">afraid of it and so you don&#39;t do it you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.380" end="00:26:37.790" style="s2">just procrastinate right and so how do</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.900" end="00:26:39.440" style="s2">you feel about that good I mean so what</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.790" end="00:26:42.110" style="s2">do you feel that you&#39;re betraying</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.440" end="00:26:43.910" style="s2">yourself your anxiety actually gets</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.110" end="00:26:45.470" style="s2">worse not better even though you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.910" end="00:26:47.180" style="s2">you can put it off moment to moment but</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.470" end="00:26:48.620" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t help because every time you</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.180" end="00:26:50.510" style="s2">put it off the anxiety just grows a</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.620" end="00:26:54.110" style="s2">little bit you&#39;re not proud of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.510" end="00:26:56.350" style="s2">you have a sense that you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.110" end="00:26:58.250" style="s2">things more chaotic than they should be</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.350" end="00:27:00.440" style="s2">you know and if you do that long enough</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.250" end="00:27:01.940" style="s2">and I&#39;m sure many of you have had that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.440" end="00:27:04.160" style="s2">experience if you do that long enough if</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.940" end="00:27:06.050" style="s2">that becomes habitual things will get so</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.160" end="00:27:10.070" style="s2">stormy around you that you&#39;ll fall right</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.050" end="00:27:14.840" style="s2">into the into the chaos into the watery</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.070" end="00:27:16.490" style="s2">chaos and maybe you&#39;ll drown so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.840" end="00:27:21.380" style="s2">a very good idea to run from your</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.490" end="00:27:24.200" style="s2">destiny let&#39;s say whatever that might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.380" end="00:27:25.640" style="s2">and you need a destiny you need a place</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.200" end="00:27:28.130" style="s2">to aim at because that&#39;s what gives your</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.640" end="00:27:30.830" style="s2">life meaning and you need meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.130" end="00:27:32.690" style="s2">your life because life is hard so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.830" end="00:27:36.800" style="s2">know you need something to buttress</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.690" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">yourself against that so anyways they</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.800" end="00:27:39.920" style="s2">wake joan up and jonah says that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:41.300" style="s2">probably my fault because like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.920" end="00:27:43.100" style="s2">running away from something i&#39;m supposed</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.300" end="00:27:44.240" style="s2">to do and you know god isn&#39;t very happy</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.100" end="00:27:46.820" style="s2">about that so why don&#39;t you just throw</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.240" end="00:27:48.740" style="s2">me over to overboard and the crew isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.820" end="00:27:50.210" style="s2">very happy about that but the waves are</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.740" end="00:27:51.770" style="s2">really starting to come up and joan is</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.210" end="00:27:57.260" style="s2">pretty insistent that he&#39;s the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.770" end="00:28:00.740" style="s2">the problem and so they draw they draw a</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.260" end="00:28:04.520" style="s2">lot and and jonah is chosen and so they</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.740" end="00:28:07.520" style="s2">decided to toss him into the ocean and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.520" end="00:28:10.010" style="s2">immediately everything&#39;s calm so he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.520" end="00:28:12.680" style="s2">center of chaos because he&#39;s not doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.010" end="00:28:16.520" style="s2">what he&#39;s supposed to do fine well then</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.680" end="00:28:19.150" style="s2">that whale comes up and swallows him and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.520" end="00:28:24.340" style="s2">then he&#39;s in the whale for three days</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.150" end="00:28:26.620" style="s2">now that&#39;s a weird thing the whale</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.340" end="00:28:30.710" style="s2">that&#39;s the way all that</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.620" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">Gepetto&#39;s ian that&#39;s a dragon it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.710" end="00:28:36.520" style="s2">thing that you have to go out there and</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:36.520" style="s2">conquer to get something of value now</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.790" end="00:28:46.200" style="s2">when you&#39;ve made an error when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.930" end="00:28:48.810" style="s2">fallen off the pathway when you deviated</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.200" end="00:28:50.730" style="s2">from what you know you should do it</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.810" end="00:28:53.970" style="s2">produces a state of internal chaos and</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.990" end="00:29:02.430" style="s2">know what to do and that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.270" end="00:29:03.090" style="s2">symbolized by the encounter with a with</p>

<p begin="00:29:03.090" end="00:29:07.800" style="s2">like a dragon something that lives under</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:09.330" style="s2">the water that&#39;s and I think the reason</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.800" end="00:29:12.330" style="s2">for that is as far as I&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.330" end="00:29:15.300" style="s2">tell is that human beings because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.330" end="00:29:16.980" style="s2">been prey animals for forever in our</p>

<p begin="00:29:18.840" end="00:29:22.440" style="s2">dinosaurs because there were dinosaurs</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.340" end="00:29:25.050" style="s2">around at the time of our most distant</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.440" end="00:29:28.080" style="s2">ancestors there was even a cat at one</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.050" end="00:29:31.680" style="s2">point that was that was adapted with</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.080" end="00:29:34.830" style="s2">teeth to pierce human skulls so it had a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.680" end="00:29:37.500" style="s2">head that was exactly shaped to grab you</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.830" end="00:29:39.300" style="s2">here and put a tooth through the back of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.500" end="00:29:42.860" style="s2">your skull so like we&#39;ve come through</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.300" end="00:29:45.750" style="s2">some rough times man and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.860" end="00:29:48.150" style="s2">system in our mind that&#39;s a threat</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.750" end="00:29:50.100" style="s2">predator detection system that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.150" end="00:29:53.190" style="s2">thing that makes little kids think about</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.100" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">monsters in the dark right because well</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.190" end="00:29:56.760" style="s2">there is monsters in the dark parents</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:29:59.460" style="s2">always say well there&#39;s no monsters in</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.760" end="00:30:01.260" style="s2">the dark it&#39;s like that&#39;s not true the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.460" end="00:30:03.360" style="s2">dark is full of monsters there might not</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.260" end="00:30:05.010" style="s2">be any in your room right at that moment</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.360" end="00:30:08.340" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.010" end="00:30:10.290" style="s2">monsters in the dark and crimes take</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.290" end="00:30:14.850" style="s2">6:00 in the morning and like you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.120" end="00:30:16.470" style="s2">have breakfast and go rob a bank they do</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.850" end="00:30:20.190" style="s2">it they do that sort of thing at night</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.470" end="00:30:23.160" style="s2">people do the things that are fit for</p>

<p begin="00:30:25.710" end="00:30:28.920" style="s2">see very well in the dark and kids</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:31.500" style="s2">aren&#39;t stupid</p>

<p begin="00:30:31.500" end="00:30:37.230" style="s2">damn close to the fire because the kids</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.220" end="00:30:40.590" style="s2">that wandered away from the fire got</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.230" end="00:30:44.190" style="s2">picked off by hyenas and lions and you</p>

<p begin="00:30:44.190" end="00:30:50.330" style="s2">hell was out there to eat the unwary so</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.470" end="00:31:00.100" style="s2">the circuit that we use to to defend</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.410" end="00:31:03.220" style="s2">ourselves against predators as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.100" end="00:31:05.260" style="s2">evolved cortically that circuit has has</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.220" end="00:31:07.420" style="s2">come to represent what we don&#39;t know in</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.260" end="00:31:10.740" style="s2">general because the Predators of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.420" end="00:31:13.630" style="s2">inhabit where we don&#39;t know and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.740" end="00:31:15.490" style="s2">evolution is a conservative force and we</p>

<p begin="00:32:24.070" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">something comes up and poof everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.180" end="00:32:32.620" style="s2">changes some axiom that you were living</p>

<p begin="00:32:55.780" end="00:32:59.830" style="s2">do you do down there in the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.060" end="00:33:03.220" style="s2">when things have fallen apart especially</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.830" end="00:33:04.000" style="s2">if oh if it&#39;s the worst possible case</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.220" end="00:33:06.100" style="s2">scenario and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:08.320" style="s2">realize that you actually had something</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.100" end="00:33:10.150" style="s2">to do with your demise that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.320" end="00:33:12.160" style="s2">annoying you know when something bad</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.150" end="00:33:14.050" style="s2">happens to you and then you know you</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.160" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">grind yourself into bits trying to</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:21.940" style="s2">then you realize that well you were</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.900" end="00:33:23.350" style="s2">playing a causal role now sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.940" end="00:33:25.330" style="s2">you&#39;re so depressed you assume you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.350" end="00:33:26.980" style="s2">playing a causal role and you work it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.330" end="00:33:29.080" style="s2">not easy to figure out by any stretch of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.980" end="00:33:30.850" style="s2">the imagination and it isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.080" end="00:33:35.020" style="s2">everyone who does something terrible is</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.850" end="00:33:37.030" style="s2">at fault for it but sometimes you find</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.020" end="00:33:38.530" style="s2">that you are off the path somehow and</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.030" end="00:33:40.630" style="s2">maybe even that you knew it and they</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.530" end="00:33:44.230" style="s2">didn&#39;t attend to it and that&#39;s why all</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.630" end="00:33:46.420" style="s2">of this hit the fan and so then down</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.230" end="00:33:48.010" style="s2">there in that chaos you decide that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.420" end="00:33:51.850" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do what you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.010" end="00:33:55.030" style="s2">to do instead and then maybe you get to</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.850" end="00:33:58.770" style="s2">rise up again renewed if you&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.030" end="00:34:02.290" style="s2">and then you can go fix the city and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.770" end="00:34:05.350" style="s2">that&#39;s what this story&#39;s about and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.290" end="00:34:06.850" style="s2">that&#39;s why I picked the image to</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.350" end="00:34:10.290" style="s2">represent the course because really what</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.850" end="00:34:13.540" style="s2">happens you see with the psychoanalysts</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.290" end="00:34:16.179" style="s2">the road due to health if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.540" end="00:34:17.409" style="s2">doing well which means that as you act</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.179" end="00:34:20.020" style="s2">in the world you&#39;re not getting what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.409" end="00:34:22.690" style="s2">want there&#39;s something wrong with your</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.020" end="00:34:25.450" style="s2">the match between your presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.690" end="00:34:28.030" style="s2">and your actions habitual and the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.450" end="00:34:30.580" style="s2">the world is responding to you and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.030" end="00:34:32.050" style="s2">it&#39;s not turning out for you and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.580" end="00:34:32.470" style="s2">question is well what can you do about</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.050" end="00:34:35.649" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.470" end="00:34:38.169" style="s2">and one answer might be to examine</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.649" end="00:34:40.149" style="s2">yourself for presuppositions and action</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.169" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">patterns that are not serving you well</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.149" end="00:34:44.080" style="s2">and to find out what they are and what</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:46.270" style="s2">to do about them and maybe some of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.080" end="00:34:48.100" style="s2">is maybe you&#39;re not moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.270" end="00:34:49.840" style="s2">because of fear and maybe that fear is</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.100" end="00:34:51.190" style="s2">grounded in terrible experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.840" end="00:34:53.770" style="s2">you had in the past that you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.190" end="00:34:55.450" style="s2">been able to understand and maybe one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.770" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">the ways of gluing yourself back</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.450" end="00:35:00.460" style="s2">together and expanding your personality</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:02.440" style="s2">so that you could in fact live properly</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.460" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">in the world is to go back to those</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.440" end="00:35:09.130" style="s2">terrible events and untie them and</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:12.280" style="s2">straighten them out and understand them</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.130" end="00:35:14.730" style="s2">and drop them and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.280" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">psychotherapy is about in large part</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.730" end="00:35:20.150" style="s2">psychoanalytic behavioral doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:22.010" style="s2">what are you afraid of what are you</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.150" end="00:35:25.100" style="s2">avoiding what are you failing to develop</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.010" end="00:35:30.170" style="s2">maybe from fear maybe from avoidance god</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.100" end="00:35:30.920" style="s2">only knows maybe from disgust how can</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.170" end="00:35:32.570" style="s2">you get over it</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.920" end="00:35:35.170" style="s2">how can you reclaim those parts of your</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.570" end="00:35:35.170" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.840" end="00:35:51.260" style="s2">now I said in the first lecture that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.790" end="00:35:56.090" style="s2">was going to try to provide you with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.260" end="00:35:57.800" style="s2">schema into which you could place the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.090" end="00:36:01.370" style="s2">theorists that we&#39;re going to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.800" end="00:36:04.100" style="s2">and it requires going down deep to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.370" end="00:36:05.360" style="s2">that and there are presuppositions in my</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.100" end="00:36:06.980" style="s2">presupposition and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.360" end="00:36:11.450" style="s2">psychoanalytic presupposition it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.980" end="00:36:14.630" style="s2">predicated on a poetic tradition I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.450" end="00:36:17.390" style="s2">say don&#39;t an ancient tradition I learned</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.630" end="00:36:20.960" style="s2">most of it from reading Jung it was Carl</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.390" end="00:36:24.500" style="s2">Jung that helped me understand that</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.960" end="00:36:26.740" style="s2">we&#39;re nested inside a dream that we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.500" end="00:36:32.390" style="s2">to be because we don&#39;t know everything</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.740" end="00:36:33.980" style="s2">we have to take things as Givens and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.390" end="00:36:37.430" style="s2">things that we take it as Givens are</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.980" end="00:36:39.770" style="s2">nested inside stories and we accept the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.430" end="00:36:43.820" style="s2">stories as valid and then outside the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.770" end="00:36:46.010" style="s2">stories is the absolute unknown you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.820" end="00:36:48.970" style="s2">and that&#39;s partly the stories are tricky</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.010" end="00:36:52.550" style="s2">you know that one of the classic stories</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.970" end="00:36:58.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a variant of the the Jonas story I</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.550" end="00:37:02.650" style="s2">would say is st. George and the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.010" end="00:37:05.270" style="s2">and that that story was represented in</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.650" end="00:37:08.540" style="s2">during the Renaissance and during</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.270" end="00:37:11.270" style="s2">medieval times thousands and thousands</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.540" end="00:37:13.070" style="s2">of ways it&#39;s like the story of st.</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.270" end="00:37:17.260" style="s2">Patrick who chased the snakes out of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.070" end="00:37:22.670" style="s2">Ireland same idea and that the typical</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.260" end="00:37:25.790" style="s2">st. George story is the Hobbit or Harry</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.670" end="00:37:27.380" style="s2">Potter so in the second volume of Harry</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.790" end="00:37:28.820" style="s2">Potter correct me if I have any of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.380" end="00:37:32.270" style="s2">details wrong you remember there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.820" end="00:37:34.220" style="s2">snake the basilisk so this is Magic</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.270" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">Castle right you guys have no problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.220" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">without Magic Castle no problem there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:40.910" style="s2">an or if he&#39;s an orphan he goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.480" end="00:37:43.250" style="s2">Magic Castle to learn how to be more</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.910" end="00:37:45.290" style="s2">than normal right the muggles he has a</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.250" end="00:37:46.790" style="s2">muggle family we&#39;re not too happy with</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.290" end="00:37:50.090" style="s2">the muggle family like as</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.790" end="00:37:52.340" style="s2">representatives of normal people they</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.090" end="00:37:53.960" style="s2">they have some blacks now of course the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.340" end="00:37:55.820" style="s2">reason for that is that well that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.960" end="00:37:57.800" style="s2">teenagers often feel about their parents</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.820" end="00:38:00.050" style="s2">right they fail Jesus these couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.800" end="00:38:01.600" style="s2">really be my parents I must have some</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.050" end="00:38:04.730" style="s2">other parents who are like</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.600" end="00:38:07.010" style="s2">together those are like magical parents</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.730" end="00:38:08.990" style="s2">right parents that live in the sky and</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.010" end="00:38:12.020" style="s2">of course Harry Potter has earthly</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.990" end="00:38:14.210" style="s2">parents that&#39;s the muggles and Dursley I</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.020" end="00:38:17.860" style="s2">think is the kid he&#39;s at one he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.210" end="00:38:21.350" style="s2">wonderful piece of work and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.860" end="00:38:24.050" style="s2">ill-formed a spoiled ill-formed</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.350" end="00:38:26.510" style="s2">selfish very far from the ideal he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.050" end="00:38:28.850" style="s2">foil for Harry and of course he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.510" end="00:38:31.340" style="s2">appreciated and doted on and Harry is</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.850" end="00:38:33.560" style="s2">actually punished for his virtues that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.340" end="00:38:35.570" style="s2">a classic story right to to be punished</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.560" end="00:38:37.340" style="s2">for your virtues I mean if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.570" end="00:38:39.620" style="s2">the story the central story in</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.340" end="00:38:41.210" style="s2">Christianity the central story and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.620" end="00:38:43.100" style="s2">Christianity is about someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.210" end="00:38:45.020" style="s2">precisely punished in the worst possible</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.100" end="00:38:46.760" style="s2">way for the highest possible virtues</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.020" end="00:38:48.650" style="s2">that&#39;s what it makes it an archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.760" end="00:38:51.410" style="s2">story because there isn&#39;t anything more</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.650" end="00:38:53.450" style="s2">unfair than that and so it&#39;s a limit in</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.410" end="00:38:55.610" style="s2">a sense you it can&#39;t be worse than that</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.450" end="00:38:58.370" style="s2">being punished for being you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.610" end="00:39:00.200" style="s2">unworthy it&#39;s like yeah yeah well at</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.370" end="00:39:02.090" style="s2">least makes sense but to be punished</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.200" end="00:39:04.220" style="s2">because you have your act together and</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.090" end="00:39:06.350" style="s2">you&#39;re a good person that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.220" end="00:39:09.560" style="s2">punishment and that&#39;s what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.350" end="00:39:11.630" style="s2">Harry so luckily he finds out that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.560" end="00:39:14.930" style="s2">magical which is quite convenient and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.630" end="00:39:17.810" style="s2">off he goes to Wizarding school and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.930" end="00:39:19.460" style="s2">know that&#39;s actually like taking that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.810" end="00:39:22.250" style="s2">actually like going and studying the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.460" end="00:39:26.840" style="s2">humanities I mean it was when they still</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.250" end="00:39:30.950" style="s2">were you know because you it&#39;s through</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.840" end="00:39:32.930" style="s2">the humanities that you that you make</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.950" end="00:39:36.410" style="s2">contact with the magic of your culture</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.930" end="00:39:39.230" style="s2">and that makes you more than merely the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.410" end="00:39:40.580" style="s2">child of your parents because you are</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.230" end="00:39:42.260" style="s2">more than merely the child of your</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.580" end="00:39:45.200" style="s2">parents you&#39;re the child of nature and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.260" end="00:39:48.110" style="s2">you&#39;re the child of culture and until</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.200" end="00:39:49.910" style="s2">you understand what that means</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.110" end="00:39:51.980" style="s2">understand that you have two sets of</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.910" end="00:39:54.730" style="s2">parents like the divine hero always has</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.980" end="00:39:57.500" style="s2">two sets of parents you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.730" end="00:39:59.870" style="s2">construe yourself properly as an</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.500" end="00:40:01.610" style="s2">individual you&#39;re not situated properly</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.870" end="00:40:04.040" style="s2">in the world you don&#39;t know what your</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.610" end="00:40:06.230" style="s2">responsibilities are you can&#39;t orient</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.040" end="00:40:09.370" style="s2">your values properly and you will suffer</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.230" end="00:40:14.360" style="s2">for that because as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.370" end="00:40:15.230" style="s2">because life is so difficult you have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.360" end="00:40:19.130" style="s2">do something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.230" end="00:40:22.460" style="s2">truly worthwhile in order to justify it</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.130" end="00:40:23.840" style="s2">and so well that&#39;s what all these</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.460" end="00:40:25.910" style="s2">stories tell you that&#39;s what the story</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.840" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">of Jonah is telling you it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.910" end="00:40:33.109" style="s2">have an ethical duty to straighten</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">things up and if you don&#39;t do it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.109" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">gonna be sorry and that stories echoed</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:40.910" style="s2">everywhere while now st. George</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:43.100" style="s2">well let&#39;s go to Harry Potter well</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.910" end="00:40:45.770" style="s2">that&#39;s what we were talking about so he</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.100" end="00:40:48.109" style="s2">goes off to the Magic Castle and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.770" end="00:40:50.270" style="s2">learning to be a wizard and he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.109" end="00:40:53.270" style="s2">an interesting character a because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.270" end="00:40:55.450" style="s2">not really good and we find out I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.270" end="00:40:58.760" style="s2">that&#39;s because does he have a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.450" end="00:41:03.010" style="s2">gold amarti in him he&#39;s not what happens</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.760" end="00:41:04.869" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.010" end="00:41:07.700" style="s2">to be good</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.869" end="00:41:09.619" style="s2">truly good you can&#39;t just follow rules</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.700" end="00:41:11.780" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s very clear in the Harry</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.619" end="00:41:13.490" style="s2">Potter story and you also have to be</p>

<p begin="00:41:17.780" end="00:41:21.650" style="s2">understand that part of you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.920" end="00:41:24.380" style="s2">malevolent because if you don&#39;t you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.650" end="00:41:27.800" style="s2">naive and if you&#39;re naive you&#39;re easy</p>

<p begin="00:41:44.359" end="00:41:49.490" style="s2">can read about Auschwitz you can read</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.490" end="00:41:58.790" style="s2">and you can imagine yourself as a guard</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.850" end="00:42:01.430" style="s2">instead of as a heroic rescuer of</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.790" end="00:42:05.420" style="s2">unfortunate victims which would be very</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.430" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">very unlikely and once you can imagine</p>

<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:13.570" style="s2">terrifying thing to do then you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.270" end="00:42:16.220" style="s2">understand something about yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.570" end="00:42:18.010" style="s2">I actually think and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.220" end="00:42:20.690" style="s2">also from students studying young that</p>

<p begin="00:42:20.690" end="00:42:25.400" style="s2">yourself until you know that you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.340" end="00:42:26.960" style="s2">monster because you won&#39;t act carefully</p>

<p begin="00:42:31.609" end="00:42:37.339" style="s2">sure of that and the harm that you do</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.309" end="00:42:39.729" style="s2">people can come in many many ways and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.339" end="00:42:45.079" style="s2">if you regard yourself as harmless</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.729" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">inoffensive nice well why do you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.079" end="00:42:48.349" style="s2">any reason to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:50.690" style="s2">you&#39;re like a teddy bear sitting on a</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.349" end="00:42:51.529" style="s2">shelf even if you throw it at someone no</p>

<p begin="00:42:51.529" end="00:42:54.769" style="s2">but that isn&#39;t what you&#39;re like because</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.150" end="00:42:59.390" style="s2">you&#39;re a human being and human beings</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.769" end="00:43:01.460" style="s2">are some vicious creatures and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.390" end="00:43:03.859" style="s2">utility in knowing that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.460" end="00:43:05.329" style="s2">also the case you know in the Harry</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.859" end="00:43:06.680" style="s2">Potter series Harry could stand up</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.329" end="00:43:08.059" style="s2">against full-dome art and understand</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.680" end="00:43:10.940" style="s2">them and speak his language because he</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.059" end="00:43:13.609" style="s2">was infected by him to some degree a</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.940" end="00:43:16.130" style="s2">very very interesting idea anyways in</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.609" end="00:43:17.690" style="s2">the second 10 the reason I&#39;m telling you</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.130" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">this and this is worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.690" end="00:43:25.099" style="s2">it&#39;s like how long were each of those</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:28.579" style="s2">books like 500 pages they&#39;re long eh and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.099" end="00:43:30.829" style="s2">there was how many of them seven and how</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.579" end="00:43:34.450" style="s2">many of them were sold I mean how many</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.829" end="00:43:34.450" style="s2">of you read every Harry Potter book</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.809" end="00:43:41.299" style="s2">right that&#39;s how many of you read at</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.969" end="00:43:44.089" style="s2">least one okay how many you saw the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.299" end="00:43:48.289" style="s2">movies it&#39;s like you&#39;re all in a cult</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.089" end="00:43:52.190" style="s2">you are I&#39;m telling you really that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.289" end="00:43:54.200" style="s2">the truth it&#39;s really the truth so in</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.190" end="00:43:55.670" style="s2">the second volume there&#39;s this snake</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.200" end="00:43:57.849" style="s2">that&#39;s zip it around there the basilisk</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.670" end="00:44:01.940" style="s2">right and it lives in the underground</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.849" end="00:44:03.799" style="s2">that&#39;s chaos that&#39;s chaos and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.940" end="00:44:05.539" style="s2">because wherever you are you&#39;re on thin</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.799" end="00:44:08.210" style="s2">ice and underneath you&#39;re thin ice is</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.539" end="00:44:10.339" style="s2">chaos and here we are in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.210" end="00:44:12.710" style="s2">unbelievably civilized environment and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.339" end="00:44:15.859" style="s2">everyone&#39;s getting along so perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.710" end="00:44:18.289" style="s2">but you know we&#39;ve got hot guard lights</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.289" end="00:44:24.559" style="s2">working no one&#39;s hungry it&#39;s like we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.979" end="00:44:26.630" style="s2">be peaceful but if any of that fell</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.559" end="00:44:28.099" style="s2">apart and it could easily fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.630" end="00:44:32.749" style="s2">because it&#39;s a bloody miracle it ever</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.099" end="00:44:34.219" style="s2">works at all then the chaos that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.749" end="00:44:37.009" style="s2">underneath the surface is going to come</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.219" end="00:44:39.380" style="s2">up right now and it&#39;s useful to know</p>

<p begin="00:45:06.530" end="00:45:11.900" style="s2">Medusa the woman with the head of snakes</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.770" end="00:45:15.380" style="s2">and if you look at her it paralyzes you</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.900" end="00:45:17.210" style="s2">what does that mean well you&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.380" end="00:45:20.690" style="s2">through the jungle and big snake appears</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.210" end="00:45:23.390" style="s2">what do you do you freeze and no bloody</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.690" end="00:45:24.860" style="s2">wonder because you&#39;re a prey animal and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.390" end="00:45:28.790" style="s2">that&#39;s what they do when they see things</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.860" end="00:45:32.060" style="s2">that are going to eat them and so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.790" end="00:45:37.520" style="s2">snake well lots of people still die from</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.060" end="00:45:39.860" style="s2">snakebite and our ancestors were and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:41.510" style="s2">mean our ancestors like you know tens of</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.860" end="00:45:42.890" style="s2">millions of years ago when they were</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.510" end="00:45:45.080" style="s2">living in trees and weren&#39;t very big</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.890" end="00:45:47.150" style="s2">they made a nice snack for a snake and</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.080" end="00:45:49.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a woman named Lynn Isbell who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.150" end="00:45:52.369" style="s2">an anthropologist at UCLA who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.460" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">correlated the presence of carnivorous</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.369" end="00:45:57.980" style="s2">snakes with the acuity of primate vision</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:45:59.960" style="s2">and what she found was that the more</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.980" end="00:46:04.430" style="s2">snakes around the better the primates</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.960" end="00:46:06.070" style="s2">could see so and we&#39;re particularly good</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.430" end="00:46:08.090" style="s2">at picking up patterns like snake</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.070" end="00:46:10.010" style="s2">camouflage in the lower half of our</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.090" end="00:46:11.210" style="s2">visual quadrant you know and people</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.010" end="00:46:14.090" style="s2">generally don&#39;t like snakes you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.210" end="00:46:15.950" style="s2">learn to handle them but no snake fear</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.090" end="00:46:17.840" style="s2">appears to be an eight to Nate in</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.950" end="00:46:19.670" style="s2">chimpanzees and it tends to increase as</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.840" end="00:46:22.430" style="s2">you age rather than decreasing you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.670" end="00:46:24.680" style="s2">overcome it but well my daughter had</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.430" end="00:46:28.760" style="s2">snakes and one day her snake bit her it</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.680" end="00:46:30.380" style="s2">was a fairly big snake and she hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.760" end="00:46:34.820" style="s2">paid attention to it for a while so it</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.380" end="00:46:36.950" style="s2">nailed her and from then on she had very</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.820" end="00:46:40.630" style="s2">difficult time grabbing the snake it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.950" end="00:46:43.730" style="s2">like bitten once you know shy</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.630" end="00:46:45.859" style="s2">permanently she also told me years later</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.730" end="00:46:47.420" style="s2">she had nightmares about snakes all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.859" end="00:46:49.670" style="s2">time when she had a snake in her room</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.420" end="00:46:54.830" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know and I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.670" end="00:46:56.660" style="s2">probably the smell so anyways so Harry</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.830" end="00:46:58.099" style="s2">Potter decides he&#39;s going to go</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.660" end="00:46:59.690" style="s2">after the basilisk rake he&#39;s gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.099" end="00:47:03.349" style="s2">out there and face the thing that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.690" end="00:47:05.900" style="s2">most afraid of so he does that wait out</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.349" end="00:47:08.599" style="s2">in the depths so it&#39;s like Jonah going</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.900" end="00:47:12.680" style="s2">down into the depths and he faces the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.599" end="00:47:15.020" style="s2">basilisk and it bites him and you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.680" end="00:47:18.109" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s right because if you go</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.020" end="00:47:20.780" style="s2">down into the depths you can get bitten</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.109" end="00:47:22.549" style="s2">like it&#39;s no joke and this is a hero</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.780" end="00:47:24.140" style="s2">story but the thing about the hero</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.549" end="00:47:25.940" style="s2">stories it&#39;s actually real the thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.140" end="00:47:28.730" style="s2">that you&#39;re facing is actually dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.940" end="00:47:31.579" style="s2">and even though facing it voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.730" end="00:47:33.349" style="s2">might be your best bet and is likely</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.579" end="00:47:35.329" style="s2">your best bet because that&#39;s the central</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.349" end="00:47:37.730" style="s2">story of humanity that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.329" end="00:47:40.130" style="s2">you&#39;re going to succeed it&#39;s the real</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.730" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">thing so anyways he gets bitten right</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.130" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">and he&#39;s gonna die now he&#39;s rescuing</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:48.829" style="s2">Ginny so that&#39;s the st. George story if</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.440" end="00:47:52.750" style="s2">you go after like dragon dragons like to</p>

<p begin="00:47:52.750" end="00:48:04.099" style="s2">think it&#39;s because I think it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.670" end="00:48:06.770" style="s2">one of the things that male humans have</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.099" end="00:48:10.039" style="s2">done from the beginning of time is chase</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.770" end="00:48:14.809" style="s2">the damn predators away and I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.039" end="00:48:17.329" style="s2">that the males from god only knows how</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.809" end="00:48:21.559" style="s2">long ago who were particularly good at</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.329" end="00:48:25.579" style="s2">that were rewarded with female attention</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.559" end="00:48:28.579" style="s2">and why the hell not so it&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.579" end="00:48:30.829" style="s2">rooted inside of us that idea of facing</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.579" end="00:48:33.079" style="s2">the unknown and freeing the woman so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.829" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">idea there is that if you it&#39;s a male</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.079" end="00:48:38.450" style="s2">idea and in large part I can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:40.910" style="s2">the central female myth and I will as we</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.450" end="00:48:45.170" style="s2">proceed the idea is that if you&#39;re this</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.910" end="00:48:47.270" style="s2">sort of person who can stand up against</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.170" end="00:48:49.819" style="s2">the unknown and the frightening then</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.270" end="00:48:50.990" style="s2">you&#39;re also likely if you develop into</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.819" end="00:48:52.549" style="s2">that sort of person then you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.990" end="00:48:54.200" style="s2">likely to develop into the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.549" end="00:48:58.520" style="s2">person that other people will find</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.200" end="00:49:00.230" style="s2">attractive so you know and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.520" end="00:49:02.420" style="s2">young believed that the inside the</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.230" end="00:49:04.520" style="s2">shadow was the anima which is like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.420" end="00:49:07.130" style="s2">female figure and so his idea was</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.520" end="00:49:08.930" style="s2">something like you know if you look</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.130" end="00:49:10.609" style="s2">watch movies there&#39;s always this beta</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.930" end="00:49:12.140" style="s2">male guy if there</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.609" end="00:49:14.180" style="s2">romantic movies and he&#39;s a nice guy and</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.140" end="00:49:15.499" style="s2">he&#39;s the friend and you know the woman</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.180" end="00:49:17.569" style="s2">tells him everything but she doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.499" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">like him a bit she likes the guy who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.569" end="00:49:23.650" style="s2">like God an edge and and who&#39;s capable</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:26.930" style="s2">of I would say mayhem but at least of</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.650" end="00:49:28.730" style="s2">aggression now that doesn&#39;t mean she</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.930" end="00:49:30.140" style="s2">wants them to be aggressive but what it</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.730" end="00:49:32.420" style="s2">does mean is that she wants him to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.140" end="00:49:35.180" style="s2">able to be aggressive that would be good</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.420" end="00:49:36.950" style="s2">and so he&#39;s the romantic target and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.180" end="00:49:39.619" style="s2">he&#39;s the person that&#39;s incorporated the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.950" end="00:49:42.910" style="s2">shadow and he&#39;s someone that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.619" end="00:49:46.720" style="s2">respectable and perhaps useful and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.910" end="00:49:46.720" style="s2">well that&#39;s a very old story</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.290" end="00:50:02.710" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s think about this for a</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.940" end="00:50:04.260" style="s2">minute I&#39;ve already offered you a</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.710" end="00:50:06.190" style="s2">proposition</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.260" end="00:50:08.080" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.190" end="00:50:10.600" style="s2">proposition and I&#39;m I&#39;m offering you</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.080" end="00:50:13.300" style="s2">this proposition so that you can make</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.600" end="00:50:16.630" style="s2">sense of art and literature and</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.300" end="00:50:19.300" style="s2">mythology and religion and dance and all</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.630" end="00:50:22.090" style="s2">those strange ritualistic things that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.300" end="00:50:26.860" style="s2">human beings do which seem central to us</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.090" end="00:50:31.470" style="s2">including including not least the in</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.860" end="00:50:35.370" style="s2">eradicable tendency of us to seek out</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.470" end="00:50:39.010" style="s2">stories of heroes I should finish the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.370" end="00:50:41.860" style="s2">Harry Potter story so Harry Potter goes</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.010" end="00:50:44.850" style="s2">down there to rescue Virginia no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.860" end="00:50:47.470" style="s2">that&#39;s not her name what is it</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.850" end="00:50:50.320" style="s2">Ginny yeah but there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.470" end="00:50:51.700" style="s2">formal name for that it&#39;s a variant of</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.320" end="00:50:55.530" style="s2">Virginia anyways which is a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.700" end="00:50:58.630" style="s2">divergent so um and it gets bitten</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.530" end="00:51:01.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t yes Ginevra that&#39;s it he gets</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.630" end="00:51:04.630" style="s2">bitten and the bite is poison and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.750" end="00:51:07.210" style="s2">there is dying which doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.630" end="00:51:09.100" style="s2">so good and then what happens and again</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.210" end="00:51:12.460" style="s2">you guys swallow this it&#39;s no problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.100" end="00:51:15.910" style="s2">so what&#39;s his name the Dumbledore</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.460" end="00:51:18.040" style="s2">character he&#39;s got a bird right so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.910" end="00:51:19.840" style="s2">the wise old man he&#39;s the ruler of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.040" end="00:51:23.530" style="s2">castle he&#39;s the ruler of the Magic</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.840" end="00:51:25.780" style="s2">Castle he&#39;s the Magic King you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.530" end="00:51:27.760" style="s2">like God the Father as far as Harry</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.780" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">Potter is concerned and he has a bird</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.760" end="00:51:32.890" style="s2">what kind of bird is it it&#39;s a Phoenix</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:35.380" style="s2">right and one of the things that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.890" end="00:51:37.840" style="s2">strange about a Phoenix is that well</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.380" end="00:51:39.730" style="s2">it&#39;s immortal but in a strange way you</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.840" end="00:51:41.140" style="s2">know it lives and lives I think a</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.730" end="00:51:42.940" style="s2">hundred years and it gets older and</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.140" end="00:51:45.340" style="s2">older and then one day poof it bursts</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.940" end="00:51:48.550" style="s2">into flames and turns into an egg and</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.340" end="00:51:51.670" style="s2">then you get a new Phoenix so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.550" end="00:51:53.890" style="s2">symbol of transformation it&#39;s a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.670" end="00:51:58.090" style="s2">of transformation the bird is a spirit</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.890" end="00:52:02.200" style="s2">or psyche and so here&#39;s what it means in</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.090" end="00:52:03.580" style="s2">part you know you know how when you</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.200" end="00:52:06.070" style="s2">learn a lesson in your life that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.580" end="00:52:09.200" style="s2">not very pleasant right it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.070" end="00:52:13.310" style="s2">when you learn something important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.200" end="00:52:15.170" style="s2">best day of your life it&#39;s often the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.310" end="00:52:17.330" style="s2">importance of what you learn is often</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.170" end="00:52:19.280" style="s2">proportionate to just how wretched it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.330" end="00:52:21.230" style="s2">to learn it you know you learn things</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.280" end="00:52:24.800" style="s2">the hard way you learn things by getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.230" end="00:52:26.420" style="s2">hit because obviously if what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.800" end="00:52:28.640" style="s2">doing is working you get where you want</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.420" end="00:52:30.530" style="s2">there&#39;s no learning in that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.640" end="00:52:33.620" style="s2">happy it&#39;s when you&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.530" end="00:52:35.240" style="s2">and you hit an obstacle and maybe yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.620" end="00:52:37.190" style="s2">bloody well hit it hard and then you</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.240" end="00:52:38.600" style="s2">know you recoil and then you down into</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.190" end="00:52:40.520" style="s2">the depths you go and you have to sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.600" end="00:52:42.410" style="s2">yourself out and you realize that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.520" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">you know this particular kind of idiot</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.410" end="00:52:46.250" style="s2">and that you should probably fix that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:48.620" style="s2">and that&#39;s really annoying and difficult</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.250" end="00:52:50.120" style="s2">and you know and maybe you&#39;re down in</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.620" end="00:52:51.920" style="s2">the dumps and anxious for quite a while</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.120" end="00:52:53.420" style="s2">and then you get it repaired more or</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.920" end="00:52:53.930" style="s2">less and you know you put yourself back</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.420" end="00:52:58.520" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.930" end="00:53:03.740" style="s2">that&#39;s the Phoenix poof into flames bang</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.520" end="00:53:06.320" style="s2">egg new you and so you know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.740" end="00:53:08.150" style="s2">ability to learn now human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.320" end="00:53:11.510" style="s2">very strange creatures right because</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.150" end="00:53:13.520" style="s2">we&#39;re very malleable compared to most</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.510" end="00:53:15.830" style="s2">animals you know like grizzly bears now</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.520" end="00:53:18.200" style="s2">and grizzly bears a thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.830" end="00:53:20.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like whatever they&#39;re the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.200" end="00:53:23.840" style="s2">thing they do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.890" end="00:53:25.970" style="s2">there&#39;s no transformation about human</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.840" end="00:53:28.700" style="s2">beings we have this massive brain and</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.970" end="00:53:30.380" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a pain because it means</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.700" end="00:53:34.670" style="s2">you have to take care of human children</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.380" end="00:53:37.160" style="s2">until they&#39;re 40 and and that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.670" end="00:53:38.780" style="s2">burden and so you know we pay a big</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.160" end="00:53:42.290" style="s2">price for it it also makes childbirth</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.780" end="00:53:43.730" style="s2">very difficult and and it&#39;s costly you</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.290" end="00:53:45.320" style="s2">have to eat a lot because you have a big</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.730" end="00:53:48.890" style="s2">brain because it uses up a lot of energy</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.320" end="00:53:51.590" style="s2">and so you know you pay a price for it</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.890" end="00:53:54.950" style="s2">but the advantage is your plastic you</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.590" end="00:53:57.950" style="s2">can learn now learning is a strange</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.950" end="00:54:01.400" style="s2">thing because you can think of it as</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.950" end="00:54:03.080" style="s2">just acquiring more information but you</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.400" end="00:54:06.920" style="s2">could also think of it and this is more</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.080" end="00:54:08.840" style="s2">accurate as finding out something that</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.920" end="00:54:10.460" style="s2">you&#39;re doing wrong so that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.840" end="00:54:12.350" style="s2">built into you like a character a</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.460" end="00:54:14.390" style="s2">character element of your character a</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.350" end="00:54:16.850" style="s2">presumption of your perception or a deep</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.390" end="00:54:18.980" style="s2">habit it&#39;s really built into you it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.850" end="00:54:22.370" style="s2">neural structure right it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.980" end="00:54:22.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve and you have to kill it because it</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.370" end="00:54:25.460" style="s2">isn&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.940" end="00:54:26.930" style="s2">properly and the pain that you go</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.460" end="00:54:30.049" style="s2">through in part when you&#39;re suffering</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.930" end="00:54:33.670" style="s2">because you did something stupid is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.049" end="00:54:36.950" style="s2">something like your your the neurology I</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.670" end="00:54:39.530" style="s2">can never get this quite right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.950" end="00:54:41.990" style="s2">pain of the death of that structure and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.530" end="00:54:43.940" style="s2">that could be a huge chunk of you you</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.990" end="00:54:47.990" style="s2">know if you really have to go through a</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.940" end="00:54:49.220" style="s2">massive revision it&#39;s like the person</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.990" end="00:54:50.750" style="s2">that comes out the other end might</p>

<p begin="00:55:34.039" end="00:55:40.220" style="s2">that&#39;s now like hanging around your neck</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.349" end="00:55:42.170" style="s2">like an albatross and so you have to let</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.170" end="00:55:48.440" style="s2">and a new part has to spring forth and</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.589" end="00:55:50.559" style="s2">that&#39;s what the Phoenix is and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.440" end="00:55:54.799" style="s2">Phoenix is the capacity of the person to</p>

<p begin="00:56:09.309" end="00:56:17.089" style="s2">the strange thing is that that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.880" end="00:56:19.849" style="s2">with all of the viewers now why would</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.089" end="00:56:24.859" style="s2">that be there&#39;s nothing about it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.849" end="00:56:28.069" style="s2">rational nothing right Magic Castle</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.859" end="00:56:30.380" style="s2">that&#39;s not rational giant snake</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.069" end="00:56:32.300" style="s2">underneath it that&#39;s a little more</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.380" end="00:56:35.220" style="s2">irrational</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.300" end="00:56:37.650" style="s2">turning you to stone going down there to</p>

<p begin="00:56:37.650" end="00:56:41.070" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah yeah that&#39;s okay we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.180" end="00:56:42.900" style="s2">we&#39;ll watch that clue</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.070" end="00:56:44.490" style="s2">well swallow it will be completely</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.900" end="00:56:47.250" style="s2">engaged in it and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.490" end="00:56:50.820" style="s2">because it&#39;s a myth it&#39;s about how</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.250" end="00:56:52.560" style="s2">people it&#39;s a meta story about how to</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.820" end="00:56:54.390" style="s2">act about how to conduct yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.560" end="00:56:56.250" style="s2">world to face the things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.390" end="00:57:01.250" style="s2">afraid of that would otherwise paralyze</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.250" end="00:57:04.770" style="s2">you to let the death of what is</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.250" end="00:57:08.630" style="s2">insufficient about you occur and then to</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.770" end="00:57:08.630" style="s2">wait for the rebirth</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.940" end="00:57:21.690" style="s2">okay so science is about what the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.040" end="00:57:25.230" style="s2">is and myth and drama and dream and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.690" end="00:57:28.109" style="s2">unconscious all of that let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.230" end="00:57:30.630" style="s2">aesthetic and artistic and fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.109" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">side of humanity that&#39;s more about how</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.630" end="00:57:36.030" style="s2">things should be it&#39;s more about how to</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.119" end="00:57:38.310" style="s2">act they&#39;re there lessons in how to act</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.030" end="00:57:40.830" style="s2">and they&#39;re abstract lessons people are</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.310" end="00:57:42.810" style="s2">capable of abstraction right so you say</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.830" end="00:57:44.250" style="s2">well there&#39;s something good about you</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.810" end="00:57:45.570" style="s2">and there&#39;s something good about you and</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.250" end="00:57:47.310" style="s2">there&#39;s something good about you and and</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.570" end="00:57:48.900" style="s2">there&#39;s some bad about you and you and</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.310" end="00:57:50.369" style="s2">you and so we&#39;ll take all the good</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.900" end="00:57:51.780" style="s2">things and make one good thing out of</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.369" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">that we&#39;ll take all the bad things and</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.780" end="00:57:54.810" style="s2">make one bad thing out of that and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:57:56.670" style="s2">we sort understand the difference</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.810" end="00:57:58.260" style="s2">between good and bad and we get better</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.670" end="00:58:00.390" style="s2">and better and better and better at that</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.260" end="00:58:02.310" style="s2">over the centuries as we distill that</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.390" end="00:58:03.990" style="s2">and then we have a figure of ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.310" end="00:58:06.570" style="s2">good and a figure of ultimate evil and</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.990" end="00:58:09.930" style="s2">that helps us understand what those two</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.570" end="00:58:11.100" style="s2">things are those are the hostile</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.930" end="00:58:13.320" style="s2">brothers that&#39;s a very common</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.100" end="00:58:17.550" style="s2">mythological motif and you could say</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.320" end="00:58:21.690" style="s2">well they&#39;re at war inside you and and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.550" end="00:58:24.770" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a universal truth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.690" end="00:58:24.770" style="s2">an existential truth</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.140" end="00:58:31.940" style="s2">the domain of ethics and morality is how</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.170" end="00:58:34.069" style="s2">are we in the world and what how should</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.940" end="00:58:35.809" style="s2">we be what&#39;s the good and the reason I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.069" end="00:58:37.130" style="s2">telling you all this apart from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.809" end="00:58:38.719" style="s2">that you should know it because this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.130" end="00:58:41.420" style="s2">what you should know if you go through</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.719" end="00:58:44.390" style="s2">university is that it bears directly on</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.420" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">issues of health you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.390" end="00:58:47.479" style="s2">accomplish something say if you go see a</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:49.339" style="s2">psychotherapist you know you could say</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.479" end="00:58:51.049" style="s2">well I&#39;m trying to get healthy but you</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.339" end="00:58:52.430" style="s2">know that&#39;s not really right what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.049" end="00:58:53.989" style="s2">trying to do when you go see your</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.430" end="00:58:56.420" style="s2">therapist just get your life together</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.989" end="00:58:59.989" style="s2">and that&#39;s not the same thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.420" end="00:59:01.729" style="s2">like mostly when I&#39;m acting as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.989" end="00:59:04.099" style="s2">therapist it&#39;s not like I&#39;m directly</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.729" end="00:59:06.109" style="s2">treating mental disorder like mental</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.099" end="00:59:08.269" style="s2">disorders aren&#39;t there just not neat</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.109" end="00:59:10.819" style="s2">little boxes it&#39;s not like someone has a</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.269" end="00:59:13.069" style="s2">fully functioning life but they have an</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.819" end="00:59:14.359" style="s2">anxiety disorder and then you bring them</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.069" end="00:59:15.890" style="s2">and you treat the anxiety disorder and</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.359" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">they go back to their fully functioning</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.890" end="00:59:19.969" style="s2">life it&#39;s like it&#39;s not like that at all</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:21.589" style="s2">the disorder is tangled out into their</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.969" end="00:59:23.989" style="s2">life you know if you&#39;re depressed</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.589" end="00:59:25.339" style="s2">well usually your your workplace isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.989" end="00:59:26.749" style="s2">going very well and your relationships</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.339" end="00:59:29.239" style="s2">with the people around you are damaged</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.749" end="00:59:31.759" style="s2">and you know you&#39;re connected in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.239" end="00:59:33.890" style="s2">actual world with all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.759" end="00:59:36.199" style="s2">and so when you come to see a therapist</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.890" end="00:59:38.029" style="s2">you have to work on putting your life</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.199" end="00:59:40.940" style="s2">together in a sustainable manner and</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.029" end="00:59:43.519" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly not just removing the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.940" end="00:59:45.650" style="s2">mental illness is very rare now and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.519" end="00:59:47.329" style="s2">you see someone who&#39;s depressed whose</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.650" end="00:59:49.099" style="s2">life is together and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.329" end="00:59:52.640" style="s2">depressed something&#39;s gone wrong</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.099" end="00:59:53.930" style="s2">probably biochemically and so with</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.640" end="00:59:57.079" style="s2">someone like that you can often give</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.930" end="00:59:59.059" style="s2">them in SSRIs I can&#39;t give them to them</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.079" end="01:00:02.839" style="s2">but I can recommend them recommend they</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.059" end="01:00:05.029" style="s2">go see a doctor anyways and that</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.839" end="01:00:06.859" style="s2">sometimes just does the trick because</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.029" end="01:00:08.690" style="s2">you know their life is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.859" end="01:00:10.880" style="s2">good they just can&#39;t see it but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.690" end="01:00:12.410" style="s2">bloody rare man it&#39;s usually the case</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.880" end="01:00:14.539" style="s2">that someone comes and sees you and</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.410" end="01:00:17.180" style="s2">things are in a serious state of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.539" end="01:00:19.819" style="s2">and all of that has to be addressed and</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.180" end="01:00:21.619" style="s2">some of its psychological and a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.819" end="01:00:23.959" style="s2">it&#39;s just practical its embedded out</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.619" end="01:00:25.969" style="s2">there in the world that&#39;s what the</p>

<p begin="01:00:33.529" end="01:00:38.209" style="s2">necessarily predicated on the question</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.259" end="01:00:39.410" style="s2">how is it that we obtain the good how do</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.209" end="01:00:41.000" style="s2">we aim at the good and what would that</p>

<p begin="01:01:14.570" end="01:01:20.630" style="s2">understand the categories of myth we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.920" end="01:01:23.480" style="s2">say you we have to understand something</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.630" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">about the nature of categorization now</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.480" end="01:01:29.270" style="s2">categorization is a tricky thing and</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.760" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna run through some complicated</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.270" end="01:01:36.440" style="s2">ideas relatively quickly you know you</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:40.190" style="s2">think you put things in the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.440" end="01:01:42.500" style="s2">category because they&#39;re similar but the</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.190" end="01:01:44.990" style="s2">problem is is that first of all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.500" end="01:01:47.690" style="s2">not an answer it&#39;s just a restatement of</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.990" end="01:01:50.600" style="s2">the initial proposition and second of</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.690" end="01:01:52.520" style="s2">all you can put things in the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.600" end="01:01:55.580" style="s2">category that are by no means identical</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.520" end="01:01:57.830" style="s2">and you often do that and third it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.580" end="01:02:01.570" style="s2">things are things that are similar are</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.830" end="01:02:05.300" style="s2">often also importantly different and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.570" end="01:02:07.250" style="s2">picking which element of similarity you</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.300" end="01:02:09.140" style="s2">know like let&#39;s say oh if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.250" end="01:02:12.440" style="s2">group of books well are they the same</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.140" end="01:02:15.310" style="s2">well obviously no because well unless</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.440" end="01:02:17.720" style="s2">they&#39;re you know all the same book but</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.310" end="01:02:19.520" style="s2">the category of books is a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.720" end="01:02:21.320" style="s2">strange category because the content of</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.520" end="01:02:22.880" style="s2">the books differs completely well you</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.320" end="01:02:25.550" style="s2">could still make a group of books and</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.880" end="01:02:28.610" style="s2">you pick some arbitrary element that</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.550" end="01:02:31.610" style="s2">unites them and consider that grounds to</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.610" end="01:02:33.530" style="s2">make a category there&#39;s other categories</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.610" end="01:02:36.530" style="s2">more scientific categories and</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.530" end="01:02:38.060" style="s2">scientific categories tend to actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.530" end="01:02:40.670" style="s2">contain things that are very very</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.060" end="01:02:43.370" style="s2">similar in across multiple dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.670" end="01:02:44.390" style="s2">like protons are like that as far as I</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.370" end="01:02:46.070" style="s2">can tell there&#39;s nothing that</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.390" end="01:02:48.740" style="s2">distinguishes one proton from another</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.070" end="01:02:50.600" style="s2">and the same with electrons and you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.740" end="01:02:52.850" style="s2">the set of triangles is like that</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.600" end="01:02:54.860" style="s2">because you can define it precisely but</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.850" end="01:02:57.350" style="s2">most of the categories that human</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.860" end="01:02:59.630" style="s2">Jews aren&#39;t so neat and the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.350" end="01:03:01.580" style="s2">that is that unless the categories are</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.630" end="01:03:04.340" style="s2">neat like scientific categories it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.580" end="01:03:07.010" style="s2">very difficult to investigate them</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.340" end="01:03:09.200" style="s2">scientifically so for example you might</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.010" end="01:03:12.560" style="s2">do research on a group of people with</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.200" end="01:03:15.230" style="s2">anxiety disorders but the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.560" end="01:03:18.950" style="s2">that is that the anxiety disorder</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.230" end="01:03:22.370" style="s2">category is so heterogeneous that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.950" end="01:03:24.650" style="s2">almost impossible to identify the</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.370" end="01:03:26.090" style="s2">commonalities across all the people who</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.650" end="01:03:27.860" style="s2">are in that category and that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.090" end="01:03:29.840" style="s2">because the category isn&#39;t actually a</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.860" end="01:03:32.990" style="s2">scientific category it&#39;s a hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.840" end="01:03:36.130" style="s2">category it&#39;s a practical category I can</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.990" end="01:03:36.130" style="s2">give you an example of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.490" end="01:04:00.460" style="s2">no I can&#39;t because I must not have saved</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.070" end="01:04:02.290" style="s2">it anyways many of the DSM categories so</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.460" end="01:04:05.680" style="s2">these are categories for psychopathology</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.290" end="01:04:07.630" style="s2">require if you&#39;re part of that category</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.680" end="01:04:09.160" style="s2">imagine there&#39;s seven symptoms that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.630" end="01:04:10.390" style="s2">could have or eight symptoms that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.160" end="01:04:12.340" style="s2">could have that would put you in that</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.390" end="01:04:15.820" style="s2">category like antisocial personality</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.340" end="01:04:17.980" style="s2">eight symptoms you steal you kick you</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.820" end="01:04:20.800" style="s2">hit you bite you you know you&#39;re abusive</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.980" end="01:04:23.380" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember the category categories</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.800" end="01:04:25.180" style="s2">precisely but you can be in the category</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.380" end="01:04:26.619" style="s2">if you have symptoms two through five</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.180" end="01:04:28.420" style="s2">and you can be in the category if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.619" end="01:04:30.310" style="s2">have symptoms six through eight they</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.420" end="01:04:32.200" style="s2">aren&#39;t the same symptoms but you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.310" end="01:04:34.210" style="s2">the same category and you think well how</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.200" end="01:04:36.250" style="s2">the hell can that be well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.210" end="01:04:38.200" style="s2">family resemblance category roughly</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.250" end="01:04:40.060" style="s2">speaking and lots of the things that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.200" end="01:04:42.520" style="s2">use our family resemblance categories</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.060" end="01:04:44.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a prototype and then if you have</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.520" end="01:04:46.360" style="s2">enough of the features of that prototype</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.500" end="01:04:49.480" style="s2">imagine the prototype has ten features</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.360" end="01:04:51.970" style="s2">and if you have an six of it those pro</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.480" end="01:04:53.830" style="s2">features you get to be in that category</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.970" end="01:04:55.720" style="s2">but it means that the categories are</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.830" end="01:05:00.040" style="s2">actually quite diverse and that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.720" end="01:05:01.960" style="s2">the problems that plagues psycho</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.040" end="01:05:03.700" style="s2">psychiatry as a science in clinical</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.960" end="01:05:06.040" style="s2">psychology as a science it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.700" end="01:05:08.050" style="s2">big problem because if the categories</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.040" end="01:05:10.240" style="s2">aren&#39;t homogeneous then it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.050" end="01:05:12.460" style="s2">difficult to draw conclusions about the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.240" end="01:05:13.859" style="s2">members of the category and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.460" end="01:05:16.119" style="s2">psychologists and the psychiatrist&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.859" end="01:05:19.060" style="s2">claim that those are scientific</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.119" end="01:05:20.650" style="s2">categories but but they&#39;re not and they</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.060" end="01:05:23.140" style="s2">can&#39;t be partly because they&#39;re aimed at</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.650" end="01:05:25.090" style="s2">the classification of health or ideal</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.140" end="01:05:26.680" style="s2">versus non health or non-ideal and</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.090" end="01:05:30.460" style="s2">partly because they play multiple roles</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.680" end="01:05:33.460" style="s2">say I mean the category isn&#39;t there just</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.460" end="01:05:35.580" style="s2">to provide neat demarcations for</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.460" end="01:05:39.430" style="s2">scientific study the categories there to</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.580" end="01:05:42.010" style="s2">give people a language to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.430" end="01:05:43.960" style="s2">certain sets of symptoms to diagnose</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.010" end="01:05:45.220" style="s2">because you know when you come in and</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.960" end="01:05:47.109" style="s2">you have a set of symptoms you might</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.220" end="01:05:49.270" style="s2">want to know what what they are so that</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.109" end="01:05:51.790" style="s2">you also know what they aren&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.270" end="01:05:53.530" style="s2">really a relief often to find a</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.790" end="01:05:55.300" style="s2">diagnosis and then of course the</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.530" end="01:05:57.940" style="s2">diagnosis has certain implications for</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.300" end="01:05:59.560" style="s2">treatment and and for billing and for</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.940" end="01:06:01.630" style="s2">all of that so the category has to play</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.560" end="01:06:05.740" style="s2">all of those roles so there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.630" end="01:06:08.170" style="s2">types of category and the categories</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.740" end="01:06:08.410" style="s2">that were talking about in relationship</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.170" end="01:06:11.530" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.410" end="01:06:13.650" style="s2">ecology aren&#39;t scientific categories</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.530" end="01:06:19.780" style="s2">they&#39;re categories about the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.650" end="01:06:22.720" style="s2">construed as a place to act so here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.780" end="01:06:23.950" style="s2">way to think about it you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.720" end="01:06:26.380" style="s2">looking at the world through a framework</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.950" end="01:06:29.740" style="s2">of reference and you have to do that</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.380" end="01:06:31.480" style="s2">because there isn&#39;t very much of you you</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.740" end="01:06:33.130" style="s2">can&#39;t see the whole world at once and in</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.480" end="01:06:34.960" style="s2">fact the amount of the world you</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.130" end="01:06:36.790" style="s2">actually see is so small you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.960" end="01:06:38.500" style="s2">believe it the central part of your</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.790" end="01:06:40.900" style="s2">vision is zipping around producing a</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.500" end="01:06:43.110" style="s2">pretty high-resolution representation of</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.900" end="01:06:46.150" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re looking at but</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.110" end="01:06:48.820" style="s2">outside of that center like if I look at</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.150" end="01:06:52.290" style="s2">you I can&#39;t see her eyes I can see her</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.820" end="01:06:56.740" style="s2">glasses but barely I can&#39;t even tell</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.290" end="01:06:59.560" style="s2">whether you&#39;re male or female the person</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.740" end="01:07:01.990" style="s2">past that I can&#39;t see it all now you</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.560" end="01:07:03.580" style="s2">don&#39;t notice that you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.990" end="01:07:05.740" style="s2">notice that you&#39;re that blind because</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.580" end="01:07:07.870" style="s2">you&#39;re your central vision is always</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.740" end="01:07:10.270" style="s2">popping around illuminating that tiny</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.870" end="01:07:12.700" style="s2">space but you&#39;re so damn blind it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.270" end="01:07:14.800" style="s2">mind-boggling and I&#39;m sure some of you</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.700" end="01:07:18.280" style="s2">have seen the invisible gorilla video</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.800" end="01:07:20.650" style="s2">you know where a gorilla comes into the</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.280" end="01:07:22.120" style="s2">video and you don&#39;t notice which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.650" end="01:07:23.830" style="s2">somewhat shocking because you would</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.120" end="01:07:25.870" style="s2">think that you would notice a gorilla</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.830" end="01:07:28.180" style="s2">but what happens is that you actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.870" end="01:07:30.450" style="s2">don&#39;t notice something unless it</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.180" end="01:07:32.410" style="s2">interferes with what you&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.450" end="01:07:35.200" style="s2">because what are you gonna do notice</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.410" end="01:07:36.760" style="s2">everything you can&#39;t do that you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.200" end="01:07:38.350" style="s2">hardly notice anything so what you do is</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.760" end="01:07:40.030" style="s2">you pick something to focus on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.350" end="01:07:41.830" style="s2">usually something that you value because</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.030" end="01:07:44.350" style="s2">why else would you focus on it so that</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.830" end="01:07:47.920" style="s2">means that your value system determines</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.350" end="01:07:49.660" style="s2">the direction of your perception bloody</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.920" end="01:07:52.990" style="s2">well think about that for a minute</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.660" end="01:07:55.560" style="s2">that&#39;s a Buddhist idea right people</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.990" end="01:07:57.640" style="s2">people live in a kind of illusion and</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.560" end="01:07:59.230" style="s2">sometimes that illusion causes suffering</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.640" end="01:08:00.640" style="s2">and they can transform the way they look</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.230" end="01:08:02.650" style="s2">at the world and that can release them</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.640" end="01:08:05.140" style="s2">from their suffering but the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.650" end="01:08:07.210" style="s2">you do live in an illusion well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.140" end="01:08:10.510" style="s2">know if it&#39;s exactly an illusion but you</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.210" end="01:08:12.430" style="s2">certainly do live within a framework of</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.510" end="01:08:15.340" style="s2">perception that&#39;s determined by your</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.430" end="01:08:17.080" style="s2">values now that is so weird you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.340" end="01:08:19.000" style="s2">because we never think of the world as</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.080" end="01:08:22.359" style="s2">something that reveals itself through</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.000" end="01:08:26.380" style="s2">our values but of course it of course it</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.359" end="01:08:28.630" style="s2">because you look at what you want you</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.380" end="01:08:30.910" style="s2">aim at what you want and once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.630" end="01:08:32.800" style="s2">aimed the world lays itself out for you</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.910" end="01:08:35.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly how perception works</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.800" end="01:08:36.910" style="s2">that&#39;s why I represented it this way</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.050" end="01:08:39.430" style="s2">you&#39;re always somewhere that&#39;s point a</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.910" end="01:08:42.370" style="s2">that&#39;s somewhere in some place and some</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.430" end="01:08:43.720" style="s2">time and you always have some notion</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.370" end="01:08:46.210" style="s2">about what you want to have have</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.720" end="01:08:47.859" style="s2">happened next you know you&#39;re gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.210" end="01:08:50.140" style="s2">to the next class maybe you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.859" end="01:08:52.330" style="s2">plan after this in this class you have a</p>

<p begin="01:08:52.330" end="01:08:56.380" style="s2">presume and maybe you have a goal with</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.640" end="01:08:58.570" style="s2">regards to a grade and that&#39;s nested</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.380" end="01:09:00.670" style="s2">inside your desire to get a degree and</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.570" end="01:09:02.530" style="s2">that&#39;s nested inside your desire to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.670" end="01:09:05.670" style="s2">educated and to have a career and and</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.530" end="01:09:09.160" style="s2">and and have a successful life so</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.670" end="01:09:10.510" style="s2">attending to me at the moment the reason</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.160" end="01:09:12.339" style="s2">you&#39;re doing that is because all of</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.510" end="01:09:14.530" style="s2">those values exist within you</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.339" end="01:09:18.370" style="s2">simultaneously focusing your attention</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.530" end="01:09:20.620" style="s2">and so you&#39;re attending to me and not to</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.370" end="01:09:22.870" style="s2">something else assuming that all of you</p>

<p begin="01:09:29.380" end="01:09:32.980" style="s2">focusing on is directed by what you</p>

<p begin="01:09:32.980" end="01:09:37.120" style="s2">unconscious in fact a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.350" end="01:09:38.920" style="s2">unconscious because you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.120" end="01:09:40.600" style="s2">difficult for you to get control of what</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.920" end="01:09:42.730" style="s2">you pay attention to you know what</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.600" end="01:09:45.609" style="s2">that&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to study it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:09:49.300" end="01:09:53.710" style="s2">instead of doing the Pape reading the</p>

<p begin="01:09:53.710" end="01:09:57.460" style="s2">that thing so your attention has an</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.450" end="01:09:59.410" style="s2">autonomy and that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.460" end="01:10:00.820" style="s2">psychoanalytic idea you know because you</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.410" end="01:10:02.770" style="s2">kind of think well you&#39;re in control</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.820" end="01:10:04.810" style="s2">it&#39;s like really</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.770" end="01:10:07.420" style="s2">you ever try telling yourself what to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.810" end="01:10:09.160" style="s2">does the how does that work for you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.420" end="01:10:12.970" style="s2">going to go to the gym three times a</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.160" end="01:10:16.840" style="s2">week right sure heard you who are ya I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:10:16.840" end="01:10:20.620" style="s2">like how long does that lasts like 15</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.790" end="01:10:24.280" style="s2">minutes and you&#39;re eating like three</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.620" end="01:10:25.930" style="s2">chocolate bars so you&#39;re this is and</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.280" end="01:10:29.460" style="s2">this is Freud central insight I would</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.930" end="01:10:32.470" style="s2">say you&#39;re an autonomous group of</p>

<p begin="01:10:32.470" end="01:10:36.219" style="s2">and they don&#39;t really get along very</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.450" end="01:10:39.400" style="s2">well and</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.219" end="01:10:42.369" style="s2">you the ego will say is by no means</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.400" end="01:10:44.170" style="s2">necessarily in charge and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.369" end="01:10:46.119" style="s2">strange thing to realize but you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.170" end="01:10:47.440" style="s2">really realize that by noticing how</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.119" end="01:10:50.979" style="s2">little control you have over your</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.440" end="01:10:53.320" style="s2">attentional focus okay so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.979" end="01:10:55.570" style="s2">your point a you&#39;re going to point B</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.320" end="01:10:58.449" style="s2">you&#39;re always doing that you inhabit a</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.570" end="01:10:59.979" style="s2">structure of value and it changes what</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.449" end="01:11:01.570" style="s2">the point a is and what the point B is</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.979" end="01:11:03.909" style="s2">but the structure itself doesn&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.570" end="01:11:06.610" style="s2">when you&#39;re looking at the world what</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.909" end="01:11:08.380" style="s2">you see is not objects you see tools and</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.610" end="01:11:09.999" style="s2">they make you happy those are things</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.380" end="01:11:11.860" style="s2">that facilitate your movement forward</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.999" end="01:11:13.539" style="s2">and you see obstacles and those are</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.860" end="01:11:16.150" style="s2">things that make you unhappy and when</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.539" end="01:11:18.010" style="s2">you encounter in an obstacle one of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.150" end="01:11:19.420" style="s2">problems is as well you don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.010" end="01:11:21.070" style="s2">where you&#39;re going and that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.420" end="01:11:23.469" style="s2">but the other problem is if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.070" end="01:11:25.630" style="s2">encounter an obstacle the frame might be</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.469" end="01:11:26.889" style="s2">wrong right because you never know it</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.630" end="01:11:29.260" style="s2">might be just something that you could</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.889" end="01:11:31.989" style="s2">Ditu around real easily might be a fatal</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.260" end="01:11:34.780" style="s2">flaw in your whole plan and so obstacles</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.989" end="01:11:36.820" style="s2">have this dual nature they get in your</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.780" end="01:11:39.610" style="s2">way but they can also take your plan</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.820" end="01:11:41.949" style="s2">down and so they can produce anxiety so</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.610" end="01:11:45.309" style="s2">my point is and this there&#39;s a book</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.949" end="01:11:49.440" style="s2">called visual an ecological approach to</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.309" end="01:11:52.769" style="s2">visual perceptions great book by Gibson</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.440" end="01:11:56.519" style="s2">JJ Gibson if I remember correctly and</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.769" end="01:11:59.380" style="s2">this is although I thought of this a</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.519" end="01:12:01.840" style="s2">while back I realized eventually that it</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.380" end="01:12:03.429" style="s2">was a variant of his theory and when he</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.840" end="01:12:06.369" style="s2">believed was that when people looked at</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.429" end="01:12:09.190" style="s2">the world they saw a value first and an</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.369" end="01:12:11.619" style="s2">inferred object second so for example</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.190" end="01:12:14.139" style="s2">for Gibson if you&#39;re standing by a cliff</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.619" end="01:12:16.030" style="s2">you don&#39;t see a cliff and then think</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.139" end="01:12:18.670" style="s2">about the fact that you might fall and</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.030" end="01:12:21.340" style="s2">then feel frightened you see a falling</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.670" end="01:12:23.590" style="s2">off place and part of the seeing of that</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.340" end="01:12:25.300" style="s2">part of the act of seeing is being</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.590" end="01:12:26.860" style="s2">afraid of that because your eyes are</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.300" end="01:12:29.380" style="s2">connected right to your emotional</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.860" end="01:12:31.510" style="s2">systems and part of what your eyes do is</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.380" end="01:12:33.190" style="s2">tell you what the object is but your</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.510" end="01:12:35.199" style="s2">eyes do all sorts of other things like</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.190" end="01:12:37.210" style="s2">they prepare you for action they prepare</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.199" end="01:12:39.880" style="s2">you for gripping they prepare you for</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.210" end="01:12:43.510" style="s2">emotion and and none of that actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.880" end="01:12:45.519" style="s2">requires the the existence necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.510" end="01:12:46.989" style="s2">the existence of your perception of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.519" end="01:12:49.960" style="s2">object so there are people who have</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.989" end="01:12:51.670" style="s2">blind sight and if you show them so they</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.960" end="01:12:53.680" style="s2">think they can&#39;t see but if you flash</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.670" end="01:12:56.290" style="s2">them in angry face they&#39;ll show a skin</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.680" end="01:12:58.239" style="s2">conductance response and that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.290" end="01:13:00.670" style="s2">the visual pathways to the amygdala</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.239" end="01:13:02.860" style="s2">which does face a most facial emotional</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.670" end="01:13:04.420" style="s2">processing can still be active these are</p>

<p begin="01:13:05.500" end="01:13:12.520" style="s2">destroyed the visual cortex so so</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.540" end="01:13:14.200" style="s2">anyways it&#39;s perfectly plausible that at</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.520" end="01:13:16.510" style="s2">least at one level of analysis when you</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.200" end="01:13:19.210" style="s2">look at something you see it&#39;s utility</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.510" end="01:13:21.400" style="s2">first so you see a chair and you might</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.210" end="01:13:24.460" style="s2">say a chair is an object but I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.400" end="01:13:26.350" style="s2">say that beanbags a chair and a stump is</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.460" end="01:13:28.239" style="s2">a chair and they don&#39;t share much in</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.350" end="01:13:30.700" style="s2">common except that you can sit on them</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.239" end="01:13:33.610" style="s2">and so you know the chair is just the</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.700" end="01:13:35.739" style="s2">chair is basically conceptualized by its</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.610" end="01:13:37.600" style="s2">functional utility and when you look at</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.739" end="01:13:39.550" style="s2">a chair what you perceive its is its</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.600" end="01:13:40.330" style="s2">functional utility and the chair tells</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.550" end="01:13:42.790" style="s2">you what to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.330" end="01:13:44.860" style="s2">it says sit on me and so that and there</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.790" end="01:13:46.420" style="s2">are people who have prefrontal damage</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.860" end="01:13:48.880" style="s2">and they engage in something called</p>

<p begin="01:14:22.960" end="01:14:30.820" style="s2">action and this is a Shakespearean quote</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.910" end="01:14:34.000" style="s2">that sort of sums it up quite nicely all</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.820" end="01:14:35.580" style="s2">the world is a stage and all the men and</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.000" end="01:14:37.540" style="s2">women merely players</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.580" end="01:14:39.310" style="s2">they have their exits and their</p>

<p begin="01:14:39.310" end="01:14:44.530" style="s2">many parts and you might say well is</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.310" end="01:14:46.840" style="s2">that really true and the answer to that</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.530" end="01:14:49.540" style="s2">is well it depends on what you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.840" end="01:14:51.160" style="s2">true and and that really is the answer</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.540" end="01:14:58.480" style="s2">because there are different ways of</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.160" end="01:15:00.760" style="s2">defining true so and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.480" end="01:15:03.460" style="s2">self-evident that there&#39;s only one way</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.760" end="01:15:05.080" style="s2">of defining true that&#39;s appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.460" end="01:15:08.290" style="s2">you know the definition of truth might</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.080" end="01:15:09.940" style="s2">be more like a tool and you know we are</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.290" end="01:15:11.469" style="s2">tool using creatures and really what</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.940" end="01:15:13.890" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do with our conceptions</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.469" end="01:15:16.690" style="s2">of truth is to work through the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.890" end="01:15:19.810" style="s2">successfully so even science is</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.690" end="01:15:22.270" style="s2">subordinate should be subordinate to our</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.810" end="01:15:24.670" style="s2">use of the world as a tool because if it</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.270" end="01:15:25.989" style="s2">isn&#39;t useful tool like what are we doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.670" end="01:15:28.000" style="s2">with it you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.989" end="01:15:30.340" style="s2">just generating technology that might</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.000" end="01:15:30.850" style="s2">destroy the world that seems like a bad</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.340" end="01:15:35.890" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.850" end="01:15:37.780" style="s2">so so I think that that the world as</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.890" end="01:15:39.700" style="s2">tool is actually the fundamental sword</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.780" end="01:15:42.760" style="s2">of truth and I think that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.700" end="01:15:44.950" style="s2">Darwinian idea right that that our</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.760" end="01:15:46.690" style="s2">notions about the world have evolved</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.950" end="01:15:50.730" style="s2">through a Darwinian process and that</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.690" end="01:15:55.110" style="s2">it&#39;s appropriate for us to regard as</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.730" end="01:15:59.860" style="s2">what is most real those things that</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.110" end="01:16:02.080" style="s2">reliably ensure are the continuation of</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.860" end="01:16:04.270" style="s2">our life and the probability of our</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.080" end="01:16:06.730" style="s2">propagation and if you&#39;re a true</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.270" end="01:16:09.790" style="s2">Darwinian I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.730" end="01:16:11.770" style="s2">out of that argument and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.790" end="01:16:14.650" style="s2">self-evident by any stretch of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.770" end="01:16:18.070" style="s2">imagination that seeing the world as all</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.650" end="01:16:20.200" style="s2">as objects is the way that our brain</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.070" end="01:16:22.090" style="s2">works in fact I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.200" end="01:16:29.739" style="s2">it works at all and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.090" end="01:16:31.150" style="s2">why we&#39;re so wired for stories right</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.739" end="01:16:33.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a mystery</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.150" end="01:16:37.450" style="s2">you know like you won&#39;t line up for two</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.520" end="01:16:39.010" style="s2">hours to go see a lecture but you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.450" end="01:16:40.840" style="s2">line up for two hours maybe you&#39;ll even</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.010" end="01:16:43.270" style="s2">camp overnight if you&#39;re mythological</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.840" end="01:16:45.570" style="s2">imagination has been seized for god only</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.270" end="01:16:49.210" style="s2">knows what reason by Star Wars and you</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.570" end="01:16:51.489" style="s2">know that&#39;s the source of mythology</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.210" end="01:16:54.700" style="s2">it&#39;s the mythology of the modern person</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.489" end="01:17:01.510" style="s2">and it fills a gap and that&#39;s why people</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.700" end="01:17:03.160" style="s2">do it so that to me speaks of men the</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.510" end="01:17:05.770" style="s2">manner in which our psyches are</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.160" end="01:17:07.300" style="s2">constructed and that&#39;s a union idea</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.770" end="01:17:10.780" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea of the archetype</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.300" end="01:17:12.880" style="s2">essentially that to be human is to</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.780" end="01:17:17.380" style="s2">participate in a certain pattern of</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.880" end="01:17:19.330" style="s2">being and that that pattern of being is</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.380" end="01:17:22.239" style="s2">socially it&#39;s acted out individually but</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.330" end="01:17:25.000" style="s2">it&#39;s also part of your structure even</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.239" end="01:17:28.210" style="s2">your perceptual structure as a as a</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.000" end="01:17:31.150" style="s2">living organism of your particular type</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.210" end="01:17:33.969" style="s2">and it would be the case at least in</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.150" end="01:17:36.929" style="s2">part that the hero myth which is go out</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.969" end="01:17:40.330" style="s2">where no one has gone before</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.929" end="01:17:43.870" style="s2">face they terrors of the unknown gather</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.330" end="01:17:47.199" style="s2">something of value and return is the</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.870" end="01:17:50.380" style="s2">central story of humankind it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.199" end="01:17:53.880" style="s2">only central story but it&#39;s it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.380" end="01:17:56.469" style="s2">there in the top three and many of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.880" end="01:18:01.179" style="s2">dramas that you engage yourself in are</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.469" end="01:18:03.940" style="s2">variations of that story and you watch</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.179" end="01:18:05.920" style="s2">it over and over and over because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.940" end="01:18:14.770" style="s2">trying to learn how to do that because</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.920" end="01:18:20.350" style="s2">that&#39;s what you need to do to live okay</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.770" end="01:18:20.980" style="s2">here&#39;s the here&#39;s an idea what&#39;s common</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.350" end="01:18:25.989" style="s2">among people</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.980" end="01:18:27.790" style="s2">well we&#39;re self conscious so we know of</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.989" end="01:18:31.300" style="s2">our own existence and we know of our own</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.790" end="01:18:33.820" style="s2">limitations and so that means that we</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.300" end="01:18:37.480" style="s2">have a certain innate terror and</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.820" end="01:18:39.969" style="s2">fragility our existence is a problem to</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.480" end="01:18:41.500" style="s2">us and in some sense what we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.969" end="01:18:42.969" style="s2">to do when we search for meaning is to</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.500" end="01:18:45.429" style="s2">search for a solution to that problem</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.969" end="01:18:47.560" style="s2">and that can be security but it don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.429" end="01:18:49.600" style="s2">can also be mode of being you know and</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.560" end="01:18:51.699" style="s2">so for example being engaged in</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.600" end="01:18:54.159" style="s2">something worthwhile seems to be a good</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.699" end="01:18:55.750" style="s2">medicine for being fragile you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.159" end="01:18:57.159" style="s2">because you think well I&#39;m doing this it</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.750" end="01:18:59.080" style="s2">seems worthwhile and the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.159" end="01:19:00.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a price to be paid for it and</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.080" end="01:19:02.650" style="s2">that things could befall me that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.940" end="01:19:04.449" style="s2">good I&#39;m willing to put up with that</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.650" end="01:19:06.219" style="s2">because what I&#39;m engaged in seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.449" end="01:19:10.389" style="s2">of appropriate of sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.219" end="01:19:11.800" style="s2">significance to justify all that we all</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.389" end="01:19:13.630" style="s2">become self-conscious and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.800" end="01:19:18.670" style="s2">trying to do something about that figure</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.630" end="01:19:21.060" style="s2">out how to deal with it so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.670" end="01:19:23.590" style="s2">landscape that we inhabit I would say</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.060" end="01:19:27.730" style="s2">within which that takes place so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.590" end="01:19:30.850" style="s2">a human being self conscious doomed to</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.730" end="01:19:32.830" style="s2">tragedy and doomed to be aware of that</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.850" end="01:19:34.240" style="s2">the human being has two elements and</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.830" end="01:19:35.830" style="s2">that&#39;s the element that seeks the good</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.240" end="01:19:39.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s the other element that seeks</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.830" end="01:19:42.220" style="s2">I would say revenge and destruction and</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.880" end="01:19:44.080" style="s2">we have our reasons you know if</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.220" end="01:19:46.240" style="s2">something tragic happens to you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.080" end="01:19:48.340" style="s2">tragic and unfair and it really brings</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.240" end="01:19:50.350" style="s2">you low the probability that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.340" end="01:19:52.270" style="s2">going to become resentful and want</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.350" end="01:19:54.400" style="s2">revenge is extraordinarily high at no</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.270" end="01:19:56.710" style="s2">wonder and you know the archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.400" end="01:19:59.740" style="s2">representation of that is evil itself</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.710" end="01:20:01.900" style="s2">and the archetypal representation of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.740" end="01:20:05.530" style="s2">good that you could do is is the hero</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.900" end="01:20:07.360" style="s2">and so those things inhabit us they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.530" end="01:20:10.900" style="s2">they&#39;re permanent elements of the human</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.360" end="01:20:13.330" style="s2">psyche and then what else is universal</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.900" end="01:20:16.180" style="s2">to us well we live in a society you</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.330" end="01:20:18.970" style="s2">could say and that&#39;s deep that&#39;s deep</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.180" end="01:20:21.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not just human society like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.970" end="01:20:24.370" style="s2">lived in a society forever so you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.190" end="01:20:27.250" style="s2">lobsters live in dominance hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.370" end="01:20:29.020" style="s2">and they use their serotonin system at</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.250" end="01:20:31.180" style="s2">least in part to keep track of their</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.020" end="01:20:32.890" style="s2">dominance position and so you can use</p>

<p begin="01:20:32.890" end="01:20:37.240" style="s2">get defeated and they don&#39;t feel so bad</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.990" end="01:20:38.890" style="s2">from being defeated in a fight and so</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.240" end="01:20:40.620" style="s2">you just think about that because the</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.890" end="01:20:45.400" style="s2">antidepressants do the same thing to us</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.620" end="01:20:49.110" style="s2">we&#39;re so bloody social that the circuits</p>

<p begin="01:21:00.040" end="01:21:04.690" style="s2">serotonin system governs your emotional</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.470" end="01:21:06.490" style="s2">regulation how people respond to you and</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.690" end="01:21:08.290" style="s2">what they think of you man that matters</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.490" end="01:21:10.650" style="s2">that&#39;s why you&#39;re on Facebook all the</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.290" end="01:21:13.000" style="s2">time and checking your texts and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.650" end="01:21:14.950" style="s2">obsessing continually about your online</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.000" end="01:21:17.140" style="s2">presence and assuming that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.950" end="01:21:18.940" style="s2">that and you know contacting people</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.140" end="01:21:21.850" style="s2">frantically and seeing what the updates</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.940" end="01:21:24.430" style="s2">are it&#39;s like where where how are you</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.850" end="01:21:25.900" style="s2">held in the esteem of others very very</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.430" end="01:21:27.370" style="s2">important and that&#39;s because it</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.900" end="01:21:30.580" style="s2">determines your emotional regulation</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.370" end="01:21:33.040" style="s2">it&#39;s really important so we exist in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.580" end="01:21:35.230" style="s2">society always and the society has two</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.040" end="01:21:37.030" style="s2">elements the tyrannical element of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.230" end="01:21:39.040" style="s2">society that would be the tyrannical</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.030" end="01:21:41.260" style="s2">king roughly speaking a very common</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.040" end="01:21:44.230" style="s2">mythological theme you see that in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.260" end="01:21:45.460" style="s2">Lion King - right because that&#39;s scar</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.230" end="01:21:49.210" style="s2">and of course you see it in the real</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.460" end="01:21:52.420" style="s2">world with almost continually and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.210" end="01:21:54.489" style="s2">the benevolent king who is the source of</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.420" end="01:21:55.930" style="s2">all the good things about culture you</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.489" end="01:21:58.739" style="s2">know and and you can see these things</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.930" end="01:22:01.630" style="s2">play out as mythologies in political</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.739" end="01:22:04.630" style="s2">terms so I would say for example the</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.630" end="01:22:07.239" style="s2">continual harping about the oppressive</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.630" end="01:22:10.720" style="s2">nature of the patriarchy is part of a</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.239" end="01:22:12.820" style="s2">myth and the myth is that society is</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.720" end="01:22:16.060" style="s2">oppressive it&#39;s like well yeah obviously</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.820" end="01:22:17.590" style="s2">you know because you have to be quite a</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.060" end="01:22:19.960" style="s2">bit like you and you have to be quite a</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.590" end="01:22:21.700" style="s2">bit like you even if you&#39;re not so that</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.960" end="01:22:23.830" style="s2">you can get along right everybody</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.700" end="01:22:27.220" style="s2">sacrifices a tremendous amount of their</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.830" end="01:22:30.520" style="s2">individuality to the common to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.220" end="01:22:32.980" style="s2">common mode of being that&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.520" end="01:22:35.860" style="s2">tyrannical element to that but you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.980" end="01:22:38.560" style="s2">by the same token it&#39;s the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.860" end="01:22:42.130" style="s2">cooperation and the stability of society</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.560" end="01:22:44.050" style="s2">and the the final element is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.130" end="01:22:46.060" style="s2">often represented met in a masculine</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.050" end="01:22:48.370" style="s2">manner by the way society and I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.060" end="01:22:50.200" style="s2">that&#39;s because our primary dominance</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.370" end="01:22:53.710" style="s2">structures given the creatures we are</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.200" end="01:22:56.620" style="s2">like chimpanzees the primary structures</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.710" end="01:23:01.380" style="s2">of dominance are masculine and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.620" end="01:23:01.380" style="s2">outside of what&#39;s known is the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.980" end="01:23:08.590" style="s2">and we always have to contend with that</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.670" end="01:23:10.150" style="s2">and it&#39;s wonderful in that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.590" end="01:23:12.130" style="s2">source of all new things and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.150" end="01:23:14.590" style="s2">terrible in that it&#39;s the place where</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.130" end="01:23:17.380" style="s2">all the things that destabilize you come</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.590" end="01:23:20.260" style="s2">from and so this is a good</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.380" end="01:23:25.360" style="s2">representation although not the only one</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.260" end="01:23:27.250" style="s2">so that&#39;s the feminine nature that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.360" end="01:23:29.380" style="s2">masculine order and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.250" end="01:23:34.020" style="s2">individual who&#39;s destined to suffer in</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.380" end="01:23:34.020" style="s2">the grasp of those two things and</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.300" end="01:23:48.570" style="s2">I&#39;ll finish this next time what have we</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.480" end="01:23:52.650" style="s2">got here yep</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.570" end="01:23:54.800" style="s2">all right good enough we&#39;ll see you next</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.650" end="01:23:54.800" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.980" end="01:24:03.180" style="s2">so today to begin with we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.830" end="01:24:05.010" style="s2">finish the last lecture and then with</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.180" end="01:24:06.780" style="s2">any luck we&#39;re gonna start the next one</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.010" end="01:24:09.360" style="s2">there somatically linked anyways well</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.780" end="01:24:12.150" style="s2">you know what all the lectures for the</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.360" end="01:24:14.910" style="s2">next well for the whole course hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.150" end="01:24:17.250" style="s2">will be thematically late to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.910" end="01:24:19.260" style="s2">given that nominally they&#39;re about the</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.250" end="01:24:20.340" style="s2">same topic but some are more tightly</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.260" end="01:24:27.060" style="s2">linked than others</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.340" end="01:24:28.920" style="s2">so I started telling you last week about</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.060" end="01:24:29.670" style="s2">this idea of the voyage to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.920" end="01:24:33.780" style="s2">underworld</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.670" end="01:24:38.460" style="s2">and I want to tell you a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.780" end="01:24:39.870" style="s2">about that young in particular</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.460" end="01:24:42.510" style="s2">conceptualized the voyage to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.870" end="01:24:46.350" style="s2">underworld as a journey into the</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.510" end="01:24:49.320" style="s2">unconscious and the unconscious for the</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.350" end="01:24:53.300" style="s2">psychoanalyst is a place of fantasy and</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.320" end="01:24:55.830" style="s2">dream an implicit presupposition and</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.300" end="01:25:00.000" style="s2">habit and that&#39;s all correct you know we</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.830" end="01:25:01.739" style="s2">there is an unconscious and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.000" end="01:25:03.120" style="s2">perfectly reasonable to conceptualize it</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.739" end="01:25:06.120" style="s2">that way that the big difference I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.120" end="01:25:10.380" style="s2">between the psychoanalysts and the later</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.120" end="01:25:13.160" style="s2">more empirical scientists is that the</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.380" end="01:25:19.410" style="s2">psychoanalyst sort of envisioned your</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.160" end="01:25:23.810" style="s2">psyche as a place of living partial</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.410" end="01:25:27.660" style="s2">personalities instead of cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.810" end="01:25:29.730" style="s2">computational systems you know they took</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.660" end="01:25:33.210" style="s2">into account the fact that you&#39;re alive</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.730" end="01:25:34.440" style="s2">and that the parts of you are alive and</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.210" end="01:25:36.090" style="s2">you know there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.440" end="01:25:40.140" style="s2">neuroscientist named gives that Gazza</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.090" end="01:25:43.380" style="s2">Nick I don&#39;t know how to say his name</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.140" end="01:25:46.080" style="s2">Gazza nigga that&#39;s wrong is that</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.380" end="01:25:48.360" style="s2">Gazzaniga yeah I think that&#39;s it anyways</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.080" end="01:25:51.030" style="s2">he did some of the earliest experiments</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.360" end="01:25:52.770" style="s2">on split brains and so sometimes if you</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.030" end="01:25:55.910" style="s2">have intractable epilepsy which I</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.770" end="01:25:55.910" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t recommend by the way</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.020" end="01:26:01.030" style="s2">one of the surgical procedures for</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.650" end="01:26:03.460" style="s2">mediating its negative effects is</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.030" end="01:26:05.710" style="s2">something called a you cut the corpus</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.460" end="01:26:08.790" style="s2">callosum and it&#39;s very large number</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.710" end="01:26:11.080" style="s2">large structure in the brain that</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.790" end="01:26:12.489" style="s2">connects the two separate hemispheres</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.080" end="01:26:14.200" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s not obvious why we</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.489" end="01:26:15.730" style="s2">have two separate hemispheres although</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.200" end="01:26:17.590" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you a little bit about why I</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.730" end="01:26:23.070" style="s2">think it is but anyways they do</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.590" end="01:26:26.530" style="s2">communicate and what Gazzaniga</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.070" end="01:26:28.989" style="s2">demonstrated was that you could tell one</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.530" end="01:26:32.320" style="s2">hemisphere something without the other</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.989" end="01:26:34.510" style="s2">one knowing that both hemispheres were</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.320" end="01:26:37.780" style="s2">conscious and that the consciousness was</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.510" end="01:26:39.100" style="s2">somewhat independent it really strange</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.780" end="01:26:41.590" style="s2">it&#39;s very interest makes very</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.100" end="01:26:44.860" style="s2">interesting readings reading you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.590" end="01:26:46.660" style="s2">because it suggests that fragments of</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.860" end="01:26:48.460" style="s2">ourselves you could think of you have</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.660" end="01:26:50.530" style="s2">fragments of yourself within you that</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.460" end="01:26:52.360" style="s2">are like low resolution representations</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.530" end="01:26:53.980" style="s2">of you you know and that and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.360" end="01:26:55.660" style="s2">psychoanalysts would think of those more</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.980" end="01:26:57.580" style="s2">as they&#39;re kind of like they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.660" end="01:26:58.660" style="s2">like one-eyed Giants that might be a way</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.580" end="01:27:00.340" style="s2">of thinking about it if you were</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.660" end="01:27:03.400" style="s2">thinking about it in a fantastical way</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.340" end="01:27:06.100" style="s2">so there&#39;s the angry you and you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.400" end="01:27:10.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve all come in contact with the</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.100" end="01:27:11.590" style="s2">angry you it&#39;s a rather rigid that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.000" end="01:27:13.989" style="s2">first thing you might say about it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.590" end="01:27:16.719" style="s2">impulsive and short-term it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.989" end="01:27:19.030" style="s2">think much about the past unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.719" end="01:27:21.070" style="s2">bad things about whoever you&#39;re angry at</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.030" end="01:27:23.650" style="s2">in which case it thinks about them a lot</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.070" end="01:27:26.590" style="s2">it&#39;s not too concerned with long-term</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.650" end="01:27:31.270" style="s2">future consequences and mostly it wants</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.590" end="01:27:35.290" style="s2">to be right and you know when angry you</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.270" end="01:27:38.380" style="s2">disappears and normal you assuming such</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.290" end="01:27:40.810" style="s2">a thing exists reappears you can be</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.380" end="01:27:45.670" style="s2">perfectly shocked about how angry you</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.810" end="01:27:47.710" style="s2">behaved and in fact sometimes if angry</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.670" end="01:27:51.820" style="s2">you really gets out of hand like it</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.710" end="01:27:53.590" style="s2">might in a battle like a war it might do</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.820" end="01:27:55.540" style="s2">things that you just can&#39;t imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.590" end="01:27:58.900" style="s2">you would do and under those</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.540" end="01:28:01.840" style="s2">circumstances you can reveal parts of</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.900" end="01:28:07.900" style="s2">yourself to yourself that are so foreign</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.840" end="01:28:09.969" style="s2">and so horrifying that it will leave you</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.900" end="01:28:14.680" style="s2">with post-traumatic stress disorder</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.969" end="01:28:16.630" style="s2">because it is the case that many but not</p>

<p begin="01:29:00.010" end="01:29:03.790" style="s2">why they need a culture you know the</p>

<p begin="01:29:09.850" end="01:29:14.770" style="s2">something inside your your head let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:29:24.340" end="01:29:29.910" style="s2">right but that isn&#39;t what your culture</p>

<p begin="01:29:43.210" end="01:29:47.170" style="s2">what that means is that when you believe</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.370" end="01:29:50.590" style="s2">something and you&#39;re among your own</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.170" end="01:29:52.000" style="s2">people you believe something implicitly</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.590" end="01:29:53.860" style="s2">it&#39;s the way you look at the world it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:29:57.550" end="01:30:01.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a match between what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.830" end="01:30:03.699" style="s2">doing what you see and what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.510" end="01:30:06.210" style="s2">and what other people expect and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.699" end="01:30:08.920" style="s2">that match that regulates your emotions</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.210" end="01:30:11.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not the belief system it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.920" end="01:30:14.739" style="s2">match and so part of the reason that</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.560" end="01:30:17.620" style="s2">people are so tied to their cultural</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.739" end="01:30:22.239" style="s2">identity is because their cultural</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.620" end="01:30:23.780" style="s2">identity regulates their emotions and in</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.239" end="01:30:25.880" style="s2">a profound way like this is</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.780" end="01:30:29.630" style="s2">no joke you know I mean one of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.880" end="01:30:31.880" style="s2">things that stabilizes human nervous</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.630" end="01:30:33.619" style="s2">systems is imagine that you have a</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.880" end="01:30:35.389" style="s2">domain of competence there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.619" end="01:30:36.889" style="s2">domains of competence and of course in</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.389" end="01:30:38.750" style="s2">some of those domains you&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.889" end="01:30:40.730" style="s2">incompetent but they met me not matter</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.750" end="01:30:42.289" style="s2">because you don&#39;t go into that domain so</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.730" end="01:30:43.940" style="s2">you have some area of specialization</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.289" end="01:30:46.610" style="s2">which you might think of as your</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.940" end="01:30:48.650" style="s2">sub-tribe you know your university</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.610" end="01:30:51.260" style="s2">students and so some of you are lower</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.650" end="01:30:53.449" style="s2">status by the rules of the university</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.260" end="01:30:55.550" style="s2">game and some of you are higher status</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.449" end="01:30:57.139" style="s2">by the rules of the university game by</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.550" end="01:31:00.440" style="s2">the tribe and so the higher status</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.139" end="01:31:02.210" style="s2">people tend to be the ones who fit into</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.440" end="01:31:05.539" style="s2">the academic environment you know and</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.210" end="01:31:08.510" style="s2">and find it conducive to their mode of</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.539" end="01:31:11.809" style="s2">being and all who also do well and their</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.510" end="01:31:15.010" style="s2">serotonin levels rise and you know the</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.809" end="01:31:18.500" style="s2">neuro chemicals that moderate mood</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.010" end="01:31:20.630" style="s2">particularly are serotonergic its</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.500" end="01:31:22.250" style="s2">serotonin it&#39;s lots of other things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.630" end="01:31:24.619" style="s2">an oversimplification but that&#39;ll do for</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.250" end="01:31:26.619" style="s2">now as you become dominant in a</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.619" end="01:31:29.570" style="s2">hierarchy your serotonin levels rise and</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.619" end="01:31:32.000" style="s2">what that means is that happy things</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.570" end="01:31:34.550" style="s2">make you happier and sad things make you</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.000" end="01:31:35.989" style="s2">less sad it Tunes your nervous system so</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.550" end="01:31:37.909" style="s2">if you&#39;re down at the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.989" end="01:31:40.480" style="s2">hierarchy and you&#39;re failing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.909" end="01:31:42.920" style="s2">hey hardly anything makes you happy and</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.480" end="01:31:44.929" style="s2">everything makes you nervous and it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.920" end="01:31:50.809" style="s2">wonder because it&#39;s it&#39;s not very good</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.929" end="01:31:52.880" style="s2">down there so the the societal structure</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.809" end="01:31:56.329" style="s2">which which is an elaborated dominance</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.880" end="01:31:58.099" style="s2">hierarchy regulates your emotions</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.329" end="01:31:59.809" style="s2">because of the match between your</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.099" end="01:32:01.849" style="s2">expectations and the behaviors of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.809" end="01:32:03.260" style="s2">people within that structure and then</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.849" end="01:32:06.559" style="s2">your position within the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.260" end="01:32:08.090" style="s2">regulates the rate ratio let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.559" end="01:32:09.949" style="s2">the intensity between positive and</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.090" end="01:32:13.309" style="s2">negative emotion so you mess with</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.949" end="01:32:16.219" style="s2">people&#39;s status at your peril and you</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.309" end="01:32:20.300" style="s2">disrupt their culture they don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.219" end="01:32:22.460" style="s2">that and no wonder because when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.300" end="01:32:25.429" style="s2">disrupted they fall into chaos and chaos</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.460" end="01:32:28.130" style="s2">isn&#39;t just anxiety the anxiety is bad</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.429" end="01:32:29.989" style="s2">enough but it&#39;s not just anxiety because</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.130" end="01:32:31.989" style="s2">when you fall into chaos when things</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.989" end="01:32:35.059" style="s2">fall apart for you</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.989" end="01:32:37.190" style="s2">of course you&#39;re uncertain and anxious</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.059" end="01:32:37.620" style="s2">because you don&#39;t know what the hell is</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.190" end="01:32:39.150" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.620" end="01:32:40.440" style="s2">on and you don&#39;t know where you are and</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.150" end="01:32:42.450" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what to do Pat&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.440" end="01:32:44.160" style="s2">anxiety-provoking and maybe you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.450" end="01:32:45.810" style="s2">even understand your past properly</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.160" end="01:32:48.450" style="s2">anymore that as I said that happens when</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.810" end="01:32:52.500" style="s2">people get betrayed and so you fall into</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.450" end="01:32:54.120" style="s2">this state where nothing is certain the</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.500" end="01:32:56.250" style="s2">way you construe the world isn&#39;t certain</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.120" end="01:32:58.620" style="s2">and even the way the world is is no</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.250" end="01:33:01.080" style="s2">longer certain because you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.620" end="01:33:03.120" style="s2">how to act or your actions aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.080" end="01:33:05.100" style="s2">working and so the world is presenting</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.120" end="01:33:07.770" style="s2">itself as something that&#39;s chaotic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.100" end="01:33:10.620" style="s2">not just psychological the chaos is a</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.770" end="01:33:13.170" style="s2">weird intermingling of the chaotic world</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.620" end="01:33:14.910" style="s2">and the chaotic self I mean that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.170" end="01:33:17.730" style="s2">happens when you get unemployed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.910" end="01:33:20.100" style="s2">like it&#39;s devastating right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.730" end="01:33:21.540" style="s2">devastating to people and it you could</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.100" end="01:33:25.110" style="s2">say well that&#39;s psychological it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.540" end="01:33:26.670" style="s2">well yeah but they&#39;re unemployed that</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.110" end="01:33:29.190" style="s2">makes the world far more</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.670" end="01:33:30.480" style="s2">incomprehensible and uncertain it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.190" end="01:33:32.970" style="s2">just psychological</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.480" end="01:33:35.250" style="s2">it&#39;s psychological and that&#39;s bad but</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.970" end="01:33:37.290" style="s2">it&#39;s also real and that&#39;s even worse and</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.250" end="01:33:40.860" style="s2">then those two things can spiral which</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.290" end="01:33:42.810" style="s2">they often do because you know if you</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.860" end="01:33:45.390" style="s2">don&#39;t set your expectations properly for</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.810" end="01:33:48.210" style="s2">a job search and assume that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.390" end="01:33:50.220" style="s2">gonna get 49 rejections for every</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.210" end="01:33:53.040" style="s2">interview which you really need to know</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.220" end="01:33:54.750" style="s2">because if you get 49 rejections it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.040" end="01:33:57.810" style="s2">not because you&#39;re useless it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.750" end="01:33:59.790" style="s2">the baseline for rejection is 98% and</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.810" end="01:34:03.360" style="s2">that&#39;s okay because the base rate for</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.790" end="01:34:05.370" style="s2">rejection for everything is 98% no</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.360" end="01:34:06.870" style="s2">matter what you do but you need to know</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.370" end="01:34:08.790" style="s2">that so that you don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.870" end="01:34:10.530" style="s2">like something wrong with you and of</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.790" end="01:34:13.590" style="s2">course you only have to get it right</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.530" end="01:34:15.690" style="s2">once that then you have a job it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.590" end="01:34:17.100" style="s2">lottery but you have to set yourself up</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.690" end="01:34:19.140" style="s2">you have to think okay well I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.100" end="01:34:21.870" style="s2">look for a job I need to how many</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.140" end="01:34:23.820" style="s2">resumes can I tolerate sending out a day</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.870" end="01:34:26.190" style="s2">you know it has to be enough so you</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.820" end="01:34:28.980" style="s2">don&#39;t feel like a useless moron and it</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.190" end="01:34:32.340" style="s2">can&#39;t be so many that you&#39;re overwhelmed</p>

<p begin="01:34:44.580" end="01:34:50.699" style="s2">know what to expect in the world and and</p>

<p begin="01:37:04.650" end="01:37:08.850" style="s2">how about a career that puts you in a</p>

<p begin="01:37:15.180" end="01:37:19.770" style="s2">because no one can live without a</p>

<p begin="01:37:19.770" end="01:37:25.050" style="s2">don&#39;t have a routine I would recommend</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.680" end="01:37:27.000" style="s2">like you get one going because you</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.050" end="01:37:29.280" style="s2">cannot be mentally healthy without a</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.000" end="01:37:31.740" style="s2">routine you need to pick a time to get</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.280" end="01:37:34.200" style="s2">up whatever time you want but pick one</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.740" end="01:37:36.630" style="s2">and stick to it because otherwise you</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.200" end="01:37:39.930" style="s2">dis regulate your circadian rhythms and</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.630" end="01:37:42.720" style="s2">they regulate your mood and eat</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.930" end="01:37:44.640" style="s2">something in the morning I had lots of</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.720" end="01:37:46.320" style="s2">clients who&#39;ve had anxiety disorders I</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.640" end="01:37:49.800" style="s2">had one client who was literally</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.320" end="01:37:51.270" style="s2">starving very smart girl sheet there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.800" end="01:37:53.040" style="s2">very little that she liked she kind of</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.270" end="01:37:55.080" style="s2">tried to subsist on like half a cup of</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.040" end="01:37:57.570" style="s2">rice a day she came to me and said I</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.080" end="01:37:59.430" style="s2">have no energy I come home all I want to</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.570" end="01:38:02.580" style="s2">do is watch the same movie over and over</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.430" end="01:38:04.290" style="s2">what like is that weird and I thought</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.580" end="01:38:06.570" style="s2">well it depends on how hard you work you</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.290" end="01:38:09.210" style="s2">know it&#39;s a little weird but whatever</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.570" end="01:38:11.910" style="s2">it&#39;s familiar you&#39;re looking for comfort</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.210" end="01:38:14.940" style="s2">so I did an analysis of her diet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.910" end="01:38:18.240" style="s2">like three quarters of a cup of rice</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.940" end="01:38:22.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re starving eat something</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.240" end="01:38:26.130" style="s2">you know you&#39;ll feel better</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.200" end="01:38:27.930" style="s2">so she modified her diet and her all her</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.130" end="01:38:34.340" style="s2">anxiety went away and she had some</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.930" end="01:38:36.960" style="s2">energy it&#39;s like yeah you got to eat so</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.340" end="01:38:38.730" style="s2">schedule that&#39;s a good thing man your</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.960" end="01:38:41.070" style="s2">brain will thank you for it it will</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.730" end="01:38:43.410" style="s2">stabilize your nervous system with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.070" end="01:38:45.120" style="s2">a bit of a plan that&#39;s a good thing you</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.410" end="01:38:47.790" style="s2">need a career you need something</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.120" end="01:38:49.680" style="s2">productive to do with your time you need</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.790" end="01:38:52.350" style="s2">to regulate your use of drugs and</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.680" end="01:38:55.790" style="s2">alcohol most particularly alcohol</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.350" end="01:38:55.790" style="s2">because that does even a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.780" end="01:39:01.530" style="s2">you need a family like the family you</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.460" end="01:39:03.330" style="s2">have your parents and all that be nice</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.530" end="01:39:04.860" style="s2">if you all got along you could work on</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.330" end="01:39:06.480" style="s2">that that&#39;s a good thing to work on and</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.860" end="01:39:09.990" style="s2">then you know you probably need children</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.480" end="01:39:13.260" style="s2">at some point that&#39;s life that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.990" end="01:39:15.870" style="s2">life is and if you&#39;re missing you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.260" end="01:39:18.570" style="s2">you may have a good reason to not be</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.870" end="01:39:21.750" style="s2">operating on one of those dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.570" end="01:39:24.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not mandatory but I can tell you</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.750" end="01:39:26.160" style="s2">that if you&#39;re not operating reasonably</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.000" end="01:39:27.750" style="s2">well on four I think I mentioned six if</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.160" end="01:39:30.870" style="s2">you&#39;re not operating reasonably well on</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.750" end="01:39:34.070" style="s2">at least three of them there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.870" end="01:39:37.470" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be psychologically</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.070" end="01:39:39.210" style="s2">thriving and that&#39;s more pragmatic in</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.470" end="01:39:41.820" style="s2">some sense than psychological right</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.210" end="01:39:44.430" style="s2">human beings have a nature there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.820" end="01:39:46.350" style="s2">things we need and if we have them well</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.430" end="01:39:48.600" style="s2">that&#39;s good and if we don&#39;t have them</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.350" end="01:39:51.120" style="s2">well then we feel the lack and so</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.600" end="01:39:53.220" style="s2">behaviorists behavioral psychologists</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.120" end="01:39:53.670" style="s2">concentrate a lot more on that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.220" end="01:39:56.210" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.670" end="01:39:59.190" style="s2">you know it&#39;s practical it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.210" end="01:40:00.390" style="s2">strategizing make a career plan figure</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.190" end="01:40:02.010" style="s2">out how to negotiate because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.390" end="01:40:04.170" style="s2">bloody important figure out how to say</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.010" end="01:40:07.760" style="s2">what you need figure out how to tell the</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.170" end="01:40:12.090" style="s2">truth to people figure out how to listen</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.760" end="01:40:13.290" style="s2">to your partner in particular because if</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.090" end="01:40:15.930" style="s2">you listen to them they will actually</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.290" end="01:40:17.610" style="s2">tell you what they want and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.930" end="01:40:19.380" style="s2">you can give it to them and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.610" end="01:40:22.230" style="s2">they&#39;ll return the favor and if you</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.380" end="01:40:24.000" style="s2">practice that for like 15 years well</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.230" end="01:40:26.580" style="s2">then maybe you&#39;re constantly giving each</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.000" end="01:40:28.560" style="s2">other what you want well hooray that</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.580" end="01:40:32.340" style="s2">would be good and then there&#39;s two of</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.560" end="01:40:34.100" style="s2">you under all circumstances and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.340" end="01:40:36.510" style="s2">better to have two brains than one</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.100" end="01:40:39.900" style="s2">because people think differently because</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.510" end="01:40:42.690" style="s2">of their temperament mostly and so the</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.900" end="01:40:45.390" style="s2">negotiation is where the wisdom arises</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.690" end="01:40:46.830" style="s2">and it&#39;s part of the transformation the</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.390" end="01:40:48.900" style="s2">psychological transformation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.830" end="01:40:51.270" style="s2">attendant on an intimate relationship</p>

<p begin="01:40:55.230" end="01:41:00.620" style="s2">when that falls apart chaos ensues and</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.540" end="01:41:04.020" style="s2">that&#39;s why chaos is represented so</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.620" end="01:41:05.280" style="s2">continually in myths and stories and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.020" end="01:41:08.790" style="s2">going to walk you through a bit of that</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.280" end="01:41:11.850" style="s2">more today I talked about the story of</p>

<p begin="01:41:11.850" end="01:41:20.640" style="s2">about the internal representations of</p>

<p begin="01:42:04.920" end="01:42:08.250" style="s2">does not require language and that</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.660" end="01:42:10.080" style="s2">language did not evolve because it was</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.250" end="01:42:12.840" style="s2">uniquely suited to representing thought</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.080" end="01:42:15.420" style="s2">well you you know you can think without</p>

<p begin="01:42:18.690" end="01:42:23.070" style="s2">language well they can operate in</p>

<p begin="01:42:38.250" end="01:42:43.580" style="s2">and it&#39;s a powerful argument by the way</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.050" end="01:42:43.580" style="s2">but it&#39;s seriously wrong</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.820" end="01:42:48.030" style="s2">there is a meaning network outside of</p>

<p begin="01:42:48.030" end="01:42:54.180" style="s2">grounded in and that&#39;s this pre verbal</p>

<p begin="01:43:00.180" end="01:43:06.960" style="s2">know this particular scientist Seyfarth</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.890" end="01:43:10.110" style="s2">talks about our shared history with you</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.960" end="01:43:11.910" style="s2">know higher primates that probably goes</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.110" end="01:43:12.240" style="s2">back 20 million years something like</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.910" end="01:43:14.940" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.240" end="01:43:18.930" style="s2">we split from the common ancestor with</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.940" end="01:43:22.470" style="s2">chimps about 7 million years ago but you</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.930" end="01:43:24.840" style="s2">know lobsters have dominance hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.470" end="01:43:26.160" style="s2">they hardly have a nervous system at all</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.840" end="01:43:28.710" style="s2">which is partly why they&#39;re studied</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.160" end="01:43:31.170" style="s2">quite extensively and so they have a</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.710" end="01:43:34.680" style="s2">social structure and they understand it</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.170" end="01:43:37.190" style="s2">like if one lobster thira lobster to be</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.680" end="01:43:39.450" style="s2">quite a shark to you if it happened and</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.190" end="01:43:41.730" style="s2">you were fighting with another lobster</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.450" end="01:43:43.200" style="s2">and you lost you would remember that and</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.730" end="01:43:46.079" style="s2">the next time you saw that lobster you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.200" end="01:43:47.969" style="s2">scuttle off somewhere else and you</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.079" end="01:43:50.369" style="s2">know that and all the lobsters in an</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.969" end="01:43:53.459" style="s2">area know who&#39;s top lobster and who</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.369" end="01:43:57.599" style="s2">isn&#39;t and top lobster gets the best</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.459" end="01:44:01.409" style="s2">bloody place to be and the best food so</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.599" end="01:44:03.899" style="s2">this dominance issue this cultural issue</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.409" end="01:44:06.749" style="s2">you know the fact that we live in a</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.899" end="01:44:08.579" style="s2">social environment is far deeper than</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.749" end="01:44:10.709" style="s2">people usually consider and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.579" end="01:44:12.149" style="s2">worth considering and that this is what</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.709" end="01:44:13.289" style="s2">you might think of from an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.149" end="01:44:16.859" style="s2">perspective you know you think of</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.289" end="01:44:19.530" style="s2">natural selection as producing evolution</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.859" end="01:44:21.659" style="s2">right well random mutation with natural</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.530" end="01:44:24.780" style="s2">selection but here&#39;s something to think</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.659" end="01:44:27.209" style="s2">about and Darwin knew this but Darwin</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.780" end="01:44:29.010" style="s2">was really smart and the biologists who</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.209" end="01:44:32.399" style="s2">followed in his footsteps even up to now</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.010" end="01:44:35.099" style="s2">have only expanded out a fraction of</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.399" end="01:44:38.939" style="s2">what he had to say you know he was very</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.099" end="01:44:40.379" style="s2">interested in sexual selection now one</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.939" end="01:44:43.559" style="s2">of the things about human beings that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.379" end="01:44:46.619" style="s2">unique is that human females are picky</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.559" end="01:44:48.510" style="s2">majors they&#39;re choosy</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.619" end="01:44:50.219" style="s2">they&#39;re also sneaky because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.510" end="01:44:54.649" style="s2">tell when they&#39;re ovulating and with</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.219" end="01:44:57.300" style="s2">many other female animals you know so</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.649" end="01:45:00.119" style="s2">they have hidden ovulation and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.300" end="01:45:01.949" style="s2">choosy and they tend to choose men who</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.119" end="01:45:05.039" style="s2">are more successful in the dominant</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.949" end="01:45:08.539" style="s2">turkey well they&#39;re there&#39;s a shock I</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.039" end="01:45:10.859" style="s2">mean if you have a choice why not</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.539" end="01:45:13.559" style="s2">if you pick someone who&#39;s at the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.859" end="01:45:14.760" style="s2">of the competence hierarchy well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.559" end="01:45:17.609" style="s2">probably not going to work out very well</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.760" end="01:45:29.010" style="s2">for you and since women bear the burden</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.609" end="01:45:30.479" style="s2">of representation you know when you</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.010" end="01:45:32.219" style="s2">think of a doorman sorry you might think</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.479" end="01:45:34.499" style="s2">well it&#39;s the powerful guy the</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.219" end="01:45:35.909" style="s2">aggressive guy say that rises to the top</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.499" end="01:45:37.609" style="s2">of the doorman it&#39;s hurricane that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.909" end="01:45:41.219" style="s2">true it&#39;s not even true among chimps</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.609" end="01:45:42.780" style="s2">like you can get a chimp tyrunt but then</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.219" end="01:45:44.489" style="s2">what happens is other chimps gang up on</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.780" end="01:45:45.510" style="s2">him and tear him to pieces and they</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.489" end="01:45:48.209" style="s2">don&#39;t do it nicely</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.510" end="01:45:50.339" style="s2">they don&#39;t do it nicely and the chimps</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.209" end="01:45:52.109" style="s2">that tend to maintain their dominance</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.339" end="01:45:54.300" style="s2">for long periods of time have a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.109" end="01:45:56.760" style="s2">wide network of friends roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.300" end="01:45:58.769" style="s2">with whom they engage in reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.760" end="01:45:59.880" style="s2">interactions like grooming and they</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.769" end="01:46:01.740" style="s2">actually pay a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.880" end="01:46:03.540" style="s2">attention to the female chimps who have</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.740" end="01:46:05.670" style="s2">their own hierarchy by the way and to</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.540" end="01:46:08.970" style="s2">the their offspring so they&#39;re like baby</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.670" end="01:46:11.100" style="s2">kissing politicians and so the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.970" end="01:46:15.000" style="s2">it&#39;s raw power that produces dominance</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.100" end="01:46:17.280" style="s2">is a it&#39;s just wrong it&#39;s it&#39;s wrong now</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.000" end="01:46:19.470" style="s2">you know tyrants you know it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.280" end="01:46:21.030" style="s2">damn up unstable business being a tyrant</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.470" end="01:46:23.310" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of people who want to kill</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.030" end="01:46:26.460" style="s2">you plus you know you tend to rule over</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.310" end="01:46:28.410" style="s2">something approximating hell so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.460" end="01:46:30.470" style="s2">that&#39;s bit worse better than being a</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.410" end="01:46:35.550" style="s2">subject in hell but it&#39;s not much better</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.470" end="01:46:37.410" style="s2">so anyway so this social social now so</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.550" end="01:46:41.190" style="s2">what this means think about this for a</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.410" end="01:46:42.420" style="s2">minute so imagine you know imagine what</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.190" end="01:46:44.460" style="s2">I&#39;m telling you bears some vague</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.420" end="01:46:46.530" style="s2">resemblance to the truth I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.460" end="01:46:49.890" style="s2">quite a lot of evidence for it from from</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.530" end="01:46:52.680" style="s2">a biological perspective I mean this</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.890" end="01:46:54.330" style="s2">choosy mating thing occurs with lots of</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.680" end="01:46:56.310" style="s2">species you know there&#39;s this bird</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.330" end="01:46:59.400" style="s2">called the bower bird you got to look up</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.310" end="01:47:01.470" style="s2">bowerbirds man those things are you just</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.400" end="01:47:03.750" style="s2">can&#39;t even believe they exist and so the</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.470" end="01:47:05.340" style="s2">male bowerbird he makes this really</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.750" end="01:47:07.560" style="s2">complicated nest that&#39;s close to the</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.340" end="01:47:10.830" style="s2">ground he weaves it it&#39;s really quite</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.560" end="01:47:14.790" style="s2">nice you couldn&#39;t make one so and then</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.830" end="01:47:17.490" style="s2">he sweeps this yard in front of the nest</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.790" end="01:47:19.190" style="s2">and then he runs around the forest or</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.490" end="01:47:22.560" style="s2">flies cuz he is a bird</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.190" end="01:47:24.480" style="s2">finding pretty things so maybe he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.560" end="01:47:26.790" style="s2">find a nice collection of red leaves and</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.480" end="01:47:28.500" style="s2">so then he&#39;ll take the red leaves one by</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.790" end="01:47:30.210" style="s2">one and fly back to his front yard and</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.500" end="01:47:32.490" style="s2">make a little square you know he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.210" end="01:47:34.410" style="s2">bird so it&#39;s not a great square but he</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.490" end="01:47:35.520" style="s2">makes a little patch of red and he takes</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.410" end="01:47:37.860" style="s2">a look at that and then he goes off and</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.520" end="01:47:39.270" style="s2">finds something blue and and he</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.860" end="01:47:41.490" style="s2">decorates it makes a little piece of</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.270" end="01:47:44.220" style="s2">abstract art in the front of his nest</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.490" end="01:47:46.620" style="s2">and a lot of male bowerbirds do this all</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.220" end="01:47:48.570" style="s2">at the same time and so then the females</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.620" end="01:47:51.270" style="s2">come along they hop on something nearby</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.570" end="01:47:54.000" style="s2">and they kind of look like this checking</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.270" end="01:47:55.620" style="s2">it out and if they&#39;re happy with it well</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.000" end="01:47:57.570" style="s2">then things proceed but if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.620" end="01:48:01.650" style="s2">they&#39;d fly off to someone else&#39;s piece</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.570" end="01:48:03.780" style="s2">of abstract art and if a male piece of</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.650" end="01:48:06.390" style="s2">art is rejected by like three females in</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.780" end="01:48:08.490" style="s2">a row he gets irritated and brushes it</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.390" end="01:48:12.000" style="s2">all off with his wing and then he makes</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.490" end="01:48:13.500" style="s2">another one it&#39;s like God well they</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.000" end="01:48:15.900" style="s2">obviously have a sense of where</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.500" end="01:48:18.690" style="s2">well developed sense of beauty it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.900" end="01:48:21.570" style="s2">cool you know and I guess the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.690" end="01:48:24.750" style="s2">that who knows what the hell the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.570" end="01:48:26.430" style="s2">the female birds like artistic males</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.750" end="01:48:28.260" style="s2">something like that but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.430" end="01:48:30.600" style="s2">thinking about it biologically maybe</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.260" end="01:48:32.640" style="s2">it&#39;s an indication of intelligence right</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.600" end="01:48:35.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a marker of intelligence you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.640" end="01:48:40.050" style="s2">and it&#39;s certainly the case that female</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.040" end="01:48:43.230" style="s2">humans prefer creative men so and no</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.050" end="01:48:44.640" style="s2">wonder of course we wouldn&#39;t be creative</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.230" end="01:48:46.680" style="s2">if that wasn&#39;t the case so then imagine</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.640" end="01:48:49.290" style="s2">that there&#39;s two primary forces of</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.680" end="01:48:51.270" style="s2">evolutionary selection operating on us</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.290" end="01:48:52.710" style="s2">and they&#39;re not really the natural world</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.270" end="01:48:55.380" style="s2">which is what people always think like</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.710" end="01:48:58.050" style="s2">the environment you know the animals and</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.380" end="01:49:00.450" style="s2">the trees and nature but it is nature</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.050" end="01:49:03.330" style="s2">that selected us it&#39;s two other things</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.450" end="01:49:04.980" style="s2">well partly it&#39;s two other things so one</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.330" end="01:49:06.780" style="s2">is the dominance hierarchy the male</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.980" end="01:49:10.440" style="s2">dominance hierarchy is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.780" end="01:49:12.900" style="s2">primary mechanisms of selection so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.440" end="01:49:14.670" style="s2">like well women are faced with a hard</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.900" end="01:49:17.610" style="s2">choice which guy to go after right</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.670" end="01:49:19.560" style="s2">that&#39;s a hard choice well so they do the</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.610" end="01:49:21.770" style="s2">same thing that people do with the stock</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.560" end="01:49:24.600" style="s2">market they outsource the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.770" end="01:49:26.520" style="s2">problem the computational problem to the</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.600" end="01:49:28.560" style="s2">male dominance hierarchy then they just</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.520" end="01:49:30.150" style="s2">let the male Sirk themselves out however</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.560" end="01:49:32.460" style="s2">they&#39;re going to and then they appeal</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.150" end="01:49:34.260" style="s2">from the top and so what that means is</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.460" end="01:49:36.780" style="s2">the dominant male dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.260" end="01:49:39.480" style="s2">itself is a selection mechanism because</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.780" end="01:49:43.650" style="s2">if you fail at it then you don&#39;t leave</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.480" end="01:49:46.920" style="s2">any offspring and so what that means at</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.650" end="01:49:49.950" style="s2">least in part is that we have adapted to</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.920" end="01:49:52.560" style="s2">be better and better at attaining status</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.950" end="01:49:54.570" style="s2">in dominance hierarchies over god only</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.560" end="01:49:57.390" style="s2">knows how long a period of time and that</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.570" end="01:49:59.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean just power you know it</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.390" end="01:50:01.710" style="s2">might mean cognitive flexibility because</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.280" end="01:50:04.560" style="s2">you could imagine dormant its hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.710" end="01:50:06.510" style="s2">a dominance hierarchy be dormant its</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.560" end="01:50:08.250" style="s2">hierarchy see okay so if like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.510" end="01:50:11.400" style="s2">really successful you climb up dominance</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.250" end="01:50:13.530" style="s2">hierarchy a right but you&#39;d be and see</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.400" end="01:50:16.610" style="s2">know if you happen to land it knows you</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.530" end="01:50:19.200" style="s2">just be a failure so then you could say</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.610" end="01:50:20.820" style="s2">the ideal human being is someone who can</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.200" end="01:50:21.990" style="s2">climb to the top of a doorman it&#39;s her</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.820" end="01:50:28.280" style="s2">key no matter what the doorman is</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.990" end="01:50:32.280" style="s2">hierarchy is right so we&#39;ve evolved to</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.280" end="01:50:34.620" style="s2">we&#39;ve evolved such that success across</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.280" end="01:50:37.710" style="s2">the set of possible dominance</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.620" end="01:50:39.300" style="s2">hierarchies is the target and I think</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.710" end="01:50:41.070" style="s2">that&#39;s why we have general intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.300" end="01:50:43.910" style="s2">because general intelligence is a</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.070" end="01:50:46.620" style="s2">general problem-solving mechanism and</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.910" end="01:50:48.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a single factor even like there is</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.620" end="01:50:52.080" style="s2">intelligence is a single factor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.900" end="01:50:58.310" style="s2">it&#39;s not divisible despite what people</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.080" end="01:51:03.360" style="s2">like Robert Sternberg and Howard Gardner</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.310" end="01:51:07.320" style="s2">falsely claimed so and then from the</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.360" end="01:51:09.570" style="s2">female perspective females are the next</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.320" end="01:51:11.220" style="s2">gatekeeper and that&#39;s why they&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.570" end="01:51:12.870" style="s2">Mother Nature took me a long time to</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.220" end="01:51:15.870" style="s2">figure this out why the hell is nature</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.870" end="01:51:18.240" style="s2">feminine in mythological representations</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.870" end="01:51:20.460" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very it&#39;s extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.240" end="01:51:22.500" style="s2">common mother nature you don&#39;t think a</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.460" end="01:51:24.990" style="s2">father nature you think of mother nature</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.500" end="01:51:31.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like why well nature brings forth</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.990" end="01:51:34.020" style="s2">new forms so that&#39;s feminine and nature</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.230" end="01:51:35.900" style="s2">select in fact that&#39;s the definition of</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.020" end="01:51:39.930" style="s2">nature from a Darwinian perspective</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.900" end="01:51:43.860" style="s2">nature is that which selects women</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.930" end="01:51:46.620" style="s2">select their nature and that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.860" end="01:51:50.150" style="s2">why far more men than you might think</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.620" end="01:51:54.030" style="s2">like far more are terrified of women</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.150" end="01:51:59.460" style="s2">because to be rejected as a romantic</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.030" end="01:52:06.060" style="s2">partner by a woman is to be classified</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.460" end="01:52:10.110" style="s2">as vaguely acceptable life form huh no</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.060" end="01:52:13.140" style="s2">value in propagating it though right so</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.110" end="01:52:16.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a major major rejection and you</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.140" end="01:52:19.340" style="s2">know I&#39;ve had dozens of clients and many</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.800" end="01:52:21.510" style="s2">many people write to me whose primary</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.340" end="01:52:23.730" style="s2">problem is that they&#39;re so terrified of</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.510" end="01:52:28.770" style="s2">women they can&#39;t even approach them very</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.730" end="01:52:31.380" style="s2">very very common so all right I want to</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.770" end="01:52:33.980" style="s2">show you this little triangle thing this</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.380" end="01:52:33.980" style="s2">is kind of cool</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.760" end="01:53:48.370" style="s2">go yet so no no nonverbal right</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.720" end="01:53:49.540" style="s2">nonverbal so what happened well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.370" end="01:53:52.830" style="s2">mother triangle</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.540" end="01:54:00.370" style="s2">I would guess and mutter triangle has</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.830" end="01:54:02.500" style="s2">circle as a child and triangle is maybe</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.370" end="01:54:10.300" style="s2">a friend but not one that&#39;s very welcome</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.500" end="01:54:12.690" style="s2">according to mother and child Circle</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.300" end="01:54:16.420" style="s2">goes out to try to play with triangle</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.690" end="01:54:17.680" style="s2">child and mother doesn&#39;t like that so</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.420" end="01:54:18.970" style="s2">she goes out there and pecks the hell</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.680" end="01:54:23.650" style="s2">out of her out of him</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.970" end="01:54:27.280" style="s2">chases him away pushes child circle back</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.650" end="01:54:29.500" style="s2">into the home and goes into the home and</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.280" end="01:54:30.040" style="s2">then child circle isn&#39;t very happy about</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.500" end="01:54:32.110" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.040" end="01:54:35.860" style="s2">it&#39;s running around causing trouble and</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.110" end="01:54:37.690" style="s2">it manages to escape and then bad child</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.860" end="01:54:39.220" style="s2">triangle shows up and they play together</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.690" end="01:54:40.690" style="s2">and run around and run around and round</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.220" end="01:54:43.150" style="s2">around and run around with mother</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.690" end="01:54:45.880" style="s2">chasing them and then they well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.150" end="01:54:48.010" style="s2">they elope who knows and then mother</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.880" end="01:54:52.810" style="s2">triangle has a fit and blows down the</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.010" end="01:54:54.520" style="s2">house right it&#39;s obvious reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.810" end="01:54:59.200" style="s2">would you consider that a reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.520" end="01:55:01.060" style="s2">story about what happened perhaps you</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.200" end="01:55:04.510" style="s2">had other interpretations but I suspect</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.060" end="01:55:06.010" style="s2">they were vaguely along that line well</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.510" end="01:55:07.989" style="s2">but the point here in this is the point</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.010" end="01:55:09.850" style="s2">of this experiment is how much</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.989" end="01:55:11.920" style="s2">information do you need from which to</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.850" end="01:55:15.160" style="s2">derive a narrative and the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.920" end="01:55:17.560" style="s2">like none it just it&#39;s just immediate</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.160" end="01:55:20.160" style="s2">you you can watch some triangles moving</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.560" end="01:55:24.670" style="s2">around a box and instantly you</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.160" end="01:55:27.070" style="s2">personalize it and that&#39;s because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.670" end="01:55:30.010" style="s2">what you&#39;re like and the reason you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.070" end="01:55:34.150" style="s2">like that is because your environment</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.010" end="01:55:36.610" style="s2">isn&#39;t nature your environment is culture</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.150" end="01:55:40.140" style="s2">your environment is other people other</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.610" end="01:55:42.400" style="s2">people and that was even more true for</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.140" end="01:55:45.100" style="s2">chimpanzees and so forth and especially</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.400" end="01:55:46.900" style="s2">animals that had a limited diet like</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.100" end="01:55:50.020" style="s2">like gorillas they pretty much only eat</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.900" end="01:55:53.350" style="s2">like leaves you know a chimp spends like</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.020" end="01:55:54.790" style="s2">12 hours a day chewing and</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.350" end="01:55:57.580" style="s2">that&#39;s where they have a gut like this</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.790" end="01:55:58.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like you can&#39;t eat leaves you know</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.580" end="01:56:00.370" style="s2">have you tried</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.660" end="01:56:01.540" style="s2">they have no nutrition so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.370" end="01:56:04.840" style="s2">gonna eat leaves you have to eat a lot</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.540" end="01:56:08.110" style="s2">of them and then it takes like three</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.840" end="01:56:09.520" style="s2">months to digest them and so what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.110" end="01:56:12.040" style="s2">done and this is pretty cool because</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.520" end="01:56:14.800" style="s2">we&#39;re so smart is that we&#39;ve traded gut</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.040" end="01:56:17.740" style="s2">for brain and that&#39;s why we&#39;re so svelte</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.800" end="01:56:19.630" style="s2">and the way we manage that it appears is</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.740" end="01:56:22.840" style="s2">that we learned how to use fire to cook</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.630" end="01:56:24.400" style="s2">things and that meant that we had high</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.840" end="01:56:26.020" style="s2">quality nutrition much higher it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.400" end="01:56:29.080" style="s2">easier to digest cooked things</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.020" end="01:56:31.150" style="s2">especially meat and so because we</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.080" end="01:56:33.460" style="s2">invented fire we didn&#39;t have to have so</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.150" end="01:56:36.730" style="s2">much intestine and we could spend a</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.460" end="01:56:38.890" style="s2">little more time on the brain so human</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.730" end="01:56:40.900" style="s2">beings really are fire users we invented</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.890" end="01:56:43.420" style="s2">fire or discovered it or whatever man</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.900" end="01:56:47.140" style="s2">mastered it at least a couple of million</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.420" end="01:56:51.780" style="s2">years ago a long time so that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.140" end="01:56:56.800" style="s2">pretty cool as far as I&#39;m concerned so</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.780" end="01:56:58.630" style="s2">that&#39;s partly how you think and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.800" end="01:57:00.820" style="s2">naturally how you think you think a</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.630" end="01:57:02.410" style="s2">certain way and so we&#39;ll say that your</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.820" end="01:57:04.630" style="s2">fundamental architecture is social</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.410" end="01:57:07.750" style="s2">cognitive you tend to view the world as</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.630" end="01:57:09.730" style="s2">if it&#39;s personified and the reason for</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.750" end="01:57:12.040" style="s2">that is that the world in which you</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.730" end="01:57:14.080" style="s2">emerged as a being was primarily social</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.040" end="01:57:15.970" style="s2">and what you needed to know was who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.080" end="01:57:17.620" style="s2">the big primate who&#39;s the little primate</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.970" end="01:57:19.960" style="s2">and who&#39;s related to who and you know</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.620" end="01:57:23.170" style="s2">among chimps if a big chimp is</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.960" end="01:57:24.490" style="s2">threatened by a small chimp well you</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.170" end="01:57:27.130" style="s2">know the big chimp could just tear the</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.490" end="01:57:30.160" style="s2">small chimp apart but the big chimp will</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.130" end="01:57:33.160" style="s2">back off if it knows that the little</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.160" end="01:57:36.070" style="s2">chimp is associated with some really big</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.160" end="01:57:38.200" style="s2">chimps and so the little chimp can bully</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.070" end="01:57:40.750" style="s2">the big chimp because it&#39;s part of a</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.200" end="01:57:42.910" style="s2">dominant family and that&#39;s because the</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.750" end="01:57:45.070" style="s2">nervous system of the big chimp doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.910" end="01:57:46.900" style="s2">respond to the little chimp like a</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.070" end="01:57:49.810" style="s2">little chimp it responds to the little</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.900" end="01:57:52.300" style="s2">chimp like it&#39;s a little chimp with four</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.810" end="01:57:55.030" style="s2">great monsters attached to it because</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.300" end="01:57:57.640" style="s2">it&#39;s true so it&#39;s nervous system is</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.030" end="01:58:00.640" style="s2">actually responding to the network</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.640" end="01:58:01.870" style="s2">around the chimp and so that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.640" end="01:58:03.250" style="s2">what you well it&#39;s not exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.870" end="01:58:06.700" style="s2">you&#39;re like cuz you&#39;re not chimps but</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.250" end="01:58:07.240" style="s2">you know it&#39;s that kind of platform that</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.700" end="01:58:09.580" style="s2">constant</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.240" end="01:58:14.170" style="s2">it&#39;s the evolutionary underpinnings of</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.580" end="01:58:16.720" style="s2">your psyche so what does that mean well</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.170" end="01:58:19.270" style="s2">it means this is like perfectly fine to</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.720" end="01:58:22.120" style="s2">us right can animate things we can hit</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.270" end="01:58:24.000" style="s2">rabbits are people no problem will go</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.120" end="01:58:26.770" style="s2">along with that</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.000" end="01:58:29.080" style="s2">you remember Roger Rabbit I presume most</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.770" end="01:58:31.420" style="s2">of you&#39;ve watched that so this is the</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.080" end="01:58:33.490" style="s2">detective whose name I don&#39;t remember he</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.420" end="01:58:35.500" style="s2">has to go to toontown because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.490" end="01:58:38.020" style="s2">cartoons and there&#39;s people and you know</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.500" end="01:58:39.190" style="s2">they share the same world and you can go</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.020" end="01:58:41.260" style="s2">to toontown although it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.190" end="01:58:43.270" style="s2">annoying because cartoon figures are</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.260" end="01:58:45.250" style="s2">kind of annoying like there&#39;s slapstick</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.270" end="01:58:48.030" style="s2">types and so he&#39;s not very happy to be</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.250" end="01:58:51.340" style="s2">there and this is what it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.030" end="01:58:55.000" style="s2">right everything is animated meaning</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.340" end="01:58:58.180" style="s2">alive anima means soul by the way so</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.000" end="01:58:59.340" style="s2">everything has a personality and you</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.180" end="01:59:02.350" style="s2">know when you&#39;re reading books to kids</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.340" end="01:59:04.630" style="s2">the son has a personality train has a</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.350" end="01:59:05.950" style="s2">personality jet has a personality</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.630" end="01:59:08.050" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter what it is it has a</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.950" end="01:59:09.520" style="s2">personality and that&#39;s because the child</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.050" end="01:59:11.740" style="s2">is learning to understand the world</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.520" end="01:59:13.750" style="s2">using the architecture of social</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.740" end="01:59:14.980" style="s2">cognitive architecture and so and the</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.750" end="01:59:17.440" style="s2">thing that&#39;s really interesting about</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.980" end="01:59:19.150" style="s2">that this just blows me away you know</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.440" end="01:59:21.220" style="s2">evolution is conservative and so once</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.150" end="01:59:21.790" style="s2">it&#39;s produced something it has to build</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.220" end="01:59:25.390" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.790" end="01:59:28.510" style="s2">it&#39;s like dass the operating system it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.390" end="01:59:30.820" style="s2">like really it&#39;s still there if I</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.510" end="01:59:32.470" style="s2">remember correctly under Windows 10 you</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.820" end="01:59:35.110" style="s2">can&#39;t get rid of the damn thing because</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.470" end="01:59:38.080" style="s2">it&#39;s part it&#39;s part of the structure now</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.110" end="01:59:40.270" style="s2">and it&#39;s like the keyboards we use which</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.080" end="01:59:42.670" style="s2">were actually designed to slow typers</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.270" end="01:59:44.530" style="s2">down because with mechanical typewriters</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.670" end="01:59:46.960" style="s2">if you type too fast the keys would jam</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.530" end="01:59:49.360" style="s2">so they divine devise the keyboard to</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.960" end="01:59:52.600" style="s2">slow you down and we still use it which</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.360" end="01:59:55.480" style="s2">is stupid you know you want the high</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.600" end="01:59:57.640" style="s2">frequency letters close to your middle</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.480" end="01:59:59.380" style="s2">fingers that isn&#39;t what it&#39;s like at all</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.640" end="02:00:02.470" style="s2">but we can&#39;t change it because everyone</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.380" end="02:00:05.020" style="s2">uses it so your body plan that thing is</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.470" end="02:00:08.550" style="s2">been around a long time man if you look</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.020" end="02:00:11.140" style="s2">at mammals particularly but even lizards</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.550" end="02:00:12.850" style="s2">there&#39;s so much like us in their in</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.140" end="02:00:14.410" style="s2">their skeletal structure that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.850" end="02:00:18.840" style="s2">mind-boggling you know and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.410" end="02:00:20.560" style="s2">variants of this same symmetrical</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.840" end="02:00:25.600" style="s2">four-legged</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.560" end="02:00:27.400" style="s2">mouth here structure and so you have to</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.600" end="02:00:29.800" style="s2">build in what you have and if you have a</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.400" end="02:00:31.360" style="s2">social cognitive architecture then you</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.800" end="02:00:33.250" style="s2">have to first understand the world</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.360" end="02:00:35.410" style="s2">through the social cognitive categories</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.250" end="02:00:37.720" style="s2">and what&#39;s so bloody strange about that</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.410" end="02:00:39.670" style="s2">is it actually seems to work we actually</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.720" end="02:00:42.640" style="s2">seem to develop a coherent</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.670" end="02:00:45.550" style="s2">representation of being I would say of</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.640" end="02:00:47.800" style="s2">being that&#39;s not the same as nature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.550" end="02:00:49.060" style="s2">not the same as the world because when</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.800" end="02:00:51.220" style="s2">we think of the world we think of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.060" end="02:00:52.840" style="s2">objective world and I&#39;m not talking</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.220" end="02:00:54.640" style="s2">about the objective world I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.840" end="02:00:56.730" style="s2">about the world of human experience and</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.640" end="02:00:58.930" style="s2">we see that through social cognitive</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.730" end="02:01:01.600" style="s2">filter and it makes perfect sense to us</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.930" end="02:01:04.330" style="s2">and it works that&#39;s so strange</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.600" end="02:01:06.700" style="s2">so anyways everything&#39;s got this</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.330" end="02:01:07.390" style="s2">animated nature and we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.700" end="02:01:10.350" style="s2">problem with that</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.390" end="02:01:14.200" style="s2">in fact we actually find it quite fun</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.350" end="02:01:18.310" style="s2">you know people go visit the Disney</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.200" end="02:01:20.440" style="s2">toontown and participate in it and and</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.310" end="02:01:23.550" style="s2">have fun with it and so that shows you</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.440" end="02:01:25.840" style="s2">as well how how natural it is for us to</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.550" end="02:01:30.010" style="s2">to view things this way you know cars</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.840" end="02:01:32.470" style="s2">have faces right designers know that</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.010" end="02:01:34.480" style="s2">they know that people don&#39;t want a car</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.470" end="02:01:37.120" style="s2">with three headlights because like who</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.480" end="02:01:39.910" style="s2">wants to be associated with a three eyed</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.120" end="02:01:41.800" style="s2">monster no one it&#39;s like two eyes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.910" end="02:01:46.390" style="s2">something you could be comfortable with</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.800" end="02:01:48.580" style="s2">and so cars have faces like a BMWs the</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.390" end="02:01:51.430" style="s2">new ones they really look cat-like you</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.580" end="02:01:53.770" style="s2">know and they have sexy curves they do</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.430" end="02:01:58.360" style="s2">they do there&#39;s been a more eye studies</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.770" end="02:02:00.190" style="s2">of that so if you show men photographs</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.360" end="02:02:01.270" style="s2">of attractive women looking directly at</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.190" end="02:02:02.710" style="s2">them there&#39;s a little part of their</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.270" end="02:02:04.660" style="s2">brain called a nucleus accumbens that</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.710" end="02:02:06.520" style="s2">lights up because to have someone look</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.660" end="02:02:09.100" style="s2">directly at you especially if they have</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.520" end="02:02:11.590" style="s2">like a smile is is interpreted as an</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.100" end="02:02:13.480" style="s2">invitation to approach and women they</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.590" end="02:02:15.700" style="s2">have the same damn problem because with</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.480" end="02:02:17.080" style="s2">women because if you go into drugstores</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.700" end="02:02:19.810" style="s2">say and you look at women&#39;s magazines</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.080" end="02:02:22.120" style="s2">they&#39;re all the same they&#39;ve all evolved</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.810" end="02:02:24.010" style="s2">to the same endpoint they all have an</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.120" end="02:02:26.080" style="s2">attractive woman on them all of them and</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.010" end="02:02:27.640" style="s2">they&#39;re looking right out and so when</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.080" end="02:02:30.310" style="s2">women see that they actually see it as</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.640" end="02:02:33.280" style="s2">something to it approach it&#39;s an ideal</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.310" end="02:02:34.600" style="s2">and you know when people say that those</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.280" end="02:02:37.060" style="s2">Beauty ideals are</p>

<p begin="02:02:37.060" end="02:02:41.830" style="s2">but the empirical research some of it</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.100" end="02:02:46.330" style="s2">done here suggests that interacting with</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.830" end="02:02:48.280" style="s2">those images helps that it performs the</p>

<p begin="02:02:54.460" end="02:02:57.790" style="s2">think about it you&#39;re really gonna go to</p>

<p begin="02:03:05.290" end="02:03:09.910" style="s2">that do that to you they will die</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.120" end="02:03:11.620" style="s2">because no one will buy them and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.910" end="02:03:13.780" style="s2">a reason they all turned out the same</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.620" end="02:03:22.570" style="s2">way it&#39;s like they&#39;re just responding to</p>

<p begin="02:03:28.810" end="02:03:32.740" style="s2">will produce this activation in the</p>

<p begin="02:03:38.560" end="02:03:42.310" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why you often see an</p>

<p begin="02:03:50.050" end="02:03:55.060" style="s2">so and you know those are all primary</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.540" end="02:03:57.820" style="s2">real reward representations and they</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.060" end="02:03:59.140" style="s2">produce attraction because part of</p>

<p begin="02:04:08.290" end="02:04:12.790" style="s2">good here I can move towards it and that</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.270" end="02:04:15.820" style="s2">that is what happiness is that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:04:17.380" end="02:04:21.930" style="s2">puts in a whole new problem you got to</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.780" end="02:04:29.230" style="s2">figure out what to do next</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.930" end="02:04:31.540" style="s2">alright so I suggested to you that one</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.230" end="02:04:35.170" style="s2">of the problems that we have the problem</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.540" end="02:04:37.060" style="s2">I would say is not what the world is</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.170" end="02:04:39.250" style="s2">made out of but how we should be in the</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.060" end="02:04:41.260" style="s2">world because we&#39;re alive and how we</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.250" end="02:04:44.980" style="s2">should be well it&#39;s fairly</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.260" end="02:04:46.750" style="s2">straightforward not so much pain would</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.980" end="02:04:48.400" style="s2">be good that&#39;d be good not too much</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.750" end="02:04:51.489" style="s2">anxiety hey we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.400" end="02:04:55.929" style="s2">bored for that little pleasure down then</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.489" end="02:04:59.230" style="s2">some stability not dying that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.929" end="02:05:00.540" style="s2">one that&#39;s a big one and then let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.230" end="02:05:03.699" style="s2">from the Darwinian perspective</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.540" end="02:05:05.080" style="s2">propagating and so that&#39;s what rained</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.699" end="02:05:06.670" style="s2">out and the reason we&#39;re aimed at that</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.080" end="02:05:11.140" style="s2">is you just think about this it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.670" end="02:05:13.960" style="s2">amazing so every single one of your of</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.140" end="02:05:17.890" style="s2">the relatives you have in your ancestry</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.960" end="02:05:21.659" style="s2">every single one of them successfully</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.890" end="02:05:23.920" style="s2">produced a child who successively</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.659" end="02:05:27.449" style="s2">successfully produced a child all the</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.920" end="02:05:30.070" style="s2">way back to three billion years ago</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.449" end="02:05:31.870" style="s2">it&#39;s bloody unbelievable like the</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.070" end="02:05:33.219" style="s2">probability that you exist well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.870" end="02:05:36.070" style="s2">hundred percent because there you are</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.219" end="02:05:38.020" style="s2">but the probability of predicting that</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.070" end="02:05:40.630" style="s2">you would exist you know if you tried to</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.020" end="02:05:42.550" style="s2">predict it it&#39;s like you the chance that</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.630" end="02:05:45.640" style="s2">the chances that you&#39;re here are so</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.550" end="02:05:48.239" style="s2">infinitesimal that it&#39;s just absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.640" end="02:05:51.790" style="s2">mind-boggling think about that unbroken</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.239" end="02:05:55.030" style="s2">sequence of success over literally over</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.790" end="02:05:58.929" style="s2">billions of years god it&#39;s amazing and</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.030" end="02:06:01.320" style="s2">so you have to obviously you have to</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.929" end="02:06:03.550" style="s2">think that there&#39;s a pretty strong</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.320" end="02:06:06.610" style="s2">proclivity for that to happen I mean</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.550" end="02:06:09.510" style="s2">some of obviously was necessity but not</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.610" end="02:06:12.969" style="s2">only that I mean it&#39;s necessary that</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.510" end="02:06:14.770" style="s2">impregnated females have an infant it</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.969" end="02:06:19.120" style="s2">isn&#39;t necessary that they keep it alive</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.770" end="02:06:21.900" style="s2">so you can&#39;t account for that continuity</p>
<p begin="02:06:19.120" end="02:06:25.179" style="s2">merely from necessity you have to</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.900" end="02:06:27.699" style="s2">interject least a small amount of</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.179" end="02:06:29.500" style="s2">consideration that the care that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.699" end="02:06:31.810" style="s2">associated especially with taking care</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.500" end="02:06:35.020" style="s2">of infants because there you know there</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.810" end="02:06:37.000" style="s2">are a lot of work that&#39;s there to tennis</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.020" end="02:06:39.100" style="s2">it&#39;s actually I think it&#39;s manifested in</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.000" end="02:06:41.290" style="s2">the personality trade agreeable to us as</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.100" end="02:06:42.370" style="s2">it looks to be like agreeableness is one</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.290" end="02:06:45.699" style="s2">of the dimensions where men and women</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.370" end="02:06:47.320" style="s2">very most substantially agreeableness</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.699" end="02:06:49.090" style="s2">looks to be like the manifestation of</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.320" end="02:06:50.710" style="s2">the maternal instinct now men can be</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.090" end="02:06:52.900" style="s2">agreeable to because of course male</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.710" end="02:06:54.550" style="s2">human beings take care of children you</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.900" end="02:06:56.860" style="s2">know if you&#39;re a grizzly bear</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.550" end="02:06:58.630" style="s2">female you just chased the damn male</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.860" end="02:07:01.210" style="s2">away because he&#39;ll kill your Cubs that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.630" end="02:07:02.170" style="s2">not so helpful but they&#39;re not maternal</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.210" end="02:07:04.480" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="02:07:02.170" end="02:07:06.610" style="s2">quite the contrary but you know human</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.480" end="02:07:09.010" style="s2">men are pretty damn maternal they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.610" end="02:07:12.370" style="s2">as maternal as women on average although</p>
<p begin="02:07:09.010" end="02:07:14.380" style="s2">some women are less maternal than some</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.370" end="02:07:19.179" style="s2">men because you know the curves overlap</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.380" end="02:07:20.739" style="s2">but but on balance how are we in the</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.179" end="02:07:24.210" style="s2">world well we&#39;re aware of our own</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.739" end="02:07:26.590" style="s2">vulnerability who are aware of our own</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.210" end="02:07:28.239" style="s2">shortcomings let&#39;s say and that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.590" end="02:07:29.679" style="s2">think that&#39;s partly from being a social</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.239" end="02:07:31.989" style="s2">being because people are always</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.679" end="02:07:33.610" style="s2">signaling your shortcomings to you to</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.989" end="02:07:35.620" style="s2">such a degree that you even signal your</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.610" end="02:07:36.850" style="s2">shortcomings to yourself because well</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.620" end="02:07:38.320" style="s2">you might as well fix them before</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.850" end="02:07:41.320" style="s2">someone else points them out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.320" end="02:07:42.910" style="s2">guilt and shame you know when Freud</p>
<p begin="02:07:41.320" end="02:07:44.380" style="s2">called out the super ego the super-ego</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.910" end="02:07:46.390" style="s2">is kind of like the internalized</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.380" end="02:07:49.300" style="s2">representation of the judgmental father</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.390" end="02:07:52.330" style="s2">and culture I think is represented as a</p>

<p begin="02:07:52.330" end="02:07:55.989" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually oh it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.310" end="02:07:58.150" style="s2">quite a bit like there is an all-seeing</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.989" end="02:07:59.739" style="s2">eye that&#39;s always watching you it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="02:08:03.300" end="02:08:08.260" style="s2">which is more or less eternal is</p>

<p begin="02:08:08.260" end="02:08:14.140" style="s2">and it&#39;s judging you all the time and we</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.160" end="02:08:16.030" style="s2">know that if you put people in a room</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.140" end="02:08:17.050" style="s2">and you put a big eye on the wall you</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.030" end="02:08:19.750" style="s2">know that you give them an opportunity</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.050" end="02:08:22.300" style="s2">to cheat on some little Chiti thing you</p>
<p begin="02:08:19.750" end="02:08:23.560" style="s2">know nothing too important if they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.300" end="02:08:24.940" style="s2">the room with the big eye they&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.560" end="02:08:28.210" style="s2">likely to cheat if they&#39;re in the room</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.940" end="02:08:29.710" style="s2">with no eye at all so you know and what</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.210" end="02:08:31.239" style="s2">do you do you keep an eye on your kids</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.710" end="02:08:32.980" style="s2">and the reason you do that is so they</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.239" end="02:08:35.500" style="s2">don&#39;t misbehave and we keep an eye on</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.980" end="02:08:37.870" style="s2">each other and so we have a</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.500" end="02:08:39.510" style="s2">representation of that and as far as I</p>
<p begin="02:08:37.870" end="02:08:42.580" style="s2">can tell we represent it as a</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.510" end="02:08:46.570" style="s2">transcendent figure of judgment and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.580" end="02:08:56.100" style="s2">like yeah it&#39;s hey that&#39;s a pretty good</p>
