<p begin="00:10:15.410" end="00:10:22.910" style="s2">ready to emerge and to take to take</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.520" end="00:10:23.420" style="s2">center stage to steal and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.910" end="00:10:28.730" style="s2">you occur</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.420" end="00:10:30.920" style="s2">I think the danger right now is the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.730" end="00:10:33.560" style="s2">wrong one gets in I wrong as the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.920" end="00:10:35.990" style="s2">word but a creepy one but ending it will</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.560" end="00:10:40.040" style="s2">because the one that&#39;s currently doing a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.990" end="00:10:41.180" style="s2">good job of going in the I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.040" end="00:10:42.620" style="s2">what you would call it but the one that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.180" end="00:10:45.590" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing unfolding all over the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.620" end="00:10:48.590" style="s2">place this redemption lists godless</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.590" end="00:10:50.870" style="s2">religion that&#39;s doing all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.590" end="00:10:52.670" style="s2">people do in religions and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.870" end="00:10:54.410" style="s2">it&#39;s bowing and scraping and getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.670" end="00:10:56.180" style="s2">together and trying to get all those</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.410" end="00:10:59.510" style="s2">things that people have in religions but</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.180" end="00:11:03.380" style="s2">ultimately it doesn&#39;t seem to have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.510" end="00:11:08.140" style="s2">redemptive and creative aspects mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.380" end="00:11:11.690" style="s2">right yes and so I mean we see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.140" end="00:11:14.870" style="s2">secularized religion right now very</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.690" end="00:11:16.970" style="s2">powerfully and that&#39;s because there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.870" end="00:11:19.850" style="s2">I want to be very careful here there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.970" end="00:11:22.820" style="s2">important goals that need to be pursued</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.850" end="00:11:26.060" style="s2">and I&#39;m not trying to criticize the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.820" end="00:11:28.160" style="s2">pursuit of those goals but if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.060" end="00:11:30.380" style="s2">allow me an analogy I was brought up in</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:32.600" style="s2">fundamentalist Christianity and had it</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.380" end="00:11:34.760" style="s2">had the noblest of goals which was to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.600" end="00:11:36.920" style="s2">save my soul from eternal damnation and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.760" end="00:11:39.170" style="s2">in the name of those normal goals it</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.920" end="00:11:41.570" style="s2">framed meaning in such a way that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.170" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">deeply traumatizing to me as it tried to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.570" end="00:11:46.790" style="s2">pursue those goals and so we have to not</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:49.730" style="s2">get overly fixated on the goals that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.790" end="00:11:51.320" style="s2">were perceiving to the exclusion of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.730" end="00:11:52.820" style="s2">way in which for framing the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.320" end="00:11:54.980" style="s2">those goals I talked a lot about that in</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.820" end="00:11:56.660" style="s2">my series how do you frame a problem is</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.980" end="00:11:59.510" style="s2">way more important than how you</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.660" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">immediately try to solve it and so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.510" end="00:12:03.820" style="s2">think you&#39;re right I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:05.930" style="s2">should be putting a lot more emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.820" end="00:12:08.330" style="s2">I&#39;ll pick up on your word to cure of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.930" end="00:12:10.640" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me we should be putting a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.330" end="00:12:12.080" style="s2">lot more emphasis on practices that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.640" end="00:12:14.240" style="s2">bring them about Redemption or what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.080" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">would call transformation or self</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.240" end="00:12:20.390" style="s2">transcendence or allow people to aspire</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:24.470" style="s2">and if you take a look at the movements</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.390" end="00:12:26.630" style="s2">that are extant right now which have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.470" end="00:12:28.670" style="s2">particular version of politics and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.630" end="00:12:30.590" style="s2">they&#39;ve can also try to convince us that</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.670" end="00:12:33.950" style="s2">that&#39;s the only version of politics that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.590" end="00:12:36.110" style="s2">means politics if you took a took a look</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.950" end="00:12:36.990" style="s2">at those the the practice they basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.110" end="00:12:39.390" style="s2">offer</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.990" end="00:12:41.190" style="s2">political sort of conflict a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.390" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">demonstration the seizing of power</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.190" end="00:12:46.290" style="s2">mm-hmm and if you allow me one more</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:49.290" style="s2">thing and then I&#39;ll pass things back to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.290" end="00:12:52.680" style="s2">you I mean I&#39;ve done quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.290" end="00:12:55.320" style="s2">history in university and i centered a</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.680" end="00:12:57.450" style="s2">lot on political revolutions and I came</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.320" end="00:12:58.860" style="s2">away that with the conviction that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.450" end="00:13:00.980" style="s2">political revolutions the French</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.860" end="00:13:04.980" style="s2">Revolution and the Russian Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.980" end="00:13:08.850" style="s2">Chinese Revolution they always promised</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.980" end="00:13:11.370" style="s2">that their their one main transformative</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.850" end="00:13:13.440" style="s2">action the revolution is going to bring</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.370" end="00:13:15.380" style="s2">about the new man the new human society</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.440" end="00:13:20.130" style="s2">the new human being the new wave and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.380" end="00:13:23.730" style="s2">inevitably that fails those fail whereas</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.130" end="00:13:26.640" style="s2">things like the axial revolution or the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.730" end="00:13:28.140" style="s2">combination of the Renaissance and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.640" end="00:13:30.990" style="s2">Reformation and the Scientific</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.140" end="00:13:33.660" style="s2">Revolution brought about profound</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.990" end="00:13:35.670" style="s2">transformations that literally and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.660" end="00:13:37.980" style="s2">mean it&#39;s very strongly altered the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.670" end="00:13:39.750" style="s2">cultural cognitive grammar so new ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.980" end="00:13:41.370" style="s2">of being are possible and I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.750" end="00:13:43.850" style="s2">interested in what you might what Zac</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.370" end="00:13:46.230" style="s2">Stein has labeled and he actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.850" end="00:13:47.370" style="s2">attributed this to me in a recent</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.230" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">conversation I had with them I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.370" end="00:13:51.660" style="s2">interested in the meta political level</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:54.209" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in the level that makes</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.660" end="00:13:56.640" style="s2">new forms of cognition culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.209" end="00:14:00.660" style="s2">communitas character building possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.640" end="00:14:03.209" style="s2">for human beings such that the way in</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.660" end="00:14:05.370" style="s2">which we undertake our political</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.209" end="00:14:08.360" style="s2">endeavors for our political goals has a</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.370" end="00:14:10.680" style="s2">more viable chance of escaping the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.360" end="00:14:14.339" style="s2">structures that basically strangle it</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.680" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">right now and so that&#39;s that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.339" end="00:14:21.570" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to propose so I have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:23.370" style="s2">question for you which is how did you do</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.570" end="00:14:24.360" style="s2">what you do I mean that&#39;s and I&#39;m asking</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.370" end="00:14:26.070" style="s2">you now almost like a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.360" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">scientist because I&#39;m really interested</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.070" end="00:14:32.279" style="s2">I mean I do a lot of work on insight and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">creativity and you know and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.279" end="00:14:35.940" style="s2">familiar with my series so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.600" end="00:14:37.890" style="s2">I&#39;m really interested in how people move</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.940" end="00:14:38.820" style="s2">from propositional through to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.890" end="00:14:41.730" style="s2">perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.820" end="00:14:43.380" style="s2">right down to participatory knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.730" end="00:14:45.089" style="s2">man when you&#39;re listening to your song</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.380" end="00:14:48.420" style="s2">you can like feel it in your bones right</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.089" end="00:14:50.130" style="s2">and then so it&#39;s just exemplifying so</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.420" end="00:14:51.570" style="s2">many things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.130" end="00:14:53.520" style="s2">knocking about and you started with</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.570" end="00:14:55.740" style="s2">basically just me uttering about a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.520" end="00:14:57.630" style="s2">bathtub of propositions and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.740" end="00:14:59.700" style="s2">turned it into this transformative thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.630" end="00:15:01.350" style="s2">like what like how did how does that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.700" end="00:15:03.810" style="s2">happen like what does that look like</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.350" end="00:15:06.050" style="s2">inside and I&#39;m not asking this in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.810" end="00:15:08.940" style="s2">fish&#39;s way I&#39;m really I&#39;m really curious</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.050" end="00:15:10.440" style="s2">yeah I guess when I was listening to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.940" end="00:15:12.690" style="s2">your work you you were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.440" end="00:15:15.240" style="s2">describing a lot of what I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.690" end="00:15:16.470" style="s2">and you know when you you kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.240" end="00:15:18.780" style="s2">through the kind of the history of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.470" end="00:15:20.340" style="s2">consciousness and how this led to this</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.780" end="00:15:21.840" style="s2">and how this led to this and how this</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.340" end="00:15:24.920" style="s2">there to this is the same sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.840" end="00:15:27.690" style="s2">building books and it&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.920" end="00:15:31.410" style="s2">macro version of the process I have</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.690" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">undertaken on this journey of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.410" end="00:15:36.150" style="s2">creating this form to the point that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:37.530" style="s2">I&#39;m calling it a psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.150" end="00:15:39.630" style="s2">because that&#39;s what it is and you gave</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.530" end="00:15:41.940" style="s2">me the the language to describe what it</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.630" end="00:15:45.540" style="s2">was because it was specifically trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.940" end="00:15:49.260" style="s2">to do something I had ascertained from</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.540" end="00:15:50.820" style="s2">early like I quit school when I was 16</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.260" end="00:15:52.920" style="s2">but her last exams I did too the only</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.820" end="00:15:54.390" style="s2">revision I did was reading my notes over</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.920" end="00:15:57.060" style="s2">ambient music and playing that when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.390" end="00:16:00.270" style="s2">went to sleep hmm as I was aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.060" end="00:16:02.490" style="s2">the power of music to deliver ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.270" end="00:16:04.410" style="s2">words and embed them you know so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.490" end="00:16:08.310" style="s2">been on that from from a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.410" end="00:16:12.720" style="s2">and in developing the meaning wave thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.310" end="00:16:19.110" style="s2">I was basically wanting to make complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.720" end="00:16:23.310" style="s2">ideas sticky in a way that you know they</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.110" end="00:16:25.260" style="s2">could be and it&#39;s similarly and also</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.310" end="00:16:28.410" style="s2">that they could I could transmit I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.260" end="00:16:30.630" style="s2">trance new ideas into the subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.410" end="00:16:32.100" style="s2">because I was very acutely aware that</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.630" end="00:16:36.420" style="s2">most stuff was happening on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.100" end="00:16:38.010" style="s2">subconscious level stuff in there and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.420" end="00:16:39.840" style="s2">program that subconscious to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.010" end="00:16:42.540" style="s2">what you consciously want to do and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.840" end="00:16:45.150" style="s2">got that from chaos magicians like comic</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.540" end="00:16:47.460" style="s2">books years ago then years before I then</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.150" end="00:16:48.930" style="s2">heard people talking about you know like</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.460" end="00:16:50.900" style="s2">prayer and affirmations and things of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.930" end="00:16:52.860" style="s2">that nature in the same sort of way like</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.900" end="00:16:54.780" style="s2">what you&#39;re actually trying to do that</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.860" end="00:16:56.520" style="s2">and I was making music and I was very</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.780" end="00:16:57.750" style="s2">aware of the power of music to do that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.520" end="00:17:00.150" style="s2">and I was like what if I try to put</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.750" end="00:17:02.010" style="s2">ideas in a way that could communicate</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.150" end="00:17:03.730" style="s2">there so then you&#39;re doing that and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.010" end="00:17:05.949" style="s2">you&#39;re listening to speech</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.730" end="00:17:07.660" style="s2">and you come across Jordan Peterson once</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.949" end="00:17:09.370" style="s2">said something about reading the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.660" end="00:17:11.799" style="s2">and come across across a passage that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.370" end="00:17:13.449" style="s2">glitters yes and it&#39;s like that when I</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.799" end="00:17:15.640" style="s2">find something that I want to turn into</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.449" end="00:17:18.760" style="s2">a song so when I heard you say that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.640" end="00:17:20.679" style="s2">glittered mm-hmm it was very apparent to</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.760" end="00:17:23.410" style="s2">me almost immediately what it sounded</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.679" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">like like what the sound of that was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.410" end="00:17:28.900" style="s2">song and as a full record like whenever</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:30.610" style="s2">I&#39;m doing anyone like I&#39;m listening to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.900" end="00:17:33.160" style="s2">them speak and I can hear what the music</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.610" end="00:17:36.520" style="s2">the compliments that would be in the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.160" end="00:17:38.830" style="s2">that would you want music that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.520" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">like the person and what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.830" end="00:17:42.190" style="s2">and what the intent of the words is</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:44.110" style="s2">because music can describe things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.190" end="00:17:45.370" style="s2">words cannot so there&#39;s no there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.110" end="00:17:48.309" style="s2">than just the words when you hear a</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.370" end="00:17:50.260" style="s2">powerful bit of speech it&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.309" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">just the words because if somebody read</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.260" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">out those words on a piece of paper it</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:55.330" style="s2">would hit differently it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:57.190" style="s2">completely different thing there&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.330" end="00:18:01.720" style="s2">more than just the words in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.190" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">communication right so and I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.720" end="00:18:07.960" style="s2">ensuring this because I&#39;ve got in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:09.580" style="s2">habit I decided to do this experiment a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.960" end="00:18:13.929" style="s2">couple of years back two and a half</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.580" end="00:18:15.700" style="s2">years ago of you and you talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.929" end="00:18:16.870" style="s2">stuff the whole flow state the being in</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.700" end="00:18:19.990" style="s2">the zone thing he talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.870" end="00:18:23.679" style="s2">quite a lot yes yes I&#39;d observed as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.990" end="00:18:24.910" style="s2">music journalist many years ago that</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.679" end="00:18:27.760" style="s2">people would often have a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.910" end="00:18:30.340" style="s2">first album and then their second album</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.760" end="00:18:32.919" style="s2">would suck and the singles around that</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.340" end="00:18:34.179" style="s2">first album the b-sides all the records</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.919" end="00:18:36.040" style="s2">they wrote around that period they would</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.179" end="00:18:38.559" style="s2">all be wonderful second album would suck</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.040" end="00:18:39.730" style="s2">and I figured it was because I figured</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.559" end="00:18:41.140" style="s2">it out it was because they were in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.730" end="00:18:42.820" style="s2">zone essentially they were in this flow</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.140" end="00:18:45.610" style="s2">state they&#39;re in their basements in</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.820" end="00:18:47.919" style="s2">their bedrooms and they Garrity&#39;s every</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.610" end="00:18:50.470" style="s2">day and then the record hits and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.919" end="00:18:53.500" style="s2">record label sends them out and saw and</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.470" end="00:18:54.760" style="s2">they fall out of that space right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.500" end="00:18:55.870" style="s2">then they try to get back into it but</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.760" end="00:18:57.730" style="s2">they don&#39;t know how to get back into it</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.870" end="00:18:58.870" style="s2">and they&#39;re different now they can</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.730" end="00:19:01.270" style="s2">barely remember what they were before</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.870" end="00:19:03.250" style="s2">and it&#39;s multiple pieces as well so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.270" end="00:19:04.630" style="s2">not just them it&#39;s like them and their</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.250" end="00:19:05.980" style="s2">friends and all this type of stuff and a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.630" end="00:19:08.169" style="s2">lot of times they can never find their</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.980" end="00:19:10.090" style="s2">way back there ever and sometimes people</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.169" end="00:19:11.559" style="s2">do it takes years and so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.090" end="00:19:13.540" style="s2">so anyway I thought what if I got in</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.559" end="00:19:15.460" style="s2">that place and just didn&#39;t leave and</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.540" end="00:19:16.900" style="s2">just stayed in there and just kept</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.460" end="00:19:17.530" style="s2">getting deeper and deeper and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.900" end="00:19:20.110" style="s2">into there</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.530" end="00:19:22.540" style="s2">like how sort of magical could it get</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.110" end="00:19:25.800" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been doing that for like two</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.540" end="00:19:28.420" style="s2">years and five months at this point and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.800" end="00:19:31.240" style="s2">every time I sit down and make a new</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.420" end="00:19:33.880" style="s2">record it&#39;s more and more powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.240" end="00:19:36.190" style="s2">closer and closer to what I see in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.880" end="00:19:37.720" style="s2">first moment when I kind of listen to</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.190" end="00:19:40.930" style="s2">the thing and I try and get the fullness</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.720" end="00:19:42.580" style="s2">of the view of what that Orchestra would</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.930" end="00:19:51.760" style="s2">that would that sound what that record</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.580" end="00:19:53.380" style="s2">is that makes what ciri than that but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.760" end="00:19:56.020" style="s2">want to sit here just like jabbering on</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.380" end="00:19:59.920" style="s2">for hours in this in slightly mystical</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.020" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">language well it&#39;s actually very</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.920" end="00:20:04.540" style="s2">consonant I&#39;m you know because I&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:07.330" style="s2">lots and lots of firsthand reports of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.540" end="00:20:10.090" style="s2">people in flow state people having</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.330" end="00:20:13.330" style="s2">mystical experiences people experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.090" end="00:20:16.030" style="s2">she and of course I&#39;ve had these</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.330" end="00:20:17.890" style="s2">experiences myself so what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.030" end="00:20:21.960" style="s2">is very resonant and consonant with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.890" end="00:20:25.660" style="s2">lot of that material so it sounds to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.960" end="00:20:29.220" style="s2">and this this is actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.660" end="00:20:31.960" style="s2">central to it the sort of topic at hand</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.220" end="00:20:33.550" style="s2">it sounds to me like that and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.960" end="00:20:35.590" style="s2">like this adjective but it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.550" end="00:20:37.000" style="s2">it&#39;s the other adjective we know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.590" end="00:20:38.770" style="s2">decided to use right now this sounds</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.000" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">like a very spiritual practice for you</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.770" end="00:20:42.820" style="s2">the way you just described it like</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:44.440" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to set up he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.820" end="00:20:47.110" style="s2">create a psycho technology and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.440" end="00:20:49.570" style="s2">supporting practices that keep you in</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.110" end="00:20:51.400" style="s2">this state of flow so that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.570" end="00:20:53.470" style="s2">sort of grind to a halt but is always</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.400" end="00:20:55.270" style="s2">doing you call the deepening I call it</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.470" end="00:20:57.130" style="s2">like this reciprocal opening it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.270" end="00:20:59.650" style="s2">to me like that&#39;s how you&#39;re organizing</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.130" end="00:21:01.180" style="s2">basically your entire life in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.650" end="00:21:04.150" style="s2">ways and your sense of who and what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.180" end="00:21:06.010" style="s2">are is that is that fair yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.150" end="00:21:08.110" style="s2">found everything you know started with</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.010" end="00:21:10.020" style="s2">that but then the whole life kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.110" end="00:21:12.040" style="s2">gets pulled into that vortex know</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.020" end="00:21:14.800" style="s2">everything that becomes that way and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.040" end="00:21:19.060" style="s2">everything becomes thus more magical and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.800" end="00:21:20.860" style="s2">powerful and serendipitous and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.060" end="00:21:23.260" style="s2">ridiculous like a part of it is this</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.860" end="00:21:26.410" style="s2">indescribable sort of I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.260" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">synchronicities as signposts right more</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.410" end="00:21:30.680" style="s2">synchronous disease I see and the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:32.840" style="s2">ins of the thing I get the more</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.680" end="00:21:36.260" style="s2">the more ridiculous everything is just</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.840" end="00:21:38.870" style="s2">absolutely improbable synchronicities on</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.260" end="00:21:41.330" style="s2">every level and the more there are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.870" end="00:21:43.130" style="s2">better the thing is and if they start</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.330" end="00:21:44.600" style="s2">reducing I can tell that I&#39;m going kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.130" end="00:21:47.030" style="s2">of off the path or what have you and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.600" end="00:21:49.430" style="s2">I&#39;ll readjust something and then I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.030" end="00:21:50.540" style="s2">deeper in again and it really does seem</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.430" end="00:21:52.670" style="s2">- well I don&#39;t you know is one of these</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.540" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">you&#39;re a scientific individual and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.670" end="00:21:55.640" style="s2">just you know you like to work out why</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:21:58.190" style="s2">and so far I&#39;ve just been kind of going</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.640" end="00:21:59.900" style="s2">with it deeper into it and deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.190" end="00:22:01.870" style="s2">and I figure some of the smart people</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.900" end="00:22:04.850" style="s2">will figure out exactly what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.870" end="00:22:07.670" style="s2">yeah oh that&#39;s really cool I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.850" end="00:22:10.730" style="s2">that is actually that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.670" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">because it&#39;s both it puts one one of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.730" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">feet into a scientific literature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:17.960" style="s2">triggering lots of thought about</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:20.030" style="s2">implicit pattern learning and intuition</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.960" end="00:22:24.650" style="s2">formation things like that but it also</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.030" end="00:22:27.190" style="s2">puts another one in the world because I</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.650" end="00:22:30.410" style="s2">lead a mindfulness Sangha or a</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.190" end="00:22:32.450" style="s2">meditation contemplation and they often</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.410" end="00:22:35.030" style="s2">ask me how do you I know what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.450" end="00:22:36.290" style="s2">it right and I give them a version of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.030" end="00:22:38.990" style="s2">something or like what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.290" end="00:22:41.630" style="s2">don&#39;t look so much introspectively in</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.990" end="00:22:43.220" style="s2">yourself and you&#39;re like look in your</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.630" end="00:22:45.260" style="s2">life look for the patterns that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.220" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">disclosing them and other people and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.260" end="00:22:48.620" style="s2">that that&#39;s the place you look and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:50.360" style="s2">notice how you even use that that way</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.620" end="00:22:52.910" style="s2">you you said I noticed when that starts</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.360" end="00:22:54.920" style="s2">to you know dry up there oh and then I</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.910" end="00:22:57.380" style="s2">step back and I sort of start reframing</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.920" end="00:22:58.970" style="s2">so that&#39;s I I think that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.380" end="00:23:01.550" style="s2">I think that&#39;s one of the central</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.970" end="00:23:03.980" style="s2">insights of a lot of these wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.550" end="00:23:06.980" style="s2">traditions that has been lost not by</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.980" end="00:23:08.540" style="s2">sort of kind of a egocentric romantic</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.980" end="00:23:10.790" style="s2">framework we&#39;ve now attached to most</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.540" end="00:23:13.370" style="s2">spirituality that you know the core is</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.790" end="00:23:14.270" style="s2">to look deeply introspect inside and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.370" end="00:23:17.500" style="s2">find the true self</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.270" end="00:23:20.930" style="s2">whereas mostly what&#39;s been happening</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.500" end="00:23:22.790" style="s2">what I hear you saying is no no I got</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.930" end="00:23:25.370" style="s2">this sense of how to be connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.790" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">world and then when I stove into it the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.370" end="00:23:29.690" style="s2">world started to close disclosing itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:32.030" style="s2">and when I veer off that pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.690" end="00:23:34.610" style="s2">disclosure dries up and then I really</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.030" end="00:23:35.900" style="s2">and I keep tracking and tracking and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.610" end="00:23:37.970" style="s2">tracking it sounds like much more of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.900" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">navigational thing that an introspective</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.970" end="00:23:44.400" style="s2">thing is that fair that is because it</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:47.550" style="s2">because it is I liken it to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.400" end="00:23:49.140" style="s2">those high-speed racing video games and</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.550" end="00:23:50.280" style="s2">the faster faster you go and you pick up</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.140" end="00:23:52.410" style="s2">the bonus thing and then something you</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.280" end="00:23:54.420" style="s2">can do no wrong in you but if you think</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.410" end="00:23:57.060" style="s2">about it for a second then you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.420" end="00:23:59.190" style="s2">yeah you have to keep moving you have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.060" end="00:24:01.680" style="s2">completely trust that instinct and Trust</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.190" end="00:24:04.020" style="s2">that connection because you do always</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.680" end="00:24:06.060" style="s2">know but the second you pull yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.020" end="00:24:07.220" style="s2">out and you question that&#39;s when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.060" end="00:24:10.230" style="s2">fuck it all up</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.220" end="00:24:11.700" style="s2">mm-hmm-hmm talk about the I keep saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.230" end="00:24:14.040" style="s2">this the synchronicities a signpost</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.700" end="00:24:15.900" style="s2">thing and the the trusting through ish</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.040" end="00:24:19.110" style="s2">and you always write when if you as your</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.900" end="00:24:21.330" style="s2">intuition ever been wrong depends what</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.110" end="00:24:24.270" style="s2">you mean I mean the problem we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.330" end="00:24:25.800" style="s2">about the word intuition is that we use</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.270" end="00:24:28.110" style="s2">the word intuition when it&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.800" end="00:24:29.670" style="s2">then we use bias and Prejudice when it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.110" end="00:24:34.860" style="s2">goes when the same machinery goes wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.670" end="00:24:35.730" style="s2">that very different do you mean it looks</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.860" end="00:24:38.970" style="s2">like it&#39;s coming from a completely</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.730" end="00:24:40.170" style="s2">different place you know you told me</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.970" end="00:24:42.630" style="s2">more about what the difference feels</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.170" end="00:24:44.160" style="s2">like to you well one of them it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.630" end="00:24:45.450" style="s2">like the system one system two you think</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.160" end="00:24:46.740" style="s2">about the subconscious conscious thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.450" end="00:24:48.090" style="s2">whoever you want to put it one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.740" end="00:24:51.570" style="s2">thing is just you know and the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.090" end="00:24:52.980" style="s2">thing you think so the one strikes you</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.570" end="00:24:54.810" style="s2">if you allow me the language the one</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.980" end="00:24:57.480" style="s2">strikes you almost like as a proposition</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.810" end="00:24:59.220" style="s2">or a representation or a belief where</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.480" end="00:25:01.200" style="s2">the other strikes you more is a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.220" end="00:25:03.240" style="s2">being coupled to the world in the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.200" end="00:25:05.970" style="s2">way connected to the world right way one</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.240" end="00:25:09.150" style="s2">you feel another one you have to kind of</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.150" end="00:25:13.170" style="s2">here somewhere and another one comes</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.530" end="00:25:18.270" style="s2">from up there somewhere I for me up in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.170" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">very distinct I do too I guess I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.270" end="00:25:22.200" style="s2">use the terms a little bit differently</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:23.520" style="s2">but the terms that the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.200" end="00:25:25.980" style="s2">describing that is the thing you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:25:25.980" end="00:25:31.830" style="s2">people&#39;s sense of how their propositions</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.550" end="00:25:33.480" style="s2">are going right is a very different</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.830" end="00:25:35.550" style="s2">sense for how they&#39;re participatory</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.480" end="00:25:37.590" style="s2">knowing their sense of connectedness is</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.550" end="00:25:38.820" style="s2">going right and what I think you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:25:41.640" end="00:25:45.180" style="s2">this is this is borne out by the flow</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.740" end="00:25:46.950" style="s2">research and other such things</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.180" end="00:25:49.920" style="s2">it&#39;s that participatory sense of</p>

<p begin="00:26:10.680" end="00:26:15.270" style="s2">doing is it shifts us out of that it</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.960" end="00:26:17.100" style="s2">gets us into the perspectival and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.270" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">participatory and it&#39;s an inherently</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.100" end="00:26:21.270" style="s2">shared thing we&#39;re all listening it</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.270" end="00:26:24.180" style="s2">think that&#39;s the big key for going</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.620" end="00:26:25.920" style="s2">forward I think that&#39;s the big key for</p>

<p begin="00:26:25.920" end="00:26:33.750" style="s2">it&#39;s this we used to be a participation</p>

<p begin="00:26:33.750" end="00:26:37.560" style="s2">stir all sing and dance together we used</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.360" end="00:26:39.060" style="s2">to all tell the stories together</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.560" end="00:26:40.890" style="s2">everyone had had a fucking verse of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.060" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">Beowulf that they knew and you&#39;d all</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.890" end="00:26:44.430" style="s2">chip in around the fire and at this</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:46.260" style="s2">point in time all of our shared</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.430" end="00:26:48.630" style="s2">mythology has been bought by Disney and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.260" end="00:26:51.120" style="s2">the only way we can participate in it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.630" end="00:26:52.710" style="s2">making memes on Twitter and complaining</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.120" end="00:26:54.180" style="s2">about and making videos complaining</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.710" end="00:26:56.340" style="s2">about what Kathleen Kennedy has done to</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.870" end="00:27:04.620" style="s2">allowed to do is kind of let rage from</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.520" end="00:27:06.900" style="s2">the sidelines yes you can&#39;t participate</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.620" end="00:27:09.810" style="s2">in the cup create in the co-creation of</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.900" end="00:27:13.100" style="s2">our shared cultural mythology and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.810" end="00:27:18.120" style="s2">been the issue and I think going forward</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.100" end="00:27:20.910" style="s2">that&#39;s a big part of how we move forward</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.120" end="00:27:22.920" style="s2">in a useful fashion and do what you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.470" end="00:27:50.820" style="s2">could do is suffer periodically rebel or</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.780" end="00:27:52.710" style="s2">rage and then the Romans doing how did</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.820" end="00:27:55.050" style="s2">you deal with all of that expertly well</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.710" end="00:27:57.750" style="s2">and crush it and turn it against itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.050" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">and divide and conquer you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.750" end="00:28:02.010" style="s2">Christianity came up with a completely</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:04.170" style="s2">alternative way that just the Romans</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.010" end="00:28:06.150" style="s2">kept trying to get their hands on it and</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.270" end="00:30:02.580" style="s2">is cities could take a horrible toll on</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.970" end="00:30:05.640" style="s2">us biologically socially and especially</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.580" end="00:30:09.120" style="s2">environmentally and there&#39;s that to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.640" end="00:30:13.290" style="s2">point now where you know that conformity</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:14.910" style="s2">of thought and action has kind of been</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.290" end="00:30:17.820" style="s2">hijacked completely now so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.910" end="00:30:20.370" style="s2">have these new forms come out of a city</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.820" end="00:30:21.990" style="s2">physically yeah because people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.370" end="00:30:23.700" style="s2">allowed but you now have a situation</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.990" end="00:30:25.260" style="s2">where like you know my seven-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.700" end="00:30:27.480" style="s2">son&#39;s best friend</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.260" end="00:30:29.490" style="s2">to Canada and they play Minecraft</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.480" end="00:30:31.110" style="s2">together everyday and create worlds</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.490" end="00:30:32.580" style="s2">together and a completely in sync and</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.110" end="00:30:34.260" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen each other like a year now</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.580" end="00:30:35.700" style="s2">and now they have other little homies</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.260" end="00:30:36.809" style="s2">from across the world coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.700" end="00:30:38.070" style="s2">they&#39;re all networked together and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.809" end="00:30:40.200" style="s2">they&#39;ll building together and playing</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.070" end="00:30:41.429" style="s2">together and each one does the bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.200" end="00:30:42.990" style="s2">they&#39;re good at and they don&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.429" end="00:30:44.160" style="s2">to discuss it they don&#39;t have to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.990" end="00:30:46.200" style="s2">you&#39;re good at that you&#39;re good at that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.160" end="00:30:47.790" style="s2">they work it out and they all play</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.200" end="00:30:49.230" style="s2">together and build together and create</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.790" end="00:30:51.960" style="s2">together and they expect that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.230" end="00:30:54.660" style="s2">normal it&#39;s completely normal to them</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.960" end="00:30:58.110" style="s2">yeah I saw my son&#39;s grow up with exactly</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.660" end="00:31:01.190" style="s2">the same thing and so it&#39;s possible that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.110" end="00:31:03.929" style="s2">we could have the most dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.190" end="00:31:06.030" style="s2">distributed cognition system in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.929" end="00:31:09.330" style="s2">world you know like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.030" end="00:31:11.580" style="s2">participation we&#39;re having now well when</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.330" end="00:31:14.549" style="s2">people wouldn&#39;t have to live in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.580" end="00:31:17.490" style="s2">toxic proximity exactly we might be able</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.549" end="00:31:20.610" style="s2">to yeah really</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.490" end="00:31:22.500" style="s2">next week I&#39;m moving out to the country</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.610" end="00:31:24.179" style="s2">in Texas a week from today so that my</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.500" end="00:31:25.770" style="s2">son has room to run around and play and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.179" end="00:31:28.320" style="s2">isn&#39;t yeah we&#39;ve talked like a lab rat</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.770" end="00:31:30.450" style="s2">in Los Angeles and I&#39;m not worried it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.320" end="00:31:31.559" style="s2">all because he will be connected to all</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.450" end="00:31:33.150" style="s2">these people they&#39;ll be other paper</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.559" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">friends play with in real life but in</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.150" end="00:31:38.220" style="s2">the other with your life exactly so</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:40.169" style="s2">there&#39;s the possibility I mean this was</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.220" end="00:31:42.360" style="s2">a science fiction novel long time ago by</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.169" end="00:31:44.160" style="s2">Clifford D Simak actually entitled city</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.360" end="00:31:46.320" style="s2">about how what was going to come after</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.160" end="00:31:49.020" style="s2">the city and he foresaw this in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:52.590" style="s2">a brilliant fashion because we could</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.020" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">live physically you know at a level that</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.590" end="00:31:57.330" style="s2">is very conducive to our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:32:00.179" style="s2">heritage you know much more ecologically</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.330" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">and socially structured in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.179" end="00:32:05.280" style="s2">conducive to our psychological and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:07.919" style="s2">environmental well-being while still</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.280" end="00:32:09.900" style="s2">having all of the benefits that used to</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:11.910" style="s2">accrue from civilization and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.900" end="00:32:14.340" style="s2">participation in a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.910" end="00:32:17.820" style="s2">collective dynamic so it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.340" end="00:32:19.710" style="s2">the possibility that you know just like</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.820" end="00:32:21.929" style="s2">there was a fundamental reorganization</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.710" end="00:32:23.669" style="s2">that was happening towards the end of</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.929" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">the Roman Empire after the collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.669" end="00:32:30.929" style="s2">the broad age Empire so when so in</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:32.429" style="s2">socio-economic structures were being</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.929" end="00:32:34.409" style="s2">dramatically altered and then you also</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.429" end="00:32:36.299" style="s2">had new culture emerging we have maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.409" end="00:32:38.230" style="s2">the two of them possible I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.299" end="00:32:40.630" style="s2">want to be too</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.230" end="00:32:42.280" style="s2">ballek especially that with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.630" end="00:32:43.870" style="s2">my own work but the possibility of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.280" end="00:32:46.419" style="s2">kind of religion that&#39;s not a religion a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.870" end="00:32:48.610" style="s2">healthy and redemptive to use your term</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.419" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">version of it being organized with a new</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.610" end="00:32:54.970" style="s2">way in which human beings can actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:57.760" style="s2">inhabit the world biologically and</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.970" end="00:33:00.010" style="s2">socially and environmentally I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.760" end="00:33:04.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a real potential for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.010" end="00:33:06.460" style="s2">kind of change that I&#39;m interested in I</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.600" end="00:33:09.220" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve also you know quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.460" end="00:33:12.880" style="s2">work on the really toxic effects of</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.220" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">urban sprawl on human beings and the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.880" end="00:33:18.520" style="s2">they live and how much was lying on me</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.240" end="00:33:21.520" style="s2">think about how it affects the mind and</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.520" end="00:33:22.600" style="s2">you really clearly you know your window</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.520" end="00:33:24.460" style="s2">you need to see some more fucking</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.600" end="00:33:27.010" style="s2">concrete you see another building that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.460" end="00:33:28.419" style="s2">about as far as your mind can go you</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.010" end="00:33:30.880" style="s2">know if you look out of a window and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.419" end="00:33:32.890" style="s2">can just see you know niceness for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:35.940" style="s2">long you know that&#39;s as far as your mind</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.890" end="00:33:38.230" style="s2">oh yes that&#39;s well so be that simple</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.940" end="00:33:39.820" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a deep relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.230" end="00:33:41.799" style="s2">what we can see in the world and how we</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.820" end="00:33:45.490" style="s2">internalize it into our cognition I</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.799" end="00:33:47.290" style="s2">think I mean cars you know if you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.490" end="00:33:50.410" style="s2">been to the UK or been to a council</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.290" end="00:33:52.390" style="s2">estate but like there&#39;s a reason grime</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.410" end="00:33:55.030" style="s2">music sounds the way it does it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.390" end="00:33:58.179" style="s2">exactly like a council estate harsh</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.030" end="00:34:01.120" style="s2">ragged ugly sort of desperate nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.179" end="00:34:03.040" style="s2">sort of bitter grey thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.120" end="00:34:04.030" style="s2">brilliant because it perfectly reflects</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.040" end="00:34:06.130" style="s2">what it came from</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.030" end="00:34:07.600" style="s2">I find it up in the way music often</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.130" end="00:34:11.290" style="s2">sounds exactly like where it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.600" end="00:34:13.419" style="s2">like west coast g-funk hip hop music</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.290" end="00:34:16.929" style="s2">sounds exactly like what Los Angeles</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.419" end="00:34:19.030" style="s2">looks like this bizarro like beauty</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.929" end="00:34:20.139" style="s2">crossed with all that urban decay this</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.030" end="00:34:21.609" style="s2">one you could look up and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.139" end="00:34:23.770" style="s2">beautiful poetry and you look down and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.609" end="00:34:27.369" style="s2">there&#39;s a guy shooting up smack on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.770" end="00:34:29.470" style="s2">floor yeah hey guys I&#39;m gonna jump in</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.369" end="00:34:31.629" style="s2">you were jamming for about 30 minutes do</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.470" end="00:34:32.919" style="s2">you want to pivot to the QA there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.629" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">good questions coming up or do you want</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.919" end="00:34:36.700" style="s2">to continue jamming I just I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:38.530" style="s2">to ask one more thing from Acura because</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.700" end="00:34:41.290" style="s2">something just came immediately to mind</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.530" end="00:34:44.230" style="s2">and was very salient or glittery as he</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.290" end="00:34:46.619" style="s2">might say to me it&#39;s out there could you</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.230" end="00:34:49.570" style="s2">describe what the music you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.619" end="00:34:51.879" style="s2">that it&#39;s psycho-spiritual geography is</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.570" end="00:34:54.009" style="s2">actually from an emergent culture rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.879" end="00:34:56.230" style="s2">than from a particular geographic</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.009" end="00:34:58.059" style="s2">location do you think is that an</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.230" end="00:35:00.400" style="s2">interesting way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.059" end="00:35:03.549" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about this a lot on</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.400" end="00:35:04.269" style="s2">my streams since Tom Hanks disease</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.549" end="00:35:05.619" style="s2">kicked in</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.269" end="00:35:08.559" style="s2">I&#39;ve been streaming every day and doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.619" end="00:35:10.900" style="s2">sort of gigs and we&#39;ve taken with this</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.559" end="00:35:12.220" style="s2">these sort of memetics kind of emerged</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.220" end="00:36:18.400" style="s2">seem to have in common is a love of</p>

<p begin="00:36:26.490" end="00:36:34.839" style="s2">adventurous spirit of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.150" end="00:36:36.970" style="s2">there&#39;s taken us from well from from</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.839" end="00:36:40.150" style="s2">where we were as you described so</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.970" end="00:36:41.769" style="s2">beautifully in your series and has is at</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.150" end="00:36:45.460" style="s2">this incredible juncture where it could</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.769" end="00:36:48.930" style="s2">all fall apart or we could reach forward</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.460" end="00:36:53.039" style="s2">and grab that that next epoch sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.930" end="00:36:59.890" style="s2">complete transcendence for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.039" end="00:37:03.109" style="s2">moment in human history which is where</p>

<p begin="00:37:03.109" end="00:37:08.009" style="s2">that&#39;s so interesting to me because the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.299" end="00:37:10.259" style="s2">place we&#39;ve gotten to is very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.009" end="00:37:12.329" style="s2">where Augustine was in 410 we wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.259" end="00:37:15.749" style="s2">City of God because he&#39;s comparing the</p>

<p begin="00:37:25.230" end="00:37:29.579" style="s2">that was coming into existence so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.289" end="00:37:31.799" style="s2">really cool that we&#39;ve gotten to this</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.360" end="00:39:31.500" style="s2">a bit longer</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.990" end="00:39:33.030" style="s2">okay cool Tyson you had a question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.500" end="00:39:36.750" style="s2">related to it cured you said you want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.030" end="00:39:39.390" style="s2">I meet your self in asking yeah thank</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.750" end="00:39:42.630" style="s2">you all right so my question was what</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.390" end="00:39:46.590" style="s2">role does danger or knife&#39;s edge miss</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.630" end="00:39:50.400" style="s2">play in creating a beautiful culture or</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.590" end="00:39:56.220" style="s2">riff on other conditions that might</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.400" end="00:39:57.810" style="s2">allow a beautiful culture to emerge well</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.220" end="00:39:59.220" style="s2">I mean I think it depends that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.810" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">wanted to find danger but the only time</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.220" end="00:40:04.170" style="s2">I make anything good is when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:05.430" style="s2">teetering on the edge of danger so</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.170" end="00:40:08.340" style="s2">that&#39;s why I always make sure I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.430" end="00:40:11.730" style="s2">introducing new processes and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.340" end="00:40:12.570" style="s2">technologies and approaches every</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.730" end="00:40:14.790" style="s2">project I do</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.570" end="00:40:16.740" style="s2">I&#39;ll introduce like a new instrument or</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.790" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">something I don&#39;t understand so I&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.740" end="00:40:21.750" style="s2">the edge of my ability to actually do it</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.440" end="00:40:23.880" style="s2">because the second I&#39;m comfortable then</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.750" end="00:40:26.970" style="s2">then the work becomes comfortable and</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.880" end="00:40:29.450" style="s2">greatness doesn&#39;t come from comfort ever</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.970" end="00:40:32.190" style="s2">so you want to be kind of on the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.450" end="00:40:35.040" style="s2">ultra danger at all times when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.190" end="00:40:36.390" style="s2">creating so I suspect it&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.040" end="00:40:40.230" style="s2">same if you&#39;re trying to create you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.390" end="00:40:41.460" style="s2">a whole beautiful world and we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.230" end="00:40:43.110" style="s2">really on the edge of danger right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.460" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">so I think this is the perfect time to</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.110" end="00:40:49.980" style="s2">create that that beautiful thing what do</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:54.600" style="s2">you think John I think that&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.980" end="00:40:57.350" style="s2">I think that if we pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.600" end="00:41:00.840" style="s2">conditions that are conducive to flow</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.350" end="00:41:05.040" style="s2">one of the things that is an important</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.840" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">predictor of the flow state is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.040" end="00:41:11.760" style="s2">importance of error error has to cost</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:14.100" style="s2">error has to matter and so if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.760" end="00:41:15.870" style="s2">situations in which error doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.100" end="00:41:18.390" style="s2">and I guess that&#39;s one way of describing</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.870" end="00:41:21.000" style="s2">danger danger is a situation in which</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.390" end="00:41:24.570" style="s2">error matters then you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.000" end="00:41:27.000" style="s2">get into the flow state so I I try to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.570" end="00:41:28.220" style="s2">the same thing when I&#39;m talking with</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.000" end="00:41:33.530" style="s2">people or</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.220" end="00:41:37.010" style="s2">I&#39;m lecturing I try to put myself into</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.530" end="00:41:39.890" style="s2">situations where that can matter and in</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.010" end="00:41:41.990" style="s2">connection with that we know that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.890" end="00:41:44.349" style="s2">disruptive strategy strategies that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.990" end="00:41:48.590" style="s2">disrupt our normal pattern of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.349" end="00:41:51.710" style="s2">are conducive to insight so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.590" end="00:41:54.140" style="s2">so many cultures have used disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.710" end="00:41:55.970" style="s2">strategies sleepers bring themselves off</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.140" end="00:41:58.070" style="s2">roofs yeah yep exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.970" end="00:42:02.359" style="s2">or cycle is why psychedelics can work if</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.070" end="00:42:05.630" style="s2">properly set and setting so if we mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.359" end="00:42:07.160" style="s2">by danger error matters and destructive</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.630" end="00:42:09.800" style="s2">strategies are indispensable</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.160" end="00:42:12.080" style="s2">and finally that means the environment</p>

<p begin="00:42:12.080" end="00:42:21.470" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s central to trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.820" end="00:42:23.570" style="s2">into the patterns of interaction and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.470" end="00:42:28.160" style="s2">participation that will afford the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.570" end="00:42:30.080" style="s2">emergence of a new culture yeah when I</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.160" end="00:42:32.359" style="s2">was DJing I would always make sure in</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.080" end="00:42:34.790" style="s2">the outside world in the long long long</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.359" end="00:42:36.470" style="s2">ago of pre Tom Hanks disease I would</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.790" end="00:42:38.300" style="s2">always make sure I had a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.470" end="00:42:40.460" style="s2">new records to that I had to play that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.300" end="00:42:42.770" style="s2">hadn&#39;t played before but I wouldn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.460" end="00:42:44.060" style="s2">what deejays often fall into this habit</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.770" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">of just playing the same songs that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.060" end="00:42:48.080" style="s2">know work if I play that then that girls</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:49.790" style="s2">go crazy boom they just do that and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.080" end="00:42:51.230" style="s2">it becomes boring you always have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.790" end="00:42:53.720" style="s2">have this element if you could complete</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.230" end="00:42:56.060" style="s2">the clip of complete disaster for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.720" end="00:42:57.619" style="s2">really magical moments the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.060" end="00:42:59.750" style="s2">magical moments are always the ones</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.619" end="00:43:00.080" style="s2">where you could have completely lost it</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.750" end="00:43:04.580" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.080" end="00:43:09.560" style="s2">I agree trying to get into situations</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.580" end="00:43:11.210" style="s2">where there&#39;s an open endedness what Jim</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.560" end="00:43:12.890" style="s2">cars calls an infinite game rather than</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.210" end="00:43:15.320" style="s2">a finite game I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.890" end="00:43:17.750" style="s2">really central and again it&#39;s hard for</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.320" end="00:43:20.630" style="s2">me to see any other example from history</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.750" end="00:43:23.510" style="s2">of people being able to afford this on</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.630" end="00:43:26.030" style="s2">the scale and forth you know and also I</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.510" end="00:43:29.630" style="s2">don&#39;t mean just social scale I also mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.030" end="00:43:31.190" style="s2">through time cross-generational I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.630" end="00:43:35.240" style="s2">see anything being able to do this other</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.190" end="00:43:41.330" style="s2">than things like religions and so I I</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.240" end="00:43:41.860" style="s2">have no I hope I I have no illusions or</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.330" end="00:43:44.080" style="s2">pretense</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.860" end="00:43:48.310" style="s2">you know this project although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.080" end="00:43:50.740" style="s2">urgent and the changes rapid this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.310" end="00:43:55.180" style="s2">going to be accomplished in my lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.740" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">or anything like that that&#39;s not I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.180" end="00:43:58.840" style="s2">foresee that being the case and I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:44:01.090" style="s2">you&#39;re pretty fast right now or you</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.840" end="00:44:02.860" style="s2">might be surprised I might be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.090" end="00:44:07.380" style="s2">and I&#39;m open to being wrong</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.860" end="00:44:09.640" style="s2">I&#39;m open to being wrong but I also think</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.380" end="00:44:11.800" style="s2">let me express some more as a hope</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.640" end="00:44:14.620" style="s2">I would hope that this took at least a</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.800" end="00:44:17.560" style="s2">generation or two because typically</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.620" end="00:44:19.660" style="s2">cross-generational things matter the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.560" end="00:44:26.410" style="s2">cathedrals took multiple generations and</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.660" end="00:44:32.260" style="s2">things like that so that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.410" end="00:44:37.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s a commitment to something maja</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.260" end="00:44:38.830" style="s2">we undertake things right now it&#39;s it if</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.000" end="00:44:42.340" style="s2">we if we&#39;re really trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.830" end="00:44:46.420" style="s2">something this significant the danger is</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.340" end="00:44:48.460" style="s2">not just or error or demand there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.420" end="00:44:50.050" style="s2">danger that we&#39;re going to confront and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.460" end="00:44:51.550" style="s2">this is a really existential danger</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.050" end="00:44:54.550" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna confront the limits of our</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.550" end="00:44:57.130" style="s2">mortality in a profound way and can we</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.550" end="00:44:59.230" style="s2">keep going can we keep working can we</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.130" end="00:45:01.180" style="s2">keep the commitment not even when our</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.230" end="00:45:05.590" style="s2">mortality gets in the way I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.180" end="00:45:09.760" style="s2">a really important issue yeah I think we</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.590" end="00:45:12.220" style="s2">can but you know I&#39;m an optimist look I</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.760" end="00:45:13.420" style="s2">I tend to attend so pessimistic end of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.220" end="00:45:14.590" style="s2">the spectrum but I&#39;ve been hanging</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.420" end="00:45:16.330" style="s2">around with more optimistic people</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.590" end="00:45:18.280" style="s2">lately so it&#39;s been rubbing off on me</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.330" end="00:45:21.100" style="s2">well the balance is very important we</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.280" end="00:45:24.040" style="s2">need you focus otherwise you know we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.100" end="00:45:24.970" style="s2">be running off hopping around naked in</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.040" end="00:45:26.350" style="s2">the trees thinking everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.970" end="00:45:30.340" style="s2">wonderful and then getting getting</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.350" end="00:45:34.780" style="s2">mucked I&#39;m very optimistic because I pay</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.340" end="00:45:37.750" style="s2">attention to the youth and as many of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.780" end="00:45:39.010" style="s2">the issues that we had they do not and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.750" end="00:45:40.720" style="s2">while they&#39;re currently trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.010" end="00:45:44.770" style="s2">reprogrammed into them I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.720" end="00:45:46.540" style="s2">they&#39;ll take because you know just what</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.770" end="00:45:47.860" style="s2">you see on your own life and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.540" end="00:45:50.860" style="s2">they&#39;ve seen in their own lives and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.860" end="00:45:52.690" style="s2">they believe what what they expect what</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.860" end="00:45:54.550" style="s2">kids under a certain age does expect</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.690" end="00:45:55.330" style="s2">from reality it&#39;s so completely</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.550" end="00:45:56.830" style="s2">different to what</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.330" end="00:45:59.110" style="s2">we did with regards to their potential</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.830" end="00:46:01.000" style="s2">with regards to their ability to create</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.110" end="00:46:04.630" style="s2">with regards to their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.000" end="00:46:07.990" style="s2">manifest what they imagined in the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.630" end="00:46:09.970" style="s2">and like how powerful that is we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.990" end="00:46:12.070" style="s2">even know yet the fact that your average</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.970" end="00:46:13.870" style="s2">seven-year-old has the creative</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.070" end="00:46:16.660" style="s2">capability of Steven spielberger is</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.870" end="00:46:19.720" style="s2">prime with regards to what they can put</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.660" end="00:46:22.030" style="s2">into the world with regards to being</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.720" end="00:46:23.950" style="s2">able to like manifest their imagination</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.030" end="00:46:26.740" style="s2">like every 7 year old on the planet can</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.950" end="00:46:30.540" style="s2">do that so what that what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.740" end="00:46:34.270" style="s2">that they have influence in the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.540" end="00:46:37.470" style="s2">boggles the mind you know if we can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.270" end="00:46:39.580" style="s2">our part and if we can all go 100% and</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.470" end="00:46:43.420" style="s2">stop wasting time and start fucking</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.580" end="00:46:45.730" style="s2">about and fire on all flipping cylinders</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.420" end="00:46:48.850" style="s2">by the time they&#39;re ready to step up</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.730" end="00:46:54.610" style="s2">there will be the framework for them to</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.850" end="00:46:57.790" style="s2">do real magic so I agree with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.610" end="00:47:01.360" style="s2">potential that you said but I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.790" end="00:47:04.150" style="s2">also see because I&#39;m an educator and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.360" end="00:47:07.710" style="s2">see the fact that in many ways these</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.150" end="00:47:07.710" style="s2">called these kids also don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.890" end="00:47:14.170" style="s2">they&#39;ve also lost a lot - yes they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.380" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">lost a lot in terms of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.170" end="00:47:19.120" style="s2">cognitive and collective machinery</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:20.830" style="s2">distributed cognition machinery that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.120" end="00:47:22.660" style="s2">big part of what we have to be right now</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.830" end="00:47:26.350" style="s2">yes that&#39;s what I was going to say and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.660" end="00:47:31.150" style="s2">so I think I mean this is where I agree</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.350" end="00:47:33.040" style="s2">with Zack I think that you know what we</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.150" end="00:47:36.430" style="s2">have to really start blurring the lines</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.040" end="00:47:38.890" style="s2">and this means giving up the way that</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.430" end="00:47:41.770" style="s2">we&#39;ve given sort of the market sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.890" end="00:47:44.290" style="s2">has become the de facto default deity</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.770" end="00:47:45.820" style="s2">for us and what we have to do another</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.290" end="00:47:47.470" style="s2">way the challenge is we have to we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.820" end="00:47:50.380" style="s2">to blur the lines and this is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.470" end="00:47:52.180" style="s2">doing it right now between education and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.380" end="00:47:55.000" style="s2">inculturation and a profound and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.180" end="00:47:57.310" style="s2">comprehensive way and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.000" end="00:47:57.820" style="s2">also part of what needs to be going on</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.310" end="00:48:00.400" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.820" end="00:48:01.990" style="s2">and I even like the genre that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.400" end="00:48:03.550" style="s2">created around there Sakura precisely</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.990" end="00:48:07.330" style="s2">and I mean this as a compliment because</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.550" end="00:48:08.859" style="s2">it blurs that line right you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.330" end="00:48:10.509" style="s2">music and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.859" end="00:48:12.609" style="s2">in in the right side of the word it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.509" end="00:48:15.279" style="s2">entertaining but it&#39;s centered on also</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.609" end="00:48:17.890" style="s2">presenting ideas and meaning that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.279" end="00:48:19.930" style="s2">line between enculturation education and</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.890" end="00:48:21.999" style="s2">entertainment has been blurred and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.930" end="00:48:25.739" style="s2">think - very very good effect I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.999" end="00:48:28.299" style="s2">that&#39;s a very important thing like I</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.739" end="00:48:29.980" style="s2">think the genre in addition to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.299" end="00:48:30.960" style="s2">particular products is an important</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.980" end="00:48:34.210" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.960" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">thank you and I agree I agree</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.210" end="00:48:38.619" style="s2">who&#39;s the thing that needed to exist and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:41.049" style="s2">now it does and lots more of that sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.619" end="00:48:45.249" style="s2">of thing you know will be popping up all</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.049" end="00:48:48.789" style="s2">over the place because now we have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.249" end="00:48:50.499" style="s2">tools previously only a few people got</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.789" end="00:48:53.470" style="s2">to decide what was done with that</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.499" end="00:48:55.450" style="s2">technology yes eyeko technology with</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.470" end="00:48:57.099" style="s2">that potentiality the combination that</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.450" end="00:48:59.849" style="s2">no one talks about that the power of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.099" end="00:49:03.549" style="s2">music and how incredibly powerful it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.849" end="00:49:05.559" style="s2">incredibly persuasive is nobody talks</p>

<p begin="00:49:34.690" end="00:49:39.069" style="s2">when we start integrating the really</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.210" end="00:49:41.140" style="s2">powerful visual stuff and we start</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.069" end="00:49:43.180" style="s2">putting that in a in a sort of augmented</p>

<p begin="00:49:43.180" end="00:49:47.950" style="s2">when people start interacting in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.239" end="00:49:50.680" style="s2">kind of world and it becomes this more</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.950" end="00:49:58.539" style="s2">participation thing they the potential</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.680" end="00:50:00.039" style="s2">is epic baby I&#39;m very excited when you</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.539" end="00:50:02.230" style="s2">said that a Nietzsche quote came to mind</p>

<p begin="00:50:21.800" end="00:50:27.470" style="s2">you had a question about magic yes thank</p>

<p begin="00:50:32.330" end="00:50:37.490" style="s2">up just a little while ago I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.370" end="00:50:40.780" style="s2">to know what role you see magic plane in</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.490" end="00:50:40.780" style="s2">this emerging culture</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.380" end="00:50:47.780" style="s2">John I mean I have thoughts on magic</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.510" end="00:50:51.980" style="s2">I&#39;ll be interested member had you met so</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.780" end="00:50:55.310" style="s2">I did I generally don&#39;t use that word</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.980" end="00:50:57.700" style="s2">precise you&#39;re gonna say that well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.310" end="00:51:00.500" style="s2">because it&#39;s such an equivocal word yes</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.700" end="00:51:03.140" style="s2">so it can mean that you can bend the</p>

<p begin="00:51:03.140" end="00:51:09.260" style="s2">can top into some forces that can never</p>

<p begin="00:51:10.040" end="00:51:14.030" style="s2">and it&#39;s just what you call stuff you</p>

<p begin="00:51:37.760" end="00:51:42.170" style="s2">here i&#39;m making use of daniel O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.260" end="00:51:43.820" style="s2">idea of the social theory of magic right</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.170" end="00:51:46.280" style="s2">and then what they do is they they</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.820" end="00:51:48.800" style="s2">individuate it and they create they do</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.280" end="00:51:51.710" style="s2">sort of riff psycho technologies off of</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.800" end="00:51:55.180" style="s2">those patterns and use that in often a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.710" end="00:51:58.190" style="s2">subversive fashion and that that magic</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.180" end="00:52:00.920" style="s2">affords people often recapturing both</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.190" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">individually and in some sort in some</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.920" end="00:52:06.410" style="s2">kind of subculture small-scale</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:08.000" style="s2">communities right access to experience</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.410" end="00:52:11.120" style="s2">into development that has been shut off</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.000" end="00:52:12.770" style="s2">to them by the overarching religion and</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.120" end="00:52:14.750" style="s2">then what magic tends to do in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.770" end="00:52:16.580" style="s2">sense and the line between magical</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.750" end="00:52:19.400" style="s2">states and mystical states and ritual</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.580" end="00:52:22.880" style="s2">states and meditative States is all very</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.400" end="00:52:24.950" style="s2">blurred but what that typically does is</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.880" end="00:52:27.410" style="s2">if they survive because of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.950" end="00:52:30.320" style="s2">a dangerous thing to do if they survive</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.410" end="00:52:31.880" style="s2">that will typically have generated in</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.320" end="00:52:34.160" style="s2">it&#39;s new cycle technologies new</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.880" end="00:52:36.200" style="s2">practices that then get reabsorbed into</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.160" end="00:52:38.600" style="s2">the religion and so there&#39;s this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.200" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">dialectical relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.600" end="00:52:51.200" style="s2">religion and magic and so insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:54.170" style="s2">human beings are taking taking</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.200" end="00:52:57.310" style="s2">established patterns of meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.170" end="00:53:01.190" style="s2">and doing that sort of thing with them I</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.310" end="00:53:02.780" style="s2">think an anthropologist and I&#39;ve done I</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.190" end="00:53:04.940" style="s2">did anthropology in graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.780" end="00:53:08.210" style="s2">would call that magic I don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.940" end="00:53:10.850" style="s2">term because like I said it has its the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.210" end="00:53:12.920" style="s2">excuse for sloppy thinking it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.850" end="00:53:15.500" style="s2">excuse often for narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.920" end="00:53:17.510" style="s2">it&#39;s these the Buddha once said this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.500" end="00:53:20.000" style="s2">how you will know somebody is not one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.510" end="00:53:25.820" style="s2">my disciples if they offer to perform a</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.000" end="00:53:28.160" style="s2">miracle so all of that stuff I think and</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.820" end="00:53:30.830" style="s2">and there&#39;s good mythological warnings</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.160" end="00:53:33.050" style="s2">against across many traditions that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.830" end="00:53:35.870" style="s2">pursuit of magic is the thing in this</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.050" end="00:53:38.090" style="s2">pejorative sense that is is the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.870" end="00:53:40.520" style="s2">form of bullshitting that will steer us</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.090" end="00:53:42.380" style="s2">away from the cultivation of wisdom so</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.520" end="00:53:46.400" style="s2">that&#39;s why I tend not to use the word I</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.380" end="00:53:49.130" style="s2">tend to reserve the word for its</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.400" end="00:53:53.780" style="s2">cultural associations you know magic as</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.130" end="00:53:56.120" style="s2">that supernatural ability so but I tend</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.780" end="00:53:59.690" style="s2">to instead use the word ritual now</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.120" end="00:54:01.580" style="s2">normative ritual and I&#39;m willing even to</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.690" end="00:54:05.480" style="s2">talk about things being sort of shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.580" end="00:54:09.590" style="s2">rituals because shamanism bridges nicely</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.480" end="00:54:12.230" style="s2">between psychological and distributed</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.590" end="00:54:15.470" style="s2">cognition transformation so I&#39;m happy to</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.230" end="00:54:18.860" style="s2">talk about that but like I said sorry</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.470" end="00:54:22.040" style="s2">I&#39;m going on and on a sore spot but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.860" end="00:54:26.000" style="s2">don&#39;t like to use the word brand what</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.040" end="00:54:27.890" style="s2">destroys magic well see I&#39;ll try I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.000" end="00:54:30.470" style="s2">trying my best to bridge between science</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.890" end="00:54:32.660" style="s2">and spirituality is that such an</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.470" end="00:54:34.670" style="s2">equivocal term that it often fudges and</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.660" end="00:54:37.580" style="s2">smudges rather than building an</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.670" end="00:54:40.490" style="s2">appropriately load-carrying bridge</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.580" end="00:54:41.840" style="s2">between the two so that yeah I like that</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.490" end="00:54:44.030" style="s2">about what you do I think one should</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.840" end="00:54:46.520" style="s2">just you know all of these things fine</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.030" end="00:54:49.880" style="s2">what&#39;s useful in them take that and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.520" end="00:54:51.080" style="s2">know and so don&#39;t you that the aspects</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.880" end="00:54:52.550" style="s2">the only bit of magic I was ever</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.080" end="00:54:54.620" style="s2">interested in because it was practical</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.550" end="00:54:56.240" style="s2">in it felt like it worked was the bit of</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.620" end="00:54:58.550" style="s2">chaos magic which was sigil</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.240" end="00:55:00.200" style="s2">magic which I later worked out the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.550" end="00:55:01.970" style="s2">reason sigil magic works is because</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.200" end="00:55:03.500" style="s2">you&#39;re communicating or feels like it</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.970" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">works what seems to sometimes work is</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.500" end="00:55:07.040" style="s2">because you&#39;re communicating and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:08.360" style="s2">your subconscious quite specifically</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.040" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">it&#39;s the same as the affirmation or the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.360" end="00:55:11.930" style="s2">prayer thing or whatever you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:13.970" style="s2">your subconscious to work on stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.930" end="00:55:16.220" style="s2">then your subconscious which does so</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.970" end="00:55:19.280" style="s2">much of the practical stuff in your life</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.220" end="00:55:21.320" style="s2">you are helping to direct that so there</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.280" end="00:55:23.030" style="s2">is you know there are practical you</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.320" end="00:55:25.010" style="s2">there&#39;s practical application for some</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.030" end="00:55:27.620" style="s2">of the stuff that is a part of so-called</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.010" end="00:55:28.550" style="s2">magic Oh profoundly I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.620" end="00:55:31.280" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the right</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.550" end="00:55:36.200" style="s2">I think enacted symbols within ritual</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.280" end="00:55:38.450" style="s2">practice to access and activate aspects</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.200" end="00:55:39.830" style="s2">of unconscious both within us and</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.450" end="00:55:43.640" style="s2">without us</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.830" end="00:55:47.390" style="s2">processing cognitive processing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.640" end="00:55:51.320" style="s2">can&#39;t be accessed otherwise and so I</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.390" end="00:55:54.500" style="s2">think we often find that these symbols</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.320" end="00:55:56.720" style="s2">are indispensable to us the confusion</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.500" end="00:55:59.810" style="s2">that we fall into I would argue is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.720" end="00:56:02.120" style="s2">we confuse that indispensability with</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.810" end="00:56:04.790" style="s2">having discovered some metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.120" end="00:56:07.070" style="s2">necessary structure of reality and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.790" end="00:56:09.350" style="s2">think that&#39;s often a mistake again the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.070" end="00:56:11.420" style="s2">argument that bears against that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.350" end="00:56:15.290" style="s2">metaphysical claim is the massive</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.420" end="00:56:17.930" style="s2">pluralism we find in rituals and the and</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.290" end="00:56:20.750" style="s2">all of these very different rituals are</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.930" end="00:56:23.480" style="s2">efficacious to significant degrees and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.750" end="00:56:25.940" style="s2">that has to be better explained than the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.480" end="00:56:29.240" style="s2">individual metaphysical claim that goes</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.940" end="00:56:30.860" style="s2">with each particular set of rituals any</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.240" end="00:56:34.040" style="s2">basically needs to have this the is this</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.860" end="00:56:36.140" style="s2">there&#39;s all these tools and many many</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.040" end="00:56:38.150" style="s2">tools that are considered magic are just</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.140" end="00:56:41.210" style="s2">tools and the advertising industry uses</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.150" end="00:56:43.490" style="s2">them yes and those that would seek to</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.210" end="00:56:44.630" style="s2">control us use them and they used every</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.490" end="00:56:46.670" style="s2">day it&#39;s a great and greater</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.630" end="00:56:48.260" style="s2">sophistication it would a state</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.670" end="00:56:52.130" style="s2">incredible work with what is some wood</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.260" end="00:56:54.050" style="s2">used to call magic oh yes eres magic</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.130" end="00:56:56.300" style="s2">from the Renaissance goes right in</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.050" end="00:56:57.890" style="s2">through and into marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.300" end="00:57:00.020" style="s2">advertising there is a direct</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.890" end="00:57:01.460" style="s2">historical lineage there was a book</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.020" end="00:57:03.290" style="s2">written on that it&#39;s an excellent book</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.460" end="00:57:05.750" style="s2">and I can&#39;t remember the title of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.290" end="00:57:07.970" style="s2">right now I apologize to the author yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.750" end="00:57:12.320" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the case that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.970" end="00:57:13.640" style="s2">the case and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.320" end="00:57:16.790" style="s2">I think part of what we should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.640" end="00:57:18.440" style="s2">right now is sort of what are all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.790" end="00:57:21.470" style="s2">tools that are at our disposal</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.440" end="00:57:22.820" style="s2">where are they who&#39;s got them and how</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.470" end="00:57:24.920" style="s2">can we integrate them so that we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.820" end="00:57:26.660" style="s2">got them to anything that&#39;s being used</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.920" end="00:57:28.760" style="s2">against us or what-have-you we need to</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.660" end="00:57:30.110" style="s2">have that as well and then anything</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.760" end="00:57:31.970" style="s2">that&#39;s missing maybe there&#39;s some stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.110" end="00:57:34.130" style="s2">that that you know that&#39;s been left on</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.970" end="00:57:38.990" style="s2">the table so I like terence mckenna&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.130" end="00:57:40.790" style="s2">archaic revival concept the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.990" end="00:57:42.740" style="s2">thing I would add I think you would</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.790" end="00:57:45.020" style="s2">agree with me on this is gathering those</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.740" end="00:57:48.440" style="s2">tools is not separable from gathering</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.020" end="00:57:50.240" style="s2">people together into a community there</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.440" end="00:57:53.930" style="s2">has to be a way in which people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.240" end="00:57:57.320" style="s2">going to share and co-create tools until</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.930" end="00:57:58.670" style="s2">they can this is a dangerous verb but</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.320" end="00:58:00.710" style="s2">it&#39;s the right verb right now until they</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.670" end="00:58:05.290" style="s2">can trust each other mm-hmm well they</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.710" end="00:58:12.740" style="s2">can trust each other yeah yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.290" end="00:58:16.700" style="s2">yeah next Hannah</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.740" end="00:58:18.470" style="s2">you had a question I read I copied it</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.700" end="00:58:24.050" style="s2">into the chat box so you have access to</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.470" end="00:58:26.630" style="s2">it thanks so much guys this is been</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.050" end="00:58:29.810" style="s2">really really interesting so far my</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.630" end="00:58:32.870" style="s2">question is for both of you in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.810" end="00:58:35.750" style="s2">navigating to stay in the flow state and</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.870" end="00:58:38.060" style="s2">synchronicities how do you balance the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.750" end="00:58:40.040" style="s2">need or desire to go meta especially in</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.060" end="00:58:43.010" style="s2">communities like this that are very meta</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.040" end="00:58:48.580" style="s2">orientated with the way that going meta</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.010" end="00:58:51.160" style="s2">can take you out of the flow State yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.580" end="00:58:56.600" style="s2">that is don&#39;t think feel thing in it</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.160" end="00:58:59.840" style="s2">which is often misinterpreted but you</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.600" end="00:59:02.660" style="s2">know the depends what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.840" end="00:59:04.370" style="s2">there&#39;s room for contemplation but in</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.660" end="00:59:05.660" style="s2">the actual creation in the actual doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.370" end="00:59:06.920" style="s2">you really don&#39;t want to be overthinking</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.660" end="00:59:09.020" style="s2">you don&#39;t really really don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.920" end="00:59:11.450" style="s2">stepping out and then afterwards you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.020" end="00:59:13.039" style="s2">go what did I make how did I make it</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.450" end="00:59:15.019" style="s2">but even you in the process of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.039" end="00:59:17.119" style="s2">actual doing you don&#39;t want to distract</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.019" end="00:59:19.190" style="s2">yourself from the doing or or you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.119" end="00:59:20.779" style="s2">pull out of the doing while you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.190" end="00:59:24.440" style="s2">the doing I would say what would you say</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.779" end="00:59:25.970" style="s2">John I think that&#39;s right you know in in</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.440" end="00:59:29.240" style="s2">the sense that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.970" end="00:59:31.460" style="s2">chokes off flow is when people start to</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.240" end="00:59:32.839" style="s2">self narrate when they get into and when</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.460" end="00:59:34.400" style="s2">they start trying to narrate what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.839" end="00:59:37.279" style="s2">happening so one of the things that that</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.400" end="00:59:39.019" style="s2">is typically shut off and what a bloody</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.279" end="00:59:41.690" style="s2">relief it is when it is shut off for a</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.019" end="00:59:43.880" style="s2">while that I think that&#39;s a fever hunger</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.690" end="00:59:46.510" style="s2">of self referentiality that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.880" end="00:59:48.619" style="s2">narrative that&#39;s always going on and on</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.510" end="00:59:51.289" style="s2">so one of the things that shutoff and</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.619" end="00:59:54.619" style="s2">flow is that narrative image management</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.289" end="00:59:58.480" style="s2">machine one of the things I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.619" end="01:00:02.569" style="s2">there are ways of going meta that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.480" end="01:00:04.910" style="s2">ways of that are independent from going</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.569" end="01:00:07.250" style="s2">into that narrative nanny in the head</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.910" end="01:00:09.230" style="s2">there are ways of moving meta there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.250" end="01:00:14.210" style="s2">way there&#39;s a way of zooming out and</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.230" end="01:00:18.220" style="s2">zooming in and that can also be taken up</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.210" end="01:00:21.140" style="s2">into a flow state part of what I&#39;m yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.220" end="01:00:24.740" style="s2">that zooming out and zooming in the a</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.140" end="01:00:26.420" style="s2">budding thing right up above and</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.740" end="01:00:28.849" style="s2">visualizing that and do because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.420" end="01:00:32.420" style="s2">what happens yes yes it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.849" end="01:00:34.940" style="s2">and there&#39;s even a way of you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.420" end="01:00:36.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of being reflective this</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.940" end="01:00:39.259" style="s2">is part of what I&#39;m trying to work out</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.559" end="01:00:42.920" style="s2">with Christopher Christopher master</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.259" end="01:00:44.720" style="s2">Pietro and with Peter and with guy cents</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.920" end="01:00:46.339" style="s2">talking during the whole in dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.720" end="01:00:49.009" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of bringing reflection</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.339" end="01:00:53.240" style="s2">into this that nevertheless is not flow</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.009" end="01:00:55.759" style="s2">disruptive but flow conducive so there I</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.240" end="01:00:59.000" style="s2">think two things to be said is we</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.759" end="01:01:03.920" style="s2">definitely want to avoid the nattering</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.000" end="01:01:06.619" style="s2">narrative nanny but that just like flow</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.920" end="01:01:09.349" style="s2">tells you flow shows you that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.619" end="01:01:11.059" style="s2">central lie of the of that narrative ego</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.349" end="01:01:13.279" style="s2">that narrative ego says you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.059" end="01:01:15.619" style="s2">anything well without me and what flow</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.279" end="01:01:17.029" style="s2">shows you is that&#39;s a lie you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.619" end="01:01:19.819" style="s2">actually do better without it</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.029" end="01:01:23.180" style="s2">incident in it in a similar way another</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.819" end="01:01:25.470" style="s2">related lies reveal the line that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.180" end="01:01:28.560" style="s2">can only go meta by going in</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.470" end="01:01:31.050" style="s2">that narrative reflective self retro</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.560" end="01:01:32.220" style="s2">Selfridge estate that&#39;s also a lie</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.050" end="01:01:34.859" style="s2">there are ways of going meta</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.220" end="01:01:37.590" style="s2">neoplatonism is filled with them so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.859" end="01:01:42.480" style="s2">sort of versions of Buddhism there are</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.590" end="01:01:45.570" style="s2">ways of going meta that do not break</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.480" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">flow but actually they do something</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.570" end="01:01:51.090" style="s2">interesting they can move you from an</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.280" end="01:01:53.220" style="s2">intimacy with way with the task or even</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.090" end="01:01:55.050" style="s2">the other people in the task to an</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.220" end="01:01:57.510" style="s2">intimacy with sort of the patterns of</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.050" end="01:02:00.030" style="s2">intelligibility itself and the flow can</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.510" end="01:02:02.040" style="s2">then sort of ramp up the level at which</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.030" end="01:02:03.720" style="s2">it&#39;s occurring so that&#39;s that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.040" end="01:02:05.490" style="s2">would answer that question it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.720" end="01:02:10.800" style="s2">difference between flow and awareness</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.490" end="01:02:12.300" style="s2">yes yes yes okay that and one can exist</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.800" end="01:02:13.920" style="s2">without the other and the other cannot</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.300" end="01:02:16.410" style="s2">and that&#39;s the thing that people often</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.920" end="01:02:18.300" style="s2">get completely backwards I think so I</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.410" end="01:02:21.690" style="s2">think so and we have to remember that</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.300" end="01:02:23.190" style="s2">awareness we also we have a spotlight</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.690" end="01:02:24.930" style="s2">metaphor for attention that our</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.190" end="01:02:26.910" style="s2">attention our awareness our just shining</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.930" end="01:02:29.880" style="s2">a homogeneous light on something and</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.910" end="01:02:34.050" style="s2">that&#39;s also a deep mistake you I mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.880" end="01:02:35.960" style="s2">music actually shows how intricately and</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.050" end="01:02:39.030" style="s2">dynamically self-corrective and</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.960" end="01:02:42.900" style="s2">multi-layered attention and awareness</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.030" end="01:02:44.480" style="s2">can be yeah really the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.900" end="01:02:47.839" style="s2">simultaneously occurring patterns</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.480" end="01:02:50.160" style="s2">exactly the high degree of</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.839" end="01:02:59.609" style="s2">intelligibility that is being processed</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.160" end="01:03:02.720" style="s2">in music yes yeah there you go David do</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.609" end="01:03:06.210" style="s2">you had a question yet a few I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.720" end="01:03:08.390" style="s2">yeah the basic gist is that was just go</p>

<p begin="01:03:08.390" end="01:03:13.890" style="s2">it&#39;s about this trust and I and John</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.339" end="01:03:16.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.890" end="01:03:20.070" style="s2">notion of trust as a propositional frame</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.440" end="01:03:21.570" style="s2">has one meaning but I&#39;d argue that what</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.070" end="01:03:22.950" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about accurate with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.570" end="01:03:25.410" style="s2">kids playing games they have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.950" end="01:03:27.089" style="s2">procedural trust they know how they know</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.410" end="01:03:28.800" style="s2">that space there&#39;s something of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.089" end="01:03:30.960" style="s2">perspectival trust and the participatory</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.800" end="01:03:32.700" style="s2">trust where ego doesn&#39;t have a foothold</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:34.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s really scary for the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.700" end="01:03:35.910" style="s2">propositional so there&#39;s something in</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.320" end="01:03:38.299" style="s2">that space and that kind of ties back</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.910" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">into this powder-keg moment we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.299" end="01:03:43.429" style="s2">we need that kind of trust we need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:45.799" style="s2">delve deep into the participatory trust</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.429" end="01:03:46.400" style="s2">where I have no fucking clue what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.799" end="01:03:47.929" style="s2">going on</p>

<p begin="01:03:50.959" end="01:03:53.989" style="s2">so that&#39;s the kind of thing you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="01:03:53.989" end="01:03:59.299" style="s2">that kind of practices what can we do to</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.880" end="01:04:00.799" style="s2">help engender that kind of trust so I</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.299" end="01:04:06.079" style="s2">mean that&#39;s why I invoke that term</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.799" end="01:04:10.390" style="s2">intimacy and the idea of intimacy being</p>

<p begin="01:07:02.960" end="01:07:14.870" style="s2">thank you both required but the message</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.810" end="01:07:17.900" style="s2">it&#39;s fun okay cool maybe we&#39;ll do one</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.870" end="01:07:24.020" style="s2">more question mimetic keeper you had a</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.900" end="01:07:25.760" style="s2">question I think you had two hi John I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.020" end="01:07:27.710" style="s2">gonna note here that a my handle</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.760" end="01:07:35.780" style="s2">actually mimetic paper it is synonymous</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.710" end="01:07:38.060" style="s2">with stealing culture yeah so within my</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.780" end="01:07:40.790" style="s2">own thinking the core element of culture</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.060" end="01:07:43.040" style="s2">is attention and you see goal-directed</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.790" end="01:07:46.160" style="s2">behavior authority theater they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.040" end="01:07:48.440" style="s2">ways of structuring attention the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.160" end="01:07:50.720" style="s2">dilemma I think with stealing culture</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.440" end="01:07:52.760" style="s2">then is that it because it can become</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.720" end="01:07:55.550" style="s2">merely competing in the attention</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.760" end="01:07:57.860" style="s2">economy and while attention must be</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.550" end="01:07:59.720" style="s2">captured I I take it you believe it must</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.860" end="01:08:02.450" style="s2">be transmuted into a different form as</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.720" end="01:08:05.180" style="s2">well yeah yeah after you have audience</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.450" end="01:08:07.810" style="s2">what&#39;s next is spectator culture</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.180" end="01:08:07.810" style="s2">pathologic</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.809" end="01:08:18.350" style="s2">so again I take very seriously</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.539" end="01:08:20.449" style="s2">everything you said which is why I you</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.350" end="01:08:23.270" style="s2">know I spend a lot of time on attention</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.449" end="01:08:25.580" style="s2">and related phenomena like insight I</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.270" end="01:08:27.560" style="s2">think culture is also about shaping</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.580" end="01:08:30.440" style="s2">agency but let&#39;s just stick with</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.560" end="01:08:31.850" style="s2">attention for now I think the thing you</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.440" end="01:08:34.429" style="s2">said towards the end there about the</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.850" end="01:08:36.290" style="s2">transmutation or well I what I some</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.429" end="01:08:39.159" style="s2">cults sometimes call that the excitation</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.290" end="01:08:41.690" style="s2">right the transmutation of attention is</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.159" end="01:08:43.759" style="s2">essential this is this this goes this</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.690" end="01:08:45.949" style="s2">isn&#39;t my idea this is iris Murdoch&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.759" end="01:08:48.770" style="s2">idea in the sovereignty of the good that</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.949" end="01:08:50.929" style="s2">the central the central act of any</p>

<p begin="01:10:47.310" end="01:10:54.389" style="s2">conducive to virtuous attention and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.099" end="01:10:56.909" style="s2">I have tried to afford both on a quality</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.389" end="01:10:59.429" style="s2">of practices and a community of Sangha</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.909" end="01:11:01.199" style="s2">that is exemplifying that transformation</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.429" end="01:11:04.110" style="s2">of attention to people that&#39;s how I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:11:14.449" end="01:11:19.619" style="s2">well I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying to show</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.920" end="01:11:22.139" style="s2">you that so sorry I didn&#39;t mean to sound</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.619" end="01:11:24.480" style="s2">defensive if I did that wasn&#39;t my intent</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.139" end="01:11:28.079" style="s2">or at least that wasn&#39;t my conscious</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.480" end="01:11:30.510" style="s2">intent that my virtuous intent was that</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.079" end="01:11:32.400" style="s2">I was trying to indicate to you that</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.510" end="01:11:34.530" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought about this a lot and deeply</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.400" end="01:11:39.320" style="s2">and these are the answers I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.530" end="01:11:44.010" style="s2">put into practice yeah I like the</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.320" end="01:11:45.570" style="s2">exemplifying thing it&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:11:45.570" end="01:11:52.139" style="s2">change if I don&#39;t if I don&#39;t exemplify</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.739" end="01:11:55.590" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about then I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.139" end="01:11:58.469" style="s2">talking it&#39;s just propositional if I</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.590" end="01:12:02.489" style="s2">have to exemplify and afford other</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.469" end="01:12:06.599" style="s2">people participating or else I won&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:12:11.849" end="01:12:16.320" style="s2">that&#39;s why and this I am NOT comparing</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.070" end="01:12:19.650" style="s2">myself in any other way but that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.320" end="01:12:22.820" style="s2">Jesus of Nazareth is so critical of</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.650" end="01:12:26.159" style="s2">hypocrisy to my mind and to</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.820" end="01:12:30.949" style="s2">self-righteousness precisely because it</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.159" end="01:12:30.949" style="s2">it is not a case of exemplification</p>

<p begin="01:14:05.320" end="01:14:07.989" style="s2">individual to be an individual the</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.789" end="01:14:09.699" style="s2">second one was when you get a bit older</p>
