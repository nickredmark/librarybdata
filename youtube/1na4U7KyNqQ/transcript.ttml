<p begin="00:00:00.469" end="00:00:05.520" style="s2">hi this is Bonnie and I&#39;m recording this</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.449" end="00:00:08.010" style="s2">from the studio at all the Lauren site</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.520" end="00:00:10.290" style="s2">Center one of the things I wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.010" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">with these short videos is respond to</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.290" end="00:00:16.020" style="s2">questions that some of you have given me</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:17.910" style="s2">and really make it pertinent to what</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.020" end="00:00:20.189" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking and what your concerns</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.910" end="00:00:23.580" style="s2">are as young people facing your future</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.189" end="00:00:26.430" style="s2">and so the daughter of a friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.580" end="00:00:29.820" style="s2">Kristina Bradley wrote in to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.430" end="00:00:32.550" style="s2">yesterday and asked this question she</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.820" end="00:00:35.730" style="s2">says what comes to me as I look into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.550" end="00:00:38.870" style="s2">future is the question of how will I</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.730" end="00:00:41.910" style="s2">listen deeply and stay true to myself</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.870" end="00:00:44.550" style="s2">this has to do mostly with what career</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.910" end="00:00:46.500" style="s2">path I choose to follow and what types</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.550" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">of people I choose to surround myself</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.500" end="00:00:50.309" style="s2">with I am really trying to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:53.160" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.309" end="00:00:55.500" style="s2">and find where I am stuck and where I am</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.160" end="00:00:59.280" style="s2">open and I hope to continue this</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.500" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">practice into the future as I look into</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:04.199" style="s2">the future I see many new experiences</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:06.270" style="s2">and opportunities and I wonder how</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.199" end="00:01:12.390" style="s2">successful I will be listening to myself</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.270" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">and what I want out of life so this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.390" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">already a rich and genuine question and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:23.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of gems in it but one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">the things that we can do is work on</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.630" end="00:01:29.540" style="s2">making these types of questions more</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">generative and what I mean by that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.540" end="00:01:37.700" style="s2">how can we work the question so that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:43.170" style="s2">actually starts to answer or lean into</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.700" end="00:01:45.210" style="s2">its own possibilities and if we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.170" end="00:01:47.340" style="s2">actually in conversation this would be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.210" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">more generative conversation and I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.340" end="00:01:51.240" style="s2">say something and there&#39;d be some</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:54.090" style="s2">feedback but we&#39;re working with these</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.240" end="00:01:56.189" style="s2">digital snapshots where the int question</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.090" end="00:01:59.070" style="s2">gets in one silo and then the answer</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.189" end="00:02:03.180" style="s2">becomes an artifact so we&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.070" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">to play with this question and see where</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.180" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:11.550" style="s2">and take it first of all you know but</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:15.750" style="s2">it&#39;s very important to remember that a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.550" end="00:02:19.020" style="s2">life is unknown and only revealed</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.750" end="00:02:22.170" style="s2">through the process of living it over</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.020" end="00:02:25.560" style="s2">the entire lifetime so when you ask the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.170" end="00:02:27.390" style="s2">question stay true to myself be careful</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.560" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">that you&#39;re not making the mistake of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.390" end="00:02:32.849" style="s2">thinking that that&#39;s something static</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:36.780" style="s2">that yourself is something formed or</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.849" end="00:02:41.400" style="s2">fixed at any one point in time that has</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.780" end="00:02:44.660" style="s2">to remain as it is and in fact life is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.400" end="00:02:48.780" style="s2">generative unfolding of not only your</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.660" end="00:02:54.060" style="s2">circumstances but what that core truly</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.780" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">is it it&#39;s it&#39;s latent in you it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.060" end="00:03:02.340" style="s2">a seed of wisdom let&#39;s say and you want</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:04.950" style="s2">to be able to let life shape that as</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.340" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">you&#39;re shaping the circumstances of your</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.950" end="00:03:14.269" style="s2">life so yes we want to have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:17.070" style="s2">being whole and congruent and authentic</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.269" end="00:03:20.459" style="s2">but that sense of being whole and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.070" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">congruent and authentic is a process of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.459" end="00:03:28.069" style="s2">opening to wider and wider possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:32.100" style="s2">opening to new ways of being opening to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.069" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">new friendships and sometimes moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.100" end="00:03:39.180" style="s2">through old friendships going where the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">enthusiasm takes us being able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.180" end="00:03:47.609" style="s2">identify where our energy wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:50.359" style="s2">and why it wants to go there to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.609" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">understand that our purpose in life is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.359" end="00:03:55.769" style="s2">always shaping itself by our</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:59.150" style="s2">relationships as I think you you wrote</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.769" end="00:04:03.260" style="s2">but not only by our friendships and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.150" end="00:04:05.970" style="s2">oftentimes the most important or</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.260" end="00:04:08.100" style="s2">significant relationships that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.970" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">have are people who never actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.100" end="00:04:12.770" style="s2">become our friends they may be our</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:16.280" style="s2">bosses then</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.770" end="00:04:20.420" style="s2">maybe our co-workers they maybe people</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.280" end="00:04:22.130" style="s2">that we spend time with in collective</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.420" end="00:04:24.190" style="s2">situation but we never really got along</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.130" end="00:04:28.250" style="s2">with and these are fabulous</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.190" end="00:04:30.530" style="s2">opportunities to assimilate aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.250" end="00:04:33.530" style="s2">the human condition but don&#39;t fit well</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.530" end="00:04:36.260" style="s2">with you but if you allow that in and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.530" end="00:04:38.900" style="s2">you allow that to shape yourself and for</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.260" end="00:04:41.900" style="s2">the wisdom to grow from that then your</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.900" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">life will be much more open and much</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.900" end="00:04:48.620" style="s2">more rich so in this process then what</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:50.690" style="s2">do we trust you know we talk about at</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.620" end="00:04:52.490" style="s2">all the lower clarity of purpose or what</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.690" end="00:04:56.060" style="s2">is clarity of purpose if it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.490" end="00:04:59.090" style="s2">static thing so we associate clarity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.060" end="00:05:03.350" style="s2">purpose with insight and intuition and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.090" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">imagination so you use your intuition</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.350" end="00:05:08.450" style="s2">which is an embodied sense a felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:10.280" style="s2">that you you call it listening to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.450" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">yourself which is a great phrase for it</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.280" end="00:05:15.530" style="s2">to listen to yourself to listen to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:17.900" style="s2">which is moving and that which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.530" end="00:05:20.480" style="s2">stagnant and that which wants to move</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.900" end="00:05:24.520" style="s2">and that which feels contained or</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.480" end="00:05:27.140" style="s2">constrained and to keep opening that in</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.520" end="00:05:29.630" style="s2">acknowledging that it&#39;s a process an</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.140" end="00:05:32.120" style="s2">ongoing process it&#39;s something that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.630" end="00:05:34.340" style="s2">alive and wants to change and wants to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.120" end="00:05:37.820" style="s2">grow and wants to generate and wants to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.340" end="00:05:43.970" style="s2">write them so this is the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.820" end="00:05:47.510" style="s2">intuition enthusiasm and inspiration and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.970" end="00:05:50.150" style="s2">your imagination is a huge part of being</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.510" end="00:05:54.230" style="s2">clear about your purpose because if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.150" end="00:05:57.290" style="s2">don&#39;t imagine with enthusiasm or taking</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.230" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">an inspiration wherever it shows up and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.290" end="00:06:04.340" style="s2">allow that to shape your imagination of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:07.040" style="s2">who you can be or what you what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.340" end="00:06:10.520" style="s2">possible then you&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.040" end="00:06:13.070" style="s2">able to feed sufficiently nurture that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.520" end="00:06:16.729" style="s2">energy that wants to open and blossom</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.070" end="00:06:20.749" style="s2">and become more so the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.729" end="00:06:25.069" style="s2">is a crucial partner to the intuition</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.749" end="00:06:27.110" style="s2">insight and then the third aspect is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.069" end="00:06:30.889" style="s2">insight itself and the insight is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.110" end="00:06:33.469" style="s2">process of being able to lean into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.889" end="00:06:36.409" style="s2">unknown so that you have this intuition</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.469" end="00:06:38.569" style="s2">that you need to move that something</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.409" end="00:06:41.509" style="s2">wants to move and you&#39;re doing an</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.569" end="00:06:46.370" style="s2">insight process or insight practice of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.509" end="00:06:50.330" style="s2">using your imagination and and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.370" end="00:06:53.300" style="s2">understand what is limiting in your way</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.330" end="00:06:57.349" style="s2">of being that needs to be changed that</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.300" end="00:07:01.879" style="s2">needs to open up and then you use the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.349" end="00:07:07.430" style="s2">insight practice to lean into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.879" end="00:07:11.419" style="s2">unknown and stay open to the energy in</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.430" end="00:07:15.649" style="s2">the enthusiasm without this knowing of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.419" end="00:07:18.949" style="s2">the final goal and so what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.649" end="00:07:22.459" style="s2">you can use the energy the enthusiasm in</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.949" end="00:07:25.430" style="s2">a practice of insight which will reveal</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.459" end="00:07:28.189" style="s2">the next elegant step so that for</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.430" end="00:07:30.770" style="s2">example I often know that what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.189" end="00:07:32.779" style="s2">is really right but this decision I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.770" end="00:07:35.149" style="s2">made to do this is really right but they</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.779" end="00:07:38.599" style="s2">also know that it&#39;s not what I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.149" end="00:07:42.169" style="s2">to be doing for a very long time and if</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.599" end="00:07:44.659" style="s2">life is a process of generative</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.169" end="00:07:47.180" style="s2">unfolding over a lifetime it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.659" end="00:07:49.249" style="s2">nonlinear process so you can&#39;t get from</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.180" end="00:07:52.580" style="s2">here to there in a straight line</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.249" end="00:07:57.559" style="s2">it&#39;s very nonlinear and so you can be</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.580" end="00:08:00.949" style="s2">sure that this step for now fits that</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.559" end="00:08:04.039" style="s2">it&#39;s right for you but it&#39;s only a piece</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.949" end="00:08:06.409" style="s2">of the puzzle a puzzle that will never</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.039" end="00:08:09.529" style="s2">be known because it&#39;s always in an</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.409" end="00:08:13.599" style="s2">unfolding process and so that&#39;s a little</p>
