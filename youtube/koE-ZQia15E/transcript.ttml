<p begin="00:00:08.130" end="00:00:13.650" style="s2">one of the world&#39;s 10 most influential</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.290" end="00:00:15.599" style="s2">thinkers he began his career documenting</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.650" end="00:00:17.880" style="s2">the psychedelic culture that created the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.599" end="00:00:20.160" style="s2">early internet then with books like</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.880" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">throwing rocks at the Google bus he</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.160" end="00:00:24.840" style="s2">started sounding the alarm about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">technology was doing to society he</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.840" end="00:00:30.029" style="s2">subscribed his most recent book team</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">human as a mic drop moment and a</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.029" end="00:00:33.780" style="s2">manifesto to recover human values in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:35.730" style="s2">digital age</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.780" end="00:00:37.620" style="s2">Douglas thank you for making the time to</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.730" end="00:00:39.570" style="s2">do this this is actually the second time</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.620" end="00:00:41.430" style="s2">we&#39;ve done an interview and the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.570" end="00:00:44.040" style="s2">time was one of the very few occasions</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.430" end="00:00:46.530" style="s2">that we had technical problems and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.040" end="00:00:49.260" style="s2">ended up being unusable so thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.530" end="00:00:51.360" style="s2">making time the second time and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.260" end="00:00:52.770" style="s2">the good thing is that I can remember</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.360" end="00:00:54.930" style="s2">some of the good answers that you gave</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.770" end="00:00:58.379" style="s2">last time so we can kind of dive into</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.930" end="00:01:01.109" style="s2">that I hope and I&#39;m really looking</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.379" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">forward to this because your your recent</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.109" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">book team human and the trajectory that</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:07.590" style="s2">you&#39;ve been on seems very similar to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:09.930" style="s2">trajectory that we&#39;ve been on since the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.590" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">beginning of the channel kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.930" end="00:01:16.530" style="s2">coming home to real conversations human</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.920" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">contact and how that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.530" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">for getting out of some of the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:21.390" style="s2">kind of messes that we seem to have got</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:23.939" style="s2">ourselves into</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.390" end="00:01:25.549" style="s2">so I I&#39;d love to hear what what has your</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.939" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">kind of journey with this being like</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.549" end="00:01:33.210" style="s2">well my journeys been a long one you</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:38.329" style="s2">know I mean for me it started with with</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">theater really and I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.329" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">interested in in well I was interested</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.979" end="00:01:44.970" style="s2">in theater and medicine at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.840" end="00:01:50.340" style="s2">because I wanted to know what what</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.970" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">animated human beings you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.340" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">the difference between the living one</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">and a dead one and you know the medicine</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">and biology are really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:00.659" style="s2">that you know what what constitutes life</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:04.619" style="s2">when does when does physics or chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.659" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">become biology and theater is interested</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.619" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">in that because what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">is to figure out what is a human being</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:12.930" style="s2">in action what is this what is a person</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">what is intention what is their will you</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.930" end="00:02:17.190" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:18.510" style="s2">and I played with both and got</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.190" end="00:02:20.340" style="s2">disillusioned with both I got</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.510" end="00:02:24.720" style="s2">disillusioned with medicine because it</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:26.250" style="s2">was way too empirical you know there</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.720" end="00:02:29.160" style="s2">wasn&#39;t any vitalism in it there was</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.250" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2">nothing it didn&#39;t acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.160" end="00:02:35.700" style="s2">weirdness that actually keeps us going</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:38.060" style="s2">and theater I got sick of because it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.700" end="00:02:41.459" style="s2">so expensive for people to go to and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.060" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">elitist and closed-ended every play kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.459" end="00:02:46.049" style="s2">of ended the same way you know and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:49.830" style="s2">some tragedy or marriage you know big</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.049" end="00:02:51.599" style="s2">crisis climax completion and right</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.830" end="00:02:57.019" style="s2">around then the internet came around and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.599" end="00:03:01.049" style="s2">it seemed to answer all of my needs for</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.019" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">an egalitarian people&#39;s participatory</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.049" end="00:03:07.950" style="s2">medium where instead of watching some</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.720" end="00:03:09.930" style="s2">hero do stuff you are the hero you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.950" end="00:03:11.970" style="s2">engaging and then you&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.930" end="00:03:14.340" style="s2">engaging in fiction you&#39;re engaging for</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.970" end="00:03:16.290" style="s2">real in this kind of fact-based world</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.340" end="00:03:18.810" style="s2">and now we can start solving solutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.290" end="00:03:21.090" style="s2">together and bottom-up ways and remake</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.810" end="00:03:23.819" style="s2">the economy to be circular instead of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.090" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">extractive and change institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.819" end="00:03:31.530" style="s2">relationships and I got excited but then</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:34.739" style="s2">by the mid to late 90s once the internet</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.530" end="00:03:39.170" style="s2">also became the poster child for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.739" end="00:03:39.170" style="s2">Nasdaq Stock Exchange and big business</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.319" end="00:03:49.440" style="s2">they pivoted the net from a people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.980" end="00:03:53.100" style="s2">medium a connecting people&#39;s medium to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.440" end="00:03:55.019" style="s2">data extraction platform and all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.100" end="00:03:59.730" style="s2">these tools all of the software all</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.019" end="00:04:02.160" style="s2">these devices were really programmed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.730" end="00:04:04.349" style="s2">keep us apart from one another and turn</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.160" end="00:04:08.750" style="s2">us back into isolated individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.349" end="00:04:13.730" style="s2">manipulable customers and voters and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.750" end="00:04:16.349" style="s2">machines really so I guess what that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.730" end="00:04:20.010" style="s2">what I came all the way back around to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.349" end="00:04:23.039" style="s2">was that you know people actually have</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.010" end="00:04:26.670" style="s2">the ability to connect you know without</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.039" end="00:04:30.450" style="s2">anything without even without theater</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.670" end="00:04:32.610" style="s2">for bid or without without a machine</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.450" end="00:04:35.760" style="s2">without a device without a game that</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.610" end="00:04:38.550" style="s2">people can can recalibrate themselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.760" end="00:04:41.610" style="s2">really simply and easily just by making</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.550" end="00:04:44.760" style="s2">eye contact for five seconds you undo</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.610" end="00:04:49.400" style="s2">you know 10 hours of computer addiction</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.760" end="00:04:53.160" style="s2">and and alienation and atomization so</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.400" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">now I&#39;m really kind of all about helping</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.160" end="00:04:59.160" style="s2">people find the opportunities and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:01.290" style="s2">courage to engage with one another in</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.160" end="00:05:04.470" style="s2">the flesh in real ways you know in in</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.290" end="00:05:06.480" style="s2">real spaces and that that&#39;s the great</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.470" end="00:05:08.580" style="s2">conspiracy that&#39;s literally what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.480" end="00:05:10.290" style="s2">word conspiracy means - conspires to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.580" end="00:05:12.660" style="s2">breathe together you know so people</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.290" end="00:05:14.300" style="s2">breathing together constitutes a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.660" end="00:05:18.990" style="s2">conspiracy against the dehumanizing</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.300" end="00:05:21.810" style="s2">forces of of digital capitalism and how</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.990" end="00:05:22.940" style="s2">would you summarize team human as your</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.810" end="00:05:25.650" style="s2">contribution to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.940" end="00:05:28.100" style="s2">well team human really started as a way</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.650" end="00:05:32.970" style="s2">originally for me to have an excuse to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.100" end="00:05:35.940" style="s2">engage with other people and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.970" end="00:05:38.460" style="s2">turned into a way for me to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.940" end="00:05:40.620" style="s2">amplify and spread the messages of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.460" end="00:05:42.090" style="s2">others rather than myself and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.620" end="00:05:44.130" style="s2">written 20 books and made all these</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.090" end="00:05:46.500" style="s2">documentaries and done all this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.130" end="00:05:48.180" style="s2">like I feel like I&#39;ve made my</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.500" end="00:05:50.640" style="s2">contribution or gotten as much attention</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.180" end="00:05:52.200" style="s2">as any person deserves and the best</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.640" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">thing I can do with that attention is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.200" end="00:06:00.120" style="s2">highlight you know people who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:06:01.770" style="s2">helping us restore those the those human</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.120" end="00:06:04.770" style="s2">connections and really the value of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.770" end="00:06:09.180" style="s2">being human you know human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.770" end="00:06:11.490" style="s2">our at least in in Silicon Valley terms</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.180" end="00:06:14.070" style="s2">human beings aren&#39;t understood as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.490" end="00:06:16.050" style="s2">problem and technology is the solution</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.070" end="00:06:18.630" style="s2">you know when you look at any human</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.050" end="00:06:19.860" style="s2">problem from climate change to racism to</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.630" end="00:06:21.750" style="s2">everything and we&#39;ll say oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.860" end="00:06:23.100" style="s2">because of those humans and we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.750" end="00:06:26.340" style="s2">develop better platforms and better</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.100" end="00:06:27.870" style="s2">systems and so you know you know this</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.340" end="00:06:33.510" style="s2">the systems and the platforms that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.870" end="00:06:35.730" style="s2">corrupting the humans I think and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.510" end="00:06:38.430" style="s2">sort of dedicating you know team human</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.730" end="00:06:39.660" style="s2">to the the celebration of the weirdness</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.430" end="00:06:42.480" style="s2">of the this</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.660" end="00:06:44.910" style="s2">between the lines the things about us</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.480" end="00:06:47.280" style="s2">that can&#39;t be quantized by digital</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.910" end="00:06:50.130" style="s2">technology know nothing against digital</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.280" end="00:06:54.120" style="s2">and and we are for sure we&#39;re migrating</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.130" end="00:06:57.690" style="s2">into a digital media environment but if</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.120" end="00:06:59.490" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do that we better start</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.690" end="00:07:01.830" style="s2">compensating now for what digital</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.490" end="00:07:04.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t recognize what aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.830" end="00:07:06.210" style="s2">humanity does digital not see you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.140" end="00:07:08.580" style="s2">just as we understand you know Marx</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.210" end="00:07:10.950" style="s2">showed us how industrialism doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.130" end="00:14:40.190" style="s2">philosophical discussion about about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.670" end="00:14:41.960" style="s2">world and it&#39;s kind of why I and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.190" end="00:14:45.200" style="s2">here even when I talk about it now I</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.960" end="00:14:47.420" style="s2">talk so little about to my ideas and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.200" end="00:14:49.670" style="s2">much more about kind of history like</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.420" end="00:14:51.590" style="s2">this telling the story this is what</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.670" end="00:14:54.250" style="s2">happened and here&#39;s who took over and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.590" end="00:14:57.710" style="s2">here&#39;s why these kids felt this way</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.250" end="00:15:01.190" style="s2">and it is I mean the the question you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.710" end="00:15:03.140" style="s2">were asking before is basically how can</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.190" end="00:15:06.500" style="s2">these people go to places like Burning</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.140" end="00:15:08.510" style="s2">Man or go down to South America and do</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.500" end="00:15:11.240" style="s2">ayahuasca and trip their brains out and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.510" end="00:15:13.910" style="s2">still be assholes you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.240" end="00:15:16.190" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of that was the question</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.910" end="00:15:19.190" style="s2">that was bothering me for the last 10</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.190" end="00:15:20.540" style="s2">years or so and I remember it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.190" end="00:15:23.750" style="s2">actually longer was when I was in</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.540" end="00:15:25.580" style="s2">college and I tripped and said oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.750" end="00:15:27.590" style="s2">now I see how everything&#39;s connected and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.580" end="00:15:29.230" style="s2">then I saw there&#39;s people tripping in</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.590" end="00:15:31.560" style="s2">the parking lot of the ac/dc concert</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.230" end="00:15:33.480" style="s2">who&#39;s still just like they</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.560" end="00:15:35.850" style="s2">trip and they break glass and stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.480" end="00:15:37.380" style="s2">smash beer bottles and it&#39;s like wait a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.850" end="00:15:40.050" style="s2">minute you&#39;re trippin shouldn&#39;t you be</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.380" end="00:15:41.580" style="s2">seeing the clear light of the essential</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.050" end="00:15:45.180" style="s2">human experience and now you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.580" end="00:15:47.730" style="s2">being assholes and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.180" end="00:15:49.950" style="s2">you can have the chairman of Google and</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.730" end="00:15:52.500" style="s2">Apple and everything they can go and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.950" end="00:15:54.810" style="s2">they can have these experiences and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.500" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">can hear the earth you know cry to them</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.810" end="00:16:01.230" style="s2">but then they&#39;re going to conclude that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:03.960" style="s2">oh and the way I&#39;m gonna fix all this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.230" end="00:16:05.610" style="s2">by you know bringing the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.960" end="00:16:09.589" style="s2">information to them through a good</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.610" end="00:16:13.350" style="s2">search engine or you know creating</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.589" end="00:16:16.320" style="s2">electric cars and spaceships and get us</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.350" end="00:16:17.940" style="s2">off the planet knob so you know just</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.320" end="00:16:19.589" style="s2">because you&#39;ve gone to Burning Man or</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.940" end="00:16:23.610" style="s2">had one of these experiences doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.589" end="00:16:26.700" style="s2">mean that you are ready to embrace the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.610" end="00:16:29.490" style="s2">full spectrum of humanity it&#39;s for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.700" end="00:16:34.140" style="s2">of people it doesn&#39;t really crash the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.490" end="00:16:36.390" style="s2">walls of ego at all but in some ways and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.140" end="00:16:39.990" style="s2">some in some cases makes them more rigid</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.390" end="00:16:42.300" style="s2">you know which is it&#39;s it&#39;s surprising</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.990" end="00:16:43.650" style="s2">but again it&#39;s what Timothy Leary used</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.300" end="00:16:45.480" style="s2">to talk about way back when it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.650" end="00:16:47.520" style="s2">set in your setting what set and setting</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.480" end="00:16:52.440" style="s2">are you doing this are you doing it in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.520" end="00:16:57.180" style="s2">way are you really willing to to rip</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.440" end="00:16:58.980" style="s2">open the fabric of reality and challenge</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.180" end="00:17:01.890" style="s2">who wouldn&#39;t who you are and what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.980" end="00:17:03.870" style="s2">lived for or you just want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.890" end="00:17:05.640" style="s2">good pyrotechnic kind of Disney</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.870" end="00:17:07.949" style="s2">experience or also the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.640" end="00:17:10.709" style="s2">psychedelics are just a nuns or are a</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.949" end="00:17:14.429" style="s2">nonspecific amplifier you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.709" end="00:17:16.679" style="s2">necessarily for you or for me it might</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.429" end="00:17:19.170" style="s2">be amplifying that sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.679" end="00:17:21.179" style="s2">spiritual dimension but then it can</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.170" end="00:17:23.100" style="s2">amplify any any dimension there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.179" end="00:17:26.790" style="s2">kind of necessarily it&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.100" end="00:17:28.710" style="s2">amoral thing and I was hoping it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.790" end="00:17:31.740" style="s2">you know I didn&#39;t think it was you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.710" end="00:17:37.190" style="s2">I originally thought well maybe LSD and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.740" end="00:17:40.410" style="s2">some of the chemical synthetic chemical</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.190" end="00:17:43.140" style="s2">psychedelics are amoral but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.410" end="00:17:45.230" style="s2">vision vine from the forest peoples</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.140" end="00:17:48.710" style="s2">would somehow let the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.230" end="00:17:50.540" style="s2">spirit of the earth speak to speak to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.710" end="00:17:53.059" style="s2">person you know that those have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.540" end="00:17:55.070" style="s2">more personality or voices in them and</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.059" end="00:17:57.500" style="s2">again I guess they have voices in them</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.070" end="00:17:58.130" style="s2">for certain people and different voices</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.500" end="00:17:59.929" style="s2">for others</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.130" end="00:18:02.360" style="s2">I first became aware of your work</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.929" end="00:18:05.419" style="s2">through the throwing rocks at the Google</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.360" end="00:18:06.590" style="s2">bus book and it was actually only sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.419" end="00:18:07.970" style="s2">of in the in the run-up to the last</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.590" end="00:18:09.830" style="s2">interview that I was aware of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.970" end="00:18:12.110" style="s2">your your interest in the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.830" end="00:18:16.340" style="s2">world and your long kind of history with</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.110" end="00:18:17.809" style="s2">with this conversation could you could</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.340" end="00:18:20.900" style="s2">you describe a little bit of that what</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.809" end="00:18:22.700" style="s2">what what was your background in that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.900" end="00:18:24.530" style="s2">know that you were you were friends with</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.700" end="00:18:26.540" style="s2">Timothy Leary is that is that right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.530" end="00:18:28.549" style="s2">you were also connected to Robert Anton</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.540" end="00:18:30.260" style="s2">Wilson could you could you describe a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.549" end="00:18:32.929" style="s2">little bit or explain some of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.260" end="00:18:39.770" style="s2">history it&#39;s a different era you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.929" end="00:18:43.100" style="s2">the late 80s and early 90s and it was in</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.770" end="00:18:47.570" style="s2">some ways easier to find people and</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.100" end="00:18:52.130" style="s2">connect with them and if you were</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.570" end="00:18:54.590" style="s2">willing you know it was theirs people</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.130" end="00:18:55.850" style="s2">were more naive to about things you</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.590" end="00:18:56.960" style="s2">could go somewhere and say you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.850" end="00:18:59.059" style="s2">write an article or do a book on</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.960" end="00:19:02.510" style="s2">something people just spoke with you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.059" end="00:19:03.950" style="s2">everybody was candid now you know people</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.510" end="00:19:07.880" style="s2">are different about news everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.950" end="00:19:09.230" style="s2">kind of media savvy and they want a</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.880" end="00:19:10.910" style="s2">piece of it oh you&#39;re writing a book</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.230" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">well what am I gonna get you know and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.910" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">it&#39;s publicity you know they don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">let you walk around with them and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:22.820" style="s2">and chill so you know I was living in</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:26.750" style="s2">Los Angeles and interested in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.820" end="00:19:29.660" style="s2">these sort of early crazy cyber stories</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.750" end="00:19:32.750" style="s2">I was interested in why were my most</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.660" end="00:19:34.130" style="s2">psychedelic friends from college moving</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.750" end="00:19:36.110" style="s2">out to Silicon Valley and becoming</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.130" end="00:19:37.760" style="s2">computer people because these were not</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.110" end="00:19:40.790" style="s2">computer types these were Grateful Dead</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.760" end="00:19:44.620" style="s2">heads these were you know a creative</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.790" end="00:19:46.940" style="s2">theater artsy people doing computer so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.620" end="00:19:48.679" style="s2">started following that and seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.940" end="00:19:50.870" style="s2">oh I get it it&#39;s because these</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.679" end="00:19:53.540" style="s2">technologies are so hallucinatory that</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.870" end="00:19:56.330" style="s2">you need people well-versed and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.540" end="00:19:58.880" style="s2">hallucinations to play with them to feel</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.330" end="00:20:00.170" style="s2">confident enough to render these worlds</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.880" end="00:20:02.210" style="s2">that the rest of humanity was going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.170" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">be living in I was just kind of welcomed</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.210" end="00:20:11.420" style="s2">in as a you know young member of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:17.570" style="s2">community that that realized that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.420" end="00:20:20.330" style="s2">know digital was the next landscape for</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.570" end="00:20:22.550" style="s2">human consciousness and that was this</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.330" end="00:20:25.340" style="s2">something big was happening you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.550" end="00:20:27.740" style="s2">counterculture saw digital first we</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.340" end="00:20:33.020" style="s2">couldn&#39;t hold on to it but but we saw it</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.740" end="00:20:35.420" style="s2">first so they just became you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.020" end="00:20:36.670" style="s2">friends and mentors and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.420" end="00:20:38.780" style="s2">mentioned Robert Anton Wilson</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.670" end="00:20:41.000" style="s2">specifically because that names come up</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.780" end="00:20:44.540" style="s2">quite a few times recently we did an</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.000" end="00:20:46.280" style="s2">interview with Eric Davis about he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.540" end="00:20:48.050" style="s2">just done a book called high weirdness</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.280" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">that is partly about Robert Anton Wilson</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.050" end="00:20:54.050" style="s2">and then Jamie will mentioned him as</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:56.870" style="s2">well as as realizing how much of an</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.050" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">impact reading him as a as a young man</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.870" end="00:21:02.030" style="s2">has had on him since the concepts of</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:04.670" style="s2">reality tunnels and the kind of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.030" end="00:21:06.830" style="s2">of sort of fake news or conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.670" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">theory it&#39;s sort of going deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.830" end="00:21:11.750" style="s2">conspiracy theory in reality tunnels in</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:13.040" style="s2">particular seems to kind of define the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.750" end="00:21:16.160" style="s2">modern world probably as well as</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.040" end="00:21:18.260" style="s2">anything would you agree yeah I mean his</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.160" end="00:21:20.090" style="s2">idea of reality tunnels is what now in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.260" end="00:21:22.910" style="s2">digital age we&#39;re calling filter bubbles</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.090" end="00:21:27.680" style="s2">you know except you know reality tunnels</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.910" end="00:21:30.470" style="s2">were kind of more self-composed where</p>

<p begin="00:28:43.690" end="00:28:48.399" style="s2">know we evolved to make eye contact</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.879" end="00:28:50.860" style="s2">that&#39;s why human beings have the most</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.399" end="00:28:52.570" style="s2">white in their eyes it&#39;s so that babies</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.860" end="00:28:54.610" style="s2">can can really target and see</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.570" end="00:28:56.890" style="s2">what where&#39;s the mother looking where&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:28:56.890" end="00:29:00.610" style="s2">it and when you make that connection</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.270" end="00:29:03.760" style="s2">that eye connection not over Skype but</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.610" end="00:29:05.380" style="s2">in real life um your mirror neurons fire</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.760" end="00:29:06.730" style="s2">the oxytocin goes through your</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.380" end="00:29:08.950" style="s2">bloodstream you begin to establish</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.730" end="00:29:12.100" style="s2">rapport and you start to move into sync</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.950" end="00:29:13.570" style="s2">with the other person that&#39;s and I hate</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.100" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">to use a word like this but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.570" end="00:29:20.490" style="s2">natural human condition that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:23.730" style="s2">we make sense that&#39;s the way we</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.730" end="00:29:30.010" style="s2">constitutions that&#39;s the way we build</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.200" end="00:29:32.440" style="s2">the frameworks that establish a society</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.010" end="00:29:35.710" style="s2">you can&#39;t do that however much we like</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.440" end="00:29:37.720" style="s2">to think we can we can&#39;t do that through</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.710" end="00:29:39.880" style="s2">spreadsheets and it&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.720" end="00:29:43.470" style="s2">utilitarian things so the blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.880" end="00:29:46.780" style="s2">will not unite humanity it could</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.470" end="00:29:49.180" style="s2">organize our numbers but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.780" end="00:29:51.070" style="s2">where that&#39;s not where the show is</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.180" end="00:29:53.290" style="s2">that&#39;s not where where this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.070" end="00:29:55.930" style="s2">happening I know I think you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.290" end="00:29:59.200" style="s2">familiar with polyvagal theory we did a</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.930" end="00:30:00.490" style="s2">whole series around the the psychology</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:02.500" style="s2">the science and psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.490" end="00:30:04.270" style="s2">polarization and the science and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.500" end="00:30:07.120" style="s2">psychology of difficult conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.270" end="00:30:08.980" style="s2">found that frame polyvagal theory</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.120" end="00:30:10.510" style="s2">understanding exactly that how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.980" end="00:30:13.540" style="s2">intrinsically social we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.510" end="00:30:15.430" style="s2">looking for connections with others and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.540" end="00:30:18.130" style="s2">with and it&#39;s generally moderated by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.430" end="00:30:19.360" style="s2">the vagus nerve and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.130" end="00:30:21.220" style="s2">mentioned it a little bit in your in</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.360" end="00:30:22.720" style="s2">your book for me that feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.220" end="00:30:25.330" style="s2">really important thing for us to realize</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.720" end="00:30:27.990" style="s2">and when we interviewed Steven Porges he</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.330" end="00:30:31.240" style="s2">called it the neurobiology of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.990" end="00:30:33.250" style="s2">spirituality and religion as much as it</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.240" end="00:30:35.770" style="s2">was the neurobiology of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.250" end="00:30:39.040" style="s2">difficult conversations it&#39;s funny we</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.770" end="00:30:41.320" style="s2">call it spiritual you know when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.040" end="00:30:45.340" style="s2">about human beings being connected</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.320" end="00:30:48.400" style="s2">subtly is one great organism we call it</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.340" end="00:30:50.140" style="s2">spiritual but when we look at the fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.400" end="00:30:52.690" style="s2">that all the cells in your body are</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.140" end="00:30:55.330" style="s2">joined together to create this one thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.690" end="00:30:57.220" style="s2">we call that science you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.330" end="00:30:58.840" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s interesting what we</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.220" end="00:31:00.970" style="s2">still don&#39;t know why all the cells work</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.840" end="00:31:02.650" style="s2">together and why we don&#39;t just follow up</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.970" end="00:31:05.080" style="s2">I mean I know why we stick together but</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.650" end="00:31:06.330" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what they know and why</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.080" end="00:31:09.600" style="s2">they all do their job</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.330" end="00:31:12.870" style="s2">and coordinate this being I mean my my</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.600" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">god you know that&#39;s just as as weird</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.870" end="00:31:18.590" style="s2">just as strange it&#39;s just we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:21.870" style="s2">used to it but yeah polyvagal theory as</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.590" end="00:31:25.169" style="s2">the the aspect of it that&#39;s most useful</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.870" end="00:31:27.990" style="s2">to me is the idea that our nervous</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.169" end="00:31:30.600" style="s2">systems are not our own you are not a</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.990" end="00:31:33.240" style="s2">distinct nervous system you are part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.600" end="00:31:34.710" style="s2">a much bigger nervous system and when</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.240" end="00:31:37.169" style="s2">stuff happens to your nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.710" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">that changes mine and mine changes yours</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.169" end="00:31:45.419" style="s2">and everybody around that the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:48.510" style="s2">you need to get your act together is</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.419" end="00:31:52.740" style="s2">because the rest of us are living with</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.510" end="00:31:54.750" style="s2">you the rest of us are impacted by your</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.740" end="00:31:59.399" style="s2">nervous system and it&#39;s fucked-up-ness</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.750" end="00:32:00.990" style="s2">you know so it&#39;s hard enough you know on</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.399" end="00:32:02.429" style="s2">our families and our loved ones and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.990" end="00:32:06.169" style="s2">people who are right with us dealing</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.429" end="00:32:08.850" style="s2">with our the actual behaviors but</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.169" end="00:32:11.460" style="s2">everybody is dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.850" end="00:32:14.490" style="s2">incoherence you know so we kind of owe</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.460" end="00:32:16.529" style="s2">it to our collective organism to be as</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.490" end="00:32:18.210" style="s2">coherent as possible and if we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.529" end="00:32:20.730" style="s2">coherent then we should at least be</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.210" end="00:32:23.130" style="s2">quiet yeah I think this is a point</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.730" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">that&#39;s been made before that in a world</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.130" end="00:32:29.450" style="s2">of ever-expanding exponential tech no</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:31.799" style="s2">one gets to be completely up</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.450" end="00:32:37.110" style="s2">right well if you&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.799" end="00:32:40.679" style="s2">up and you&#39;re at the dashboard of you</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.110" end="00:32:43.470" style="s2">know the of the net or even if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.679" end="00:32:46.200" style="s2">got a powerful twitter account you cause</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.470" end="00:32:48.600" style="s2">a whole lot more damage than you did it</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.200" end="00:32:51.630" style="s2">used to be just some guy would you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.600" end="00:32:57.450" style="s2">stand on an Apple crate in the park and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.630" end="00:33:00.659" style="s2">say weird stuff I mean and now the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.450" end="00:33:02.510" style="s2">weirdest people and not weird in the fun</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.659" end="00:33:05.309" style="s2">way but weird in the destructive way</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.510" end="00:33:06.769" style="s2">have tremendous mouthpieces</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.309" end="00:33:08.850" style="s2">you know they&#39;d get tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.769" end="00:33:10.529" style="s2">amplification and then when you combine</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.850" end="00:33:12.630" style="s2">that with the fact that they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.529" end="00:33:14.610" style="s2">amplified on a platform that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.630" end="00:33:15.590" style="s2">designed to put people into a state of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.610" end="00:33:18.809" style="s2">terror</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.590" end="00:33:19.410" style="s2">they&#39;re going to get more amplification</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.809" end="00:33:21.140" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.410" end="00:33:25.830" style="s2">those of us who are arguing for</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.140" end="00:33:28.260" style="s2">rapprochement or moderation or even</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.830" end="00:33:30.150" style="s2">tolerance yeah and you&#39;d be a good</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.260" end="00:33:34.050" style="s2">person to ask about this we had a had a</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.150" end="00:33:36.690" style="s2">dialogue with Josh fields the CEO of</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.050" end="00:33:38.910" style="s2">consciousness hacking so their idea is</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.690" end="00:33:41.220" style="s2">that it&#39;s possible it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.910" end="00:33:43.590" style="s2">implicit in tech it&#39;s just the first</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.220" end="00:33:45.390" style="s2">generation of tools that we have and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.590" end="00:33:48.090" style="s2">potentially tech could also be the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.390" end="00:33:49.860" style="s2">solution as well as the as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.090" end="00:33:51.170" style="s2">problem do you have time for that</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.860" end="00:33:54.810" style="s2">argument or do you think there are</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.170" end="00:33:59.550" style="s2">incentives or characteristics built into</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.810" end="00:34:01.530" style="s2">the world of tech that will will kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.550" end="00:34:04.980" style="s2">act against that kind of slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.530" end="00:34:09.330" style="s2">optimistic vision I mean I have time for</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.980" end="00:34:12.360" style="s2">the argument but I think it&#39;s wrong you</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.330" end="00:34:16.110" style="s2">know I mean it&#39;s like okay now because</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.360" end="00:34:20.010" style="s2">my smartphone is making me crazy</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.110" end="00:34:22.770" style="s2">I can now install a wellness app to try</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.010" end="00:34:28.830" style="s2">to counteract the crazy that the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.770" end="00:34:32.250" style="s2">the cell phone has put on me I mean as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.830" end="00:34:33.990" style="s2">baby step maybe you know if people are</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.250" end="00:34:37.890" style="s2">so addicted to the thing that the only</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.990" end="00:34:39.600" style="s2">place to get them less addicted is</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.890" end="00:34:42.450" style="s2">through the thing itself you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.600" end="00:34:44.040" style="s2">like Jesus going into the you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.450" end="00:34:50.490" style="s2">temple with the money changers or</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.040" end="00:34:54.080" style="s2">something but it&#39;s so much so much</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.490" end="00:34:57.470" style="s2">easier than that so no I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.080" end="00:35:00.570" style="s2">believe at this stage of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.470" end="00:35:05.820" style="s2">that we should be turning to digital</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.570" end="00:35:10.650" style="s2">devices for correctives to the problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.820" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">of digital technology I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.650" end="00:35:19.350" style="s2">see it I think it&#39;s it&#39;s a desperate</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.520" end="00:35:21.180" style="s2">attempt mostly of mostly of digital</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.350" end="00:35:23.790" style="s2">business and people who have such a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.180" end="00:35:26.730" style="s2">stake in it to think that there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.790" end="00:35:29.340" style="s2">out that&#39;s that&#39;s through and and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.730" end="00:35:32.230" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t think there is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.340" end="00:35:34.330" style="s2">same question as weird</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.230" end="00:35:38.440" style="s2">the topsoil we&#39;ve got you know 30</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.330" end="00:35:42.040" style="s2">harvests left before it&#39;s all gone do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.440" end="00:35:44.770" style="s2">retrieve the aboriginal permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.040" end="00:35:47.200" style="s2">methods and crop rotation and treating</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.460" end="00:37:56.319" style="s2">well could we invent a drug that will</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.819" end="00:37:59.109" style="s2">help them sleep while they&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.319" end="00:38:03.520" style="s2">dexedrine sure let&#39;s do it let&#39;s do into</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:13.059" style="s2">you can create compensatory tech for the</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.059" end="00:38:22.119" style="s2">to compensate for it is to embed oneself</p>

<p begin="00:41:19.640" end="00:41:22.309" style="s2">comfortable kind of repeating that story</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.229" end="00:41:26.390" style="s2">I&#39;d like to I got a couple of questions</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.309" end="00:41:28.219" style="s2">I&#39;d like to ask about that so yeah I I</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.390" end="00:41:30.680" style="s2">was invited to do what I thought was a</p>

<p begin="00:41:33.589" end="00:41:37.549" style="s2">stage to do a talk they brought these</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.029" end="00:41:38.630" style="s2">five guys into the greenroom who started</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.549" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">peppering me with all these questions</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.630" end="00:41:43.819" style="s2">about the digital future you know like</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.119" end="00:41:46.489" style="s2">you know Bitcoin or aetherium and</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.819" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">augmented reality or virtual reality I</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.489" end="00:41:49.459" style="s2">figured it was one of these things where</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:51.259" style="s2">it&#39;s just these five billionaire&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.459" end="00:41:52.699" style="s2">looking for you know investment</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.259" end="00:41:55.009" style="s2">strategies from someone who&#39;s on the</p>

<p begin="00:41:55.009" end="00:41:58.640" style="s2">eventually they got around to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.719" end="00:42:00.949" style="s2">question of you know Alaska or New</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.640" end="00:42:03.739" style="s2">Zealand right so they wanted to know</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.949" end="00:42:06.920" style="s2">mainly how to prepare for the inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.739" end="00:42:09.440" style="s2">collapse of society and the question we</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.920" end="00:42:12.320" style="s2">spent most of the time on was how do I</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.440" end="00:42:14.870" style="s2">maintain control of my security force</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.320" end="00:42:16.460" style="s2">after the event because their money&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.870" end="00:42:19.700" style="s2">gonna be worthless and these guys will</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.460" end="00:42:21.950" style="s2">turn on them and it just struck me that</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.700" end="00:42:24.770" style="s2">here are the wealthiest and most</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.950" end="00:42:27.110" style="s2">powerful men I&#39;ve ever encountered yet</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.770" end="00:42:29.120" style="s2">they feel utterly powerless to influence</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.110" end="00:42:30.500" style="s2">the digital future that the best they</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.120" end="00:42:33.470" style="s2">can do is prepare for the inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.500" end="00:42:35.270" style="s2">collapse and you know insulate</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.470" end="00:42:37.460" style="s2">themselves from the reality that they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.460" end="00:42:45.590" style="s2">they&#39;re earning it and it was it was sad</p>

<p begin="00:42:51.680" end="00:42:55.460" style="s2">and Jeff Bezos they want to get off the</p>

<p begin="00:44:35.640" end="00:44:40.740" style="s2">like the dudes but invite their families</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.440" end="00:44:41.730" style="s2">too you know so that it&#39;s a community</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.740" end="00:44:44.700" style="s2">but then you might as well invite</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.730" end="00:44:46.890" style="s2">everybody so instead of figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.700" end="00:44:48.690" style="s2">to insulate yourself from the future</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.890" end="00:44:50.730" style="s2">world what if you spent your effort</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.690" end="00:44:52.080" style="s2">figuring out how to make the world a</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.730" end="00:44:54.690" style="s2">place you don&#39;t need to insulate</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.080" end="00:44:56.670" style="s2">yourself from you know which is the real</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.690" end="00:44:58.950" style="s2">answer and they should be smart enough</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.670" end="00:45:01.140" style="s2">for that and what was the impact of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.950" end="00:45:05.220" style="s2">on you like that experience were you</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.140" end="00:45:09.240" style="s2">shocked or surprised by it I was I guess</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.220" end="00:45:14.250" style="s2">I was surprised by it because I figured</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.240" end="00:45:17.940" style="s2">if I was ever in a place with really</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.250" end="00:45:19.560" style="s2">rich people I be spending the time like</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.940" end="00:45:23.060" style="s2">asking them for money to do a theater</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.560" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">project or something or you know and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.060" end="00:45:32.340" style="s2">instead I experienced them all as such</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:34.920" style="s2">kind of low-level thinkers I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.340" end="00:45:37.040" style="s2">they&#39;re smart you know and they could</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.920" end="00:45:39.480" style="s2">play out all of the walking-dead</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:43.890" style="s2">scenarios with me which is where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.480" end="00:45:45.900" style="s2">at it&#39;s sort of they&#39;re all like SimCity</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.890" end="00:45:52.310" style="s2">kind of people they all look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.900" end="00:45:55.590" style="s2">everything from this no it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.310" end="00:45:57.180" style="s2">programmers view a game developers view</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.590" end="00:46:02.810" style="s2">so they&#39;re looking at the way the game</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.180" end="00:46:02.810" style="s2">is being played and they&#39;ve gotten to</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.290" end="00:46:07.230" style="s2">the idea that there&#39;s going to be a Last</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.460" end="00:46:10.740" style="s2">Man Standing that it&#39;s this weird poker</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.230" end="00:46:14.070" style="s2">game and that one person&#39;s gonna end up</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.740" end="00:46:16.230" style="s2">winning but being utterly alone I&#39;m so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.070" end="00:46:21.420" style="s2">guess that the thing that surprised me</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.230" end="00:46:24.180" style="s2">was was there&#39;s sort of their inability</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.420" end="00:46:26.130" style="s2">to think in certain ways kind of no</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.180" end="00:46:31.910" style="s2">matter what books they read or they</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.130" end="00:46:36.980" style="s2">can&#39;t think outside of this very</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.910" end="00:46:36.980" style="s2">individualist understanding of things</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.190" end="00:46:40.220" style="s2">I mean maybe it if partly it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.900" end="00:46:41.690" style="s2">happens when you get all this money that</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.220" end="00:46:43.789" style="s2">people treat you differently so they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.690" end="00:46:47.839" style="s2">really alone and they&#39;re in the worst</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.789" end="00:46:51.200" style="s2">position possible but I don&#39;t see why it</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.839" end="00:46:52.819" style="s2">necessarily has to happen that way but</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:54.589" style="s2">yeah I was a little sad they just seemed</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.819" end="00:46:57.890" style="s2">really young they seemed like they had</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.589" end="00:47:00.140" style="s2">very childlike understandings of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.890" end="00:47:01.579" style="s2">world but it&#39;s a lot of them you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.140" end="00:47:03.319" style="s2">leave college they drop out of college</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.579" end="00:47:05.690" style="s2">when they make their first million and</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.319" end="00:47:07.190" style="s2">you know and keep going from there</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.690" end="00:47:09.170" style="s2">because this is the kind of concern I</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.190" end="00:47:11.359" style="s2">think that the I&#39;m hearing from a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.170" end="00:47:13.269" style="s2">people is this the potential for some</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.359" end="00:47:15.619" style="s2">people in Silicon Valley to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.269" end="00:47:17.420" style="s2">thinking already thinking along those</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.619" end="00:47:18.849" style="s2">lines and then why not just drive it off</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.420" end="00:47:20.900" style="s2">the cliff we&#39;ll be okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.849" end="00:47:22.309" style="s2">do you get that sense that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.900" end="00:47:24.799" style="s2">widespread or not</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.309" end="00:47:27.349" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s either widespread that way or</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.799" end="00:47:32.750" style="s2">they&#39;re cynically cynically thinking you</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.349" end="00:47:34.339" style="s2">know none of us are gonna make it or you</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.750" end="00:47:35.630" style="s2">know they remind me of I used to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.339" end="00:47:37.160" style="s2">these dreams when I was a kid where I</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.630" end="00:47:38.420" style="s2">like fall off a cliff or something but</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.160" end="00:47:40.880" style="s2">then realize that I could kind of fly</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.420" end="00:47:41.930" style="s2">and you don&#39;t just die and I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.880" end="00:47:43.880" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking that that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.930" end="00:47:48.559" style="s2">something&#39;s going to happen that will</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.880" end="00:47:51.490" style="s2">just prevent death and they&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.559" end="00:47:56.329" style="s2">about death individually not even</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.490" end="00:47:58.039" style="s2">civilizational II and that&#39;s uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.329" end="00:48:00.289" style="s2">weird but yeah they&#39;re gonna upload</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.039" end="00:48:03.890" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna something&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.289" end="00:48:06.230" style="s2">before and that&#39;s you know they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.890" end="00:48:10.099" style="s2">disconnected from from others that I get</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.230" end="00:48:12.109" style="s2">it death is really real to them and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.099" end="00:48:14.779" style="s2">there&#39;s a question I wanted to ask that</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.109" end="00:48:16.190" style="s2">we when we did our interview before just</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.779" end="00:48:18.440" style="s2">before you got into the lift I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.190" end="00:48:22.730" style="s2">know if you remember this we touched on</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.440" end="00:48:24.950" style="s2">a subject I said something like it seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.730" end="00:48:26.359" style="s2">clear that the the only solution is</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.950" end="00:48:28.430" style="s2">going to be somehow that we need to go</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.359" end="00:48:29.869" style="s2">more into the liminal and you&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.430" end="00:48:31.519" style="s2">looked at me and said yes definitely and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.869" end="00:48:33.200" style="s2">then then the lift doors closed and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.519" end="00:48:35.539" style="s2">was like oh that should definitely have</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:37.190" style="s2">been a big part of the interview so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.539" end="00:48:40.910" style="s2">have a sense of what I meant by that but</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.190" end="00:48:41.890" style="s2">I&#39;d love to check with you what you</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.910" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">meant by that</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.890" end="00:48:46.460" style="s2">well the liminal is a tricky concept for</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:50.000" style="s2">a lot of people but I mean the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.460" end="00:48:50.930" style="s2">way to describe it is you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.000" end="00:48:52.819" style="s2">think about the tick</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.930" end="00:48:54.290" style="s2">of the clock as the seconds but the</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.819" end="00:48:57.020" style="s2">seconds are not the ticks the seconds</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.290" end="00:48:58.550" style="s2">are the space between those ticks that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.020" end="00:48:59.599" style="s2">where life happens that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.550" end="00:49:01.550" style="s2">everything happens</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.599" end="00:49:05.210" style="s2">you know the digital realm understands</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.550" end="00:49:07.190" style="s2">those ticks everything and it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.210" end="00:49:11.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t hear what&#39;s happening between</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.190" end="00:49:13.309" style="s2">them and that&#39;s where love happens</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.390" end="00:49:17.150" style="s2">that&#39;s where weirdness happens that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.309" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">where humanity lives is in the space</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.150" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">between the numbers and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.160" end="00:49:27.290" style="s2">that&#39;s where we can play the place</p>
