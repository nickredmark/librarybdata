<p begin="00:14:39.579" end="00:14:44.109" style="s2">course yeah right and so our experience</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.499" end="00:15:12.579" style="s2">strange especially if you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.910" end="00:15:14.860" style="s2">about real sexual strategies I believe</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.579" end="00:15:17.619" style="s2">it on mass media like all the popular</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.860" end="00:15:19.299" style="s2">movies like the popular comedies are</p>

<p begin="00:15:23.019" end="00:15:26.799" style="s2">this guy who&#39;s a loser has no idea what</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:29.049" style="s2">to do themselves and like that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.799" end="00:15:31.269" style="s2">permeated our our mass culture so when</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.049" end="00:15:33.129" style="s2">somebody talks about being a man and</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.269" end="00:15:35.980" style="s2">finding strategies because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.129" end="00:15:37.749" style="s2">smart guys do you find a strategy any</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.980" end="00:15:39.669" style="s2">problem you have in your life and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.749" end="00:15:40.869" style="s2">think sex should be the number one thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.669" end="00:15:42.939" style="s2">for a young man to get out of the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.869" end="00:15:45.910" style="s2">right so you&#39;re not just obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.939" end="00:15:47.919" style="s2">it I was right thank you sorry yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.910" end="00:15:51.100" style="s2">my mid-20s I remember it was very</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.919" end="00:15:54.339" style="s2">difficult for me to like meet new people</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.100" end="00:15:56.860" style="s2">and you know get laid so finding that</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.339" end="00:15:57.459" style="s2">strategy like it took a lot of work to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.860" end="00:16:00.850" style="s2">go to effort</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.459" end="00:16:02.290" style="s2">found it and then it I just I mean then</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.850" end="00:16:05.050" style="s2">I became creative and involved with it</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.290" end="00:16:07.689" style="s2">right but that&#39;s not the norm now people</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.050" end="00:16:09.279" style="s2">just expect you to sit back and just you</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.689" end="00:16:11.290" style="s2">know you just don&#39;t don&#39;t talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.279" end="00:16:12.639" style="s2">yeah just just deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.290" end="00:16:15.009" style="s2">well I guess it&#39;s taboo for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.639" end="00:16:17.740" style="s2">right yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s crazy people</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.009" end="00:16:20.649" style="s2">this culture really wants men to just</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.740" end="00:16:22.269" style="s2">sit back and be passive and not take</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.649" end="00:16:23.529" style="s2">life by the balls well and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.269" end="00:16:25.389" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the reasons why guys like</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.529" end="00:16:27.550" style="s2">you and me and a lot of the fellows that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.389" end="00:16:30.429" style="s2">we ran into at the 21 convention get so</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.550" end="00:16:32.649" style="s2">much pushback is because we don&#39;t accept</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.429" end="00:16:34.809" style="s2">that premise yeah we don&#39;t accept this</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.649" end="00:16:36.189" style="s2">premise of like guys you just have to</p>

<p begin="00:42:57.199" end="00:43:01.009" style="s2">thinking the same thing idea that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.969" end="00:43:03.709" style="s2">is really like what happened to them</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.009" end="00:43:06.559" style="s2">like when it&#39;s somebody like held up a</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.709" end="00:43:08.929" style="s2">flag like an American flag to you would</p>

<p begin="00:43:19.849" end="00:43:23.509" style="s2">is the American ideal is real</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.509" end="00:43:26.660" style="s2">bringing back right now it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.429" end="00:43:29.599" style="s2">thinking now we don&#39;t have to go you</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.660" end="00:43:31.819" style="s2">know explore new frontiers but we need</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:33.109" style="s2">frontiers of the mind especially where</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.819" end="00:43:35.319" style="s2">we&#39;re headed in the future</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.109" end="00:43:38.150" style="s2">we need new ways of thinking literally</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.319" end="00:43:40.609" style="s2">well what&#39;s dangerous about about not</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.150" end="00:43:43.279" style="s2">being an independent thinker in the age</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.609" end="00:43:46.009" style="s2">of social media and and this this era in</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.279" end="00:43:47.539" style="s2">which basically like what Twitter is is</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.009" end="00:43:49.400" style="s2">like is like connecting all of our inner</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.539" end="00:43:52.429" style="s2">monologues to each other in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.400" end="00:43:55.099" style="s2">right and and and creating that Borg</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.429" end="00:43:57.890" style="s2">mine and that collective mind where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.099" end="00:43:59.419" style="s2">really easy to you know I can understand</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.890" end="00:44:01.699" style="s2">like it&#39;s really easy to fall in line</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.419" end="00:44:03.949" style="s2">and to just think what everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.699" end="00:44:06.459" style="s2">thinking cuz that&#39;s safe right yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.949" end="00:44:09.289" style="s2">in doing that we&#39;re not going to have</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.459" end="00:44:12.339" style="s2">evolution of thought we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.289" end="00:44:14.479" style="s2">have new ideas we&#39;re not gonna spark</p>

<p begin="00:44:19.609" end="00:44:27.739" style="s2">but you know we&#39;re like a bulwark</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.019" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">against this total commodification of</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.739" end="00:44:31.759" style="s2">human thinking yeah I saw it happened</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:34.249" style="s2">especially with my generation because</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.759" end="00:44:36.259" style="s2">Facebook came of age when I was in when</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.249" end="00:44:37.759" style="s2">I was in college and then so that whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.259" end="00:44:39.799" style="s2">generation of mine was sucked into</p>
