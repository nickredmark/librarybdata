<p begin="00:00:01.170" end="00:00:05.850" style="s2">what is it how do you see a work getting</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.600" end="00:00:11.280" style="s2">gave me I had it like in my head cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.850" end="00:00:12.480" style="s2">just read it before oh no no no if</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:14.519" style="s2">you&#39;ve got if you&#39;ve got a thing all</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:15.990" style="s2">lined up go ahead I just I did like five</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.519" end="00:00:17.609" style="s2">minutes of research is looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.990" end="00:00:19.830" style="s2">etymology of about the origins of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.609" end="00:00:21.720" style="s2">word where that was that was all no I</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.830" end="00:00:23.369" style="s2">just think you just say for for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.720" end="00:00:28.800" style="s2">beginning part but the question was and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.369" end="00:00:30.599" style="s2">then we take the turns and I what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:32.460" style="s2">Redemption and how do you see a working</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.599" end="00:00:34.469" style="s2">in game B&#39;s you know it&#39;s there if I</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.460" end="00:00:36.270" style="s2">don&#39;t hold on to it so strongly right</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.469" end="00:00:44.120" style="s2">would anyone like to go first</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.270" end="00:00:46.200" style="s2">I think Eric wants to go first so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.120" end="00:00:49.440" style="s2">etiology of it which I just looked up</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.200" end="00:00:51.030" style="s2">today is it&#39;s to do with paying again</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:53.399" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what what&#39;s what redemption</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.030" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">means so there the Damier is to do with</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.399" end="00:00:57.800" style="s2">payment Andrey&#39;s obviously to repay and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:00.210" style="s2">so I mean there is that sense in</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.800" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">everyday English right he redeem of out</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.210" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">show you spent when you spend your vow</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:07.080" style="s2">to you redeem it so there is there is</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:10.619" style="s2">that part of it but it has also come to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.080" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">mean like forgiveness from sin kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.619" end="00:01:14.130" style="s2">thing and I mean I think that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:16.439" style="s2">the sense in which the question was</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.130" end="00:01:17.850" style="s2">asked to go with more in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:19.710" style="s2">sense the question was asked but</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.850" end="00:01:23.070" style="s2">nevertheless the roots like the roots of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.710" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">the word lie in the notion of paying</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.070" end="00:01:29.250" style="s2">back paying again and so my biggest</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:31.829" style="s2">question around this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.250" end="00:01:33.540" style="s2">redemption has always been kind of along</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.829" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">the lines of his Redemption something</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.540" end="00:01:38.579" style="s2">that is an inner process right you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:40.890" style="s2">you&#39;ve done wrong and so you do what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.579" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">necessary both internally and in terms</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.890" end="00:01:45.420" style="s2">of you know making reparations or making</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">things right with the people that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.420" end="00:01:50.070" style="s2">wronged is that redemption or redemption</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">something that is granted by the outside</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.070" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">world to you and and that&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:01:56.939" style="s2">the main question I&#39;ve had centered</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:01:59.820" style="s2">around this but it seems as though from</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.939" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">the root of the word that is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.820" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">that it&#39;s about you right it&#39;s about you</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:05.579" style="s2">paying back for what you have done kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">of thing that that&#39;s that&#39;s the root of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.579" end="00:02:11.129" style="s2">the word is in is in repayment so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:12.810" style="s2">that I mean I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">but just because of the etiology of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.810" end="00:02:16.590" style="s2">word that&#39;s the lie</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:20.670" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna take on it and if you do see</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.590" end="00:02:22.170" style="s2">it as an inner process of putting right</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.670" end="00:02:23.820" style="s2">what&#39;s gone wrong kind of thing it</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.170" end="00:02:25.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be a grievous sin right</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.820" end="00:02:26.940" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be raping a baby kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.560" end="00:02:30.360" style="s2">of thing you know that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.940" end="00:02:37.080" style="s2">constant process of it&#39;s just the worst</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.360" end="00:02:39.600" style="s2">thing that pops into our head but you</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.080" end="00:02:42.330" style="s2">know if you see redemption as a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.600" end="00:02:44.670" style="s2">constant process of improvement right so</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.330" end="00:02:46.980" style="s2">noticing where you have fallen short of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.670" end="00:02:50.070" style="s2">you ideals that you hold for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.980" end="00:02:52.680" style="s2">and you know doing the work necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.070" end="00:02:55.590" style="s2">fall less short of those the next time</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.680" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">around kind of thing and so I see it you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.590" end="00:02:59.730" style="s2">know like so many things in the last six</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:01.830" style="s2">months or so start to see these things</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.730" end="00:03:03.300" style="s2">as directionality is right a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.830" end="00:03:05.370" style="s2">more of that a little bit less of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.300" end="00:03:07.950" style="s2">gets you going in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.370" end="00:03:10.080" style="s2">and so I I kind of see it like that so</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.950" end="00:03:13.470" style="s2">I&#39;ll stop there I think that&#39;s okay I</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.080" end="00:03:18.930" style="s2">wanted to say all right did you wanna</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.470" end="00:03:20.820" style="s2">connect security I too looked up you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.930" end="00:03:23.100" style="s2">know the words and there being two you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.820" end="00:03:25.800" style="s2">know there being two different one you</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.100" end="00:03:30.030" style="s2">know two different definitions and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.800" end="00:03:32.730" style="s2">know you know the first one being the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.030" end="00:03:34.410" style="s2">action of saving or being saved from sin</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.730" end="00:03:37.740" style="s2">you know that it&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.410" end="00:03:40.200" style="s2">external like like your that your</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.740" end="00:03:42.570" style="s2">redemption comes from the external and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.200" end="00:03:44.520" style="s2">then the other one is Eric exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.570" end="00:03:47.340" style="s2">you were talking about in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.520" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">the debt and one of the things that my</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.340" end="00:03:55.730" style="s2">husband and I talk a lot about is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:04:00.480" style="s2">way that debt language plays a role in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.730" end="00:04:03.270" style="s2">relationships and in turn in and how so</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.480" end="00:04:06.300" style="s2">much of what is happening in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.270" end="00:04:09.930" style="s2">right now is everything is transactional</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.300" end="00:04:11.550" style="s2">and it&#39;s a debt and so when if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.930" end="00:04:13.590" style="s2">talking about how does redemption you</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.550" end="00:04:16.109" style="s2">know I don&#39;t remember the exact wording</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.590" end="00:04:19.260" style="s2">of the second part of the question in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.109" end="00:04:24.590" style="s2">terms of how does redemption work in</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.260" end="00:04:25.920" style="s2">game B but to me you know there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.590" end="00:04:28.530" style="s2">there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.920" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">there&#39;s two pieces because there is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.530" end="00:04:38.280" style="s2">the part of that&#39;s my internal you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">I have committed a I have sinned I have</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.280" end="00:04:45.800" style="s2">missed them you know the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:49.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve missed the mark or my mark and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.800" end="00:04:52.370" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to figure out how to redeem</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.650" end="00:04:57.000" style="s2">you know how to pay that debt to myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.370" end="00:04:59.880" style="s2">but there is also the debt with other</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.000" end="00:05:03.330" style="s2">people you know that there is redemption</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.880" end="00:05:08.310" style="s2">a process of redemption with other</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.330" end="00:05:11.460" style="s2">people in game a it there is a process</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.310" end="00:05:13.080" style="s2">of redemption for certain crimes we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.460" end="00:05:15.210" style="s2">the process of if you if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.080" end="00:05:18.120" style="s2">committed certain types of crimes you go</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.210" end="00:05:21.960" style="s2">to prison and when you have when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.120" end="00:05:25.850" style="s2">have completed your sentence that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.960" end="00:05:29.430" style="s2">know that&#39;s your path to redemption and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.850" end="00:05:31.920" style="s2">in some cases that you know if you if</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.430" end="00:05:35.700" style="s2">you&#39;ve taken a life you know there</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.920" end="00:05:39.950" style="s2">there&#39;s maybe that maybe that is an</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.700" end="00:05:48.510" style="s2">appropriate way of a path to redemption</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.950" end="00:05:51.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a story that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.510" end="00:05:55.770" style="s2">heard recently about a tribe in Africa</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.750" end="00:05:58.010" style="s2">if you know someone if someone kills</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.770" end="00:06:01.740" style="s2">someone else the family has a choice</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.010" end="00:06:05.310" style="s2">they can either drown the person who</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.740" end="00:06:08.760" style="s2">killed the their family member or they</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.310" end="00:06:11.580" style="s2">can forgive them and the question is is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.760" end="00:06:13.530" style="s2">do you want justice or do you want like</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.580" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">the emotional salvation that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.530" end="00:06:20.930" style="s2">for forgiveness and people get to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">that decision and so you know I think I</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.930" end="00:06:26.520" style="s2">am I do a lot of work in 12-step in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:30.120" style="s2">12-step world and I talk about that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.520" end="00:06:33.570" style="s2">lot and in 12-step there is the process</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.120" end="00:06:36.210" style="s2">of amends that you you know you do them</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.570" end="00:06:37.860" style="s2">you take a personal moral inventory it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.210" end="00:06:41.730" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.860" end="00:06:45.120" style="s2">figuring out how have I missed the mark</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.730" end="00:06:47.880" style="s2">based on my standards for myself and in</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.120" end="00:06:51.540" style="s2">what ways have I harmed others in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.880" end="00:06:53.490" style="s2">process and how do I need to make amends</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.540" end="00:06:55.320" style="s2">and sometimes the men&#39;s is to myself and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.490" end="00:06:57.390" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s a financial amends</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.320" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s you know something more</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.390" end="00:07:04.010" style="s2">significant and I think that I think the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:11.610" style="s2">12-step model of the amends process is</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.010" end="00:07:13.580" style="s2">an interesting part of that and talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.610" end="00:07:18.090" style="s2">about it in terms of the morality</p>

<p begin="00:07:54.750" end="00:08:01.740" style="s2">else&#39;s and I think those are complicated</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.790" end="00:08:05.040" style="s2">confusing nuanced conversations that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.740" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">important and right now it&#39;s in game a</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.040" end="00:08:15.300" style="s2">it&#39;s if you said something that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:19.320" style="s2">colorful and no it&#39;s politically correct</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.300" end="00:08:23.280" style="s2">ten years ago you get canceled and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.320" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">because there is it there is no path to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.280" end="00:08:32.040" style="s2">redemption yet and it&#39;s up to us to hold</p>

<p begin="00:08:32.040" end="00:08:41.870" style="s2">agree with that wholeheartedly and but</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.080" end="00:08:44.150" style="s2">how do we how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.870" end="00:08:47.810" style="s2">servile with being with everyone having</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.150" end="00:08:49.970" style="s2">their own set of morality and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.810" end="00:08:54.820" style="s2">live together in an environment that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.970" end="00:08:58.670" style="s2">does that I&#39;m not sure okay I&#39;m done</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.820" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">hey Kyra Oh funny because I asked the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.670" end="00:09:04.520" style="s2">redemption question I was very much</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:06.529" style="s2">thinking about it in a group format not</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.520" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">how do you come to individual redemption</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.529" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">but how is a group do we decide when</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">somebody&#39;s no longer part of the group</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:15.589" style="s2">and is there a path back to that because</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:18.980" style="s2">it&#39;s come up in several conversations</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.589" end="00:09:21.710" style="s2">that kicking someone out is at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.980" end="00:09:23.480" style="s2">historically death you can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.710" end="00:09:25.550" style="s2">another group that&#39;s no longer the case</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.480" end="00:09:29.029" style="s2">even inking hey you know what I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.550" end="00:09:31.490" style="s2">your immediate family disowns you you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.029" end="00:09:34.760" style="s2">can find a new family it&#39;s possible if</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.490" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">and so there&#39;s also a piece of like does</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.760" end="00:09:40.370" style="s2">your reputation follow you do you get to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:42.500" style="s2">start over afresh and start with a new</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.370" end="00:09:44.839" style="s2">group and you know in some cases I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.500" end="00:09:46.160" style="s2">say yeah and in other cases no because</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.839" end="00:09:48.770" style="s2">you need people need to know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:50.540" style="s2">happened before and who makes those</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.770" end="00:09:51.980" style="s2">decisions who gets to decide what</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.540" end="00:09:57.320" style="s2">follows you and what doesn&#39;t follow you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.980" end="00:09:59.240" style="s2">and that there is the group itself gets</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.320" end="00:10:00.410" style="s2">to kind of decide when and how people</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.240" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">are kicked out in the path to redemption</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.410" end="00:10:05.990" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s a higher level group</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:08.120" style="s2">that needs to kind of make sure there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.990" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">a place for everyone or at least own</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.120" end="00:10:13.520" style="s2">that kicking someone out of all over the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:15.650" style="s2">places equals death and that is canceled</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.520" end="00:10:17.480" style="s2">culture it&#39;s like not only am I not</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.650" end="00:10:18.620" style="s2">talking to you nobody can talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.480" end="00:10:20.360" style="s2">and I&#39;m not talking to anyone who talks</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.620" end="00:10:25.310" style="s2">to you and like this bridge is burnt</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.360" end="00:10:27.050" style="s2">like it&#39;s done and so but like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.310" end="00:10:28.339" style="s2">we do that with a sense of like oh but</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.050" end="00:10:30.080" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean death I just want you</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.339" end="00:10:32.089" style="s2">to let go live on is a hermit somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.080" end="00:10:35.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s death is humanity like</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.089" end="00:10:39.080" style="s2">that is actually making sure that there</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.320" end="00:10:40.870" style="s2">is a place for every individual even if</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.080" end="00:10:43.130" style="s2">that place isn&#39;t within our group and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.870" end="00:10:45.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a level we have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.130" end="00:10:46.850" style="s2">that with well well owning that truth</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.500" end="00:10:50.060" style="s2">and if it&#39;s kicked out of the higher</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.850" end="00:10:53.240" style="s2">level then that does mean death and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.060" end="00:10:54.900" style="s2">at the at the smaller group level you</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.240" end="00:10:56.670" style="s2">can have</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.900" end="00:10:57.930" style="s2">right you don&#39;t belong here for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.670" end="00:10:59.460" style="s2">metric reason maybe you didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.930" end="00:11:01.080" style="s2">anything egregious but like you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.460" end="00:11:02.580" style="s2">intellectually capable or you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.080" end="00:11:04.890" style="s2">emotionally capable or you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.580" end="00:11:06.810" style="s2">there&#39;s some metric that like no sorry</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.890" end="00:11:09.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a barrier to entry and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.810" end="00:11:10.950" style="s2">make it but there&#39;s somewhere for you</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.060" end="00:11:14.880" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s a difference between a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.950" end="00:11:18.060" style="s2">group that is like you&#39;re you luck into</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.880" end="00:11:19.350" style="s2">entering like your family right where</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.060" end="00:11:21.690" style="s2">it&#39;s like getting kicked out of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.350" end="00:11:23.190" style="s2">family should be a higher barrier but it</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.690" end="00:11:24.540" style="s2">exists and some some people it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.190" end="00:11:26.070" style="s2">high barrier it&#39;s like oh you happen to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.540" end="00:11:29.220" style="s2">be born gay you know you&#39;re not part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.070" end="00:11:31.880" style="s2">our family anymore but the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.220" end="00:11:34.140" style="s2">groups that we choose to be part of are</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.880" end="00:11:35.790" style="s2">and is there a difference right between</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.140" end="00:11:37.410" style="s2">like getting kicked out of your family</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.790" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">versus getting kicked out of a hobby</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.410" end="00:11:42.330" style="s2">Girt that you&#39;re part of right and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:45.240" style="s2">what that is and I think that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.330" end="00:11:47.010" style="s2">big piece of that word justice and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.240" end="00:11:49.350" style="s2">whatever the opposite of justice is like</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.010" end="00:11:51.480" style="s2">we want that justice at the same time it</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.350" end="00:11:53.070" style="s2">stops the other piece it stops the light</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.480" end="00:11:54.779" style="s2">right but you want them to get better do</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.070" end="00:11:56.460" style="s2">you want to society that functions or do</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.779" end="00:11:59.490" style="s2">we want to have justice do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.460" end="00:12:01.709" style="s2">have revenge on people and those are</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.490" end="00:12:03.660" style="s2">things that gain be whatever it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.709" end="00:12:05.700" style="s2">gonna have to figure out because of all</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.660" end="00:12:08.459" style="s2">of these levels and the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.700" end="00:12:12.600" style="s2">the group and bigger meta groups of like</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.459" end="00:12:14.220" style="s2">decided on these levels and to own that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.600" end="00:12:17.970" style="s2">if you kick somebody out of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.220" end="00:12:19.500" style="s2">group level it equals death and to own</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.970" end="00:12:20.790" style="s2">that so that you&#39;re literally giving</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.500" end="00:12:23.070" style="s2">them the death penalty even if you were</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.790" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">not firing a bullet at them is it worth</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.070" end="00:12:27.510" style="s2">it did they do something so egregious do</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:37.230" style="s2">we agree with the death I&#39;m holding it</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.510" end="00:12:46.490" style="s2">right so that&#39;s that&#39;s fine Jubilee I</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.230" end="00:12:46.490" style="s2">liked that part of understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.879" end="00:12:52.999" style="s2">understanding the reaper cut you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.689" end="00:12:55.310" style="s2">like okay if I&#39;m choosing to kick</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.999" end="00:13:01.089" style="s2">someone out of all you know of all</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.310" end="00:13:04.189" style="s2">groups then I am you know essentially</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.089" end="00:13:07.009" style="s2">causing them death and you know it when</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.189" end="00:13:12.740" style="s2">groups lived in you know tribes of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.009" end="00:13:15.139" style="s2">Dunbar number you know there was a you</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.740" end="00:13:18.199" style="s2">knew that you knew that if someone was</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.139" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">kicked out of the tribe then it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.199" end="00:13:24.470" style="s2">death and whereas now like well you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:26.660" style="s2">just go and you can just join another</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.470" end="00:13:32.990" style="s2">tribe or you know but the the cancel</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.660" end="00:13:38.059" style="s2">culture you know wanting to you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.990" end="00:13:40.850" style="s2">it&#39;s this all-or-nothing you have you</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.500" end="00:14:06.769" style="s2">been involved in a lot of discussions</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:12.500" style="s2">recently about you know what it means to</p>

<p begin="00:14:12.500" end="00:14:25.370" style="s2">do you I think part of the path in game</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.699" end="00:14:29.420" style="s2">B is loosening our grip on our moral</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.490" end="00:15:33.420" style="s2">person going through the 12 steps the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.410" end="00:15:36.690" style="s2">person going through the 12 steps yeah</p>

<p begin="00:16:01.080" end="00:16:04.740" style="s2">but for the person to get to choose what</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.520" end="00:16:06.300" style="s2">the amends is but I guess it&#39;s cuz</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.740" end="00:16:07.560" style="s2">you&#39;re getting right as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.300" end="00:16:12.150" style="s2">getting right with the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.560" end="00:16:13.760" style="s2">it&#39;s more like you&#39;re right and it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.150" end="00:16:17.820" style="s2">it&#39;s about you getting right with</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.760" end="00:16:20.339" style="s2">yourself versus getting right with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.820" end="00:16:27.540" style="s2">relationship now a lot of times when you</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.339" end="00:16:29.910" style="s2">do it it&#39;s you&#39;ve the most often you</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.540" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">know one of the parts of the 12 steps is</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.910" end="00:16:33.810" style="s2">that you go through you go through them</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:35.940" style="s2">with a sponsor someone who has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.810" end="00:16:37.380" style="s2">through them before someone who helps</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.940" end="00:16:39.510" style="s2">you you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.380" end="00:16:41.850" style="s2">simply making that decision and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:16:49.320" end="00:16:56.520" style="s2">of and what you know and what fits the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.280" end="00:17:00.120" style="s2">crime and you know it&#39;s getting right</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.520" end="00:17:01.890" style="s2">with your own conscience there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.120" end="00:17:04.410" style="s2">something there for the path to</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.890" end="00:17:06.329" style="s2">redemption game because it&#39;s like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.410" end="00:17:07.920" style="s2">the sponsors not neutral they&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.329" end="00:17:09.780" style="s2">neutral party they&#39;re clearly more in it</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.920" end="00:17:10.819" style="s2">for the person they know then the person</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.780" end="00:17:12.470" style="s2">wronged but if this</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.819" end="00:17:13.730" style="s2">in time they&#39;ve been wronged by people</p>

<p begin="00:17:13.730" end="00:17:17.329" style="s2">right down to it I know that&#39;s not an OK</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.620" end="00:17:21.709" style="s2">in amends you need to do more than that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.329" end="00:17:24.860" style="s2">but having that kind of external but</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.709" end="00:17:27.799" style="s2">loving in a way support system to say</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.539" end="00:17:34.789" style="s2">sponsor I don&#39;t get to choose whether</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.620" end="00:17:37.880" style="s2">the other person forgives you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.789" end="00:17:39.860" style="s2">whether that&#39;s that&#39;s okay but I can say</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.880" end="00:17:41.960" style="s2">that I can help you do that where it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:17:47.509" end="00:17:52.159" style="s2">it&#39;s for the opposite maybe someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.750" end="00:17:53.840" style="s2">comes up with a horrible Redemption and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.159" end="00:17:56.389" style="s2">there is this like I just say forgive me</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.840" end="00:18:00.399" style="s2">and like to be able to hold that space</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.389" end="00:18:03.049" style="s2">more well na de charlie and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.399" end="00:18:07.700" style="s2">one of the big pieces of it is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.049" end="00:18:10.429" style="s2">going in with the desert of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.700" end="00:18:13.879" style="s2">you&#39;re you may have the desire to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.429" end="00:18:17.690" style="s2">forgiven but you may go in and and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.879" end="00:18:19.190" style="s2">all it is is that you know Ana is making</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.690" end="00:18:21.320" style="s2">an amends for something that you said</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.190" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">you know the some way that you&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.320" end="00:18:27.169" style="s2">know wronged someone by something that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:30.950" style="s2">you&#39;ve said or you know gossip or you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.169" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">know something like that and saying what</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.950" end="00:18:37.990" style="s2">you have to say and then sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.600" end="00:18:42.500" style="s2">quietly whatever comes back at you and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.990" end="00:18:44.419" style="s2">not getting defensive and just trusting</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.500" end="00:18:49.309" style="s2">that whatever you know whatever comes</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.419" end="00:18:53.960" style="s2">back in return is appropriate and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.309" end="00:18:55.990" style="s2">know more often than not like you hear</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.960" end="00:18:59.210" style="s2">stories in 12-step all the time where</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.990" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">somebody goes and makes an amends and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.210" end="00:19:04.820" style="s2">the person is still angry and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:07.129" style="s2">want to forgive them and then years</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.820" end="00:19:11.929" style="s2">later they&#39;re going and doing their own</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.129" end="00:19:16.970" style="s2">amends so like it is this looks</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.929" end="00:19:18.620" style="s2">definitely a circular thing because you</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.970" end="00:19:20.149" style="s2">know it&#39;s like somebody can hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.620" end="00:19:21.710" style="s2">their whatever their anger is and they</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.149" end="00:19:24.140" style="s2">you say that&#39;s not good enough</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.710" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">and ultimately it usually ends up</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.140" end="00:19:28.070" style="s2">poisoning that person more than it does</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:30.529" style="s2">the person who made way more than the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.070" end="00:19:32.570" style="s2">person who made the amends mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.529" end="00:19:33.830" style="s2">but then it also is like so you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.570" end="00:19:37.460" style="s2">to make the amends and you&#39;ve left them</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.830" end="00:19:40.190" style="s2">with poison okay and but that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.460" end="00:19:42.890" style="s2">that person yeah yeah if I&#39;ve made the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.190" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">amends and not person chooses to hold on</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.890" end="00:19:50.029" style="s2">to it that just we&#39;re yeah but there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:52.039" style="s2">some egregious thing I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.029" end="00:19:53.480" style="s2">forgive you for hurting my child and at</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.039" end="00:19:55.990" style="s2">the same time then you&#39;ve come and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.480" end="00:20:00.710" style="s2">stirred that up again and then like</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.990" end="00:20:05.779" style="s2">right well there is part so that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.710" end="00:20:07.820" style="s2">the 12 steps that step 9 and we make we</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.779" end="00:20:09.950" style="s2">made amends wherever possible except</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.820" end="00:20:13.130" style="s2">when to when to do so would injure them</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.950" end="00:20:15.110" style="s2">or others and there&#39;s like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.130" end="00:20:16.669" style="s2">question like one of the ones that can</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.110" end="00:20:19.640" style="s2">come up is like somebody broke the law</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.669" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">and they&#39;re wanting to make amends but</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.640" end="00:20:26.029" style="s2">if they now but if they now bring it up</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">like it could devastate their entire</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.029" end="00:20:32.210" style="s2">family you know they they they have now</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:35.390" style="s2">like you know built a family and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.210" end="00:20:39.049" style="s2">everything else but and and if they you</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.390" end="00:20:41.149" style="s2">know go and say okay I broke this law</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.049" end="00:20:45.429" style="s2">and could end up in jail you know you</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.149" end="00:20:48.830" style="s2">it&#39;s like figuring out what makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.429" end="00:20:51.110" style="s2">yeah and to me also when you had shared</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.830" end="00:20:52.700" style="s2">your piece in the beginning with that in</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.110" end="00:20:54.559" style="s2">game a that you go to jail and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.700" end="00:20:55.640" style="s2">you&#39;re it&#39;s that&#39;s theoretically a road</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.559" end="00:20:57.970" style="s2">to redemption and then your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.640" end="00:21:01.070" style="s2">have served your I don&#39;t the worthiness</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.970" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">servant yours and since I like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.070" end="00:21:04.130" style="s2">you&#39;ve done what you said like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:06.409" style="s2">committed the crime you&#39;ve served your</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.130" end="00:21:08.779" style="s2">sentence that you&#39;re redeemed but in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.409" end="00:21:10.850" style="s2">way that&#39;s true no matter what the crime</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.779" end="00:21:12.590" style="s2">is in under the law you&#39;re redeems but</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.850" end="00:21:14.120" style="s2">also it&#39;s absolutely not true because</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.590" end="00:21:15.980" style="s2">your criminal record follows you for</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.120" end="00:21:18.890" style="s2">your entire life and people don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.980" end="00:21:20.029" style="s2">necessarily know like you&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.890" end="00:21:20.990" style="s2">gonna hire someone with a criminal</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.029" end="00:21:23.750" style="s2">record you&#39;re not going to necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.990" end="00:21:25.399" style="s2">get there they&#39;re yes here&#39;s why I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.750" end="00:21:27.440" style="s2">there I was in an addiction I was you</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.399" end="00:21:29.350" style="s2">know this this big long story and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.440" end="00:21:31.850" style="s2">therefore having committed a crime once</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.350" end="00:21:33.889" style="s2">means that it there is no road to</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.850" end="00:21:35.260" style="s2">redemption right it&#39;s always gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.889" end="00:21:36.640" style="s2">mark on your record</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.340" end="00:21:48.820" style="s2">if like you have actually served your</p>

<p begin="00:21:48.820" end="00:21:54.370" style="s2">system in that the same way and how do</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.420" end="00:21:55.960" style="s2">we make sure there&#39;s space for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.370" end="00:21:57.730" style="s2">because there is a certain amount of</p>

<p begin="00:22:07.180" end="00:22:12.940" style="s2">it&#39;s really difficult you know sorry for</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.080" end="00:22:15.480" style="s2">this this we need three different words</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.940" end="00:22:18.280" style="s2">he wrote there&#39;s three clearly different</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.480" end="00:22:20.110" style="s2">domains within this notion of redemption</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.280" end="00:22:22.270" style="s2">and they&#39;re and they are as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.110" end="00:22:23.680" style="s2">tell largely separate things right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.270" end="00:22:25.900" style="s2">so in the nothing that in the example</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.680" end="00:22:27.340" style="s2">you&#39;ve given of a crime being committed</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.900" end="00:22:29.620" style="s2">you serve your sentence and you are</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.340" end="00:22:31.540" style="s2">redeemed in the eyes of the law but and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.620" end="00:22:33.940" style="s2">exactly as DubLi pointed out by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.540" end="00:22:36.100" style="s2">letter of the law by the system you are</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.940" end="00:22:37.660" style="s2">redeemed by the society you are not</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.100" end="00:22:38.860" style="s2">right you you you have not achieved</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.660" end="00:22:41.110" style="s2">Redemption and whether you&#39;ve achieved</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.860" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">redemption inside yourself whether</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.110" end="00:22:44.530" style="s2">you&#39;ve forgiven yourself for the crime</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:47.650" style="s2">come to terms with whatever that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.530" end="00:22:49.900" style="s2">that&#39;s a third and separate thing right</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.650" end="00:22:51.220" style="s2">and you know it may be easier to come to</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.900" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">terms with it you ruin yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.220" end="00:22:54.370" style="s2">if those around you have forgiven you</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">for it you&#39;ve been accepted back into</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.370" end="00:23:00.490" style="s2">the tribe or the society and so on but</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:03.610" style="s2">they are three largely separate things</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.490" end="00:23:07.480" style="s2">I&#39;m not actually sure that Redemption is</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.610" end="00:23:10.870" style="s2">the right word for serving a sentence in</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.480" end="00:23:13.000" style="s2">a prison unless of course your record is</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.870" end="00:23:14.740" style="s2">expunged afterwards right and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.000" end="00:23:18.430" style="s2">follow you around in any way then then</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.740" end="00:23:19.990" style="s2">possibly so but I I&#39;m really sorry to</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.430" end="00:23:22.900" style="s2">come back to where we started because</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.990" end="00:23:25.570" style="s2">there was one thing in your opening</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.900" end="00:23:27.670" style="s2">Keira which stuck with me as well which</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.570" end="00:23:31.180" style="s2">I&#39;d like to come back to was the idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.670" end="00:23:33.190" style="s2">that game a I come here exactly how you</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.180" end="00:23:35.890" style="s2">phrase the game a is characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.190" end="00:23:37.900" style="s2">other by needing to follow the morality</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.890" end="00:23:40.660" style="s2">imposed on you by other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.900" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">whereas game B is more about an</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.660" end="00:23:44.260" style="s2">exploration of your own morality right</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:46.180" style="s2">and then the difficulty comes what</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.260" end="00:23:47.500" style="s2">happens with morality z&#39; differing</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.180" end="00:23:48.970" style="s2">moralities have to live in the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.500" end="00:23:54.789" style="s2">space and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.970" end="00:23:56.380" style="s2">so it needs that we&#39;re going slightly</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.789" end="00:23:58.840" style="s2">off the topic of redemption here but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.380" end="00:24:00.610" style="s2">but I think this is a really important</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.840" end="00:24:02.470" style="s2">thing that this this idea of different</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.610" end="00:24:03.549" style="s2">morality living together it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.470" end="00:24:05.919" style="s2">what you mean by different moralities</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.549" end="00:24:09.039" style="s2">right I mean and this is a personal</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.919" end="00:24:10.150" style="s2">thing but for me if the actor is acting</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:12.220" style="s2">in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.150" end="00:24:13.780" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s it you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.220" end="00:24:16.510" style="s2">everything else should be dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.780" end="00:24:18.730" style="s2">from that position it&#39;s just a question</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.510" end="00:24:22.179" style="s2">of are the actors acting in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.730" end="00:24:24.760" style="s2">as best they can right what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.179" end="00:24:27.059" style="s2">to act in good faith well that no III</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.760" end="00:24:29.620" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a deliberately vague</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.059" end="00:24:31.419" style="s2">thing but we will understand the notion</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.620" end="00:24:32.650" style="s2">right we might disagree in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.419" end="00:24:34.900" style="s2">about whether someone is or is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.650" end="00:24:36.820" style="s2">acting in good faith right but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.900" end="00:24:38.230" style="s2">notion of what it means to act in good</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.820" end="00:24:40.390" style="s2">faith is something we can all agree on</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.230" end="00:24:42.850" style="s2">right that the principle is something we</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.390" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">could we can all agree on would do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.850" end="00:24:47.740" style="s2">see what I mean as opposed to a in any</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">given moment evaluating whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.740" end="00:24:51.370" style="s2">that&#39;s going on that can cause it that</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.360" end="00:24:57.150" style="s2">that&#39;s a source of disagreement for sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.370" end="00:25:00.330" style="s2">yeah for me I think of it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.150" end="00:25:03.070" style="s2">there&#39;s this concept called generosity</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.330" end="00:25:04.570" style="s2">assuming the best intentions of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.070" end="00:25:07.890" style="s2">other person you know assuming that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.570" end="00:25:07.890" style="s2">other person has the best intentions</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.640" end="00:25:13.330" style="s2">yeah I mean I get I guess so but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.409" end="00:25:14.770" style="s2">you very I mean if someone doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.330" end="00:25:16.720" style="s2">the best intentions making that</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.770" end="00:25:18.580" style="s2">assumption very quickly makes you into a</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.720" end="00:25:23.740" style="s2">punching bag or a fool or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.580" end="00:25:25.990" style="s2">know so yeah yes but up to a point I I</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.740" end="00:25:28.240" style="s2">don&#39;t see it as an absolute position yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.990" end="00:25:30.580" style="s2">up to a point in an in an initial</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.240" end="00:25:33.580" style="s2">interaction yeah yeah yeah yeah that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.580" end="00:25:37.570" style="s2">would extend that you know if if you say</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.580" end="00:25:43.240" style="s2">something that&#39;s like completely gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.570" end="00:25:45.429" style="s2">front to my morality and assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.240" end="00:25:48.970" style="s2">you&#39;re not you know making you know you</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.429" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">say something and assume like say you</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.970" end="00:25:57.539" style="s2">call me names or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:57.539" style="s2">assuming that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.779" end="00:26:03.690" style="s2">that there&#39;s a valid reason for that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.029" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">not immediately jumping to the I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.690" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">fight with you because you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.499" end="00:26:14.789" style="s2">there&#39;s like one of the reasons this</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.639" end="00:26:17.639" style="s2">question came up was in the game be</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.789" end="00:26:20.369" style="s2">space I interacted with somebody who had</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.639" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">their reputation follow them and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.369" end="00:26:23.549" style="s2">honestly don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:26.099" style="s2">it&#39;s up to me to judge whether the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.549" end="00:26:27.989" style="s2">reputation is fair or not right whether</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.099" end="00:26:30.599" style="s2">they did the thing they said you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.989" end="00:26:33.779" style="s2">they they admit to doing 70% of it I</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.599" end="00:26:37.309" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what 100% or 70% is but</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.779" end="00:26:41.149" style="s2">it was having my interaction with them</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.309" end="00:26:45.029" style="s2">which is recorded but not public and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.149" end="00:26:47.159" style="s2">realiz and how much power I had it that</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.029" end="00:26:49.109" style="s2">in that interaction that I wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.159" end="00:26:50.399" style="s2">until the conversation didn&#39;t really own</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.109" end="00:26:52.529" style="s2">that I could record it then I could edit</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.399" end="00:26:55.469" style="s2">it that I can do things with it and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.529" end="00:26:58.889" style="s2">make him look bad but also like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.469" end="00:27:00.330" style="s2">just there are people who are sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.889" end="00:27:02.969" style="s2">and I just looked up with the actual</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.330" end="00:27:05.210" style="s2">proper proper name for the newer name</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.969" end="00:27:08.519" style="s2">which is antisocial personality disorder</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.210" end="00:27:11.129" style="s2">who are actually really good at</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.519" end="00:27:12.659" style="s2">mimicking not being right they can read</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.129" end="00:27:14.460" style="s2">the people they can do it and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.659" end="00:27:17.759" style="s2">there&#39;s people who are what I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.460" end="00:27:20.339" style="s2">label autistic like myself who come off</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.759" end="00:27:22.259" style="s2">like people associate not me necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.339" end="00:27:24.479" style="s2">but associate people who have that under</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.259" end="00:27:26.909" style="s2">that umbrella as being antisocial</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.479" end="00:27:30.269" style="s2">without the intense being there right</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.909" end="00:27:32.489" style="s2">like without office where it&#39;s like no I</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.269" end="00:27:34.169" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the rules if I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.489" end="00:27:35.789" style="s2">stood the runway but I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.169" end="00:27:37.229" style="s2">them versus I know the rules and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.789" end="00:27:39.330" style="s2">choosing to break them in my own benefit</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.229" end="00:27:40.769" style="s2">and as a human you can&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.330" end="00:27:43.349" style="s2">tell the difference that&#39;s an individual</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.769" end="00:27:45.330" style="s2">sorry yeah but there&#39;s a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.349" end="00:27:47.789" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t matter in certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.330" end="00:27:49.320" style="s2">interactions where it&#39;s like if I assume</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.789" end="00:27:51.599" style="s2">you have a good intent that&#39;s gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.320" end="00:27:53.729" style="s2">me better but also I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.599" end="00:27:57.719" style="s2">underlining that you could have bad</p>

<p begin="00:35:23.160" end="00:35:27.329" style="s2">you know it is one of those things of</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.319" end="00:35:28.440" style="s2">you know if you they&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.329" end="00:35:29.369" style="s2">reading you know there are different</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.440" end="00:35:32.329" style="s2">reasons I won&#39;t say that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.369" end="00:35:36.299" style="s2">exclusively why people end up there but</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.329" end="00:35:38.069" style="s2">no I think that is like start going no</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.299" end="00:35:39.420" style="s2">no no I was just saying that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.069" end="00:35:43.500" style="s2">entirely reasonable there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.420" end="00:35:44.940" style="s2">lots of people with societal challenges</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.500" end="00:35:46.319" style="s2">let&#39;s put it that way of one kind or</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.940" end="00:35:48.119" style="s2">another right and they get kicked out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.319" end="00:35:51.059" style="s2">group after group after group and as you</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.119" end="00:35:54.390" style="s2">say this is yeah one place that they</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.059" end="00:35:56.609" style="s2">know they will be accepted well I do and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.390" end="00:35:58.920" style="s2">so and so just one very final thought</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.609" end="00:36:00.450" style="s2">that and that their tendency towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.920" end="00:36:01.890" style="s2">addiction of one sort or another is</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.450" end="00:36:06.150" style="s2">likely to be greater because of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.890" end="00:36:07.920" style="s2">sense of alienation right and do they</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.150" end="00:36:09.270" style="s2">high don&#39;t know so I&#39;m not one of those</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.920" end="00:36:11.579" style="s2">like do they have a sense of alienation</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.270" end="00:36:13.589" style="s2">part of it is they don&#39;t they have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.579" end="00:36:16.049" style="s2">self preserver they like themselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.589" end="00:36:17.579" style="s2">right at the narcissism but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.049" end="00:36:18.930" style="s2">necessarily have that need for</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.579" end="00:36:20.490" style="s2">connection or maybe they I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.930" end="00:36:22.470" style="s2">actually know because I&#39;m not know like</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.490" end="00:36:24.150" style="s2">because it&#39;s no use right they need they</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.470" end="00:36:26.010" style="s2">do need an audience yeah they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.150" end="00:36:27.329" style="s2">office or sociopath you need an audience</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.010" end="00:36:29.849" style="s2">where you need people to manipulate play</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.329" end="00:36:31.500" style="s2">with and that is so those people being</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.849" end="00:36:32.670" style="s2">in a group together and this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.500" end="00:36:33.750" style="s2">what I suggest is person I had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.670" end="00:36:35.190" style="s2">conversation with it&#39;s like well if</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.750" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">you&#39;re not welcome at my table I need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.190" end="00:36:38.700" style="s2">make sure there&#39;s a table for you but</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:40.349" style="s2">the table is gonna be filled with people</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.700" end="00:36:42.450" style="s2">like you and it&#39;s like yeah that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.349" end="00:36:44.430" style="s2">like a horrific place to be and part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.450" end="00:36:46.530" style="s2">the issue is that like must stamping</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.430" end="00:36:48.359" style="s2">people versus that like a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.530" end="00:36:50.520" style="s2">narcissists together that&#39;s gonna be all</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.359" end="00:36:52.740" style="s2">of their worst nightmare but like fun</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.520" end="00:36:54.210" style="s2">you like figure that out figure out who</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.740" end="00:36:57.540" style="s2">that is a bunch of autistic people</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.210" end="00:36:59.250" style="s2">together I live in that like I online</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.540" end="00:37:01.650" style="s2">and it&#39;s beautiful because we got like</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.250" end="00:37:01.980" style="s2">we call each other out in ways that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.650" end="00:37:03.869" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.980" end="00:37:05.850" style="s2">that&#39;s not okay no that&#39;s not that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.869" end="00:37:08.220" style="s2">you don&#39;t get to put that under this</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.850" end="00:37:09.510" style="s2">umbrella you don&#39;t get to like yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.220" end="00:37:10.950" style="s2">get that you don&#39;t understand those</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.510" end="00:37:13.170" style="s2">rules but that&#39;s going too far that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.950" end="00:37:14.970" style="s2">stalking that&#39;s doing it and it actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.170" end="00:37:18.540" style="s2">works out really well and also not</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.970" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">because autistic people all generally</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.540" end="00:37:25.619" style="s2">have two sides of every person is</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:27.810" style="s2">completely different and it generally is</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.619" end="00:37:29.520" style="s2">two extremes it&#39;s like your sensory</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.810" end="00:37:31.050" style="s2">seeking or your sensory avoidance so</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:31.770" style="s2">what works for one person wouldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.050" end="00:37:33.720" style="s2">for another</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.770" end="00:37:35.550" style="s2">but because we&#39;re aware of that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.720" end="00:37:38.430" style="s2">something about being able to work</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.550" end="00:37:39.990" style="s2">together that works that like is like we</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.430" end="00:37:41.640" style="s2">can own that it doesn&#39;t work so it works</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.990" end="00:37:43.109" style="s2">whereas I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.640" end="00:37:44.340" style="s2">necessarily with narcissus because they</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.109" end="00:37:45.810" style="s2">need the audience they need the people</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.340" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">to manipulate and they&#39;re the worst at</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.810" end="00:37:49.920" style="s2">manipulating each other they can&#39;t write</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:51.510" style="s2">because they&#39;re all everyone&#39;s like me</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.920" end="00:37:53.490" style="s2">everyone&#39;s in are everyone&#39;s out to get</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.510" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">their best interests so I&#39;m out to get</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.490" end="00:37:57.420" style="s2">my best interest and there isn&#39;t people</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:59.420" style="s2">to like play it with which to me is like</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.420" end="00:38:05.970" style="s2">go play your own game figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.420" end="00:38:11.160" style="s2">well and I think there&#39;s so going back</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.970" end="00:38:12.680" style="s2">to John for Vicki in the last episode</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.160" end="00:38:17.340" style="s2">that I watched of him he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.680" end="00:38:19.830" style="s2">the right now he&#39;s at the place where</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.340" end="00:38:22.440" style="s2">it&#39;s he&#39;s talking about Martin Luther</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.830" end="00:38:26.940" style="s2">and the schism of Protestantism from</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.440" end="00:38:28.590" style="s2">Catholicism and the and also the start</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.940" end="00:38:31.880" style="s2">of the Scientific Revolution and those</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.590" end="00:38:31.880" style="s2">things those two things together</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.930" end="00:38:40.740" style="s2">specifically create a situation of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.090" end="00:38:47.090" style="s2">narcissistic cultures that like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.740" end="00:38:50.030" style="s2">thought process that they or the the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.090" end="00:38:54.510" style="s2">grammar that came out of their thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.030" end="00:38:56.790" style="s2">creates a situation um I</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.510" end="00:38:58.290" style="s2">he said he talks about a narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.790" end="00:39:00.420" style="s2">culture I don&#39;t know if he means like</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.290" end="00:39:03.000" style="s2">all the individuals within the culture</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.420" end="00:39:05.820" style="s2">are narcissistic or the the culture</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.000" end="00:39:12.270" style="s2">itself being narcissistic but you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.820" end="00:39:14.220" style="s2">addressing the you know I need to dig</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.270" end="00:39:15.720" style="s2">into that more and understand more but</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.220" end="00:39:22.970" style="s2">you know if</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.720" end="00:39:22.970" style="s2">the tendency towards narcissism is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.619" end="00:39:34.260" style="s2">side a side effect of the cultural the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.990" end="00:39:37.560" style="s2">the cultural grammar that we have been</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.260" end="00:39:41.160" style="s2">born into then there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.560" end="00:39:45.930" style="s2">extremes and so you know in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.160" end="00:39:48.119" style="s2">cases people who end up in like AAA or</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.930" end="00:39:51.020" style="s2">NA there there&#39;s there&#39;s several</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.119" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">different 12-step groups but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.020" end="00:39:55.109" style="s2">something called ACA which is adult</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:59.579" style="s2">children of alcoholics and dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.109" end="00:40:02.040" style="s2">families and that&#39;s for because once we</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.579" end="00:40:05.640" style="s2">get sober you kind of realize oh wait a</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.040" end="00:40:07.410" style="s2">minute that didn&#39;t actually fixed a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.640" end="00:40:10.170" style="s2">of the shame that I feel that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.410" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">underneath that comes from you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.170" end="00:40:13.890" style="s2">fact that I grew up in a dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:16.470" style="s2">family where the goalposts was</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.890" end="00:40:19.680" style="s2">constantly being moved and I wa and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.470" end="00:40:24.030" style="s2">shame was the main tool used to get me</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.680" end="00:40:27.180" style="s2">to behave and so it it&#39;s it&#39;s very and</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.030" end="00:40:29.069" style="s2">if you grew up with a narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.180" end="00:40:31.829" style="s2">parent the likelihood that you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.069" end="00:40:36.109" style="s2">to be a narcissist is very high but</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.829" end="00:40:40.470" style="s2">there is also a path out of that if one</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.109" end="00:40:43.530" style="s2">so it&#39;s this you know I would I I have</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.470" end="00:40:47.940" style="s2">I&#39;m okay with acknowledging that I am</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.530" end="00:40:50.640" style="s2">that I am on that narcissistic spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.940" end="00:40:52.560" style="s2">I mean I think everyone I think everyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.640" end="00:40:54.810" style="s2">exists on the narcissistic spectrum but</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.560" end="00:40:56.069" style="s2">I&#39;m further over on that side just</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.810" end="00:41:01.140" style="s2">because of the environment that I grew</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.069" end="00:41:06.599" style="s2">up in and and so I have to do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.140" end="00:41:10.260" style="s2">work in order to heal all of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.599" end="00:41:13.230" style="s2">that I got and in order to you know and</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.260" end="00:41:15.210" style="s2">and so like I have a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.230" end="00:41:19.619" style="s2">tools that help me on that path to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.210" end="00:41:20.620" style="s2">redemption so I don&#39;t know if that again</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.619" end="00:41:24.170" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.620" end="00:41:25.850" style="s2">what makes that space well if I can just</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.170" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">slightly put it into a different frame</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.850" end="00:41:29.180" style="s2">exactly what you were saying but just in</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:31.490" style="s2">a slightly different framework and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.180" end="00:41:33.830" style="s2">the idea of niche creation right and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.490" end="00:41:37.010" style="s2">in the culture in which we exist there</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.830" end="00:41:39.050" style="s2">are advantages to exploiting the niche</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.010" end="00:41:40.790" style="s2">of being a narcissist right you can get</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.050" end="00:41:42.320" style="s2">the sense of validation you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.790" end="00:41:43.610" style="s2">mean you can get the attention of others</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.320" end="00:41:44.990" style="s2">this kind of thing by behaving in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.610" end="00:41:49.100" style="s2">statistic way similar similarly</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.990" end="00:41:51.620" style="s2">sociopathy there&#39;s a there is a niche in</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.100" end="00:41:53.750" style="s2">existence in the culture to make it</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.620" end="00:41:55.340" style="s2">worthwhile to exploit that niche if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.750" end="00:41:56.630" style="s2">can manipulate other people to do your</p>

<p begin="00:41:56.630" end="00:42:04.490" style="s2">have to do for yourself right and so it</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.210" end="00:42:08.230" style="s2">these are I I personally don&#39;t see these</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.490" end="00:42:08.230" style="s2">things to a large degree as</p>

<p begin="00:42:14.570" end="00:42:20.840" style="s2">entirely inculcated and so my point the</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.830" end="00:42:24.050" style="s2">point I&#39;m trying to make is that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.840" end="00:42:25.790" style="s2">notion of separating out the sociopaths</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.570" end="00:42:37.310" style="s2">profoundly flawed view a I have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.310" end="00:42:38.780" style="s2">inherent aversion to be any situation in</p>

<p begin="00:42:38.780" end="00:42:41.570" style="s2">of another group of people and say we</p>

<p begin="00:42:41.570" end="00:42:46.640" style="s2">separated from us I mean whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.240" end="00:42:49.040" style="s2">I have an aversion I have a deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.640" end="00:42:53.030" style="s2">deep seated aversion to that and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.040" end="00:42:58.370" style="s2">power always like I said great</p>

<p begin="00:43:06.320" end="00:43:09.680" style="s2">or later that becomes a much much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.300" end="00:43:11.120" style="s2">thing and more and more groups start to</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.680" end="00:43:13.400" style="s2">get singled out as being do you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.120" end="00:43:15.140" style="s2">what I mean the hole that it&#39;s a path</p>

<p begin="00:43:16.850" end="00:43:21.380" style="s2">on that path might be it&#39;s a path that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.650" end="00:43:25.580" style="s2">simply needs to remain blocked off in my</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.380" end="00:43:27.860" style="s2">opinion and I think as a group you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.580" end="00:43:30.530" style="s2">say you are or aren&#39;t welcome in this</p>

<p begin="00:43:37.850" end="00:43:43.310" style="s2">metrics as to who&#39;s included and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.410" end="00:43:44.870" style="s2">not included global societies the level</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.310" end="00:43:46.070" style="s2">I was talking on so when we come if</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.870" end="00:43:48.320" style="s2">you&#39;re coming down to the sort of level</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.070" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">of a Facebook group kind of thing then</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.320" end="00:43:54.020" style="s2">yeah I mean I get yeah yeah I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:56.270" style="s2">really really in two minds about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.020" end="00:43:57.590" style="s2">we&#39;re not on the one hand obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.270" end="00:43:59.270" style="s2">administration of the group have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.590" end="00:44:01.430" style="s2">right to kick anyone out but any or no</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.270" end="00:44:03.860" style="s2">reason in the same way that the you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.430" end="00:44:05.060" style="s2">the proprietor of a public establishment</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.860" end="00:44:06.620" style="s2">has the reason it has the right to kick</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.060" end="00:44:07.730" style="s2">people out for any or no reason if they</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.620" end="00:44:09.470" style="s2">don&#39;t want them in there you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.730" end="00:44:11.030" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s your right to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.470" end="00:44:13.490" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s your thing it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.030" end="00:44:17.000" style="s2">right to do that however given the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.490" end="00:44:19.000" style="s2">nature of what game B is I really do</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.000" end="00:44:21.170" style="s2">think that if we can&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.000" end="00:44:23.330" style="s2">solutions to the little spats that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.170" end="00:44:24.860" style="s2">have among a group of people who are all</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.330" end="00:44:27.620" style="s2">fundamentally on the same team right</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.860" end="00:44:31.070" style="s2">otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be here then what</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.620" end="00:44:33.140" style="s2">hope is there of ever rolling it out on</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.070" end="00:44:35.180" style="s2">a sort of global kind of scale so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.140" end="00:44:37.820" style="s2">really do think more effort could be put</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.180" end="00:44:39.890" style="s2">into resolving these things whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.820" end="00:44:42.850" style="s2">they are because yeah for exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.890" end="00:44:48.650" style="s2">reason I just it just sets a bad tone</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.850" end="00:44:50.150" style="s2">you know if sorry gone done know what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.650" end="00:44:54.860" style="s2">was gonna say is you know I mean one of</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.150" end="00:44:57.680" style="s2">the pieces is I think part of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.860" end="00:45:00.130" style="s2">gonna what is gonna come out or what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:05.230" style="s2">see coming out of game B or at least my</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.130" end="00:45:08.330" style="s2">or let me backtrack the thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.230" end="00:45:15.470" style="s2">come out as a result of my transition</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.330" end="00:45:21.340" style="s2">into game beeping and a desire to a deep</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.470" end="00:45:27.830" style="s2">desire to see the best in everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.340" end="00:45:31.760" style="s2">to or not is to not assume the best be</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.830" end="00:45:36.260" style="s2">aware of boundaries and also recognize</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:38.180" style="s2">that you know the thing a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.260" end="00:45:40.510" style="s2">things especially with no narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.180" end="00:45:44.230" style="s2">narcissism in particular more so than</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.510" end="00:45:44.230" style="s2">sociopathy is</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.150" end="00:45:54.390" style="s2">is healed through community it is healed</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.029" end="00:45:58.079" style="s2">through being accepted for who you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.390" end="00:46:00.950" style="s2">and you know again psychopathy and</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.079" end="00:46:03.450" style="s2">sociopathy I don&#39;t know as much about</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.950" end="00:46:05.940" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know you know to what extent</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.450" end="00:46:10.950" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s inheritable</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.940" end="00:46:16.109" style="s2">versus nature versus nurture but you</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.950" end="00:46:26.400" style="s2">know that that process of you know can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:46:26.400" end="00:46:30.329" style="s2">lot of Tara brach and I&#39;m reminded of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.230" end="00:46:37.579" style="s2">story that she talks about about again</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.329" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">about a tribe where they if some woman</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.579" end="00:46:43.970" style="s2">gets if someone in the tribe gets sick</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:48.660" style="s2">they all come together and they and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.970" end="00:46:53.220" style="s2">everyone tells all of the things they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.660" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">been keeping that they&#39;ve been keeping</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.220" end="00:46:58.410" style="s2">to themselves like it&#39;s it&#39;s a community</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:00.809" style="s2">like in order to heal an individual you</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.410" end="00:47:02.970" style="s2">have to the whole community has to</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.809" end="00:47:05.849" style="s2">participate in that healing process and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.970" end="00:47:08.730" style="s2">so when we kick someone out of a you</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.849" end="00:47:11.369" style="s2">know of a group it we&#39;re saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.730" end="00:47:16.079" style="s2">you&#39;re not you know you don&#39;t fit into</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.369" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">this group and to what extent is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.079" end="00:47:22.999" style="s2">person manifesting all of the shadow of</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:26.339" style="s2">everyone else within that community</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.999" end="00:47:29.220" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question how did that and</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.339" end="00:47:34.410" style="s2">and and an individual&#39;s path to</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.220" end="00:47:39.749" style="s2">redemption is part of the communal path</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.410" end="00:47:44.009" style="s2">to redemption mm-hmm and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.749" end="00:47:47.599" style="s2">it&#39;s this you know it is that how do you</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.009" end="00:47:55.529" style="s2">find the balance between individual and</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.599" end="00:47:56.470" style="s2">the community and there being a you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.529" end="00:47:58.540" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.470" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">disconnection we have to how we are all</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.540" end="00:48:03.400" style="s2">connected as a community which I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:04.180" style="s2">one of the qualities of being a</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.400" end="00:48:06.070" style="s2">narcissist</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.180" end="00:48:07.869" style="s2">especially as a parent is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.070" end="00:48:10.150" style="s2">like a scapegoat and a golden child</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.869" end="00:48:12.190" style="s2">right that you kind of pass those things</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.150" end="00:48:14.380" style="s2">onto and that&#39;s literally what the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.190" end="00:48:15.910" style="s2">community does is like well let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.380" end="00:48:17.440" style="s2">this person a scapegoat and kick them</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.910" end="00:48:19.720" style="s2">out and with them go all our problems</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.440" end="00:48:21.790" style="s2">right right and we turn people into</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.720" end="00:48:29.349" style="s2">golden child but like they get to be the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.790" end="00:48:32.650" style="s2">and it&#39;s in our individual lives we i we</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.349" end="00:48:34.690" style="s2">are reflected the shadow and light of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.650" end="00:48:36.460" style="s2">everyone that we encounter and so when</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.690" end="00:48:38.530" style="s2">someone annoys us it&#39;s because it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.460" end="00:48:39.849" style="s2">shadow when someone&#39;s like when we hold</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.530" end="00:48:41.830" style="s2">someone to high esteem it&#39;s generally a</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.849" end="00:48:45.310" style="s2">light it&#39;s not always the case but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.830" end="00:48:46.720" style="s2">never I come from that spin there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.310" end="00:48:48.400" style="s2">always something for me to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.720" end="00:48:50.349" style="s2">it&#39;s not kicking the person out because</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.400" end="00:48:52.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like right there&#39;s shadow for us to</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.349" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">learn if we didn&#39;t have any of this</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.119" end="00:48:56.859" style="s2">shadow it wouldn&#39;t matter how they</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:48:58.270" style="s2">showed up and so like owning a little</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.859" end="00:48:59.619" style="s2">bit of that it was just like what came</p>

<p begin="00:49:01.420" end="00:49:04.780" style="s2">they are the scapegoat and kicking them</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.950" end="00:49:06.520" style="s2">out and like good now we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.780" end="00:49:08.430" style="s2">deal with that anymore gone no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.520" end="00:49:11.770" style="s2">gonna show up again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.430" end="00:49:13.599" style="s2">there was something about the tone as</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.770" end="00:49:15.490" style="s2">well which which is troubling me I&#39;m a</p>

<p begin="00:49:48.910" end="00:49:56.940" style="s2">is that there is groups are going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.050" end="00:49:56.940" style="s2">emerge around a ratio of</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.440" end="00:50:05.800" style="s2">conflict to conflict resolution like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.050" end="00:50:10.319" style="s2">group a group is only going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.800" end="00:50:17.119" style="s2">to maintain coherence if or no</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.319" end="00:50:17.119" style="s2">very friction to a ratio of friction to</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.719" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">brain fart um what&#39;s the word I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.459" end="00:50:25.049" style="s2">thinking of conflict resolution there we</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:29.190" style="s2">go no because you have to have in order</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.049" end="00:50:32.190" style="s2">for a group to like make forward motion</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.190" end="00:50:34.049" style="s2">you have to have friction but if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.190" end="00:50:37.559" style="s2">have too much friction and not enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.049" end="00:50:42.589" style="s2">conflict resolution then the group&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.559" end="00:50:46.079" style="s2">breakup and so you know trusting that</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.589" end="00:50:48.359" style="s2">you know okay right now maybe it would</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.079" end="00:50:51.390" style="s2">be nicer you know it would be better to</p>

<p begin="00:51:09.029" end="00:51:15.150" style="s2">able to do that and that&#39;s not a it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.160" end="00:52:00.269" style="s2">more compassionate ways to deal with all</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.259" end="00:52:03.359" style="s2">of those conflicts then what we</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.269" end="00:52:06.059" style="s2">currently do right with domestic</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.359" end="00:52:08.759" style="s2">violence like there is a way to keep a</p>

<p begin="00:53:12.660" end="00:53:16.710" style="s2">it and I it&#39;s a higher level of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.760" end="00:53:20.070" style="s2">resolution like being present with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.710" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">dysfunction treating it as it is instead</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.070" end="00:53:26.520" style="s2">of criminalizing it and making it be</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:29.490" style="s2">something that has to stop now when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.520" end="00:53:31.500" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s playing itself out</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.490" end="00:53:33.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a reason it&#39;s here and</p>

<p begin="00:53:33.000" end="00:53:37.070" style="s2">it you&#39;re not getting to not passing</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:39.180" style="s2">that trauma on to another generation</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.070" end="00:53:40.230" style="s2">like well like well violence is</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.180" end="00:53:42.000" style="s2">happening so we&#39;re gonna commit this</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.230" end="00:53:43.170" style="s2">other violence to stop that violence</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.000" end="00:53:46.770" style="s2">because taking a kid away from their</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.170" end="00:53:48.990" style="s2">family is always violent it&#39;s just is it</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.770" end="00:53:51.780" style="s2">the lesser of the two and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.990" end="00:53:52.890" style="s2">honor it like that it&#39;s like no we gotta</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.780" end="00:53:56.840" style="s2">take em all over the state we know</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.890" end="00:53:59.750" style="s2">what&#39;s best right well and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.840" end="00:54:03.510" style="s2">what comes up for me is like people how</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.750" end="00:54:06.840" style="s2">much are people identified with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.510" end="00:54:08.640" style="s2">victim consciousness and but not only</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.840" end="00:54:11.280" style="s2">victim consciousness but also the hero</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.640" end="00:54:13.770" style="s2">consciousness like we have to protect</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.280" end="00:54:19.440" style="s2">you know it&#39;s our job to protect people</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.770" end="00:54:23.880" style="s2">and what and the rush that people get</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.440" end="00:54:27.840" style="s2">from that like well I I&#39;m a good person</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.880" end="00:54:31.350" style="s2">because I&#39;m rescuing people and how much</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.840" end="00:54:34.470" style="s2">is rescues victims right Yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.350" end="00:54:35.820" style="s2">exactly yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.470" end="00:54:37.440" style="s2">really really interesting dynamic I</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.820" end="00:54:39.420" style="s2">think it might have been you that</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.440" end="00:54:43.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a triangle or something and some</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.420" end="00:54:45.030" style="s2">equipment is really really interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.020" end="00:54:47.370" style="s2">know that it&#39;s a it&#39;s a lens that stuck</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.030" end="00:54:49.260" style="s2">with me it&#39;s really it strikes me that a</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.370" end="00:54:52.080" style="s2">really simple change of name would have</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.260" end="00:54:54.300" style="s2">a profound effect if you change the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.080" end="00:54:57.630" style="s2">criminal justice system into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.300" end="00:54:59.340" style="s2">conflict resolution service yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.630" end="00:55:01.740" style="s2">it&#39;s just boom you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.340" end="00:55:02.970" style="s2">straight away just just with the change</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.740" end="00:55:05.010" style="s2">of name if you did nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.970" end="00:55:07.110" style="s2">different just the change of name would</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.010" end="00:55:08.730" style="s2">alter the expectations of everyone</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.110" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">involved in it and everyone going into</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.730" end="00:55:14.520" style="s2">it I feel like no it would not because</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:15.990" style="s2">only because we do like the government</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.520" end="00:55:17.340" style="s2">does those things all the time therefore</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.990" end="00:55:18.690" style="s2">they caught they call something by a</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.340" end="00:55:21.540" style="s2">different name it&#39;s like the family</p>

<p begin="00:55:26.070" end="00:55:31.020" style="s2">if we were going to look at revamping it</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.320" end="00:55:33.780" style="s2">with that being the title what could we</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.020" end="00:55:35.910" style="s2">do that&#39;s not tearing it down to zero</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.780" end="00:55:37.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason we it exists we want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.910" end="00:55:40.590" style="s2">keep people say if we want to you know</p>

<p begin="00:58:16.710" end="00:58:20.340" style="s2">difficult conversation or the</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.330" end="00:58:22.440" style="s2">conversation was enjoyable but the topic</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.340" end="00:58:24.660" style="s2">is like there&#39;s a lot here the person to</p>

<p begin="00:58:24.660" end="00:58:31.080" style="s2">and there is also the sense of it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.040" end="00:58:32.910" style="s2">theoretical there&#39;s nothing like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.080" end="00:58:35.250" style="s2">no concrete action to take and that can</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.910" end="00:58:36.470" style="s2">be enough difficult at times yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.250" end="00:58:38.640" style="s2">absolutely</p>

<p begin="00:58:48.060" end="00:58:52.290" style="s2">personal view redemption is the inner</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.890" end="00:58:53.900" style="s2">thing right of forgiving yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.290" end="00:58:56.820" style="s2">whatever making yourself better</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.900" end="00:58:59.250" style="s2">forgiveness is that which is bestowed</p>
