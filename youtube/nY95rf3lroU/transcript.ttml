<p begin="00:02:25.280" end="00:02:31.549" style="s2">trainee at the Manassas Academy which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.680" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">a modern monastery based in Lowell</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.549" end="00:02:40.370" style="s2">Vermont so we&#39;re a training center that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:43.599" style="s2">combines a lot of different modalities</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.370" end="00:02:45.890" style="s2">training modalities and the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.599" end="00:02:48.829" style="s2">like to think about it is that were a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.890" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">training center for creating better</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.829" end="00:02:54.730" style="s2">people that has been kind of my personal</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:57.470" style="s2">experience of it and my my view of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.730" end="00:03:03.709" style="s2">what I&#39;ve observed from the people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.470" end="00:03:07.909" style="s2">have gone through this program so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.709" end="00:03:09.739" style="s2">combine traditional wisdom practices</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.909" end="00:03:13.400" style="s2">Buddhism we have a head teacher who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.739" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">Zen monk we&#39;re not a Zen monastery he</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.400" end="00:03:18.709" style="s2">doesn&#39;t teach them but he is a Zen monk</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:20.840" style="s2">so we do a lot of practices like</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.709" end="00:03:22.549" style="s2">meditation like several hours of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.840" end="00:03:25.700" style="s2">meditation per day and we have we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.549" end="00:03:28.489" style="s2">a very strict schedule but we also</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.700" end="00:03:32.840" style="s2">combine that with a lot of real-world</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.489" end="00:03:36.019" style="s2">work because training for enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.840" end="00:03:38.030" style="s2">is very nice and good but if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.019" end="00:03:42.919" style="s2">using that to enact real change in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.030" end="00:03:50.480" style="s2">world then well then what are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.919" end="00:03:53.419" style="s2">kind of and I had all sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.480" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">that I was thinking about saying and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.419" end="00:03:58.940" style="s2">then there were it just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:04:02.359" style="s2">ballooned and I decided that probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.940" end="00:04:04.129" style="s2">the best thing to do would be to answer</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.359" end="00:04:10.750" style="s2">questions rather than just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.129" end="00:04:13.609" style="s2">talk for a long time I want to note that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.750" end="00:04:15.620" style="s2">so we have this Vermont location then we</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.609" end="00:04:17.090" style="s2">also have a California location and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.620" end="00:04:18.709" style="s2">did not realize that the California</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.090" end="00:04:21.019" style="s2">location would be calling into this call</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.709" end="00:04:24.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re all watching right now which</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.019" end="00:04:27.480" style="s2">is a little nerve-racking hi guys</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.400" end="00:04:30.389" style="s2">they&#39;re leaving</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.480" end="00:04:33.479" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.389" end="00:04:34.740" style="s2">so I think maybe it&#39;ll open it too I</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.479" end="00:04:36.150" style="s2">don&#39;t know if Peter you had some</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.740" end="00:04:38.520" style="s2">starting questions that you wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.150" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">or if anyone who had any questions at</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.520" end="00:04:43.229" style="s2">all and we can kind of weave the story</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.560" end="00:04:45.629" style="s2">or a narrative through that yeah I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.229" end="00:04:47.099" style="s2">ask a few opening questions and while I</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.629" end="00:04:49.800" style="s2">ask guys another question is just feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.099" end="00:04:51.509" style="s2">free to write it down in the chat box</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.800" end="00:04:57.349" style="s2">and then I can call on you and you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.509" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">meet yourself so someone like myself who</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.349" end="00:05:02.789" style="s2">sort of is like I like being a cowboy a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2">spiritual cowboy and do my own thing but</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.789" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">I&#39;m also drawn to a monastic life so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:09.180" style="s2">in the in-between space and I&#39;m imagine</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:11.550" style="s2">a lot of people like that too they like</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.180" end="00:05:13.919" style="s2">their own independence the own way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.550" end="00:05:16.409" style="s2">doing things but they want to have some</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.919" end="00:05:19.289" style="s2">guidance in the monastery setting so</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.409" end="00:05:21.689" style="s2">what would you say in order to once they</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.289" end="00:05:23.099" style="s2">sell it but just to kind of give them</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.689" end="00:05:26.759" style="s2">enough information so they can make the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.099" end="00:05:28.349" style="s2">wisest choice make the wisest choice</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.759" end="00:05:32.939" style="s2">about whether this type of training</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.349" end="00:05:34.379" style="s2">would be useful to them yeah hmm yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.939" end="00:05:36.150" style="s2">I mean I don&#39;t want to make the claim</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.379" end="00:05:38.039" style="s2">that it&#39;s for like absolutely everyone I</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.150" end="00:05:42.589" style="s2">think that can be a dangerous dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.039" end="00:05:46.379" style="s2">claim to make what I have found is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.589" end="00:05:47.969" style="s2">so I have been connected with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.379" end="00:05:49.770" style="s2">organization for about four years but</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.969" end="00:05:51.150" style="s2">it&#39;s really only in the past year that</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.770" end="00:05:58.139" style="s2">I&#39;ve started doing more intensive</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.150" end="00:06:00.719" style="s2">training and I was resistant for a long</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.139" end="00:06:02.550" style="s2">time to you know doing it the way that</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.719" end="00:06:03.870" style="s2">it is here because you know how do I</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.550" end="00:06:05.189" style="s2">know that this is actually the best way</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.870" end="00:06:06.539" style="s2">and this kind of sucks you know you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.189" end="00:06:07.919" style="s2">to wake up early and if you do all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.539" end="00:06:09.419" style="s2">annoying things you have to live with</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.919" end="00:06:12.659" style="s2">annoying people and you have to just</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.419" end="00:06:14.659" style="s2">like deal with it and like surely</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.659" end="00:06:20.099" style="s2">there&#39;s a better way to do this and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.659" end="00:06:23.819" style="s2">maybe there is but the thing is while</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.099" end="00:06:25.319" style="s2">I&#39;m here the best way to make use of all</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.819" end="00:06:27.199" style="s2">of this is to throw myself in and to</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.319" end="00:06:29.310" style="s2">trust it for the duration that I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.199" end="00:06:32.669" style="s2">and when I started doing that when I</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.310" end="00:06:34.620" style="s2">started when I stopped thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.669" end="00:06:35.909" style="s2">like oh this this thing is wrong if they</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.620" end="00:06:36.870" style="s2">did it this other way then it would be</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.909" end="00:06:38.490" style="s2">better I&#39;m not going to trust this</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.870" end="00:06:42.930" style="s2">organization until they do it this right</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.490" end="00:06:43.440" style="s2">better way when I kind of this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.930" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:47.790" style="s2">a way to convince people I suppose but</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:50.430" style="s2">like when when I was able to set that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.790" end="00:06:53.130" style="s2">aside and say like okay well I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.430" end="00:06:55.230" style="s2">and it is done this way and so I should</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.130" end="00:06:58.740" style="s2">participate fully and get whatever I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.230" end="00:07:00.030" style="s2">from this that really made a big</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.740" end="00:07:01.410" style="s2">difference and the thing is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.030" end="00:07:03.030" style="s2">like you come here and then you&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.410" end="00:07:04.350" style="s2">here forever you come here and you do</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.030" end="00:07:06.030" style="s2">the training and you leave at some point</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.350" end="00:07:07.710" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re here for a week maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.030" end="00:07:08.850" style="s2">you&#39;re here for a year the longest</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.710" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">person who&#39;s been here has been here for</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.069" end="00:12:08.779" style="s2">feedback on what your brain is doing so</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.059" end="00:12:18.980" style="s2">monastery forever and and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.540" end="00:12:20.959" style="s2">what are you doing this is the weirdest</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.980" end="00:12:24.069" style="s2">decision you&#39;ve made so far like this</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.959" end="00:12:28.220" style="s2">makes no sense your life is so good here</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.069" end="00:12:35.480" style="s2">you&#39;re just running away like acquitted</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.220" end="00:12:37.670" style="s2">please stay but he left and I was upset</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.480" end="00:12:39.879" style="s2">and angry and maybe eight months later I</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.670" end="00:12:42.350" style="s2">went to go visit him and I was very</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.879" end="00:12:43.579" style="s2">skeptical of the entire thing I was just</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.350" end="00:12:47.870" style="s2">like what is this cult that took my</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.579" end="00:12:50.059" style="s2">friend away and I wanted to see if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.870" end="00:12:53.510" style="s2">know he was still the same person and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.059" end="00:12:57.410" style="s2">like if these are people who I can trust</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.510" end="00:13:01.670" style="s2">care of him so I came to visit for like</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.410" end="00:13:06.250" style="s2">a day and a half and was pretty weird</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.670" end="00:13:08.180" style="s2">it was a weird place and I got to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.250" end="00:13:10.130" style="s2">breakfast with the head teacher because</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.180" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">when guests come generally they get to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.130" end="00:13:14.600" style="s2">have like tea or breakfast or something</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:16.070" style="s2">with the head teacher and at that point</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.600" end="00:13:19.490" style="s2">I had been meditating for maybe about a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.070" end="00:13:20.690" style="s2">year or so yeah maybe a little more and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.490" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">I was kind of like I was convinced by</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.690" end="00:13:23.420" style="s2">you know like the health benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:24.590" style="s2">meditation it&#39;s like it&#39;s good for</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.420" end="00:13:26.810" style="s2">mental health and all of that but it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.590" end="00:13:28.910" style="s2">okay that&#39;s nice but like really a</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.810" end="00:13:32.750" style="s2">monastery like that&#39;s it that&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.910" end="00:13:35.630" style="s2">extreme so I talked with the head</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.750" end="00:13:38.450" style="s2">teacher and it was the first time that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.630" end="00:13:41.300" style="s2">someone had actually been able to answer</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.450" end="00:13:43.190" style="s2">my sort of skepticisms and my questions</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.300" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">and my hesitations about meditation in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.190" end="00:13:50.960" style="s2">way that I was just like oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.160" end="00:13:54.200" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what seems reasonable so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.960" end="00:13:56.210" style="s2">left and I was like okay this place it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.200" end="00:13:58.220" style="s2">maybe not awful I don&#39;t know if I like</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.210" end="00:14:01.400" style="s2">it but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not what I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.220" end="00:14:03.230" style="s2">afraid of and then over the years I just</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.400" end="00:14:04.820" style="s2">kind of kept visiting every once in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.230" end="00:14:06.140" style="s2">while maybe like every few months but</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.820" end="00:14:08.290" style="s2">like once or twice a year or something</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.140" end="00:14:10.010" style="s2">each time for a little bit longer</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.290" end="00:14:12.290" style="s2">because there was just like there was</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.010" end="00:14:16.520" style="s2">something drawing me to it but it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.290" end="00:14:18.760" style="s2">still pretty kind of like arm&#39;s length I</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.520" end="00:14:21.710" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.760" end="00:14:23.390" style="s2">and over time I kind of I got to see I</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.710" end="00:14:24.590" style="s2">got to make friends with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.390" end="00:14:26.570" style="s2">people going through the program and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.590" end="00:14:28.070" style="s2">got to see the changes that were</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.570" end="00:14:31.670" style="s2">happening in them and the way that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.070" end="00:14:32.780" style="s2">organization worked and like the I one</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.670" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">of the things that I was afraid of is</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.780" end="00:14:36.440" style="s2">that there would be you would think of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:39.350" style="s2">monastery as being something that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.440" end="00:14:42.040" style="s2">a very separate from the world and like</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.350" end="00:14:44.600" style="s2">not impacted by it and not impacting it</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.040" end="00:14:46.760" style="s2">which this organization is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.600" end="00:14:48.050" style="s2">not doing like the entire point of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.760" end="00:14:51.260" style="s2">training is so that we can become more</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.050" end="00:14:53.470" style="s2">effective people in the world and so I I</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.260" end="00:15:04.490" style="s2">grew to to see that and trust it more</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.470" end="00:15:06.660" style="s2">and then and what was it 2017 or 2018</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.490" end="00:15:09.449" style="s2">one of those years</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.660" end="00:15:13.139" style="s2">I spent a year working in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.449" end="00:15:15.660" style="s2">cryptocurrency world and I was just like</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.139" end="00:15:17.389" style="s2">I had a crazy year there&#39;s a constantly</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.660" end="00:15:20.190" style="s2">travelling between different continents</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.389" end="00:15:22.440" style="s2">like living as a nomad which was</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.190" end="00:15:25.050" style="s2">beautiful but exhausting and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.440" end="00:15:29.250" style="s2">completely burn myself out and then I</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.050" end="00:15:30.779" style="s2">left that job and and I thought oh I</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.250" end="00:15:34.259" style="s2">know the perfect place to go to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.779" end="00:15:35.790" style="s2">like reset myself and it decided that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.259" end="00:15:38.250" style="s2">would go to the mask Academy for two</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.790" end="00:15:40.259" style="s2">months or well for some amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.250" end="00:15:41.399" style="s2">which ended up being two months and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.259" end="00:15:47.639" style="s2">was when I was doing the co-working</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.399" end="00:15:49.199" style="s2">program and that was really when things</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.639" end="00:15:51.569" style="s2">started for me where I was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.199" end="00:15:54.980" style="s2">there&#39;s like this is a lot more than</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.569" end="00:15:59.160" style="s2">just like better mental health this is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.980" end="00:16:02.509" style="s2">really important really fundamental type</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.160" end="00:16:04.980" style="s2">of training that I have never seen</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.509" end="00:16:07.199" style="s2">anywhere else I mean I&#39;m sure other</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.980" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">places do things like this but I had not</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.199" end="00:16:13.439" style="s2">been exposed to anything like this and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:16.680" style="s2">and that was kind of when I realized</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.439" end="00:16:18.600" style="s2">that at this point in my life this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.680" end="00:16:20.399" style="s2">the best possible thing that I could be</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.600" end="00:16:21.449" style="s2">doing and there&#39;s all sorts of other</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.399" end="00:16:24.930" style="s2">things that you know would be</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.449" end="00:16:31.470" style="s2">interesting and good and the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.930" end="00:16:34.050" style="s2">that like hmm all those other things</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.470" end="00:16:35.699" style="s2">that I want to do I can still do them</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.050" end="00:16:37.110" style="s2">after doing this training that was kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.699" end="00:16:39.269" style="s2">of my thinking at that point where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.110" end="00:16:41.130" style="s2">like I can do those things now or I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.269" end="00:16:42.839" style="s2">like spend a year making myself into a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.130" end="00:16:44.370" style="s2">more badass person and then do those</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.839" end="00:16:50.100" style="s2">things even better than I would do them</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.370" end="00:16:51.660" style="s2">now and actually my thinking has since</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.100" end="00:16:56.550" style="s2">shifted I mean that that is still true</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.660" end="00:16:57.630" style="s2">but I actually now am believing the what</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.550" end="00:17:00.569" style="s2">I want to be doing is more of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.630" end="00:17:01.769" style="s2">training and trying to bring it and make</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.569" end="00:17:03.240" style="s2">it sort of more accessible to more</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.769" end="00:17:05.520" style="s2">people so I&#39;m actually in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.240" end="00:17:07.740" style="s2">creating a Canadian branch of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.520" end="00:17:15.230" style="s2">monastic Adam II near Toronto very early</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.740" end="00:17:17.610" style="s2">stages but yeah I basically became or</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.230" end="00:17:20.530" style="s2">came to the conclusion or the belief</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.610" end="00:17:25.720" style="s2">that this type of training is so</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.530" end="00:17:30.040" style="s2">important and so vital and nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.720" end="00:17:36.400" style="s2">seemed right now at least nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.040" end="00:17:38.200" style="s2">seemed worthwhile thank you cool</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.400" end="00:17:40.690" style="s2">so we have a lot of questions coming in</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.200" end="00:17:42.580" style="s2">I&#39;m going to use my discernment we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.690" end="00:17:44.560" style="s2">not going to go in the order that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.580" end="00:17:50.110" style="s2">came in and everyone might not have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.560" end="00:17:52.180" style="s2">chance to ask their question so let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.110" end="00:17:55.210" style="s2">with the Nicholas you had two good</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.180" end="00:17:59.980" style="s2">questions filled which one you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.210" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">ask and feel free to ask it yes No thank</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.980" end="00:18:11.350" style="s2">you so much for through Danielson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:12.730" style="s2">podcast and anyway a couple of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.350" end="00:18:14.230" style="s2">questions that I had and you feel free</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.730" end="00:18:15.430" style="s2">to use your discernment to decide which</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.230" end="00:18:17.320" style="s2">one you want to answer or both</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.430" end="00:18:19.720" style="s2">incorporate them in the first one was</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.320" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">what is a day in the life of a trainee</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.720" end="00:18:23.650" style="s2">at the academy maybe you were gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:25.090" style="s2">into that anyway the second one is what</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.650" end="00:18:27.640" style="s2">are the greatest challenges that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.090" end="00:18:29.500" style="s2">have faced or are facing during your</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.640" end="00:18:32.460" style="s2">practice and what changes have you</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.500" end="00:18:33.700" style="s2">noticed in yourself and overcoming them</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.460" end="00:18:36.100" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.700" end="00:18:38.740" style="s2">so Dana life I can kind of go over</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.100" end="00:18:40.750" style="s2">quickly and I also have a blog post from</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.740" end="00:18:42.640" style="s2">about a year ago that basically goes</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.750" end="00:18:45.010" style="s2">through the daily schedule and has like</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.640" end="00:18:46.420" style="s2">pictures of the place and stuff so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.010" end="00:18:49.420" style="s2">just go through it quickly now but if</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.420" end="00:18:50.680" style="s2">you want more details I don&#39;t know Peter</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.420" end="00:18:52.660" style="s2">if you&#39;re able to find that blog post</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.680" end="00:18:56.520" style="s2">somehow and post it in chat or something</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.660" end="00:18:56.520" style="s2">but we can figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.670" end="00:19:06.400" style="s2">so daily schedule is start chanting at</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.490" end="00:19:09.820" style="s2">4:40 a.m. are you writing this down what</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.400" end="00:19:11.680" style="s2">why not yeah you can also find this on</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.820" end="00:19:19.090" style="s2">the website but you&#39;re welcome to write</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.680" end="00:19:23.530" style="s2">it down so start chanting 4:40 then at</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.090" end="00:19:25.600" style="s2">5:30 a.m. is an hour of meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.530" end="00:19:27.160" style="s2">during this time we also have interviews</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.600" end="00:19:29.710" style="s2">with the teacher so what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.160" end="00:19:32.310" style="s2">one person at a time goes into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.710" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">interview room with the teacher and they</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.310" end="00:19:36.340" style="s2">demonstrate or discuss their</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:41.860" style="s2">just it&#39;s just it&#39;s a time to have</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.340" end="00:19:42.910" style="s2">one-on-one time and it&#39;s really from</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.860" end="00:19:46.290" style="s2">what I understand it&#39;s really different</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.910" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">for every person like at what that means</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.290" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">sometimes for me it&#39;s like actual</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:51.760" style="s2">full-on discussions with the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:53.920" style="s2">other times I just sit there quietly</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.760" end="00:19:55.690" style="s2">breathing and demonstrating my practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.920" end="00:19:57.460" style="s2">sometimes he&#39;ll ask questions and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.690" end="00:19:58.809" style="s2">answer some plain words sometimes he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.460" end="00:20:00.340" style="s2">ask questions and I will just answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.809" end="00:20:03.130" style="s2">with the way that I&#39;m breathing which</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.340" end="00:20:08.559" style="s2">might sound ridiculous it&#39;s really not I</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.130" end="00:20:12.070" style="s2">promise um so that&#39;s 5:30 to 6:30 then</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.559" end="00:20:14.380" style="s2">6:30 to 7:30 is the exercise period so</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.070" end="00:20:16.150" style="s2">we exercise everyday you choose your own</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.670" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">workshops sovereignty workshops or other</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.010" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">things sometimes will do embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:30.930" style="s2">practices sometimes we&#39;ll do more</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:34.050" style="s2">meditation so that&#39;s like the period</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.930" end="00:22:37.620" style="s2">between five and six thirty is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.050" end="00:22:40.260" style="s2">much different every day six thirty we</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.620" end="00:22:42.960" style="s2">do group sutra study which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.260" end="00:22:44.880" style="s2">one person presents something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.960" end="00:22:46.260" style="s2">they&#39;ve been reading about and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.880" end="00:22:51.270" style="s2">there&#39;s like a sort of group discussion</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.260" end="00:22:53.640" style="s2">about it 7:00 until 8:30 we do sitting</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.270" end="00:22:56.870" style="s2">meditation again again with interviews</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.640" end="00:22:59.670" style="s2">so people go and talk to the teacher I</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.870" end="00:23:02.310" style="s2">think most of the time people get to</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.670" end="00:23:06.990" style="s2">maybe not but you got to talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.310" end="00:23:09.030" style="s2">teacher every day or two in general and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.990" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">on retreat on full retreat weeks it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.030" end="00:23:15.630" style="s2">it&#39;s everyday generally and then 8:30</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:21.540" style="s2">p.m. we chant for about 15 minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.630" end="00:23:23.610" style="s2">then it&#39;s bedtime and then so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.540" end="00:23:26.130" style="s2">that&#39;s called like responsibility weeks</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.610" end="00:23:28.200" style="s2">so most of the month is a responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.130" end="00:23:30.030" style="s2">period and then we have one week of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.200" end="00:23:32.310" style="s2">month that is what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.030" end="00:23:35.190" style="s2">awakening period who our people would</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.310" end="00:23:36.420" style="s2">call it our retreats and the way the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.190" end="00:23:37.710" style="s2">schedule is different for that one is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.420" end="00:23:43.890" style="s2">just like replaced pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.710" end="00:23:46.950" style="s2">everything with meditation your other</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.890" end="00:23:50.570" style="s2">questions one was something about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.950" end="00:23:53.010" style="s2">the most challenging thing I think I</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.570" end="00:23:54.180" style="s2">mean there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s challenging I</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.010" end="00:23:56.310" style="s2">think one of the most challenging things</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.180" end="00:23:57.930" style="s2">is and and the most beautiful things is</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.310" end="00:24:00.180" style="s2">actually living in community because</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.930" end="00:24:03.000" style="s2">you&#39;re living and training and working</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.180" end="00:24:06.120" style="s2">and eating and everything with the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.000" end="00:24:08.970" style="s2">people and you have conflicts and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.120" end="00:24:10.200" style="s2">can&#39;t get away from them like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.970" end="00:24:11.970" style="s2">reasons that actually this training is</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.200" end="00:24:16.140" style="s2">so profound is that you can&#39;t get away</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.970" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">from your problems and you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.140" end="00:24:19.110" style="s2">deal with them you can&#39;t like if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:20.520" style="s2">something you dislike you can&#39;t avoid</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.110" end="00:24:21.510" style="s2">them because you live with them you work</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.520" end="00:24:23.460" style="s2">with who&#39;s your trainer without you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.510" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">just you&#39;re around them and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.460" end="00:24:32.300" style="s2">really there&#39;s a real beauty to that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:32.300" style="s2">because you&#39;re committed to</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.210" end="00:24:42.300" style="s2">um you&#39;re committed to loving and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.710" end="00:24:44.640" style="s2">supporting these people and still</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.300" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">clashing with them you know like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.640" end="00:24:50.430" style="s2">not it&#39;s not about like being you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:54.180" style="s2">protect you can only pretend to like</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.430" end="00:24:57.270" style="s2">someone for so long you know so like all</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.180" end="00:24:59.510" style="s2">the stuff comes out and you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.270" end="00:25:02.970" style="s2">support each other through it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.510" end="00:25:07.590" style="s2">really difficult and probably one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.970" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">most growing experiences of this entire</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.590" end="00:25:11.310" style="s2">place and it&#39;s one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">makes a real difference between like</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.310" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">meditating on your own a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:22.140" style="s2">meditating in community it&#39;s yeah thank</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:23.970" style="s2">you and I guess it&#39;s the last thing what</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.140" end="00:25:26.370" style="s2">what changes have you noticed in</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.970" end="00:25:33.810" style="s2">yourself in overcoming that challenge of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.370" end="00:25:36.270" style="s2">living in community yeah that one I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.810" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">much more comfortable now just telling</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.270" end="00:25:39.540" style="s2">people what I think or how I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:40.470" style="s2">when I disagree with them about</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.540" end="00:25:41.820" style="s2">something and it just doesn&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.470" end="00:25:45.810" style="s2">that big a deal anymore it does</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.820" end="00:25:48.690" style="s2">sometimes but like I actually distinctly</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.810" end="00:25:51.720" style="s2">remember a time it was more than a year</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.690" end="00:25:53.130" style="s2">ago I don&#39;t remember exactly when but I</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.720" end="00:25:55.740" style="s2">remember time when like someone said</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.130" end="00:25:58.020" style="s2">something to me and I just kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.740" end="00:26:00.390" style="s2">smiled and it was like aha</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.020" end="00:26:01.800" style="s2">and then internally I was like what like</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.390" end="00:26:02.940" style="s2">I completely disagree with everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.800" end="00:26:04.350" style="s2">that you&#39;re saying but like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.940" end="00:26:06.300" style="s2">like I&#39;m just I&#39;m feeling a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.350" end="00:26:07.650" style="s2">the situation and want to leave like I</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.300" end="00:26:09.540" style="s2">was internally my experience but</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.650" end="00:26:13.590" style="s2">externally I just kind of like smiled</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.540" end="00:26:15.690" style="s2">and pretended whereas now that seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.590" end="00:26:17.160" style="s2">like not even a thing like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.690" end="00:26:18.450" style="s2">easy for me now like when someone says</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.160" end="00:26:19.530" style="s2">something I think should be like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.450" end="00:26:22.260" style="s2">disagree with that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.530" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">or like that that bothers me for like</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.260" end="00:26:24.840" style="s2">this in this reason it&#39;s not like some</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:27.410" style="s2">sort of like clash or conflict it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.840" end="00:26:27.410" style="s2">actually just</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.600" end="00:26:32.929" style="s2">sort of like lowering that resistance of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.179" end="00:26:32.929" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.650" end="00:26:40.390" style="s2">the the disagreements are okay that like</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.100" end="00:26:42.280" style="s2">judgment is okay it&#39;s okay for me to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.390" end="00:26:44.560" style="s2">like hey I&#39;m judging you right now or</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.280" end="00:26:45.850" style="s2">like I feel unsafe with you right now or</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.560" end="00:26:47.500" style="s2">something like that and I can trust that</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.850" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">that&#39;s actually going to be received in</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.500" end="00:26:53.880" style="s2">in a certain way and that that person is</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:56.740" style="s2">going to want to like be with me in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.880" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">interaction and or maybe they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.740" end="00:26:59.530" style="s2">maybe they will have their own freak out</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:02.460" style="s2">and walk away and then like we&#39;ll deal</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.530" end="00:27:06.570" style="s2">with it later or something so I&#39;m good</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.460" end="00:27:10.150" style="s2">mm-hmm sorry I&#39;m parsing this as</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.570" end="00:27:14.020" style="s2">toggling or or reducing the opacity of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.150" end="00:27:17.800" style="s2">the membrane between your inner world</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.020" end="00:27:19.930" style="s2">and your outer experience that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.800" end="00:27:24.690" style="s2">that&#39;s a great way contributes to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.930" end="00:27:28.360" style="s2">greater authenticity yeah it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.690" end="00:27:31.120" style="s2">cool some great questions coming in</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.360" end="00:27:39.550" style="s2">change has had one which I&#39;m personally</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:42.910" style="s2">curious about I yeah I&#39;d like to ask</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.550" end="00:27:47.170" style="s2">about the experience of living in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.910" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">monastic lifestyle what lessons can the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.170" end="00:27:53.100" style="s2">general public take from that about</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:58.450" style="s2">living in lockdown and and then the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.100" end="00:28:01.530" style="s2">further becomes a change in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.450" end="00:28:05.020" style="s2">once we come out of lockdown and after</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.530" end="00:28:07.630" style="s2">coab it 19 is no longer the huge problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.020" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">that it currently is I&#39;d really like to</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.630" end="00:28:22.660" style="s2">hear about what what lessons do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:23.010" style="s2">think we could take yeah I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.660" end="00:28:25.470" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.010" end="00:28:28.680" style="s2">biggest things so there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.470" end="00:28:31.500" style="s2">things that I think are really have been</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.680" end="00:28:36.990" style="s2">extremely useful and beneficial for us</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.500" end="00:28:40.170" style="s2">in living through this crisis and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.990" end="00:28:43.290" style="s2">say actually we got infected with Kovac</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.170" end="00:28:45.540" style="s2">in early March so we like that that went</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.290" end="00:28:50.580" style="s2">through the monastery where all everyone</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.540" end="00:28:52.590" style="s2">is fine but one of the really beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.580" end="00:28:54.360" style="s2">things about it is the fact that we live</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.590" end="00:28:55.080" style="s2">in community and so we were able to take</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.360" end="00:28:58.140" style="s2">care of each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.080" end="00:29:00.150" style="s2">and so much of what is happening right</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.140" end="00:29:03.090" style="s2">now is that people are isolated alone in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.150" end="00:29:04.380" style="s2">their homes and we have you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.090" end="00:29:05.760" style="s2">beautiful things happening like people</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.380" end="00:29:07.520" style="s2">are zooming so much more I&#39;m talking to</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.760" end="00:29:11.550" style="s2">my family so much more than ever before</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:13.260" style="s2">which is really lovely but there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.550" end="00:29:15.690" style="s2">something really profound about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.260" end="00:29:19.080" style="s2">that we were living in community we</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.690" end="00:29:21.090" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to feel that extreme</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.080" end="00:29:26.580" style="s2">loneliness that I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.090" end="00:29:29.010" style="s2">are feeling right now and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.580" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">it really it speaks to I know that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.010" end="00:29:31.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who really like</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:32.790" style="s2">the idea of community living you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.590" end="00:29:34.500" style="s2">like creating like shared community</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.790" end="00:29:37.170" style="s2">houses or like little villages with all</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.500" end="00:29:39.690" style="s2">your friends and stuff but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.170" end="00:29:41.460" style="s2">really coming a lot more alive for</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.690" end="00:29:42.710" style="s2">people now from like what I&#39;ve seen the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.460" end="00:29:45.210" style="s2">discussions that I&#39;ve seen online</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.710" end="00:29:46.950" style="s2">everyone is not everyone but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.210" end="00:29:49.790" style="s2">people are saying like let&#39;s you know go</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.950" end="00:29:52.470" style="s2">to a communist let&#39;s build our own thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.790" end="00:29:53.790" style="s2">and monasteries are really like a model</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.470" end="00:30:00.530" style="s2">of that they&#39;re a model of a community</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.790" end="00:30:00.530" style="s2">living together and then the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.640" end="00:30:06.240" style="s2">well yeah so I mean I think for that one</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.410" end="00:30:08.280" style="s2">just more concisely is basically like</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.240" end="00:30:10.260" style="s2">living in community has a lot of really</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.280" end="00:30:13.740" style="s2">important benefits and at a time like</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.260" end="00:30:15.060" style="s2">this it&#39;s especially important and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.740" end="00:30:16.380" style="s2">know when certain people were very sick</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.060" end="00:30:17.660" style="s2">there were other people who are less</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.380" end="00:30:19.890" style="s2">sick were able to take care of them</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.660" end="00:30:22.290" style="s2">rather than people just kind of being</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.890" end="00:30:26.090" style="s2">cooped up at home the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.290" end="00:30:28.710" style="s2">that throughout all this we were still</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.090" end="00:30:31.080" style="s2">like we were we shifted our schedule a</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.710" end="00:30:32.730" style="s2">bit so that we could like Cameron get my</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.080" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">regrets and stuff but we were still</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.730" end="00:30:35.840" style="s2">practicing every day for several hours</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:43.669" style="s2">meditating</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.840" end="00:30:48.710" style="s2">and it really I think helped us stay a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.669" end="00:30:52.940" style="s2">lot more grounded and a lot more able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.710" end="00:30:55.909" style="s2">process the information without not to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.940" end="00:30:57.140" style="s2">say that like we weren&#39;t going nuts</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.909" end="00:31:01.690" style="s2">because in many ways we were</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.140" end="00:31:04.039" style="s2">but it really was beneficial to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.690" end="00:31:07.159" style="s2">like a strong meditation practice and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.039" end="00:31:11.270" style="s2">the thing is during that time specially</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.159" end="00:31:13.640" style="s2">our teacher was really guiding us to</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.270" end="00:31:15.080" style="s2">deal with the problem of death you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.640" end="00:31:16.850" style="s2">this is what all of us are facing right</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.080" end="00:31:18.380" style="s2">now the fact that we&#39;re going to die</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.850" end="00:31:21.230" style="s2">that the people who we love are going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.380" end="00:31:23.570" style="s2">die and that&#39;s a really hard thing to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.230" end="00:31:26.450" style="s2">face and the entire world right now is</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.570" end="00:31:28.190" style="s2">facing that and what contemplator</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.450" end="00:31:31.789" style="s2">ditions or at least buddhism does</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.190" end="00:31:35.990" style="s2">largely or not largely but in a very big</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.789" end="00:31:37.850" style="s2">way is make you face your own death make</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.990" end="00:31:40.130" style="s2">you face your mortality make you face</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.850" end="00:31:41.539" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;re gonna get old that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.130" end="00:31:44.570" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get sick that everyone you</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.539" end="00:31:46.220" style="s2">love will die and I&#39;m laughing because I</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.570" end="00:31:48.529" style="s2">just like remembering some of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.220" end="00:31:50.270" style="s2">meditation some of the guidances that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.529" end="00:31:52.159" style="s2">our teacher did or like literally we</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.270" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">would sit for an hour and contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.159" end="00:32:00.500" style="s2">death and so we use this opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:02.870" style="s2">really because you know it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.500" end="00:32:05.600" style="s2">anyway you&#39;re you we&#39;re dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.870" end="00:32:07.279" style="s2">fact that we&#39;re gonna die or maybe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.600" end="00:32:08.809" style="s2">not dealing with it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.279" end="00:32:11.029" style="s2">but we&#39;re facing the fact that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.809" end="00:32:15.230" style="s2">gonna die so we might as well you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.029" end="00:32:16.880" style="s2">step in and do it fully so that was I</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.230" end="00:32:18.980" style="s2">think another another thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.880" end="00:32:22.659" style="s2">really important about living nastily</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.980" end="00:32:24.649" style="s2">is the fact that we were able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.659" end="00:32:26.299" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking of some other things but</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.649" end="00:32:31.520" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of like half form so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.299" end="00:32:38.809" style="s2">think I&#39;ll leave them for now cool Tonya</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.520" end="00:32:42.460" style="s2">you have a question yeah I was just</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.809" end="00:32:46.909" style="s2">wondering because you&#39;re starting this</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.460" end="00:32:48.210" style="s2">maple up in Canada what what was the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.909" end="00:32:50.660" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.210" end="00:32:54.510" style="s2">what stirred you to do that what</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.660" end="00:32:59.490" style="s2">motivated you and if there is a vision</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.510" end="00:33:01.320" style="s2">there or yeah and and there&#39;s the second</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.490" end="00:33:05.820" style="s2">part of the question when you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.320" end="00:33:09.210" style="s2">about the the day-to-day things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.820" end="00:33:10.950" style="s2">come up when people are living in close</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.210" end="00:33:18.780" style="s2">quarters and can&#39;t get away from each</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.950" end="00:33:26.010" style="s2">other yeah how and I&#39;m just curious what</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.780" end="00:33:29.910" style="s2">questions and learning has come up for</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.010" end="00:33:35.450" style="s2">you withholding whatever is motivating</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.910" end="00:33:35.450" style="s2">you and and then that day-to-day reality</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.850" end="00:33:48.570" style="s2">yeah so for what motivated me it was a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.130" end="00:33:51.150" style="s2">little bit of a snowball effect I came</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.570" end="00:33:52.920" style="s2">back from the monastic Academy so I was</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.150" end="00:33:54.120" style="s2">here for two months and then I left and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.920" end="00:33:56.760" style="s2">I knew that I wanted to come back for</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.120" end="00:33:58.290" style="s2">more training but it wasn&#39;t the right</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.760" end="00:33:59.580" style="s2">time for me at that point there was some</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.290" end="00:34:03.720" style="s2">family things that I wanted to do in</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.580" end="00:34:05.070" style="s2">Toronto for a little while and it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.720" end="00:34:07.320" style="s2">just kind of like thinking about what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.070" end="00:34:08.400" style="s2">wanted to do next and I didn&#39;t at that</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.320" end="00:34:11.280" style="s2">point I didn&#39;t have a place to live</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.400" end="00:34:13.640" style="s2">because well coincidentally I had moved</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.280" end="00:34:17.160" style="s2">out of my apartment a few months earlier</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.640" end="00:34:18.930" style="s2">and because I knew that it was going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.160" end="00:34:21.600" style="s2">come back to the monastic atomy I kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.930" end="00:34:22.890" style="s2">of didn&#39;t want to find like a one-year</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.600" end="00:34:25.740" style="s2">lease somewhere or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.890" end="00:34:28.260" style="s2">and then I thought well if I buy a place</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.740" end="00:34:31.020" style="s2">then I can at least I can like rent it</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.260" end="00:34:32.430" style="s2">out while I&#39;m gone and not like it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.020" end="00:34:34.440" style="s2">all just like a bunch of like logistical</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.430" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">stuff and then I was like wait I can buy</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.440" end="00:34:39.210" style="s2">a property somewhere outside of the city</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.800" end="00:34:40.680" style="s2">which would be really lovely and I had</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.210" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">been living nomadically for a year</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.680" end="00:34:44.370" style="s2">before that anyway so living outside of</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:45.810" style="s2">the city wasn&#39;t that different from just</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.370" end="00:34:48.120" style="s2">like you know constantly traveling or</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.810" end="00:34:50.850" style="s2">something just as far as like seeing my</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.120" end="00:34:54.660" style="s2">friends in the city uh-huh and then it</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.850" end="00:34:56.040" style="s2">was like oh I could I could places in</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.660" end="00:34:57.540" style="s2">the city are a lot more expensive than</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.040" end="00:34:58.860" style="s2">places outside of the city and so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.540" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">started looking at places like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.860" end="00:35:01.890" style="s2">could actually get a pretty big place</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.240" end="00:35:04.829" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.890" end="00:35:06.420" style="s2">at some point in the future something</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.829" end="00:35:08.220" style="s2">will magically happen and people from</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.420" end="00:35:09.539" style="s2">the mask Academy will want to expand to</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.220" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">Canada and then I can give them this</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.539" end="00:35:15.779" style="s2">this property right this is this</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:19.769" style="s2">location they can they can do it there</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.779" end="00:35:22.079" style="s2">and then very quickly it was like</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.769" end="00:35:24.930" style="s2">they&#39;re not it&#39;s not gonna be them</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.079" end="00:35:26.730" style="s2">magically doing it I&#39;m gonna write I</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.930" end="00:35:28.259" style="s2">should just like start that process and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.730" end="00:35:31.230" style="s2">I was like renovating it to be like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.259" end="00:35:33.480" style="s2">right thing and it was just like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.230" end="00:35:34.980" style="s2">just taking one step at a time and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.480" end="00:35:40.589" style="s2">each thing snowballed and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.980" end="00:35:42.029" style="s2">eventually eventually it started</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.589" end="00:35:43.470" style="s2">becoming a real thing and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.029" end="00:35:44.579" style="s2">well I can definitely be like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.470" end="00:35:47.609" style="s2">executive director of this like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.579" end="00:35:49.170" style="s2">capable of doing that but I had this</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.609" end="00:35:51.269" style="s2">conversation with my with my teacher and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.170" end="00:35:52.769" style="s2">it was like well I&#39;m a NASA Academy</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.269" end="00:35:57.420" style="s2">needs a teacher so who&#39;s gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.769" end="00:35:59.279" style="s2">teacher and I was like oh well not not</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.420" end="00:36:01.619" style="s2">Oh cuz I mean I already knew that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.279" end="00:36:03.749" style="s2">was a thing but I was like oh I see so</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.619" end="00:36:06.359" style="s2">there&#39;s no one so I&#39;m the only option</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.749" end="00:36:10.650" style="s2">I&#39;m a terrible option but you can train</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.359" end="00:36:12.839" style="s2">me and maybe someday I will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.650" end="00:36:18.839" style="s2">be a teacher and maybe not I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.839" end="00:36:20.009" style="s2">but we basically came to the agreement</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.839" end="00:36:21.900" style="s2">that the thing that would make sense is</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.009" end="00:36:24.900" style="s2">for me to do a lot more intensive</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.900" end="00:36:26.789" style="s2">training and move towards becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.900" end="00:36:28.380" style="s2">teacher but the whole thing really</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.789" end="00:36:34.589" style="s2">started with like I don&#39;t want to find a</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.380" end="00:36:36.390" style="s2">place to rent and and every step of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.589" end="00:36:39.029" style="s2">way it felt like the right thing but it</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.390" end="00:36:40.109" style="s2">was it was very much like there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.029" end="00:36:41.700" style="s2">of different directions that this could</p>

<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:25.470" style="s2">people are helping in so many ways and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.360" end="00:37:29.250" style="s2">then we&#39;re not actually sure how to tie</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.470" end="00:37:31.190" style="s2">you into your second question I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.250" end="00:37:35.190" style="s2">know if you want to maybe ask it again</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.190" end="00:37:38.910" style="s2">feels like you&#39;re starting to describing</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.190" end="00:37:42.090" style="s2">the experience that&#39;s been emerging that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.910" end="00:37:47.250" style="s2">you&#39;ve been having with people on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.090" end="00:37:51.390" style="s2">ground yeah yeah I mean my experience</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.250" end="00:37:53.460" style="s2">has basically been that like if I if I</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.390" end="00:37:56.310" style="s2">just read if I believe in this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.460" end="00:37:56.850" style="s2">I just like take steps towards making it</p>

<p begin="00:37:56.850" end="00:38:00.720" style="s2">other people get excited about it too</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.530" end="00:38:03.900" style="s2">and then they take steps towards making</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.720" end="00:38:05.310" style="s2">it happen and like I don&#39;t I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.900" end="00:38:07.260" style="s2">necessarily wanting to make it just like</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.310" end="00:38:08.400" style="s2">this thing that I want it to be I want</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.260" end="00:38:12.900" style="s2">it to be like co-created by the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:23.190" style="s2">community um so yeah that part has been</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.900" end="00:38:36.600" style="s2">just mind-blowing to me honestly cool</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.190" end="00:38:38.310" style="s2">Megan you had a few questions I&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.600" end="00:38:40.350" style="s2">to link some of my questions with others</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.310" end="00:38:44.150" style="s2">that I&#39;ve read that I think are related</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.350" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">I was interested in whether you felt</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.150" end="00:38:51.840" style="s2">maple could fit under the engaged</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:54.780" style="s2">Buddhism movement I kind of want to link</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.840" end="00:38:57.660" style="s2">this to other people asking around like</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.780" end="00:39:00.030" style="s2">impact of maple and how you view their</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.660" end="00:39:01.950" style="s2">theory of change and if there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.030" end="00:39:04.410" style="s2">ways of impact that they conceive of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.950" end="00:39:08.670" style="s2">that&#39;s both like political but also</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.410" end="00:39:10.770" style="s2">beyond social and political change which</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.670" end="00:39:13.680" style="s2">is kind of how I understand engaged</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.770" end="00:39:15.690" style="s2">Buddhism and then my second question you</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.680" end="00:39:18.030" style="s2">can answer either/or was just around</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.690" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">your earlier comment about this like</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.030" end="00:39:23.400" style="s2">Frank radical honesty you&#39;ve been able</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:26.100" style="s2">to cultivate and how you kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.400" end="00:39:28.260" style="s2">lost reservation just speak your truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.100" end="00:39:30.000" style="s2">and I was just curious whether you ever</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.260" end="00:39:33.420" style="s2">felt that</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.000" end="00:39:35.490" style="s2">refraining from sharing what is honestly</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.420" end="00:39:40.110" style="s2">coming up for you can be a kinder more</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.490" end="00:39:42.140" style="s2">compassionate thing to do sure yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.110" end="00:39:46.110" style="s2">mean I&#39;ll answer the second one first</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.140" end="00:39:50.820" style="s2">and yeah definitely it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.110" end="00:39:52.920" style="s2">just about like being unfiltered so in</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.820" end="00:39:55.110" style="s2">Buddhism there&#39;s this thing called the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.920" end="00:39:57.090" style="s2">Eightfold Path which you know you and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.110" end="00:39:58.410" style="s2">have talked about a little bit and one</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.090" end="00:40:03.030" style="s2">of the things in the Eightfold Path is</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.410" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">right speech and right speech does mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.030" end="00:40:08.910" style="s2">being truthful but it also means like</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:16.440" style="s2">saying things at the right time and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.910" end="00:40:23.910" style="s2">saying things kindly and it also means</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.440" end="00:40:25.800" style="s2">other things but I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.910" end="00:40:32.100" style="s2">things about doing this type of training</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.800" end="00:40:34.320" style="s2">is that ideally over time you start</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.100" end="00:40:36.540" style="s2">becoming less reactive and so it</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.320" end="00:40:38.520" style="s2">actually becomes a lot easier to talk</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.540" end="00:40:39.810" style="s2">about like the difficult things that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.520" end="00:40:41.370" style="s2">coming out or the disagreements or</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.810" end="00:40:42.750" style="s2">something like that because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.370" end="00:40:46.260" style="s2">necessarily saying them from an angry</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.750" end="00:40:49.370" style="s2">place if the reaction that you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.260" end="00:40:52.590" style="s2">is anger just using that as an example</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.370" end="00:40:56.730" style="s2">and so there is a way to speak your</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.590" end="00:41:01.410" style="s2">truth without that necessarily being</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.730" end="00:41:03.660" style="s2">some sort of difficult or traumatizing</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.410" end="00:41:06.690" style="s2">experience for the person who&#39;s hearing</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.660" end="00:41:08.340" style="s2">it um not that you can you know control</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.690" end="00:41:11.910" style="s2">everything about how someone will</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.340" end="00:41:13.950" style="s2">receive it but yeah I definitely don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.910" end="00:41:15.360" style="s2">want it to come off as like always just</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.950" end="00:41:17.690" style="s2">blurting out whatever is on your mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.360" end="00:41:23.340" style="s2">and being like yeah I&#39;m practicing</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.690" end="00:41:27.810" style="s2">that&#39;s not exactly the point and so then</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.340" end="00:41:29.100" style="s2">for the first question I&#39;ve heard a bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.810" end="00:41:31.680" style="s2">about engaged Buddhism but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.100" end="00:41:35.910" style="s2">really know like the definition of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.680" end="00:41:41.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a tip not Han thing right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.910" end="00:41:42.599" style="s2">like I guess he&#39;s the recent person he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.190" end="00:41:45.440" style="s2">been advocating it but</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.599" end="00:41:49.559" style="s2">it comes from a I think a history of</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.440" end="00:41:53.039" style="s2">Buddhists who wanted to reclaim the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.559" end="00:41:55.229" style="s2">political power that some scholars at</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.039" end="00:41:58.739" style="s2">least have claimed was stripped after</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.229" end="00:42:03.239" style="s2">the Cold War era and when brought to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.739" end="00:42:06.119" style="s2">west the DC politicization of Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.239" end="00:42:11.729" style="s2">was seen as one of the outcomes I</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.119" end="00:42:13.109" style="s2">suppose mm-hmm okay so I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.729" end="00:42:15.329" style="s2">lot of the academic background on that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.109" end="00:42:17.059" style="s2">so like I can kind of answer in some</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.329" end="00:42:23.539" style="s2">sort of like my own interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.059" end="00:42:27.900" style="s2">interpretation of things but yeah I I</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.539" end="00:42:30.059" style="s2">feel like my answer won&#39;t quite be like</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.900" end="00:42:34.650" style="s2">satisfying exactly the question as</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.059" end="00:42:36.660" style="s2">opposed but I think if I take the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.650" end="00:42:38.099" style="s2">question more broadly as like what is it</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.660" end="00:42:44.220" style="s2">that maple is actually doing that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.099" end="00:42:45.769" style="s2">making a difference in the world all</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.220" end="00:42:47.910" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.769" end="00:42:49.859" style="s2">so I mean there&#39;s you know there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.910" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">the specific easy things to point to or</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.859" end="00:42:55.349" style="s2">like when we go to protests or something</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:57.749" style="s2">or the causes that we support and things</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.349" end="00:43:03.299" style="s2">like that but that&#39;s actually the less</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.749" end="00:43:09.180" style="s2">interesting stuff I think although</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.299" end="00:43:18.900" style="s2">that&#39;s important too but the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.180" end="00:43:24.299" style="s2">see it is I want to be careful about how</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.900" end="00:43:27.900" style="s2">I put this a lot of our problems in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.299" end="00:43:37.060" style="s2">world start a lot earlier than we think</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.900" end="00:43:40.780" style="s2">and the tree</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.060" end="00:43:46.510" style="s2">that we&#39;re doing at maple part of it at</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.780" end="00:43:50.550" style="s2">least is in trying to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.510" end="00:43:54.580" style="s2">foundations of where our problems start</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.550" end="00:43:57.010" style="s2">so part of why the meditation practice</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.580" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">is so important is that you kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.010" end="00:44:01.930" style="s2">still everything over time and then you</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:05.710" style="s2">start to see like all the little things</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.930" end="00:44:07.060" style="s2">that are urging you towards doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.710" end="00:44:09.460" style="s2">certain things making certain decisions</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.060" end="00:44:12.790" style="s2">that like are very easy to rationalize</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.460" end="00:44:14.440" style="s2">but are actually like something much</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.790" end="00:44:21.910" style="s2">more subtle that&#39;s happening in your</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.440" end="00:44:26.820" style="s2">mind and basically by changing this</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.910" end="00:44:29.710" style="s2">foundation we change we change ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.820" end="00:44:33.340" style="s2">like by doing this practice you change</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.710" end="00:44:37.600" style="s2">yourself into being someone who is able</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.340" end="00:44:38.920" style="s2">to function from a more I don&#39;t to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.600" end="00:44:43.750" style="s2">grounded place because it&#39;s not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.920" end="00:44:47.110" style="s2">it but a more wise place a less reactive</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.750" end="00:44:49.780" style="s2">place and everything snowballs from</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.110" end="00:44:53.710" style="s2">there all the little decisions that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.780" end="00:44:55.240" style="s2">make turn into big decisions and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.710" end="00:45:00.610" style="s2">know the way that we live our days is</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.240" end="00:45:02.380" style="s2">the way that we live our lives and and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.610" end="00:45:04.330" style="s2">don&#39;t mean to say that like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.380" end="00:45:05.530" style="s2">completely impossible or like the only</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.330" end="00:45:07.290" style="s2">thing we need to be doing is working on</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.530" end="00:45:09.460" style="s2">ourselves and that will change the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.290" end="00:45:11.020" style="s2">like there we have to be working you</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.460" end="00:45:13.290" style="s2">know bottom-up and top-down we have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.020" end="00:45:28.030" style="s2">be looking at the system&#39;s level things</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.290" end="00:45:28.550" style="s2">but I do personally believe that so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.030" end="00:45:31.700" style="s2">just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.550" end="00:45:34.520" style="s2">two great words here you know how</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.700" end="00:45:36.440" style="s2">there&#39;s like we can do like all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.520" end="00:45:38.180" style="s2">like brain games and stuff to like make</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.440" end="00:45:39.770" style="s2">a maker make our brains better you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.180" end="00:45:42.230" style="s2">if you do don&#39;t goo puzzles and that</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.770" end="00:45:45.530" style="s2">makes you be better at math and better</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.230" end="00:45:47.900" style="s2">at focusing and whatever else there is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.530" end="00:45:54.050" style="s2">more fundamental type of training that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.900" end="00:45:58.700" style="s2">we can be doing and we can basically</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.050" end="00:46:02.110" style="s2">create ourselves into people who have</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.700" end="00:46:06.200" style="s2">minds that like the types of minds that</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.110" end="00:46:11.510" style="s2">can actually solve problems without</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.200" end="00:46:20.120" style="s2">creating new ones or at least making</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.510" end="00:46:23.330" style="s2">fewer new ones and so that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.120" end="00:46:26.570" style="s2">way of looking at it looking at a little</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.330" end="00:46:29.380" style="s2">bit more abstractly one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.570" end="00:46:33.620" style="s2">that we talked about here at maple is as</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.380" end="00:46:40.040" style="s2">these three pillars of wisdom love and</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.620" end="00:46:42.110" style="s2">power and we will often say is that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.040" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">people who have wisdom and love often</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.110" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">don&#39;t want power and people who have</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:48.650" style="s2">power often don&#39;t have wisdom and love</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:50.750" style="s2">and so what we&#39;re trying to do is train</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.650" end="00:46:54.410" style="s2">leaders who are wise loving and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.750" end="00:46:55.670" style="s2">so which might mean taking people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.410" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">are powerful and building out their</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.670" end="00:46:59.360" style="s2">wisdom and building up their love or it</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:01.640" style="s2">might mean taking people who have wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.360" end="00:47:05.750" style="s2">or yeah I have some wisdom have some</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.640" end="00:47:07.700" style="s2">love and giving them more power and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.750" end="00:47:09.590" style="s2">part of like the sort of more practical</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.700" end="00:47:12.400" style="s2">stuff that maple does is actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.590" end="00:47:14.690" style="s2">empower people to do a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.400" end="00:47:16.970" style="s2">first within the organization like we</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.690" end="00:47:18.290" style="s2">are we&#39;re nonprofit and so people have</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.970" end="00:47:19.550" style="s2">to have all sorts of roles within the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.290" end="00:47:22.630" style="s2">organization someone will be doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.550" end="00:47:24.830" style="s2">fundraising will be doing bookkeeping</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.630" end="00:47:26.480" style="s2">kitchen management all that and so like</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.830" end="00:47:28.550" style="s2">people will come in and but not have</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.480" end="00:47:31.070" style="s2">certain real-world skills and then those</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.550" end="00:47:34.730" style="s2">that they get built up and they actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.070" end="00:47:36.130" style="s2">are put into leadership positions where</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.730" end="00:47:38.810" style="s2">they&#39;re completely out of their depth</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.130" end="00:47:41.560" style="s2">like we put people into positions where</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.810" end="00:47:42.970" style="s2">they will basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.560" end="00:47:45.640" style="s2">not necessarily fail but they will</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.970" end="00:47:47.200" style="s2">struggle and failure is okay struggling</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.640" end="00:47:52.480" style="s2">is okay they&#39;re supported all through it</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.200" end="00:47:54.250" style="s2">but it&#39;s basically like getting that</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.480" end="00:47:57.730" style="s2">type of real-world training in addition</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.250" end="00:47:58.870" style="s2">to the contemplatively and like really</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.730" end="00:48:00.280" style="s2">like holding those two aspects together</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.870" end="00:48:01.750" style="s2">that&#39;s why we talk about awakening and</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.280" end="00:48:05.350" style="s2">responsibility like those are two</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.750" end="00:48:07.690" style="s2">pillars of maple that like one side is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.350" end="00:48:09.010" style="s2">not enough you have to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.690" end="00:48:23.770" style="s2">building up both and they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.010" end="00:48:28.270" style="s2">informing each other let&#39;s see here okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.770" end="00:48:35.080" style="s2">so you leap you could ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.270" end="00:48:37.130" style="s2">you had a few I think thank you I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.080" end="00:48:39.180" style="s2">just typing out another one right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.130" end="00:48:41.950" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.180" end="00:48:46.180" style="s2">yeah which one I want to go for so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.950" end="00:48:47.980" style="s2">gonna lift them up and hop oh you just</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.180" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">asked one because we don&#39;t have much</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.980" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">time so jerk yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.850" end="00:48:59.380" style="s2">yes then can you tell us a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.840" end="00:49:01.750" style="s2">about best practices and monastic</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.380" end="00:49:05.170" style="s2">philosophy on how to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.750" end="00:49:08.710" style="s2">uncertainty of how much time you should</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.170" end="00:49:10.810" style="s2">be spending between on training yourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.710" end="00:49:13.270" style="s2">to become a more badass person and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.810" end="00:49:15.100" style="s2">putting that bad ass to work so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.270" end="00:49:17.680" style="s2">gonna probably go through a cyclical</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.100" end="00:49:19.360" style="s2">check-in process to say okay I needed</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.680" end="00:49:21.730" style="s2">more training at this time I got more</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.360" end="00:49:23.590" style="s2">training now I can go do some stuff I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.730" end="00:49:25.660" style="s2">doing some stuff I&#39;m noticing I could</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.590" end="00:49:27.400" style="s2">probably use more training how do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.660" end="00:49:29.950" style="s2">balance that what are the checks to make</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.400" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">sure that yeah this is working for you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.950" end="00:49:36.580" style="s2">is this a solo journey for you or does</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.280" end="00:49:38.790" style="s2">the monastic practice help to people</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.580" end="00:49:41.770" style="s2">there help tell us about that please</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.790" end="00:49:44.710" style="s2">yeah it is absolutely not a solo journey</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.770" end="00:49:47.830" style="s2">and it can&#39;t be I think so like even as</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.710" end="00:49:51.310" style="s2">you were saying your question like your</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.830" end="00:49:52.540" style="s2">question is how do you know when these</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.310" end="00:49:53.910" style="s2">certain things happen or when you need a</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.540" end="00:49:55.440" style="s2">certain thing and</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.910" end="00:49:58.500" style="s2">the first thing that was coming to mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.440" end="00:50:00.030" style="s2">was like I mean there is a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.500" end="00:50:01.380" style="s2">I can you know make those decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.030" end="00:50:03.270" style="s2">maybe they&#39;ll be right and maybe they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.380" end="00:50:05.940" style="s2">be wrong but having a teacher is</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.270" end="00:50:07.710" style="s2">actually a really really vital part of</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.940" end="00:50:10.170" style="s2">doing this and that&#39;s it that&#39;s a hard</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.710" end="00:50:11.850" style="s2">thing because like having that type of</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.170" end="00:50:13.320" style="s2">trusting relationship with someone is</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.850" end="00:50:15.720" style="s2">very difficult and it like it took me</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.320" end="00:50:17.640" style="s2">years to actually be able to trust so</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.720" end="00:50:19.710" style="s2">are you the head teacher here enough to</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.640" end="00:50:23.070" style="s2">you know step into full training with</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.710" end="00:50:26.550" style="s2">him um but there really is that level of</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.070" end="00:50:27.840" style="s2">trust were like I actually I mean he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.550" end="00:50:29.730" style="s2">been doing this for a long time and he</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.840" end="00:50:34.310" style="s2">is like I I do actually cross his wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.730" end="00:50:37.260" style="s2">in in guiding me along the right path</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.310" end="00:50:39.000" style="s2">and so some some part of it that is just</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.260" end="00:50:45.060" style="s2">like find someone who is better than you</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.000" end="00:50:46.860" style="s2">and like half of them tell you you but</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.060" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">and like I do mean that and also I know</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.860" end="00:50:53.610" style="s2">that that&#39;s like not really how it can</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:58.110" style="s2">always be some of it is honestly just</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.610" end="00:51:01.260" style="s2">informed by necessity probably it would</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.110" end="00:51:02.760" style="s2">be better to just like if I could take a</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.260" end="00:51:05.940" style="s2">month or three months or something and</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.760" end="00:51:07.860" style="s2">just meditate probably I will probably</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.940" end="00:51:09.300" style="s2">that would be more useful than me doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.860" end="00:51:11.880" style="s2">anything else for those three months I</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.300" end="00:51:14.340" style="s2">do genuinely believe that but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.880" end="00:51:16.140" style="s2">really feasible you know like I still</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.340" end="00:51:18.930" style="s2">have to be working in the world I still</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.140" end="00:51:22.380" style="s2">have to be helping the organization and</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.930" end="00:51:25.920" style="s2">all of that so some of it really is just</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.380" end="00:51:26.280" style="s2">informed by what is it that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:30.570" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.280" end="00:51:34.800" style="s2">um what is it that I need to do to like</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.570" end="00:51:35.760" style="s2">maintain my livelihood and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.800" end="00:51:37.530" style="s2">actually a really good question because</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.760" end="00:51:42.840" style="s2">a lot there&#39;s actually a lot they can</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.530" end="00:51:45.080" style="s2">follow away that we think can&#39;t but one</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.840" end="00:51:45.080" style="s2">thing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.910" end="00:51:54.040" style="s2">is it that he said I&#39;m gonna I mean I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.060" end="00:51:56.530" style="s2">butcher it so I don&#39;t know if this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.040" end="00:51:58.390" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s already said but he said</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.530" end="00:51:59.560" style="s2">something along the lines of like if</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.390" end="00:52:02.590" style="s2">you&#39;re spending more time on social</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.560" end="00:52:04.350" style="s2">media than you are listening to Dharma</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.590" end="00:52:08.560" style="s2">talks then social media is your teacher</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.350" end="00:52:10.570" style="s2">like that is and like that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.560" end="00:52:12.010" style="s2">statement of fact I think like the thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.570" end="00:52:13.150" style="s2">that you surround yourself with is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.010" end="00:52:14.530" style="s2">thing that&#39;s going to influence you the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.150" end="00:52:16.090" style="s2">most the people that you surround</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.530" end="00:52:18.550" style="s2">yourself or the people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.090" end="00:52:20.650" style="s2">influence you the most and so like in my</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.550" end="00:52:22.030" style="s2">view if I want to be a specific type of</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.650" end="00:52:23.500" style="s2">person then I need to surround myself</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.030" end="00:52:26.500" style="s2">with other people who are working</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.500" end="00:52:28.090" style="s2">towards that as well and that like it</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.500" end="00:52:30.160" style="s2">can&#39;t be a lonesome journey you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.090" end="00:52:31.920" style="s2">you could do that on your own but why</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.160" end="00:52:37.270" style="s2">would you like it&#39;s it&#39;s so much harder</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.920" end="00:52:38.440" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think that actually fully</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.270" end="00:52:42.460" style="s2">that answers your question</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.440" end="00:52:45.670" style="s2">exactly as posed but I think that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:52:51.940" end="00:52:57.790" style="s2">know in thinking about how we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.150" end="00:52:59.890" style="s2">construct ourselves it at least appears</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.790" end="00:53:01.900" style="s2">to me at very least that monastic</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.890" end="00:53:07.030" style="s2">practices are taking age-old wisdom on a</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.900" end="00:53:08.410" style="s2">whole slew of different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.030" end="00:53:10.270" style="s2">improving yourself right you can change</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.410" end="00:53:13.090" style="s2">your social context you can change your</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.270" end="00:53:14.740" style="s2">social ties you can change your basic</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.090" end="00:53:16.330" style="s2">physiology and how much your exercise</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.740" end="00:53:18.310" style="s2">how much you sleep what kind of postures</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.330" end="00:53:20.560" style="s2">you sit in how comfortable is your brain</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.310" end="00:53:22.120" style="s2">with comfort and discomfort</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.560" end="00:53:24.790" style="s2">how does it feel about things with types</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.120" end="00:53:26.140" style="s2">of neural patterns are you encoding and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.790" end="00:53:30.730" style="s2">practicing what are you building up</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.140" end="00:53:33.130" style="s2">right and so because and and there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.730" end="00:53:35.620" style="s2">there is an enormous enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.130" end="00:53:39.130" style="s2">wisdom in these practices but I wonder I</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.620" end="00:53:42.160" style="s2">mean what are their I guess my question</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.130" end="00:53:44.470" style="s2">for you is are there also more modern</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:46.540" style="s2">insights that you&#39;re aiming to draw from</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.470" end="00:53:48.520" style="s2">and in particular not for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.540" end="00:53:51.400" style="s2">being modern but obviously for the sake</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.520" end="00:53:54.520" style="s2">of you know how is it that life today is</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.400" end="00:53:56.980" style="s2">very is different in a specific way that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.520" end="00:53:58.030" style="s2">means you have to tweak you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.980" end="00:54:00.190" style="s2">the kind of training you&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.030" end="00:54:01.460" style="s2">order to actually yeah get optimal</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.190" end="00:54:04.609" style="s2">flourishing out of the human</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.460" end="00:54:05.990" style="s2">as you improve one sure yeah so I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.609" end="00:54:07.579" style="s2">lot of the practices that we do here are</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.990" end="00:54:11.480" style="s2">actually not ancient</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.579" end="00:54:13.970" style="s2">so like circling is a big one circling</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.480" end="00:54:16.599" style="s2">is sometimes we call it social</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.970" end="00:54:18.920" style="s2">meditation but it&#39;s basically like</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.599" end="00:54:21.859" style="s2">there&#39;s this quote I think by around us</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.920" end="00:54:24.910" style="s2">that&#39;s if you think you&#39;re enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.859" end="00:54:27.349" style="s2">go spend a week with your family</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.910" end="00:54:32.809" style="s2">select the fact is like there is some</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.349" end="00:54:34.309" style="s2">way to you can be like blissful and</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.809" end="00:54:35.480" style="s2">wonderful and things can be great when</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.309" end="00:54:37.880" style="s2">you&#39;re sitting alone on the cushion but</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.480" end="00:54:40.460" style="s2">that&#39;s really put into practice in</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.880" end="00:54:42.920" style="s2">relationship and so we do these circling</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.460" end="00:54:48.170" style="s2">practices together to kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.920" end="00:54:49.640" style="s2">really test out that our ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.170" end="00:54:51.890" style="s2">present with each other and with</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.640" end="00:54:53.150" style="s2">ourselves and so this is a much more</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.890" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">modern thing I don&#39;t remember once our</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.150" end="00:54:58.010" style="s2">claim came about I think I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:55:00.350" style="s2">in the 90s and there&#39;s emotional</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.010" end="00:55:01.630" style="s2">clearing stuff the bio motive practice</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.350" end="00:55:05.569" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.630" end="00:55:13.660" style="s2">we are as human beings in this modern</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.569" end="00:55:16.640" style="s2">world carrying around so much emotional</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.660" end="00:55:22.690" style="s2">trauma like lowercase T and in many</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.640" end="00:55:25.160" style="s2">cases uppercase T we are extremely</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.690" end="00:55:28.640" style="s2">impacted by things and then kind of not</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.160" end="00:55:29.809" style="s2">processing that you know you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.640" end="00:55:34.040" style="s2">just like hold yourself together as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.809" end="00:55:35.990" style="s2">set yourself up can keep going and this</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.040" end="00:55:40.520" style="s2">is really like makes it extremely</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.990" end="00:55:44.780" style="s2">difficult to go through life and be</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.520" end="00:55:48.559" style="s2">happy but we kind of just do it as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.780" end="00:55:52.520" style="s2">society so much that we don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.559" end="00:55:54.140" style="s2">quite realize it and so emotional clear</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.520" end="00:55:56.900" style="s2">anger and like emotional processing type</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.140" end="00:55:59.900" style="s2">things have I think are extremely vital</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.900" end="00:56:00.920" style="s2">practices that are much more modern I</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.900" end="00:56:02.750" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to say like people</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.920" end="00:56:05.809" style="s2">and the past didn&#39;t need them I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.750" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">know what it was like at that point but</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.809" end="00:56:09.470" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of one of the more modern</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:14.240" style="s2">things that that we&#39;re pulling in and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.470" end="00:56:14.930" style="s2">then I talked a bit about how like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.240" end="00:56:18.770" style="s2">placed in different</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.930" end="00:56:20.029" style="s2">within the monastery like this is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.770" end="00:56:23.599" style="s2">basically getting like business type</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.029" end="00:56:25.789" style="s2">training and you know startup type</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.599" end="00:56:27.589" style="s2">training and then this is the type of</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.789" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">stuff that really is necessary if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.589" end="00:56:31.910" style="s2">want to actually go out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:37.250" style="s2">and do things ever because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.910" end="00:56:38.569" style="s2">just be a monk who is completely</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.250" end="00:56:40.730" style="s2">separate from from everything that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:56:40.730" end="00:56:45.230" style="s2">wonderfully enlightened and then what if</p>
