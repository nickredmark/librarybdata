<p begin="00:00:04.700" end="00:00:11.280" style="s2">yellow says yeah and it doesn&#39;t let me</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.250" end="00:00:13.980" style="s2">move so a little weird are these weird</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:16.350" style="s2">videos also I like how they take a</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.980" end="00:00:17.850" style="s2">picture of you for the thumbnail and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.350" end="00:00:19.170" style="s2">don&#39;t know that&#39;s better or worse it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.850" end="00:00:20.970" style="s2">probably better for most people</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.170" end="00:00:22.590" style="s2">then the awkward weird one that they</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.970" end="00:00:24.420" style="s2">just picked for like Facebook live and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.590" end="00:00:25.619" style="s2">stuff or if you upload a video to</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.420" end="00:00:27.420" style="s2">YouTube it just kind of picks a random</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.619" end="00:00:29.699" style="s2">one you can still pick a better one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.420" end="00:00:31.230" style="s2">like always like freezes you in a weird</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.699" end="00:00:33.960" style="s2">position which I kind of prefer to like</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.230" end="00:00:38.070" style="s2">the fake smile of the photo but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.960" end="00:00:39.719" style="s2">like a whole a whole other side today I</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.070" end="00:00:41.579" style="s2">want to talk about a topic that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.719" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2">definitely gonna get me into trouble but</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.579" end="00:00:45.059" style="s2">then because of that it&#39;s one that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:47.640" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily talk about in coz it</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.059" end="00:00:50.070" style="s2">brings in cultural appropriation in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.640" end="00:00:52.230" style="s2">way that maybe we&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.070" end="00:00:54.690" style="s2">talk about it and but it&#39;s the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.230" end="00:00:57.239" style="s2">the individual versus the group and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.690" end="00:00:58.649" style="s2">not crystallized ideas that I can</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.239" end="00:01:00.800" style="s2">explain really well it&#39;s still something</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.649" end="00:01:03.480" style="s2">that I&#39;m dealing with and it&#39;s in my</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.800" end="00:01:05.760" style="s2">issue of one of the things that which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.480" end="00:01:07.229" style="s2">not stupid alteration that I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.760" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">to myself in camera about this morning</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.229" end="00:01:14.280" style="s2">was this concept of what was I doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:18.600" style="s2">group versus individual oh that when</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.280" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">you&#39;re under stress we like our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.600" end="00:01:22.979" style="s2">go for fight or flight just like our</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:25.920" style="s2">autonomic nervous system is either like</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.979" end="00:01:27.540" style="s2">fight or run away and you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.920" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">make a choice the whole point is it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.540" end="00:01:32.579" style="s2">like a nervous system reaction to this</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">to the stress or the thing these</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.579" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">perceive as as life-threatening we as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:41.070" style="s2">society there&#39;s a spectrum from like</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:43.530" style="s2">people who flight to people people</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.070" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">flight to people who fight and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.530" end="00:01:48.320" style="s2">fighting people we call heroic and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.780" end="00:01:53.930" style="s2">fighting people we call cowards and yet</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.320" end="00:01:59.540" style="s2">let&#39;s say it&#39;s 50/50 like we had to as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.930" end="00:02:01.640" style="s2">species as a very war driven species</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.540" end="00:02:04.330" style="s2">had to kind of make bravery the thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.640" end="00:02:06.920" style="s2">that was good right because if you had</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.330" end="00:02:09.950" style="s2">your army that you needed to fight and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.920" end="00:02:12.380" style="s2">they were gonna run away and tie it as</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.950" end="00:02:14.420" style="s2">opposed to fight that&#39;s a problem and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.380" end="00:02:15.709" style="s2">how I was thinking about this this</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.420" end="00:02:19.310" style="s2">morning was the difference to the group</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.709" end="00:02:22.010" style="s2">of the individual so chances are we</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.310" end="00:02:24.319" style="s2">survived by fleeing not by fighting</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.010" end="00:02:26.750" style="s2">because for individuals your comp</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:29.060" style="s2">against danger it may generally you come</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.750" end="00:02:30.290" style="s2">out better running than fighting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.060" end="00:02:31.910" style="s2">not always the case you can chase you</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.290" end="00:02:34.550" style="s2">and kill you that&#39;s why we do fight</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.910" end="00:02:37.190" style="s2">sometimes but chances are I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.550" end="00:02:38.480" style="s2">safer to run than to fight that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.190" end="00:02:41.390" style="s2">that&#39;s the option that some people take</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.480" end="00:02:43.160" style="s2">some animals take and so that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.390" end="00:02:44.750" style="s2">we&#39;ve survived in how our genetics cup</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.160" end="00:02:48.380" style="s2">has started we were here is probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.750" end="00:02:49.940" style="s2">that our ancestors ran and hid and ran</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.380" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">away from danger and didn&#39;t decide that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.940" end="00:02:55.030" style="s2">they needed to take on every tiger and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:58.489" style="s2">every lion but at the same time as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.030" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">group it&#39;s very different because as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.489" end="00:03:02.390" style="s2">group if you have an army of a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:05.420" style="s2">versus another army of a thousand and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.390" end="00:03:07.850" style="s2">half of these ones defect but only 25%</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.420" end="00:03:10.790" style="s2">of these ones defect clearly the group</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.850" end="00:03:13.340" style="s2">with more bravery ie less flight is</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.790" end="00:03:18.140" style="s2">going to win over the other group and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.340" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">on a group scale fight wins and yet on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.140" end="00:03:24.650" style="s2">personal scale flight wins if that if</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:27.620" style="s2">that makes sense so for this also comes</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.650" end="00:03:28.940" style="s2">into play for me is cultural</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.620" end="00:03:31.880" style="s2">appropriation I was just looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.940" end="00:03:36.739" style="s2">amazing Instagram site about things</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.880" end="00:03:38.750" style="s2">called ask ask a POC and it is which</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.739" end="00:03:41.090" style="s2">I&#39;ve had this idea before not just for</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.750" end="00:03:43.400" style="s2">for people of color but like for every</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.090" end="00:03:45.680" style="s2">group right like pregnant women women</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.400" end="00:03:47.030" style="s2">who&#39;ve been gestational carriers people</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.680" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">who have had brain tumors y&#39;all have had</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.030" end="00:03:51.109" style="s2">like we&#39;re so weird in our society of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:52.430" style="s2">like both we want to connect with people</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.109" end="00:03:54.440" style="s2">we connect with people it&#39;s kids</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.430" end="00:03:56.060" style="s2">alienating it&#39;s like oh so why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.440" end="00:03:57.260" style="s2">do to a pregnant woman it&#39;s like blonde</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.060" end="00:03:58.549" style="s2">you&#39;re not pregnant well that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.260" end="00:04:00.769" style="s2">sucks don&#39;t assume people are pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.549" end="00:04:03.190" style="s2">why are we go so fat phobic and life but</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.769" end="00:04:03.190" style="s2">I know</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.240" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">like some people are okay about talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.410" end="00:04:07.930" style="s2">about it would like to and then other</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:10.120" style="s2">people aren&#39;t and it&#39;s just about</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.930" end="00:04:11.170" style="s2">consent and asking permission then some</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.120" end="00:04:12.280" style="s2">people even that would be uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.170" end="00:04:14.050" style="s2">if it&#39;s like how do you treat somebody</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.280" end="00:04:17.920" style="s2">even ask if they can ask me a question</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.050" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">and so this idea of group versus hey</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.920" end="00:04:22.090" style="s2">someone asks someone asked on their like</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:23.410" style="s2">how do I talk my other white friends out</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.090" end="00:04:24.370" style="s2">of not wearing dreadlocks like how do I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.410" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">explain to them that they are not</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.370" end="00:04:29.710" style="s2">allowed to wear dreadlocks and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:30.670" style="s2">always is weird to me not like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.710" end="00:04:32.830" style="s2">want to wear dreadlocks</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.670" end="00:04:35.290" style="s2">I don&#39;t think white people look good in</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.830" end="00:04:37.240" style="s2">dreadlocks but it&#39;s an individual choice</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.290" end="00:04:38.770" style="s2">so you can&#39;t say someone&#39;s not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.240" end="00:04:41.890" style="s2">to do something with their hair or their</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.770" end="00:04:43.570" style="s2">body because it&#39;s something that&#39;s owned</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.890" end="00:04:44.950" style="s2">by a culture because it&#39;s not it&#39;s group</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.570" end="00:04:46.990" style="s2">versus individuals so those are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.950" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">conversations I think we need to have on</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.990" end="00:04:55.960" style="s2">a group scale so when we have like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:05:00.130" style="s2">prevailing culture is like western white</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.960" end="00:05:02.860" style="s2">culture and part of the reason that all</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.130" end="00:05:07.150" style="s2">of that like African American culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.860" end="00:05:10.420" style="s2">and I can&#39;t like let&#39;s be honest art</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.150" end="00:05:12.490" style="s2">comes out of out of hardness right like</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.420" end="00:05:16.870" style="s2">it&#39;s when you go through struggle as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.490" end="00:05:18.460" style="s2">group you make beautiful art it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.870" end="00:05:21.610" style="s2">say that like that should be a good</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.460" end="00:05:23.230" style="s2">thing to put the struggle but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.610" end="00:05:25.750" style="s2">understandable that people are drawn</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.230" end="00:05:27.880" style="s2">towards that better art at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.750" end="00:05:29.830" style="s2">as an artist which I&#39;m not it makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.880" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">sense that people drawn to that style of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.830" end="00:05:35.080" style="s2">art are gonna want to copy or bring that</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:37.930" style="s2">into their art form right so the fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.080" end="00:05:40.210" style="s2">that white people get recognition for</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.930" end="00:05:42.340" style="s2">doing rap and R&amp;B and jazz and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.210" end="00:05:44.530" style="s2">that is phenomenally from black culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.340" end="00:05:47.590" style="s2">that&#39;s a group conversation chin and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.530" end="00:05:49.060" style="s2">it&#39;s ridiculous right like that white</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.590" end="00:05:51.490" style="s2">people are like drawn to black culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.060" end="00:05:53.170" style="s2">but don&#39;t but are still few racist as</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.490" end="00:05:56.020" style="s2"> like that&#39;s that&#39;s problematic</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.170" end="00:05:57.610" style="s2">as a group as individuals though like</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.020" end="00:05:59.110" style="s2">you&#39;re allowed to like what you like and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.610" end="00:06:00.340" style="s2">not like what you don&#39;t like and do the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.110" end="00:06:02.350" style="s2">art that you want to do and where the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.340" end="00:06:04.270" style="s2">fashion you want to wear personally it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.350" end="00:06:08.530" style="s2">like it&#39;s the individual versus the</p>

<p begin="00:07:26.020" end="00:07:29.770" style="s2">some other thoughts on like that I&#39;ve a</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.870" end="00:07:32.830" style="s2">lot of thoughts of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.770" end="00:07:35.050" style="s2">appropriation which is both what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.830" end="00:07:36.880" style="s2">trying to accomplish I very much want to</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.760" end="00:07:47.710" style="s2">privilege based on stupid right but</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.070" end="00:07:50.410" style="s2">I don&#39;t think cultural appropriation</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.710" end="00:07:52.510" style="s2">helps that but I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.410" end="00:07:55.480" style="s2">flipping like it&#39;s like it lets the</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.720" end="00:08:11.380" style="s2">up per capita like whether cuz it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.910" end="00:08:12.850" style="s2">it was it was it&#39;s it&#39;s from India but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.380" end="00:08:15.790" style="s2">don&#39;t think many Indians actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.850" end="00:08:17.740" style="s2">practice it because it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:08:22.150" end="00:08:25.720" style="s2">not that&#39;s not a lot that&#39;s cultural</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.010" end="00:08:27.940" style="s2">appropriation like all of it is that but</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.720" end="00:08:29.290" style="s2">at the same time I don&#39;t know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.940" end="00:08:31.150" style="s2">some truth there for me where I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.290" end="00:08:32.919" style="s2">wait if it has been like so co-opted</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.150" end="00:08:34.630" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually kind of like when I</p>

<p begin="00:08:43.810" end="00:08:47.950" style="s2">Indian people practicing it then white</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.300" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">people that&#39;s probably the case because</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.950" end="00:08:54.690" style="s2">there&#39;s more Indian people but if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:57.880" style="s2">not the case it&#39;s definitely not like</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.690" end="00:08:59.620" style="s2">prom prominent in India like because</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.380" end="00:09:36.430" style="s2">like suppressing people color talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.290" end="00:09:38.740" style="s2">about how it&#39;s affecting them because if</p>

<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:52.180" style="s2">it is part of it&#39;s like how I say Amen</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:55.990" style="s2">at the end of dinner when I&#39;m praying</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.180" end="00:09:58.600" style="s2">with my my my mom but I don&#39;t pray when</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.200" end="00:10:13.300" style="s2">to want to give and I don&#39;t pray it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.260" end="00:10:15.280" style="s2">like all right it&#39;s like namaste the God</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.300" end="00:10:16.600" style="s2">in me slits or ballast to the God in you</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.280" end="00:10:18.310" style="s2">like I&#39;m like there&#39;s something so</p>

<p begin="00:10:21.220" end="00:10:24.730" style="s2">and I get like I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.720" end="00:10:25.840" style="s2">about the idea of the group versus</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.730" end="00:10:28.150" style="s2">individual I was also happy in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.840" end="00:10:33.010" style="s2">scanner as I said these are not</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.150" end="00:10:34.810" style="s2">crystallized thoughts and so this video</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.010" end="00:10:36.700" style="s2">I did before which is a nice on here</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.810" end="00:10:41.230" style="s2">it&#39;s on the Facebook group of the normal</p>

<p begin="00:10:48.070" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">that is its own its own thing of luck on</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.370" end="00:10:57.700" style="s2">that on the the normal curve and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:59.830" style="s2">point is as I was also looking Adam like</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.700" end="00:11:02.440" style="s2">dealing with out on an individual basis</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.830" end="00:11:04.450" style="s2">is like okay I very much feel there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.440" end="00:11:07.750" style="s2">no better in worse right like bravery</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.450" end="00:11:09.430" style="s2">versus cowardice clearly bravery is</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.750" end="00:11:12.460" style="s2">better but that&#39;s because we&#39;ve labeled</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.430" end="00:11:14.920" style="s2">the flight cowardice it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.460" end="00:11:16.750" style="s2">not what it is it&#39;s like okay confront</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.920" end="00:11:18.580" style="s2">or run away and those are both have</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.750" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">their places and they both you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.580" end="00:11:23.740" style="s2">likely to survive when you run away and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:24.940" style="s2">with a group like so it&#39;s an individual</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.740" end="00:11:26.740" style="s2">it&#39;s like you have a certain skill set</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.940" end="00:11:28.180" style="s2">and that either makes you better worse</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.740" end="00:11:29.590" style="s2">than other people and that&#39;s not true it</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.180" end="00:11:33.330" style="s2">makes you different than other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.590" end="00:11:36.790" style="s2">but not better or some other people and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.330" end="00:11:39.580" style="s2">looking at that whole like where people</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.790" end="00:11:43.060" style="s2">are going to give their action and</p>
