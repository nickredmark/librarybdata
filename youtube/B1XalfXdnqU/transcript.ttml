<p begin="00:00:03.720" end="00:00:08.460" style="s2">whether you&#39;re new to my work or whether</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.759" end="00:00:13.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve been drawing from my work for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.460" end="00:00:16.560" style="s2">last three four years or longer now is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.170" end="00:00:21.330" style="s2">special moment in my personal life but</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.560" end="00:00:23.070" style="s2">also on a planetary scale that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.330" end="00:00:26.910" style="s2">us have to reconsider how they do their</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.070" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">work and I basically have just had my</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.910" end="00:00:34.940" style="s2">income slashed by about seventy five</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:37.680" style="s2">percent and that income is supported</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.940" end="00:00:40.440" style="s2">probably me working more than half of my</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.680" end="00:00:43.379" style="s2">time for free for many organizations but</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.440" end="00:00:46.170" style="s2">also doing the work I do online sharing</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.379" end="00:00:48.090" style="s2">things so this is really a call to all</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.170" end="00:00:49.890" style="s2">of you to who can afford it because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.090" end="00:00:53.850" style="s2">know many of you are in similar</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.890" end="00:00:55.469" style="s2">situations or much worse those of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.850" end="00:00:58.289" style="s2">who can afford it and have appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.469" end="00:01:00.780" style="s2">my working can still afford to maybe put</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.289" end="00:01:04.830" style="s2">a standing order to support one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.780" end="00:01:07.140" style="s2">six tiers I&#39;ve set up on patreon I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.830" end="00:01:11.280" style="s2">really ask you to consider where they</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.140" end="00:01:13.110" style="s2">can do that because I would love to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">able to continue to do my work and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.110" end="00:01:19.290" style="s2">will try to do my best anyway to do so</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">but right now is really the time where I</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.290" end="00:01:24.860" style="s2">need a little bit of support and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:28.049" style="s2">can come in different ways from monthly</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.860" end="00:01:31.229" style="s2">donations that range from ten to twenty</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.049" end="00:01:33.470" style="s2">to fifty to a hundred to two hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.229" end="00:01:35.880" style="s2">even to five hundred euros a month and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.470" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">if you look at the page you can see</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:42.680" style="s2">these six tiers are structured with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:45.420" style="s2">couple of little return gift offers but</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.680" end="00:01:47.220" style="s2">really what I&#39;m asking you is to support</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.420" end="00:01:50.220" style="s2">me to keep doing what I&#39;m doing and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.220" end="00:01:53.100" style="s2">you feel that that is valuable and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.220" end="00:01:55.770" style="s2">you can afford to support it then</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.100" end="00:01:57.689" style="s2">consider it and otherwise please keep</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.770" end="00:01:59.219" style="s2">drawing from the material and I will not</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.689" end="00:02:03.450" style="s2">hide stuff behind paywalls</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.219" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">because I want these ideas to travel and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.450" end="00:02:08.460" style="s2">I want to support the regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.189" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">rising everywhere as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.460" end="00:02:13.590" style="s2">I don&#39;t pretend I&#39;ve never pretended to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:15.990" style="s2">have answers but I have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:17.820" style="s2">questions and I&#39;ve done a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.990" end="00:02:19.980" style="s2">over the last 20 years looking at how we</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.820" end="00:02:22.950" style="s2">might participate more appropriately in</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.980" end="00:02:25.020" style="s2">this nested wholeness that is us in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.950" end="00:02:27.290" style="s2">we depend upon or we can create</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.020" end="00:02:30.200" style="s2">community resilience how we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.290" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">regenerate by the regional economies and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.200" end="00:02:34.980" style="s2">restore local ecosystems and how</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">ultimately can heal the planet and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.980" end="00:02:41.190" style="s2">the course heal ourselves that is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:45.060" style="s2">what I&#39;m dedicated to it and what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.190" end="00:02:47.490" style="s2">continue to do now but now has come the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.060" end="00:02:50.100" style="s2">time where if you can please consider</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.490" end="00:02:52.530" style="s2">supporting it so thank you very much and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.100" end="00:02:55.920" style="s2">take a look at the letter and the six</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.530" end="00:02:57.900" style="s2">possible ways of supporting me and just</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.920" end="00:03:00.390" style="s2">sharing my work as already supporting me</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.900" end="00:03:02.610" style="s2">and reading it is nourishing me to see</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.390" end="00:03:05.940" style="s2">how many people come back and actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.610" end="00:03:08.610" style="s2">draw meaning and inside and new guidance</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.940" end="00:03:10.170" style="s2">from the things that I&#39;ve just pulled</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.610" end="00:03:12.270" style="s2">together from other people&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.170" end="00:03:17.640" style="s2">honoring the network and making the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.270" end="00:03:19.710" style="s2">network visible so please I&#39;m deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.640" end="00:03:22.700" style="s2">grateful if you could help a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.710" end="00:03:22.700" style="s2">thank you bye</p>
