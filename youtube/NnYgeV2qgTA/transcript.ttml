<p begin="00:00:01.040" end="00:00:06.330" style="s2">welcome to the stola the stoah is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">digital campfire where we go here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.590" end="00:00:24.470" style="s2">let&#39;s talk more about why we&#39;re here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.320" end="00:00:25.939" style="s2">what&#39;s going on so the Cova trolley I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.470" end="00:00:27.169" style="s2">going to share my well first I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.939" end="00:00:28.730" style="s2">give you some explanation that I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.169" end="00:00:31.699" style="s2">share a presentation we&#39;re gonna walk</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.730" end="00:00:33.290" style="s2">through the presentation and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.699" end="00:00:35.870" style="s2">try to make this as accessible as</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.290" end="00:00:40.250" style="s2">possible so the trolley problem is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.870" end="00:00:43.370" style="s2">frequent moral device that is brought up</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.250" end="00:00:45.260" style="s2">whenever you want to figure out if we</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.370" end="00:00:47.030" style="s2">pick this path there&#39;s a consequence and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.260" end="00:00:48.559" style="s2">we pick this path there&#39;s a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.030" end="00:00:51.500" style="s2">and both consequences are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.559" end="00:00:54.400" style="s2">terrible so which one do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.500" end="00:00:58.420" style="s2">suffer with the most basically this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.400" end="00:01:00.559" style="s2">very important today not just for</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.420" end="00:01:04.239" style="s2">philosophical reasons but also because</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.559" end="00:01:07.760" style="s2">of the advent of AI so because of</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.239" end="00:01:10.490" style="s2">artificial vision machine learning data</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.760" end="00:01:12.020" style="s2">science those things fusing together is</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.490" end="00:01:14.540" style="s2">creating scenarios where you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.020" end="00:01:16.520" style="s2">self-driving cars where the car has to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.540" end="00:01:19.070" style="s2">make a split decision does it go one way</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.520" end="00:01:20.300" style="s2">and wipe out a 70 year old white elderly</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.070" end="00:01:22.570" style="s2">woman or does it go the other way and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.300" end="00:01:24.650" style="s2">then wipe out a 17 year old black female</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.570" end="00:01:26.480" style="s2">what do you pick you can only pick one</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.650" end="00:01:28.400" style="s2">way you&#39;re gonna accidentally tackle</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.480" end="00:01:30.470" style="s2">someone here at high speed and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.400" end="00:01:32.740" style="s2">not gonna go well so what is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.470" end="00:01:35.659" style="s2">criteria you&#39;re picking for your choice</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.740" end="00:01:39.430" style="s2">I tend to think that that criteria is</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.659" end="00:01:42.110" style="s2">ultimately going to be risk-based</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.430" end="00:01:44.060" style="s2">economics as they&#39;re already calculated</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.110" end="00:01:46.729" style="s2">in Lloyd&#39;s of London and other players</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.060" end="00:01:50.000" style="s2">but what&#39;s happening now is we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.729" end="00:01:52.820" style="s2">the this moral trolley problem being</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.000" end="00:01:55.100" style="s2">carted out in the kovat space without</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.820" end="00:01:57.170" style="s2">formalizing it so there&#39;s this fun</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.100" end="00:01:59.240" style="s2">little dichotomy that&#39;s forming in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.170" end="00:02:02.030" style="s2">mimetic space where it&#39;s either well the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.240" end="00:02:03.560" style="s2">government has to intervene or it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.030" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">going to kill a lot of people but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.560" end="00:02:06.530" style="s2">markets have to burn and other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:07.970" style="s2">will say well the markets have to stay</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.530" end="00:02:10.310" style="s2">alive otherwise the people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.970" end="00:02:13.330" style="s2">starve so in either scenario you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.310" end="00:02:15.799" style="s2">really terrible outcome so what this</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.330" end="00:02:17.659" style="s2">discussion is going to go down is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.799" end="00:02:19.730" style="s2">going to say well let&#39;s back up a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.659" end="00:02:21.790" style="s2">instead of picking one the other let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.730" end="00:02:24.109" style="s2">look at this from an epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.790" end="00:02:25.549" style="s2">standpoint and instead of trying to pick</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.109" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">one way or another and then rationalize</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.549" end="00:02:29.300" style="s2">whatever body count you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:32.690" style="s2">rationalize let&#39;s instead</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.300" end="00:02:34.940" style="s2">Edie say hey let&#39;s explore how these two</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.690" end="00:02:37.550" style="s2">things feed back into each other how</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.940" end="00:02:38.750" style="s2">does the population that&#39;s getting sick</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.550" end="00:02:41.420" style="s2">affect the economy and how does the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.750" end="00:02:42.980" style="s2">economy improve the people getting sick</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.420" end="00:02:45.770" style="s2">so let&#39;s look at that feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.980" end="00:02:47.390" style="s2">instead and so that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.770" end="00:02:49.580" style="s2">preference I&#39;m going to now turn it over</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.390" end="00:02:51.320" style="s2">to the screen share and we&#39;ll go from</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.580" end="00:03:00.320" style="s2">there and I&#39;ll go through this one step</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.320" end="00:03:05.420" style="s2">at a time and let me know if everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.320" end="00:03:06.710" style="s2">can see that okay a little laser making</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.420" end="00:03:09.230" style="s2">sure if I can see it so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.710" end="00:03:11.060" style="s2">little meme I found floating about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.230" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">internet and I realized that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.060" end="00:03:16.520" style="s2">funny and the implication of the meme is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">that you&#39;re basically screwed no matter</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.520" end="00:03:19.880" style="s2">what you pick you&#39;re more along the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:21.800" style="s2">lines of who do you want to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.880" end="00:03:22.910" style="s2">first you want to trash the economy do</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.800" end="00:03:25.430" style="s2">you want to trash a bunch of sick people</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.910" end="00:03:27.740" style="s2">first and in either case they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.430" end="00:03:30.620" style="s2">getting trashed so I found this meme to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.740" end="00:03:34.190" style="s2">be a proper reflection of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.620" end="00:03:36.320" style="s2">problem because of the symbiotic nature</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.190" end="00:03:40.010" style="s2">the people are the economy and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.320" end="00:03:42.230" style="s2">economy feeds back on people so because</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.010" end="00:03:44.660" style="s2">of that complicated nature what is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.230" end="00:03:46.100" style="s2">economy what it what are what is kovat</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.660" end="00:03:47.300" style="s2">even what it what are the people what</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.100" end="00:03:51.470" style="s2">are what are all these actors in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.300" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">play here I let&#39;s start with you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.470" end="00:03:55.100" style="s2">let&#39;s start with the train which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:03:56.360" style="s2">kovat what is it right you might think</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.100" end="00:03:57.650" style="s2">you know something about it you might</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.360" end="00:03:59.390" style="s2">know a little bit about the disease you</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.650" end="00:04:02.270" style="s2">might have heard that it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.390" end="00:04:04.340" style="s2">aids and it has this cytokine storm sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.270" end="00:04:05.750" style="s2">of effect you might have heard a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.340" end="00:04:09.320" style="s2">people are getting infected with it but</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.750" end="00:04:10.850" style="s2">it accumulates you&#39;ve heard a lot you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.320" end="00:04:12.650" style="s2">heard other people say it&#39;s fake I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.850" end="00:04:18.310" style="s2">sure you&#39;ve come across the entire</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.650" end="00:04:18.310" style="s2">spectrum of possibilities here so</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.430" end="00:04:24.200" style="s2">whatever you think you know about it you</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.989" end="00:04:26.750" style="s2">actually don&#39;t unless you were there and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.200" end="00:04:28.550" style="s2">even if you were a lab person sitting</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.750" end="00:04:30.530" style="s2">there under the microscope poking and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.550" end="00:04:32.540" style="s2">prodding this thing and you&#39;ve or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.530" end="00:04:33.890" style="s2">one of the team of the potential bio</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.540" end="00:04:35.540" style="s2">weapon engineers who made this thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.890" end="00:04:39.380" style="s2">even then you still don&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.540" end="00:04:41.240" style="s2">this thing is and there&#39;s a good chance</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.380" end="00:04:43.160" style="s2">that we&#39;ll never know what this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.240" end="00:04:45.300" style="s2">now why is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.160" end="00:04:47.130" style="s2">these two statements are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.300" end="00:04:49.050" style="s2">controversial to say because we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.130" end="00:04:51.000" style="s2">huge amount of faith in a concept of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.050" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">science the idea that if we put anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.000" end="00:04:54.960" style="s2">under the scrutiny we&#39;ll figure out all</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:57.510" style="s2">kinds of details about it and we&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.960" end="00:04:58.350" style="s2">up with some good enough conclusions you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.510" end="00:05:00.030" style="s2">don&#39;t have to figure out you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.350" end="00:05:01.889" style="s2">everything down to the particle we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.030" end="00:05:03.570" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s pragmatic for us and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.889" end="00:05:06.330" style="s2">our purposes and our needs and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.570" end="00:05:08.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of how we associate the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.330" end="00:05:11.580" style="s2">concept of knowing something and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.760" end="00:05:13.230" style="s2">pragmatically extracting usefulness from</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.580" end="00:05:14.669" style="s2">that knowledge and that&#39;s kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.230" end="00:05:16.710" style="s2">we&#39;re already trained to go so when I</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.669" end="00:05:18.900" style="s2">but when I pop these two statements in</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.710" end="00:05:20.340" style="s2">front of you and I say you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.900" end="00:05:22.200" style="s2">anything about it and you&#39;ll never know</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.340" end="00:05:24.690" style="s2">what it is there&#39;s probably like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.200" end="00:05:26.970" style="s2">some of you might be having a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.690" end="00:05:28.680" style="s2">violent reaction to that to a degree but</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.970" end="00:05:30.690" style="s2">I&#39;m not here to tempt you and troll you</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.680" end="00:05:32.370" style="s2">into that type of reaction what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.690" end="00:05:34.290" style="s2">saying is that the concept here is</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.370" end="00:05:38.810" style="s2">knowledge right to know something</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.290" end="00:05:42.080" style="s2">meaning to have a definite understanding</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.810" end="00:05:45.960" style="s2">and capacity of what this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:47.550" style="s2">unless anyone here is a virologist then</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.960" end="00:05:49.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a good chance no one&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.550" end="00:05:50.490" style="s2">gonna know anything about it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.410" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.490" end="00:05:54.810" style="s2">that is okay it usually were shunned and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:05:56.310" style="s2">we&#39;re told you can&#39;t you have to know</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.810" end="00:05:57.750" style="s2">everything because we&#39;re smart we&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.310" end="00:05:59.190" style="s2">advanced civilization so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.750" end="00:06:01.950" style="s2">know everything but it&#39;s okay to not</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.190" end="00:06:03.090" style="s2">know it&#39;s completely perfect it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.950" end="00:06:05.039" style="s2">perfectly normal</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.090" end="00:06:07.140" style="s2">we&#39;re humans which three pounds of meat</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.039" end="00:06:09.450" style="s2">up here right there&#39;s more going on in</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.140" end="00:06:11.190" style="s2">the universe then then we have the brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.450" end="00:06:12.720" style="s2">capacity for and that&#39;s okay because we</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.190" end="00:06:15.419" style="s2">have another thing that we do and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.720" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">called belief and belief isn&#39;t another</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.419" end="00:06:20.250" style="s2">is a very important part of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:22.110" style="s2">cognitive process so whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.250" end="00:06:25.610" style="s2">believe about kovat nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.110" end="00:06:28.050" style="s2">that&#39;s what Kovan nineteen actually is</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.610" end="00:06:30.660" style="s2">again another controversial statement</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.050" end="00:06:32.669" style="s2">because I could believe it&#39;s a frog and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.660" end="00:06:36.060" style="s2">therefore it is a frog that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.669" end="00:06:38.610" style="s2">complete insanity but it&#39;s not that far</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.060" end="00:06:40.410" style="s2">off from what we&#39;re already doing we</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.610" end="00:06:42.479" style="s2">believe that some of us might believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.410" end="00:06:45.210" style="s2">that it&#39;s a bioweapon some of us might</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.479" end="00:06:47.039" style="s2">believe that it&#39;s a someone ate a bat</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.210" end="00:06:48.570" style="s2">now the world economy&#39;s trash I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.039" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of wild stuff there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.570" end="00:06:51.390" style="s2">a whole spectrum of crazy stuff we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:56.430" style="s2">willing to believe here there might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.390" end="00:06:59.669" style="s2">some truth to that but truth is</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.430" end="00:07:01.949" style="s2">we&#39;ll get the truth in a second but the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.669" end="00:07:03.900" style="s2">concept of belief it&#39;s not a religious</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.949" end="00:07:08.190" style="s2">thing it&#39;s not a theocratic thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.900" end="00:07:10.860" style="s2">like belief is how we&#39;re making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.190" end="00:07:12.539" style="s2">the universe when we have a limited</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.860" end="00:07:13.889" style="s2">sensory input that we can process at a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.539" end="00:07:15.479" style="s2">time again three pounds of meat you</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.889" end="00:07:16.740" style="s2">can&#39;t store it&#39;s not like a computer up</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.479" end="00:07:18.810" style="s2">here it&#39;s not a hard drive that stores</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.740" end="00:07:20.580" style="s2">everything you&#39;re creating models of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.810" end="00:07:23.070" style="s2">universe in your brain and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.580" end="00:07:24.600" style="s2">trying to figure out what is going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.070" end="00:07:26.610" style="s2">about the world with these limited</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.600" end="00:07:28.530" style="s2">inputs and you use belief to to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.610" end="00:07:30.630" style="s2">sense of that and again this is okay too</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.530" end="00:07:35.070" style="s2">because this is what humans naturally do</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.630" end="00:07:36.810" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll always believe what</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.070" end="00:07:39.270" style="s2">kovat is right so this the inverse of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.810" end="00:07:40.919" style="s2">never knowing what it is so whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.270" end="00:07:43.020" style="s2">believe Kove it is you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.919" end="00:07:44.430" style="s2">continue to believe into the future even</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.020" end="00:07:46.229" style="s2">if you&#39;re presented with different</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.430" end="00:07:48.690" style="s2">evidence it&#39;s not that you&#39;re gonna dig</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.229" end="00:07:50.039" style="s2">your heels in and say well I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.690" end="00:07:51.720" style="s2">presented with some evidence but I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.039" end="00:07:54.150" style="s2">this this first conclusion I had was</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.720" end="00:07:55.740" style="s2">right you&#39;re going to glom on to that</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.150" end="00:07:57.930" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna take what&#39;s useful to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.740" end="00:08:01.490" style="s2">and upend it on your chain as you go</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.930" end="00:08:04.020" style="s2">Neuros gonna believe that that original</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.490" end="00:08:06.449" style="s2">belief that you have is going to mutate</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.020" end="00:08:07.830" style="s2">over time but the theme of that original</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.449" end="00:08:10.199" style="s2">belief will carry through you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.830" end="00:08:12.090" style="s2">gonna do a hard break people just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.199" end="00:08:13.770" style="s2">do hard breaks very often statistically</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.090" end="00:08:16.050" style="s2">speaking they they kind of evolve over</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.770" end="00:08:18.539" style="s2">time and over the days so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.050" end="00:08:20.699" style="s2">looking at here is what feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.539" end="00:08:23.639" style="s2">juxtaposition between knowing something</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.699" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">and believing something but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.639" end="00:08:27.570" style="s2">actually juxtaposed at all they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:30.000" style="s2">actually they intertwine they interact</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.570" end="00:08:31.710" style="s2">and we in the West are not taught about</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:34.200" style="s2">that we&#39;re not taught that these two</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.710" end="00:08:35.880" style="s2">things interact we&#39;re taught that belief</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.200" end="00:08:38.459" style="s2">is superstition and knowledge is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.880" end="00:08:40.440" style="s2">only thing that exists if you approach</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.459" end="00:08:43.640" style="s2">with that methodology to this problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.440" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna make too many mistakes so</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.640" end="00:08:48.270" style="s2">how do we solve problems or well not</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:50.040" style="s2">solve or not here to solve anything</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.270" end="00:08:51.839" style="s2">we&#39;re here to explore so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.040" end="00:08:54.089" style="s2">explore problems that we can never know</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.839" end="00:08:56.850" style="s2">and when oh the only thing we have is</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.089" end="00:08:58.020" style="s2">belief well it&#39;s not just kovat it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.850" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">just kovat that has this problem it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.020" end="00:09:01.470" style="s2">turns out the global economy whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.000" end="00:09:04.220" style="s2">construct you have in your mind about</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.470" end="00:09:07.320" style="s2">the global economy same exact problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.220" end="00:09:09.790" style="s2">you don&#39;t know anything about it you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.320" end="00:09:12.160" style="s2">never know what the global economy is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.790" end="00:09:14.140" style="s2">it&#39;s too it&#39;s too huge it&#39;s distributed</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.160" end="00:09:16.360" style="s2">is it Goldman Sachs is it some</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.140" end="00:09:18.790" style="s2">Rothschild is that the central banks is</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.360" end="00:09:20.740" style="s2">it a bunch of farmers this is it a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.790" end="00:09:24.040" style="s2">credit swap agreement between two</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.740" end="00:09:25.810" style="s2">different houses two different banking</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.040" end="00:09:27.490" style="s2">exchanges there&#39;s a million different</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.810" end="00:09:30.190" style="s2">parts that&#39;s going on here you&#39;ll only</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.490" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">ever get a tiny subset of what the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.190" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">global economy is it&#39;s it&#39;s this massive</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:37.900" style="s2">body of activity in human action so</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:41.740" style="s2">you&#39;ll never really know what the global</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.900" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">economy is but again we&#39;ll certainly</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.740" end="00:09:46.780" style="s2">have beliefs about it and you&#39;ll always</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.320" end="00:09:50.050" style="s2">believe what it is based upon what your</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.780" end="00:09:53.190" style="s2">original beliefs are again how do we</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.050" end="00:09:59.530" style="s2">explore the problems we can never know</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.190" end="00:10:02.320" style="s2">now as I was saying there is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.530" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">interplay between truth and belief this</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.320" end="00:10:09.250" style="s2">is called epistemology which is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:10.930" style="s2">science of knowledge right so we we take</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.250" end="00:10:13.330" style="s2">the step back instead of going down the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.930" end="00:10:15.520" style="s2">trolley route and saying it&#39;s gonna wipe</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.330" end="00:10:17.350" style="s2">out the people but that&#39;ll save the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.520" end="00:10:19.080" style="s2">economy or it&#39;s gonna wipe out the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.350" end="00:10:22.960" style="s2">economy but that I&#39;ll see the people</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.080" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">instead we say okay there&#39;s a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.960" end="00:10:27.010" style="s2">truths about kovat 19 that exist I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:28.660" style="s2">know them</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.010" end="00:10:31.780" style="s2">but I&#39;m willing to accept that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.660" end="00:10:34.330" style="s2">exist then we go into beliefs about</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.780" end="00:10:35.830" style="s2">kovat 19 which I have beliefs about</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.330" end="00:10:37.270" style="s2">kovat they might be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.830" end="00:10:39.250" style="s2">but other people have beliefs and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.270" end="00:10:40.570" style="s2">might be wrong but some of them might be</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.250" end="00:10:42.460" style="s2">right I don&#39;t know what they are but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.570" end="00:10:44.620" style="s2">willing to accept there&#39;s a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.460" end="00:10:47.050" style="s2">things that my brain is doing about</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.620" end="00:10:48.940" style="s2">kovin 19 right now I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.050" end="00:10:50.950" style="s2">establish truths about it and I have</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.940" end="00:10:53.020" style="s2">beliefs about it and these two things</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.950" end="00:10:56.020" style="s2">intersect they&#39;re not opposite they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.020" end="00:10:57.820" style="s2">not enemies this isn&#39;t a a dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.020" end="00:10:58.930" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to extract from where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.820" end="00:11:01.540" style="s2">understanding that these two things</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.930" end="00:11:05.020" style="s2">automatically synthesize no dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.540" end="00:11:08.140" style="s2">required and from that synthesis you get</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.020" end="00:11:12.970" style="s2">knowledge about kovat 19 so you get</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.140" end="00:11:15.610" style="s2">useful action by by reconciling the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.970" end="00:11:17.560" style="s2">beliefs with the truths it&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.610" end="00:11:20.080" style="s2">to find truths about the kovat 19</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.560" end="00:11:21.910" style="s2">situation those truths are not going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.080" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">do anything for you it&#39;s not a question</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.910" end="00:11:26.890" style="s2">of oh it opens the road and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:28.810" style="s2">all problems are solved no it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.890" end="00:11:31.089" style="s2">solve all the problems because there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.810" end="00:11:33.730" style="s2">a intrinsic relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.089" end="00:11:35.320" style="s2">economy and the people by influencing</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.730" end="00:11:38.920" style="s2">one you influence the other which has a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.320" end="00:11:40.510" style="s2">feedback back to what you&#39;ve done so</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.920" end="00:11:42.399" style="s2">finding a truth isn&#39;t enough you still</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.510" end="00:11:44.770" style="s2">have to reconcile your beliefs as you</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:46.330" style="s2">try to make sense of this situation now</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.770" end="00:11:49.260" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking in the abstract a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.330" end="00:11:52.750" style="s2">so I promise you we&#39;re gonna get into</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.260" end="00:11:54.370" style="s2">more concrete examples of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.750" end="00:11:57.279" style="s2">high-minded crap that I&#39;m spewing right</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.370" end="00:11:59.020" style="s2">now it also turns out that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.279" end="00:12:00.700" style="s2">another thing that happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.020" end="00:12:02.380" style="s2">reconcile with truths and beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.700" end="00:12:07.270" style="s2">you get poorly justified true beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.380" end="00:12:08.980" style="s2">which is to say you are right about your</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.270" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">knowledge you have pragmatic stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.980" end="00:12:14.230" style="s2">can do about it you just can&#39;t defend it</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:17.110" style="s2">very well that&#39;s what that means so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.230" end="00:12:19.060" style="s2">might have a glimmer of understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.110" end="00:12:21.070" style="s2">what&#39;s going on but you just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.060" end="00:12:22.990" style="s2">how to defend it in either a court of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.070" end="00:12:26.649" style="s2">law or in front of a scientist or in</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.990" end="00:12:28.540" style="s2">front of a lawyer you just you just suck</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.649" end="00:12:31.390" style="s2">you just know something right and this</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.540" end="00:12:33.730" style="s2">this kind of struggle leads to two</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.390" end="00:12:35.170" style="s2">outcomes that are completely again these</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.730" end="00:12:37.779" style="s2">the outcomes are completely okay they</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.170" end="00:12:38.860" style="s2">work the first is having knowledge about</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.779" end="00:12:40.120" style="s2">it where you can explain it you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.860" end="00:12:42.310" style="s2">defend it other people see it they can</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.120" end="00:12:43.660" style="s2">repeat it it&#39;s good that leads to more</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.310" end="00:12:45.910" style="s2">traditional science routes and then the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.660" end="00:12:48.490" style="s2">poorly justified true beliefs is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.910" end="00:12:51.130" style="s2">known as a black box it works you just</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.490" end="00:12:53.890" style="s2">don&#39;t know why and the world is full of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.130" end="00:12:56.529" style="s2">black boxes AI for the vast majority of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.890" end="00:12:58.600" style="s2">AI is actually a black box you put an</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.529" end="00:13:02.290" style="s2">input it gives you the output you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.600" end="00:13:04.510" style="s2">why worked it just did and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.290" end="00:13:06.970" style="s2">okay he said this is all okay none of</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.510" end="00:13:11.100" style="s2">this is a stigma there&#39;s a huge cultural</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.970" end="00:13:13.540" style="s2">stigma around this sort of stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.100" end="00:13:14.529" style="s2">epistemology we&#39;re gonna lay out on the</p>

<p begin="00:13:14.529" end="00:13:19.089" style="s2">what faded interview was this gradient</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.570" end="00:13:21.160" style="s2">where we have localized belief of going</p>

<p begin="00:14:01.980" end="00:14:06.670" style="s2">so here&#39;s some examples finally some</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.660" end="00:14:08.980" style="s2">examples right as high-minded Crabbe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.670" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">spinning so a localized belief would be</p>

<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:16.840" style="s2">common local belief i i certainly have</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.350" end="00:14:18.340" style="s2">that local belief communal beliefs is</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.840" end="00:14:20.890" style="s2">something that we all tend to agree on</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.340" end="00:14:22.180" style="s2">we need to self isolate whether we do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.890" end="00:14:24.820" style="s2">or now it&#39;s a different story but we</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.180" end="00:14:26.710" style="s2">need to that&#39;s e belief and then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.820" end="00:14:28.810" style="s2">define belief is that copa 19 exists</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.710" end="00:14:31.510" style="s2">it&#39;s there it&#39;s in the world right so</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.810" end="00:14:34.450" style="s2">these are beliefs they feel like truths</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.510" end="00:14:36.520" style="s2">they certainly feel like troops but</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.450" end="00:14:37.900" style="s2">their beliefs no it&#39;s the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.520" end="00:14:41.350" style="s2">well let me give you some examples some</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.900" end="00:14:43.350" style="s2">truths a localized truth is that many of</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.350" end="00:14:47.830" style="s2">us do not know many people with it</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.350" end="00:14:50.260" style="s2">that&#39;s a true statement Cova 19 is</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.830" end="00:14:53.710" style="s2">staring people that is a true statement</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.260" end="00:14:55.270" style="s2">as well it&#39;s not that it appears scary</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.710" end="00:14:56.560" style="s2">it is doing it right that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.270" end="00:14:58.870" style="s2">definitively doing this this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.560" end="00:15:00.580" style="s2">repeatedly you take a snippet of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.870" end="00:15:03.730" style="s2">world and you get hey this is scaring</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.580" end="00:15:05.560" style="s2">people okay scaring people define truths</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.730" end="00:15:08.850" style="s2">would be that we can demonstrate that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.560" end="00:15:11.920" style="s2">kovin 19 has hurt the stock exchanges</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.850" end="00:15:15.760" style="s2">30% wipe of the market just in the past</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.920" end="00:15:17.650" style="s2">like month it&#39;s been disaster so what do</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:23.650" style="s2">we do with these points right well</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.650" end="00:15:28.050" style="s2">excuse me one moment I believe I have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.650" end="00:15:29.800" style="s2">sneeze nope I don&#39;t have to okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.050" end="00:15:33.940" style="s2">therefore there wasn&#39;t the truth of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.800" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">so we have our we have our beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.940" end="00:15:36.820" style="s2">our truths and what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:39.430" style="s2">is we&#39;re trying to find other black</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.820" end="00:15:40.450" style="s2">boxes or adjustable processes we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.430" end="00:15:41.500" style="s2">know what they are right now so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.450" end="00:15:46.530" style="s2">going to walk through and explore and</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.500" end="00:15:46.530" style="s2">figure out the hell these are and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.670" end="00:15:52.670" style="s2">so yeah we&#39;re trying to squeeze these</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.490" end="00:15:55.070" style="s2">things together to reconcile to find out</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.670" end="00:15:56.600" style="s2">what we can actually do about it instead</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.070" end="00:15:58.220" style="s2">of either listening to an authority or</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.600" end="00:16:00.110" style="s2">listening to some conspiracy or</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.220" end="00:16:01.880" style="s2">listening to our friends what can we</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.110" end="00:16:04.010" style="s2">actually tangibly do about this stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.880" end="00:16:08.240" style="s2">understand the cycle between the people</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.010" end="00:16:11.660" style="s2">the economy and all the interrelation so</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.240" end="00:16:13.580" style="s2">because of this those little those</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.660" end="00:16:15.110" style="s2">little boxes I showed you in the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.580" end="00:16:17.000" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s a categorization process</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.110" end="00:16:19.430" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to categorize what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.000" end="00:16:21.920" style="s2">belief and what is knowledge what is</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.430" end="00:16:25.430" style="s2">truth so that we can find ology see this</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:27.470" style="s2">is an epistemic categorization and what</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.430" end="00:16:29.090" style="s2">is the epistemic categorization of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.470" end="00:16:31.130" style="s2">virus well it&#39;s a nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.090" end="00:16:33.110" style="s2">unfortunately now why is it a night</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.130" end="00:16:35.510" style="s2">where nightmare because of how it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.110" end="00:16:38.030" style="s2">combined this is a lot I&#39;m gonna walk</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.510" end="00:16:40.070" style="s2">you through this race okay Pat so</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.030" end="00:16:41.690" style="s2">there&#39;s this giant gray box in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.070" end="00:16:43.370" style="s2">middle of the screen other people</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.690" end="00:16:44.930" style="s2">noticed it yeah your mouse is on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.370" end="00:16:48.560" style="s2">right now yeah there you go there you go</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.930" end="00:16:50.840" style="s2">thanks folks so we have let&#39;s just start</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.560" end="00:16:52.040" style="s2">with some high-level categorization so</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.840" end="00:16:54.320" style="s2">we can wrap our head around this problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.040" end="00:16:56.660" style="s2">we have infected and we have uninfected</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.320" end="00:16:59.420" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a fair categorization to</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.660" end="00:17:00.590" style="s2">start with it might be to course but</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.420" end="00:17:02.300" style="s2">it&#39;s where we start because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.590" end="00:17:04.730" style="s2">exploring we&#39;re not trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.300" end="00:17:07.130" style="s2">we&#39;re exploring right so put on your</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.730" end="00:17:08.630" style="s2">door the Explorer hat and away we go</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.130" end="00:17:10.970" style="s2">infected people can be further</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.630" end="00:17:12.920" style="s2">categorized into these people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.970" end="00:17:14.990" style="s2">infected and they know it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.920" end="00:17:16.850" style="s2">infected and they don&#39;t know it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.990" end="00:17:18.710" style="s2">infected and they believe they have it</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.850" end="00:17:21.140" style="s2">they&#39;re infected and they don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.710" end="00:17:23.390" style="s2">they have it now the last of the two</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.140" end="00:17:25.670" style="s2">here that you can see that I&#39;m circling</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.390" end="00:17:28.400" style="s2">of these two that can be broken down</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.670" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">further into people who are infected</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.400" end="00:17:31.730" style="s2">they don&#39;t know it and they know they</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:33.260" style="s2">can get it people are infected they</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.730" end="00:17:35.690" style="s2">don&#39;t know it and they don&#39;t know they</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.260" end="00:17:36.980" style="s2">can get it people are infected you see</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.690" end="00:17:39.260" style="s2">how it combines right it just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.980" end="00:17:41.960" style="s2">explodes from there right so each one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.260" end="00:17:43.730" style="s2">these is a category that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.960" end="00:17:45.560" style="s2">account for when you&#39;re trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.730" end="00:17:47.330" style="s2">out what is true and what is a belief</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.560" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">this is very important in the belief</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.330" end="00:17:52.310" style="s2">analysis part because this indicates the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:54.530" style="s2">type of range of actions that a person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.310" end="00:17:56.870" style="s2">willing to take based upon these</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.530" end="00:18:00.090" style="s2">categorization motives effectively or</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.870" end="00:18:01.770" style="s2">state of being the infected person</p>

<p begin="00:18:03.539" end="00:18:07.799" style="s2">will get it that&#39;s that&#39;s a totally</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.090" end="00:18:09.330" style="s2">different spectrum of action that person</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.799" end="00:18:11.909" style="s2">will take as opposed to a person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.330" end="00:18:14.039" style="s2">uninfected and they know it it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.909" end="00:18:16.470" style="s2">totally influence our actions now going</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.039" end="00:18:18.240" style="s2">through the unaffected side same rules</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.470" end="00:18:22.520" style="s2">apply there&#39;s a lot of combinations of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.240" end="00:18:22.520" style="s2">these different types of categories now</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.510" end="00:18:28.710" style="s2">so as you could tell it&#39;s uh it gets</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.240" end="00:18:30.179" style="s2">messy real quick when you start</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.710" end="00:18:32.970" style="s2">combining all these things together and</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.179" end="00:18:35.010" style="s2">so if anybody tries to say well I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.970" end="00:18:36.659" style="s2">the truth of something well first you</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.010" end="00:18:39.750" style="s2">have to you have to have to resolve this</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.659" end="00:18:41.700" style="s2">combination of of interactions because</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.750" end="00:18:43.350" style="s2">each one of these people are interacting</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.700" end="00:18:45.510" style="s2">with each other that is what infection</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.350" end="00:18:49.610" style="s2">is that is what the economy is human</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.510" end="00:18:51.770" style="s2">action interacting with one another so</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.610" end="00:18:55.280" style="s2">how do all of these types of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.770" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">interact mmm that&#39;s that&#39;s a tough one</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.280" end="00:18:59.540" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge amount of data you have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:01.310" style="s2">gather so we tend to rely on heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.540" end="00:19:03.920" style="s2">we tend to rely on belief to help us</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.310" end="00:19:06.260" style="s2">navigate this mess and again that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.920" end="00:19:07.880" style="s2">there is no stigma to belief because</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.260" end="00:19:11.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a starting point to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.880" end="00:19:13.880" style="s2">all this stuff now again there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.240" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">people who tend to come up and they like</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.880" end="00:19:18.170" style="s2">to say oh no it&#39;s the blue church ball</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:20.210" style="s2">with loud opinions and they&#39;ll say oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.170" end="00:19:23.230" style="s2">because this messy combination of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.210" end="00:19:25.580" style="s2">it&#39;s right for trolling it&#39;s right for</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.230" end="00:19:27.080" style="s2">propaganda and disbelief and all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.580" end="00:19:27.800" style="s2">negative things and that is true that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.080" end="00:19:30.470" style="s2">a true statement</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.800" end="00:19:32.510" style="s2">that&#39;s legit right so let&#39;s explore</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.470" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">precisely how to do disinformation</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.510" end="00:19:38.120" style="s2">campaign given this combination of</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:39.830" style="s2">information so here is a I made all</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.120" end="00:19:43.010" style="s2">these numbers up none of these are true</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.830" end="00:19:45.800" style="s2">they&#39;re just demonstrations so what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.010" end="00:19:47.750" style="s2">done is I&#39;ve taken the uninfected group</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.800" end="00:19:48.860" style="s2">here I broken them down into no believe</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.750" end="00:19:50.570" style="s2">don&#39;t know don&#39;t believe and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.860" end="00:19:51.950" style="s2">further can&#39;t get can&#39;t get so forth</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.570" end="00:19:54.530" style="s2">right and I&#39;ve done the same for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.950" end="00:19:55.670" style="s2">infected and these percentages again</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.530" end="00:19:57.110" style="s2">they&#39;re made up their garbage but</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.670" end="00:20:00.170" style="s2">they&#39;re demonstrating a point they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.110" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">demonstrating the chances of this group</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.170" end="00:20:03.980" style="s2">of people intersecting with this group</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:06.140" style="s2">of people and then coordinating in a way</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.980" end="00:20:07.460" style="s2">that can help them for their local</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.140" end="00:20:09.170" style="s2">problems I&#39;m just stuck because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.460" end="00:20:10.670" style="s2">a what there&#39;s way more different</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.170" end="00:20:13.130" style="s2">combinations of factors you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.670" end="00:20:14.300" style="s2">at here I didn&#39;t even represent infected</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.130" end="00:20:17.690" style="s2">interacting with in fact that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.300" end="00:20:21.320" style="s2">uninfected interact this is purely just</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.690" end="00:20:25.910" style="s2">like a small subset of of how crazy you</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.320" end="00:20:28.010" style="s2">want to play this game of of seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.910" end="00:20:29.600" style="s2">these categorizations what how these</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.010" end="00:20:32.120" style="s2">categories interact with each other in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.600" end="00:20:35.060" style="s2">way that&#39;s beneficial to each and as you</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.120" end="00:20:38.360" style="s2">can tell it&#39;s just these this is just</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.060" end="00:20:41.210" style="s2">nuts and this is a failure of of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.360" end="00:20:43.430" style="s2">categorization theory to a degree which</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.210" end="00:20:45.170" style="s2">is in sense a failure of set theory</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.430" end="00:20:47.110" style="s2">which in turn could be a failure of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.170" end="00:20:50.150" style="s2">scientific approach which we will get to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.110" end="00:20:51.260" style="s2">so if there is a fear here there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.150" end="00:20:54.350" style="s2">genuine fear that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.260" end="00:20:56.900" style="s2">disinformation campaign I would like for</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.350" end="00:20:58.940" style="s2">you to point to me what cell do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.900" end="00:21:00.860" style="s2">target to get the maximum amount of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.940" end="00:21:04.230" style="s2">disinformation</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.860" end="00:21:05.970" style="s2">that&#39;s really hard because there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.230" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">much craziness going on there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.970" end="00:21:09.690" style="s2">interaction going on here it&#39;s not Lake</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:12.120" style="s2">case a central conspiracy where I can</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.690" end="00:21:13.590" style="s2">come down and say oh if I touch this</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.120" end="00:21:15.889" style="s2">cell it&#39;ll spread to all these other</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.590" end="00:21:18.360" style="s2">cells now structurally yes there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.889" end="00:21:20.009" style="s2">center points that you can target to</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.360" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">maximize the influence of these</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.009" end="00:21:24.090" style="s2">statistics you could say targeting</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:25.860" style="s2">central media you could say target</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.090" end="00:21:26.999" style="s2">central banking and it influenced all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.860" end="00:21:28.529" style="s2">these variables at once that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.999" end="00:21:31.860" style="s2">absolutely true that&#39;s a bias and a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.529" end="00:21:34.379" style="s2">weighting approach but if I was just a</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.860" end="00:21:36.509" style="s2">4chan troll I say I&#39;m gonna try this</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.379" end="00:21:38.399" style="s2">number I&#39;m gonna hack this by 5% I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.509" end="00:21:40.350" style="s2">gonna put some disbelief here I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.399" end="00:21:42.419" style="s2">bring down by 5% so their ability local</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.350" end="00:21:44.759" style="s2">coordinate will go down and so therefore</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.419" end="00:21:46.740" style="s2">ha I&#39;m the master troll I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.759" end="00:21:47.940" style="s2">have no idea what kind of effect that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.740" end="00:21:52.350" style="s2">gonna have on the rest of these numbers</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.940" end="00:21:54.360" style="s2">it&#39;s too small of an operation so if if</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.350" end="00:21:57.480" style="s2">trolls are your biggest concern if this</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.360" end="00:21:59.570" style="s2">information from individual actors bad</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.480" end="00:22:01.559" style="s2">faith actors is your primary concern</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.570" end="00:22:04.590" style="s2">you&#39;re giving them too much power</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.559" end="00:22:06.210" style="s2">because for starters if they are able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.590" end="00:22:07.049" style="s2">touch one of these cells and influence</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.210" end="00:22:08.429" style="s2">all the other cells</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.049" end="00:22:12.029" style="s2">it sounds like they should be in charge</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.429" end="00:22:13.409" style="s2">of the covert 19 response more than not</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.029" end="00:22:15.330" style="s2">be allowed to be anywhere near it</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.409" end="00:22:17.190" style="s2">because if they can predict their</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.330" end="00:22:19.350" style="s2">interactions with these with these</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.190" end="00:22:20.820" style="s2">points then these guys are really good</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.350" end="00:22:21.840" style="s2">and you should probably tap them for</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.820" end="00:22:23.909" style="s2">their brain power instead of being</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.840" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">afraid of them of course blue church</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.909" end="00:22:27.480" style="s2">ball has its meltdown but that&#39;s blue</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:30.779" style="s2">church ball right so this this is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.480" end="00:22:32.700" style="s2">this is the combination of of how</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.779" end="00:22:35.869" style="s2">complicated it can get really quickly</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.700" end="00:22:35.869" style="s2">when you&#39;re trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.379" end="00:22:42.600" style="s2">epistemic categories and approaches so</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.169" end="00:22:44.279" style="s2">let&#39;s back off the hard science approach</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.600" end="00:22:45.269" style="s2">because it&#39;s just outright impossible</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.279" end="00:22:47.850" style="s2">it&#39;s pointless</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.269" end="00:22:52.049" style="s2">it&#39;s almost premature to a degree let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.850" end="00:22:54.629" style="s2">instead try to explore proxies of truth</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.049" end="00:22:57.779" style="s2">again we&#39;re not solving the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.629" end="00:23:00.899" style="s2">the economy and the virus what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.779" end="00:23:03.929" style="s2">doing is we&#39;re trying to explore the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.899" end="00:23:06.869" style="s2">interactions between our beliefs and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.929" end="00:23:08.789" style="s2">truths we can discover to find brought</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.869" end="00:23:10.830" style="s2">two proxies of truth we&#39;re not finding</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.789" end="00:23:13.049" style="s2">solutions we&#39;re finding proxies of truth</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.830" end="00:23:15.299" style="s2">a proxy of truth is</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.049" end="00:23:18.210" style="s2">is sort of like a foothold where you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.299" end="00:23:23.429" style="s2">then expand your options to do further</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.210" end="00:23:25.049" style="s2">exploration right so if I was to start</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.429" end="00:23:26.940" style="s2">with localized beliefs the three</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.049" end="00:23:29.249" style="s2">examples I gave when I started over</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.940" end="00:23:31.529" style="s2">nineteen appear scary this will then</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.249" end="00:23:33.119" style="s2">open up things I need to resolve and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.529" end="00:23:35.970" style="s2">what proxy is a truth can I find that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.119" end="00:23:36.929" style="s2">are local to me how can I solve the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.970" end="00:23:38.610" style="s2">things I&#39;m afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.929" end="00:23:39.960" style="s2">if covin 19 appears scary that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.610" end="00:23:41.309" style="s2">scared of something and I need to figure</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.960" end="00:23:43.049" style="s2">out what it is I&#39;m actually scared about</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.309" end="00:23:44.700" style="s2">right so that&#39;s that&#39;s a truth</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.049" end="00:23:46.980" style="s2">exploration process I should go through</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.700" end="00:23:48.149" style="s2">I should find proxies to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.980" end="00:23:50.820" style="s2">I am actually afraid of and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.149" end="00:23:54.029" style="s2">identify that if I can&#39;t do that for</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.820" end="00:23:56.399" style="s2">whatever reason maybe I&#39;m like extremely</p>

<p begin="00:23:56.399" end="00:24:00.809" style="s2">with introversion and self exploration</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.470" end="00:24:02.460" style="s2">again that&#39;s fine not everyone is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.809" end="00:24:04.259" style="s2">same you should start looking at other</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.460" end="00:24:06.119" style="s2">people that so if you&#39;re extrovert</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.259" end="00:24:07.830" style="s2">oriented you should probably be looking</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.119" end="00:24:09.840" style="s2">at what other people are afraid of and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.830" end="00:24:13.519" style="s2">what solutions they&#39;re finding to manage</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.840" end="00:24:16.289" style="s2">that that fear could be I self isolation</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.519" end="00:24:17.940" style="s2">alcoholism that&#39;s a thing right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.289" end="00:24:19.379" style="s2">a whole medley of solutions you start</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.940" end="00:24:21.359" style="s2">looking and seeing how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.379" end="00:24:22.859" style="s2">interacting with one another so</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.359" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">depending upon what your preferences are</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.859" end="00:24:28.759" style="s2">there are ways to get to the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:30.899" style="s2">what actually appears scary about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.759" end="00:24:35.009" style="s2">when you do that you will come to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.899" end="00:24:39.570" style="s2">defined truth that is defined to you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.009" end="00:24:41.070" style="s2">sorry that I have some solutions of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.570" end="00:24:43.470" style="s2">I&#39;m afraid of right so now you have some</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.070" end="00:24:45.659" style="s2">truths to figure out this belief you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.470" end="00:24:46.919" style="s2">not trying to eliminate the belief this</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.659" end="00:24:48.179" style="s2">isn&#39;t the scientific method I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.919" end="00:24:51.119" style="s2">promoting I&#39;m not saying eliminate the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.179" end="00:24:53.039" style="s2">belief I&#39;m saying evolve the belief into</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.119" end="00:24:54.389" style="s2">these proxies of truth and that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.039" end="00:24:56.399" style="s2">important because there&#39;s one more step</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.389" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">after this so let&#39;s move on we need the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.399" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">self isolate to communal beliefs here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:03.210" style="s2">the example self-isolation interferes</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:06.330" style="s2">with my routines that&#39;s called being</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.210" end="00:25:08.580" style="s2">self honest maybe we have maybe we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.330" end="00:25:10.980" style="s2">stuff to do maybe I have to go shop or</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.580" end="00:25:13.590" style="s2">buy food you know this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.980" end="00:25:15.480" style="s2">significant impact on my ability to to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.590" end="00:25:18.809" style="s2">stay you know not infected while</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.480" end="00:25:21.779" style="s2">simultaneously staying alive so this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.809" end="00:25:23.429" style="s2">a truth about the belief the belief is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.779" end="00:25:26.520" style="s2">we need the self isolate the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.429" end="00:25:29.010" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of hard we got stuff to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.520" end="00:25:31.620" style="s2">and self-isolation isn&#39;t even widely</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.010" end="00:25:33.960" style="s2">embraced so there are other nations that</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.620" end="00:25:35.910" style="s2">are not engaging in the self isolation</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.960" end="00:25:39.570" style="s2">paranoia that we&#39;re doing right now so</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.910" end="00:25:42.150" style="s2">take I think Japan but they&#39;re iffy on</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.570" end="00:25:43.980" style="s2">their numbers from what I&#39;ve seen but I</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.150" end="00:25:46.830" style="s2">think Norway was pretty aggressive about</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.980" end="00:25:48.210" style="s2">not self isolating at all and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.830" end="00:25:50.130" style="s2">there&#39;s other states in America that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.210" end="00:25:51.780" style="s2">aren&#39;t engaging in self isolation now</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.130" end="00:25:53.370" style="s2">there&#39;s shame tactics and all these</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.780" end="00:25:55.590" style="s2">things that happen and you know trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.370" end="00:25:59.010" style="s2">to yell at each other to you know stay</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.590" end="00:26:01.110" style="s2">indoors but for the most part we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.010" end="00:26:07.860" style="s2">them we have a diaspora of self</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.110" end="00:26:08.520" style="s2">isolation adhesion or usage you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.860" end="00:26:11.280" style="s2">what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.520" end="00:26:13.080" style="s2">so okay so now we have self isolation we</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.280" end="00:26:15.570" style="s2">need to but the truth of it is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.080" end="00:26:17.820" style="s2">we&#39;re not really actually doing it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.570" end="00:26:19.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not a solution that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.820" end="00:26:22.350" style="s2">defined truth self isolation by itself</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.920" end="00:26:26.730" style="s2">is not a solution because you have too</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.350" end="00:26:29.700" style="s2">many people engaging in whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.730" end="00:26:31.800" style="s2">think self isolation is they have their</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.700" end="00:26:33.750" style="s2">belief of what self isolation means and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.800" end="00:26:36.360" style="s2">so that&#39;s informing their proxy of truth</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.750" end="00:26:39.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s not gonna be the same for all</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.360" end="00:26:41.510" style="s2">of us so because of that self isolation</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.000" end="00:26:43.500" style="s2">simply isn&#39;t a solution by itself</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.510" end="00:26:47.880" style="s2">because we&#39;re dealing with an infectious</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.500" end="00:26:50.580" style="s2">agent so now we have Koba 19 exists as</p>

<p begin="00:26:53.010" end="00:26:57.060" style="s2">I&#39;m speaking from my localized truth</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.020" end="00:26:58.230" style="s2">position that&#39;s probably true for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.060" end="00:27:00.630" style="s2">of us as well although I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.230" end="00:27:02.760" style="s2">speak out of turn and if you are dealing</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.630" end="00:27:04.290" style="s2">with Kovan 19 my absolute regards in</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.760" end="00:27:05.760" style="s2">this situation from what I&#39;ve read about</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.290" end="00:27:08.790" style="s2">it it is rather frightening when it</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:10.980" style="s2">really kicks off but I do know</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.790" end="00:27:12.990" style="s2">communally that that there are reports</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.980" end="00:27:14.940" style="s2">of people with it so there are certainly</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.990" end="00:27:17.070" style="s2">some people with it even though I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.940" end="00:27:20.400" style="s2">know anybody who has it or I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.070" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">close relations with many people who so</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.400" end="00:27:23.910" style="s2">I&#39;m left with a defined truth that some</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:25.620" style="s2">people have Kovan 19 others don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.910" end="00:27:26.910" style="s2">it now this seems kind of elementary</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.620" end="00:27:28.290" style="s2">that I&#39;m walking through maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.910" end="00:27:31.050" style="s2">giving too much emphasis on my own</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.290" end="00:27:33.660" style="s2">performance on explaining it but this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.050" end="00:27:36.570" style="s2">all pretty basic conclusions we may have</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.660" end="00:27:38.160" style="s2">sort of reached on our own but again</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.570" end="00:27:39.840" style="s2">this is a transitory step there is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.160" end="00:27:40.919" style="s2">final step after this</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.840" end="00:27:44.220" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you some more we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.919" end="00:27:46.799" style="s2">click through I&#39;m certainly not showing</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.799" end="00:27:52.590" style="s2">time to time that&#39;s about it so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.650" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">know so if I&#39;m not showing symptoms but</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.590" end="00:27:56.549" style="s2">let&#39;s look at the truth I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:27:58.110" style="s2">access to reliable testing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.549" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">localized truth I can&#39;t just go to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.110" end="00:28:01.890" style="s2">doctor be like yo I got kovat and be</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:04.679" style="s2">like you know yes no it&#39;s just not an</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.890" end="00:28:06.360" style="s2">option I&#39;ll have that Nations are not</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.679" end="00:28:08.279" style="s2">providing the same testing coverage when</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.360" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">we expanded a communal they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.279" end="00:28:13.169" style="s2">providing the same coverage at all they</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">don&#39;t have enough tests some nations or</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.169" end="00:28:17.460" style="s2">militant about it other nations or not</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:19.890" style="s2">we&#39;re left with the defined truth that</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.460" end="00:28:24.899" style="s2">there isn&#39;t widespread access to Coba 19</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.890" end="00:28:28.289" style="s2">testing then the illustrious hilarious</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.899" end="00:28:32.159" style="s2">bat soup problem where communally some</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.289" end="00:28:34.770" style="s2">guy a bat soup and then this the stock</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.159" end="00:28:37.080" style="s2">market lost 30% I&#39;ve never eaten a bat</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.770" end="00:28:38.990" style="s2">so that&#39;s a localized truth I am 100%</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.080" end="00:28:41.909" style="s2">confident that I&#39;ve never eaten a bat</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.990" end="00:28:45.750" style="s2">although someone may have snuck it into</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.909" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">my canned food once you never know but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.750" end="00:28:50.909" style="s2">do know that bats migrate they are a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:53.789" style="s2">migratory species some of them do fly as</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.909" end="00:28:57.270" style="s2">great distances as birds do that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.789" end="00:28:59.669" style="s2">known thing so what this does now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.270" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">getting to an interesting proxy of truth</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.669" end="00:29:02.539" style="s2">the first three that I&#39;ve the first four</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:04.230" style="s2">kind of throw away they&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.539" end="00:29:06.659" style="s2">demonstrating what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.230" end="00:29:08.460" style="s2">here now we&#39;re because we&#39;re engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.659" end="00:29:10.020" style="s2">this proc to your truth process now</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.460" end="00:29:12.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve come up with something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.020" end="00:29:15.090" style="s2">we&#39;ve come up with an interesting proxy</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.600" end="00:29:17.309" style="s2">the bat migration should have an</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.090" end="00:29:20.549" style="s2">influence on Cove Kotov because I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.309" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">spell Cove in 19 spread it should</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.549" end="00:29:25.140" style="s2">because of these things of terrible</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:27.090" style="s2">carriers then well its douche bat</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.140" end="00:29:28.860" style="s2">migrations and kovin infections should</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.090" end="00:29:31.529" style="s2">be simultaneous should be one to one</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.860" end="00:29:33.990" style="s2">right so now we found a proxy of truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.529" end="00:29:37.140" style="s2">that we can stand on and say now wait a</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.990" end="00:29:40.490" style="s2">minute this is missing from my belief</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.140" end="00:29:43.890" style="s2">system I did not have this previously ah</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.490" end="00:29:46.080" style="s2">okay interesting so we&#39;re taking our</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.890" end="00:29:47.909" style="s2">beliefs we&#39;re exploring them not to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.080" end="00:29:50.549" style="s2">cancel the belief or not Western</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.909" end="00:29:52.620" style="s2">scientific method we&#39;re saying I this</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.549" end="00:29:54.010" style="s2">was not part of my belief system before</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.620" end="00:29:57.940" style="s2">now I have to reckon</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.010" end="00:30:01.000" style="s2">Silus interesting okay so then Kovac 19</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.940" end="00:30:02.500" style="s2">started in China that&#39;s very common I</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.000" end="00:30:05.560" style="s2">think that&#39;s a defined belief at this</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.500" end="00:30:07.570" style="s2">point I don&#39;t know much about Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.560" end="00:30:08.860" style="s2">public health policies me personally</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.570" end="00:30:10.300" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a Chinese public health</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.860" end="00:30:11.740" style="s2">policy expert in the audience right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.300" end="00:30:13.870" style="s2">but I&#39;m certainly not that person so</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.740" end="00:30:15.640" style="s2">that&#39;s my localized truth communal truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.870" end="00:30:18.850" style="s2">is that other pandemics did start in</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.640" end="00:30:29.830" style="s2">China they have SARS and all types of</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.850" end="00:30:31.720" style="s2">animal human viruses that jumped other</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.830" end="00:30:34.480" style="s2">pandemics have started in China there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.720" end="00:30:37.000" style="s2">a long history of that and so China does</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.480" end="00:30:39.910" style="s2">have ways as so from these two built</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.000" end="00:30:42.910" style="s2">truths we can then derive that China has</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.910" end="00:30:45.250" style="s2">ways to assess where to apply public</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.910" end="00:30:48.700" style="s2">health policies so they are they do have</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.250" end="00:30:51.970" style="s2">metrics they are using if we assume</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.700" end="00:30:54.820" style="s2">China has X number of resources and Y</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.970" end="00:30:56.710" style="s2">number of people so how do we apply how</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.820" end="00:30:58.510" style="s2">do we distribute how to answer not we</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.710" end="00:31:01.750" style="s2">how does China distribute the X</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.510" end="00:31:03.970" style="s2">resources to the Y people and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.750" end="00:31:05.710" style="s2">not a utilitarian distribution it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.970" end="00:31:07.540" style="s2">like they&#39;re going for the widest amount</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.710" end="00:31:09.700" style="s2">of people they can go for they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.540" end="00:31:11.500" style="s2">for specific people they&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.700" end="00:31:13.090" style="s2">resources to the specific people that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.500" end="00:31:16.480" style="s2">they particularly want to save and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.090" end="00:31:19.390" style="s2">can identify as best we can at least we</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.480" end="00:31:20.830" style="s2">can we can attempt to identify who it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.390" end="00:31:22.750" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to save and who it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.830" end="00:31:24.490" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to sacrifice so this</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.750" end="00:31:26.020" style="s2">gives us useful information about their</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.490" end="00:31:27.970" style="s2">public health policy which can then</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.020" end="00:31:29.530" style="s2">inform how other nations might be either</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.970" end="00:31:33.250" style="s2">following it or what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.530" end="00:31:35.880" style="s2">differently and then a couple more and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.250" end="00:31:39.130" style="s2">then we&#39;ll move on to the final piece</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.880" end="00:31:41.830" style="s2">hospitals are place that can help I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.130" end="00:31:44.110" style="s2">seen hospitals request more supplies so</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.830" end="00:31:46.030" style="s2">I this is my local truth because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.110" end="00:31:47.710" style="s2">I&#39;m actually dealing with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.030" end="00:31:51.190" style="s2">acquisition of supplies to some of these</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.710" end="00:31:53.500" style="s2">hospitals and the communal truth is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.190" end="00:31:55.300" style="s2">well the the media is showing Italian</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.500" end="00:31:56.740" style="s2">hospitals as New York hospitals here is</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.300" end="00:32:00.480" style="s2">that one little flub they did a couple</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.740" end="00:32:03.280" style="s2">days ago that made the rounds and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.480" end="00:32:05.740" style="s2">what are you doing guys right on one</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.280" end="00:32:07.480" style="s2">hand they might be doing that to convey</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.740" end="00:32:07.990" style="s2">to point that this is scary and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.480" end="00:32:09.550" style="s2">should</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.990" end="00:32:11.140" style="s2">do the self isolating like we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.550" end="00:32:13.420" style="s2">it or they could be just a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.140" end="00:32:14.770" style="s2">jerk-offs being dicks with cameras or</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.420" end="00:32:17.380" style="s2">they could be both simultaneously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.770" end="00:32:18.910" style="s2">not necessarily mutually exclusive the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.380" end="00:32:20.620" style="s2">hospital is what we&#39;re able what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.910" end="00:32:23.410" style="s2">able at least from my local truth</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.620" end="00:32:26.200" style="s2">perspective I know that hospitals are</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.410" end="00:32:28.270" style="s2">requesting more supplies I know that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.200" end="00:32:30.460" style="s2">there are media reports showing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.270" end="00:32:32.410" style="s2">wrong hospitals on purpose I know that</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.460" end="00:32:34.510" style="s2">in addition to the media on social media</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.410" end="00:32:36.250" style="s2">people are sharing videos and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.510" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">attributing the hospital&#39;s where those</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.250" end="00:32:42.010" style="s2">videos did not come from so it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:45.250" style="s2">that these hospitals do not have any</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.010" end="00:32:46.929" style="s2">control over what is said about them on</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.250" end="00:32:49.780" style="s2">social media and even what is said about</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.929" end="00:32:51.190" style="s2">them on legacy media what this means to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.780" end="00:32:55.300" style="s2">me is that hospitals are now prepared to</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.190" end="00:32:57.940" style="s2">handle this bitch is simply not quite</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.300" end="00:33:00.550" style="s2">the supplies that they&#39;re getting and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.940" end="00:33:03.580" style="s2">the media the lack of media control on</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.550" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">their front means that any type of scare</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.580" end="00:33:09.850" style="s2">can panic people into a hospital</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:10.780" style="s2">unnecessarily which says to me that</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.850" end="00:33:15.280" style="s2">they&#39;re not prepared for it</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.780" end="00:33:17.320" style="s2">so this this type of this type of fear</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.280" end="00:33:20.230" style="s2">can influence the resource acquisition</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.320" end="00:33:21.520" style="s2">from the hospital&#39;s one Hospital might</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.230" end="00:33:23.950" style="s2">get more supplies that they shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.520" end="00:33:27.190" style="s2">the other one will get less supplies and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.950" end="00:33:28.630" style="s2">this Platero right here is not helping</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.190" end="00:33:30.490" style="s2">things at all</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.630" end="00:33:34.110" style="s2">so this belief is that hospitals can</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.490" end="00:33:36.580" style="s2">help but because of the problem here</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.110" end="00:33:39.010" style="s2">they might not be places that can help</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.580" end="00:33:41.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s unfortunate cuz that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.010" end="00:33:44.500" style="s2">a really deeply held local belief from</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.050" end="00:33:47.290" style="s2">many many people there will be a cure</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.500" end="00:33:50.110" style="s2">eventually yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.290" end="00:33:51.670" style="s2">belief I mean I don&#39;t want to be the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.110" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">black pill Negative Nancy on this one</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.670" end="00:33:57.040" style="s2">but let&#39;s look at a localized truce</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:59.559" style="s2">so President Trump&#39;s a hydroxy</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.040" end="00:34:01.000" style="s2">chloroquine works and then of course in</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.559" end="00:34:02.950" style="s2">Arizona couple decided to take the fish</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.000" end="00:34:06.700" style="s2">cleaner which is not hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.950" end="00:34:08.080" style="s2">but whatever I&#39;ve seen President Trump</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.700" end="00:34:11.290" style="s2">say that I don&#39;t know if it works but</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.080" end="00:34:14.379" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen him say that there are at</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.290" end="00:34:16.300" style="s2">least six distinct koban 19 vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.379" end="00:34:20.139" style="s2">trials initiatives going on right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.300" end="00:34:21.870" style="s2">from different countries so as a result</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.139" end="00:34:23.460" style="s2">we have a Anti</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.870" end="00:34:25.920" style="s2">chemical solution and we have an</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.460" end="00:34:28.950" style="s2">attenuated back an attenuated viral</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.920" end="00:34:30.780" style="s2">vaccine solution now the challenge here</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.950" end="00:34:33.180" style="s2">is that you can only take one or the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.780" end="00:34:35.160" style="s2">other from a market share perspective if</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.180" end="00:34:38.580" style="s2">I&#39;m manufacturing a million pills of</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.160" end="00:34:41.790" style="s2">hydro hydroxychloroquine and I&#39;m putting</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.580" end="00:34:44.580" style="s2">in the tremendous money for vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.790" end="00:34:46.830" style="s2">trials FDA approvals everything else I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.580" end="00:34:49.080" style="s2">looking at a sick person as a unit of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.830" end="00:34:51.390" style="s2">market I then have to then put this into</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.080" end="00:34:52.950" style="s2">right so if I give you a vaccine there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.390" end="00:34:54.690" style="s2">a chance you&#39;re not gonna take the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.950" end="00:34:56.550" style="s2">anti malarial and if I give you the anti</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.690" end="00:34:57.720" style="s2">malarial and it works there&#39;s a chance</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.550" end="00:35:00.510" style="s2">you&#39;re probably not getting the vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.720" end="00:35:03.510" style="s2">although you might right so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.510" end="00:35:05.130" style="s2">market pressure here this is an</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.510" end="00:35:06.930" style="s2">interesting thing that&#39;s not being</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.130" end="00:35:07.980" style="s2">discussed it&#39;s being alluded to so this</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.930" end="00:35:11.120" style="s2">is another one of those interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.980" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">proxies of truth hey now wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.120" end="00:35:15.240" style="s2">these two might have competitive</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">pressures with one another that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.240" end="00:35:19.350" style="s2">interesting right so now your your</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:21.840" style="s2">belief space is now expanded and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.350" end="00:35:24.990" style="s2">have to then reconcile and then finally</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.840" end="00:35:26.610" style="s2">Co V 19 is causing mass unemployment I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.990" end="00:35:29.970" style="s2">currently working at home because of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.610" end="00:35:32.100" style="s2">contagion fears which sucks I am and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.970" end="00:35:33.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who are just at</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.100" end="00:35:34.470" style="s2">home and not working which sucks even</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.810" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.470" end="00:35:39.420" style="s2">I dunno communally that 6 million people</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:41.400" style="s2">applied for unemployment I think is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.420" end="00:35:44.420" style="s2">10 million now but I don&#39;t know if those</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.400" end="00:35:48.300" style="s2">numbers are true but I know at least six</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.420" end="00:35:49.230" style="s2">that&#39;s astronomical that&#39;s that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.300" end="00:35:50.550" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.230" end="00:35:55.470" style="s2">that&#39;s like beyond Great Depression</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.550" end="00:35:58.260" style="s2">levels and so again the shredded code if</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.470" end="00:36:01.260" style="s2">19 we know that it is damaging the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.260" end="00:36:02.910" style="s2">economy so from this belief the belief</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.260" end="00:36:05.400" style="s2">is that it&#39;s causing mass employment</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.910" end="00:36:07.980" style="s2">turns out it probably is right so this</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.400" end="00:36:09.720" style="s2">is damaging the economy so what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.980" end="00:36:11.520" style="s2">done is we&#39;ve explored beliefs and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.720" end="00:36:13.470" style="s2">turn them into practice truths we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.520" end="00:36:15.240" style="s2">solving it were exploring we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.470" end="00:36:18.090" style="s2">to figure out our belief space more than</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.240" end="00:36:19.320" style="s2">anything else okay so why am i harping</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.090" end="00:36:21.390" style="s2">on about belief in knowledge and all</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.320" end="00:36:23.730" style="s2">this stuff right this seems so freakin</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.390" end="00:36:25.320" style="s2">elementary and fundamental and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.730" end="00:36:28.170" style="s2">why here&#39;s why I&#39;ve spent so much time</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.320" end="00:36:31.410" style="s2">on this this is the process we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.170" end="00:36:33.030" style="s2">going through traditionally in the West</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.410" end="00:36:35.310" style="s2">at least this is how we go about our</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.030" end="00:36:37.740" style="s2">process we take our belief take</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.310" end="00:36:39.620" style="s2">and we stay oh we found proxies of truth</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.740" end="00:36:41.400" style="s2">and then we will find the random</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.620" end="00:36:42.840" style="s2">questionable of the thing right we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.400" end="00:36:46.530" style="s2">find this one truth</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.840" end="00:36:49.050" style="s2">this one axiom that&#39;s so pure and so so</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.530" end="00:36:50.610" style="s2">absolutely binding and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.050" end="00:36:51.840" style="s2">dismiss the process that we use to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.610" end="00:36:53.730" style="s2">there and we can dismiss the belief</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.840" end="00:36:55.350" style="s2">entirely we can come back all of it into</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.730" end="00:36:57.240" style="s2">this grand unquestionable of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.350" end="00:36:59.250" style="s2">and then poof we have it right</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.240" end="00:37:01.920" style="s2">this is this is the this is the Western</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.250" end="00:37:03.510" style="s2">scientific tradition specifically the</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.920" end="00:37:05.460" style="s2">materialist scientific tradition where</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.510" end="00:37:07.290" style="s2">we it&#39;s a it&#39;s a flow it&#39;s a pipe flow</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.460" end="00:37:08.940" style="s2">or you start here you follow the line</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.290" end="00:37:10.680" style="s2">and you get to the great truth and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.940" end="00:37:12.200" style="s2">you have your science your big science</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.680" end="00:37:15.120" style="s2">that they always see on reddit right</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.200" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">this is absolutely not going to help for</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.120" end="00:37:19.230" style="s2">the reasons that we&#39;ve already explored</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:20.910" style="s2">so this is probably useless right this</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.230" end="00:37:23.190" style="s2">does not help us at all in the current</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.910" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">solution because of the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.190" end="00:37:26.610" style="s2">mechanism between the economy and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:27.930" style="s2">people just because you found the</p>

<p begin="00:37:27.930" end="00:37:31.470" style="s2">does not mean you found the</p>

<p begin="00:37:31.470" end="00:37:33.900" style="s2">oops</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.520" end="00:37:35.910" style="s2">you found your grant unquestionable</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.910" end="00:37:40.680" style="s2">it has no pragmatic value whatsoever so</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.150" end="00:37:43.140" style="s2">what do you actually have to do you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.680" end="00:37:45.810" style="s2">to reconcile you have to reconcile your</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.140" end="00:37:49.170" style="s2">beliefs with your proxies of truth to</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.810" end="00:37:52.230" style="s2">find a process and in this case we know</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.170" end="00:37:53.970" style="s2">that Kovan 19 starts in China we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.230" end="00:37:56.790" style="s2">our we have our practice of truth and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.970" end="00:37:58.770" style="s2">then we say oh the reconciliation is we</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.790" end="00:38:00.840" style="s2">need a process to explore what metrics</p>

<p begin="00:38:20.070" end="00:38:25.350" style="s2">the the the the challenge space is too</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:26.880" style="s2">complicated you have too many variants</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.350" end="00:38:28.980" style="s2">in the virus you have too much variance</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.880" end="00:38:31.470" style="s2">in the global economy so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.980" end="00:38:35.640" style="s2">build these little ladder step ladder</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.470" end="00:38:37.650" style="s2">like steps to get to these processes and</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.640" end="00:38:40.290" style="s2">that will give you a much better way of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.650" end="00:38:43.530" style="s2">solving these complicated problems so</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.290" end="00:38:47.220" style="s2">just to familiar with this when we</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.530" end="00:38:49.320" style="s2">resolve that we say a process to examine</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.220" end="00:38:51.030" style="s2">fear to a to identify prime</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.320" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">motivations that&#39;s an important process</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.030" end="00:38:54.480" style="s2">to have when we are tackling this</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">particular problem because if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.480" end="00:38:58.500" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t have a process for</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.500" end="00:39:03.120" style="s2">rest of this stuff isn&#39;t even all work</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.830" end="00:39:04.350" style="s2">process to evaluate motives of nodes and</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.250" end="00:39:12.120" style="s2">and and what are their actual motives</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.140" end="00:39:16.620" style="s2">how effective will the self-isolation</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.120" end="00:39:18.030" style="s2">actually be covin 19 exists i you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.620" end="00:39:19.350" style="s2">some people have it others don&#39;t we need</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.030" end="00:39:22.260" style="s2">to explore why countries have different</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.350" end="00:39:23.310" style="s2">infection rates why why is one country</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.260" end="00:39:25.410" style="s2">hit harder than the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.310" end="00:39:27.690" style="s2">why is italy so devastated is that all</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.410" end="00:39:30.090" style="s2">media is it not media is you know you</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.690" end="00:39:31.080" style="s2">have to look at these differentials</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.090" end="00:39:32.850" style="s2">because that&#39;s gonna give you</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.080" end="00:39:34.830" style="s2">understanding of things that you that</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.850" end="00:39:36.750" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get elsewise otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.830" end="00:39:38.460" style="s2">you&#39;ll just you just be exposed to like</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.750" end="00:39:41.070" style="s2">oh and i wasn&#39;t probably got hit me but</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.460" end="00:39:43.380" style="s2">i got so bad and then like a week later</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.070" end="00:39:45.630" style="s2">be like oh then then say you&#39;re go my</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.380" end="00:39:48.180" style="s2">god you panicking all the time it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.630" end="00:39:49.530" style="s2">gonna do any good to explore you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.180" end="00:39:52.140" style="s2">look at the differentials what was</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.530" end="00:39:53.550" style="s2">effective what wasn&#39;t explore why</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.140" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">testing is so different why is it so</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.550" end="00:39:58.470" style="s2">hard the test right this will force you</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:59.940" style="s2">to look into the actual biomechanics of</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.470" end="00:40:01.620" style="s2">the virus which is admittedly</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.940" end="00:40:03.270" style="s2">complicated because it&#39;s four ology and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.620" end="00:40:04.350" style="s2">always is but it&#39;s something you should</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.270" end="00:40:07.380" style="s2">know anyway when you&#39;re trying to tackle</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.350" end="00:40:09.500" style="s2">this problem you need to know as you</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.380" end="00:40:11.370" style="s2">need to have a process to extract useful</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.500" end="00:40:15.030" style="s2">pragmatic knowledge or at least black</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.370" end="00:40:16.950" style="s2">boxes from this thing excuse me that it</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.030" end="00:40:18.720" style="s2">comes from bat soup then let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.950" end="00:40:21.030" style="s2">how bat carriers work and we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.720" end="00:40:22.950" style="s2">immediately dismiss that if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.030" end="00:40:25.890" style="s2">the migration and transmission rate so</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.950" end="00:40:29.130" style="s2">that&#39;s just not it right and we only get</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.890" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">to that conclusion because we&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.130" end="00:40:33.270" style="s2">the process to examine that hey bat</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:35.820" style="s2">migration should have should have an</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.270" end="00:40:37.980" style="s2">influence so starts in china then we</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.820" end="00:40:39.510" style="s2">explore what metrics china is using the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.980" end="00:40:41.970" style="s2">guide pandemics we walk through that a</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.510" end="00:40:43.140" style="s2">process to identify which hospitals are</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.970" end="00:40:44.550" style="s2">prepared in which rooms or not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.140" end="00:40:48.540" style="s2">really important to that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.550" end="00:40:50.910" style="s2">variation of this problem or at least</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.540" end="00:40:52.200" style="s2">this process might be able to steal some</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.910" end="00:40:54.290" style="s2">of the techniques you get and you use</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.200" end="00:40:57.540" style="s2">here to then apply here to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.290" end="00:40:59.190" style="s2">the preparation scale obviously New York</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.540" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">and Los Angeles but other players as</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.190" end="00:41:03.920" style="s2">well trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:06.580" style="s2">economic pressures of a cure that is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.920" end="00:41:09.230" style="s2">very fascinating part of this problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.580" end="00:41:11.030" style="s2">because that is going to have an</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.030" end="00:41:17.660" style="s2">leading up to it because everybody wants</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.080" end="00:41:19.970" style="s2">to cure now they&#39;re all afraid they&#39;ve a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.660" end="00:41:22.820" style="s2">stir or all self or trying to be self</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.970" end="00:41:24.410" style="s2">isolated I should say but the economic</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.820" end="00:41:26.030" style="s2">pressures for the Cure matter on the</p>

<p begin="00:41:26.030" end="00:41:28.580" style="s2">has already been given so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.590" end="00:41:30.200" style="s2">definitely going to be pressures</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.580" end="00:41:31.340" style="s2">associated there you want to find boards</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.200" end="00:41:35.210" style="s2">you want to find people what are they</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.340" end="00:41:36.470" style="s2">actually doing and then finally you want</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.210" end="00:41:38.450" style="s2">to examine how the economy is</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.470" end="00:41:40.820" style="s2">anticipating the future so when you</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.450" end="00:41:42.440" style="s2">combine all of these when you figure out</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.820" end="00:41:44.300" style="s2">all of these processes you&#39;ll then be</p>

<p begin="00:41:44.300" end="00:41:49.790" style="s2">this talk is ultimately about how do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.850" end="00:41:51.800" style="s2">how is the economy anticipating future</p>

<p begin="00:42:04.130" end="00:42:07.820" style="s2">where things are going like for example</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.600" end="00:42:09.320" style="s2">you have all these hospitals that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.820" end="00:42:11.300" style="s2">ordering thousands of beds that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.320" end="00:42:14.120" style="s2">didn&#39;t have previously what are they</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.300" end="00:42:15.860" style="s2">going to do with these beds when this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.120" end="00:42:17.600" style="s2">over it&#39;s not like they can keep them in</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.860" end="00:42:18.740" style="s2">their facility it&#39;ll block up all their</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.600" end="00:42:20.600" style="s2">space what are they gonna do with it</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.740" end="00:42:22.490" style="s2">well there has to be some company out</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.600" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">there who&#39;s going to take that response</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.490" end="00:42:26.360" style="s2">that I&#39;ll take those surplus beds and</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:28.340" style="s2">I&#39;ll allocate them somewhere else so</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.360" end="00:42:30.770" style="s2">there&#39;s already an agent in this network</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.340" end="00:42:33.770" style="s2">who&#39;s anticipating moving those beds out</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.770" end="00:42:35.060" style="s2">to a profitable location after this</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.770" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">whole thing is over and they&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.060" end="00:42:38.720" style="s2">setting timelines and oh they have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:40.460" style="s2">profit motive to care about this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.720" end="00:42:42.650" style="s2">stuff so you have to do is find these</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.460" end="00:42:45.110" style="s2">people and now you can start getting and</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.650" end="00:42:46.490" style="s2">building a complete picture about how</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.110" end="00:42:48.530" style="s2">these things are inter flowing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.490" end="00:42:50.960" style="s2">influencing one another so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.530" end="00:42:53.210" style="s2">relying on news and relying on whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.960" end="00:42:54.680" style="s2">localized sources the truth you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.210" end="00:42:58.040" style="s2">extract and using that as your</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.680" end="00:43:00.200" style="s2">foundation of operation if you search</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.040" end="00:43:02.240" style="s2">for these processes you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.200" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">expand both your truth space and your</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.240" end="00:43:04.580" style="s2">belief space simultaneously and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.920" end="00:43:08.300" style="s2">going to get more comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.580" end="00:43:10.100" style="s2">reconciling them so finally to wrap this</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.300" end="00:43:12.140" style="s2">all up because I know this is a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.100" end="00:43:12.680" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking I don&#39;t know my time is I</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.140" end="00:43:14.730" style="s2">apologize</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.680" end="00:43:17.040" style="s2">Peter so</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.730" end="00:43:19.830" style="s2">this is the Cova trolley why are we</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.040" end="00:43:21.720" style="s2">picking epistemic reconciliation over</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.830" end="00:43:23.790" style="s2">materialist scientific tradition because</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.720" end="00:43:26.010" style="s2">three factors the story never ends</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.790" end="00:43:28.410" style="s2">agents adapt and once the once struck</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.010" end="00:43:30.210" style="s2">the golf balls on its own the story</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.410" end="00:43:32.610" style="s2">never ends means right here</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.210" end="00:43:34.950" style="s2">once that kovat hits it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.610" end="00:43:38.370" style="s2">you know do that and then leave koba&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.950" end="00:43:40.650" style="s2">going to do this over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.370" end="00:43:43.170" style="s2">again and it&#39;s going to influence each</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.650" end="00:43:45.450" style="s2">other and as it does so these players</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.170" end="00:43:47.850" style="s2">are going to respond as the kovat is</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.450" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">doing this for example not being talked</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.850" end="00:43:51.420" style="s2">about but October there&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:53.010" style="s2">second round of this yeah there&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.420" end="00:43:54.510" style="s2">be a second round of COBIT as it mutates</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.010" end="00:43:56.130" style="s2">and more people are going to get hit</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.510" end="00:43:58.140" style="s2">with it so how are the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.130" end="00:43:59.490" style="s2">economy gonna adapt as they go around</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.140" end="00:44:01.740" style="s2">with this right it&#39;s gonna go round and</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.490" end="00:44:03.960" style="s2">round and finally once struck the golf</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.740" end="00:44:05.790" style="s2">ball is on its own once kovat is in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.960" end="00:44:07.410" style="s2">cycle it&#39;s gonna do whatever the hell at</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.790" end="00:44:09.930" style="s2">once we&#39;re gonna do our best to steer it</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.410" end="00:44:12.810" style="s2">of course hopefully using epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.930" end="00:44:15.090" style="s2">reconciliation but more likely we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.810" end="00:44:17.490" style="s2">unfortunately going to use this but this</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.090" end="00:44:20.430" style="s2">thing is on its own is on a crash course</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.490" end="00:44:22.740" style="s2">and mapping it is gonna be tough but if</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.430" end="00:44:25.080" style="s2">you find the processes to then examine</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.740" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">this you can actually get to how these</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.080" end="00:44:28.350" style="s2">two are interacting and finally how this</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:29.700" style="s2">is interacting with these and poor</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.350" end="00:44:31.920" style="s2">governments sitting here with almost</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.700" end="00:44:34.680" style="s2">nothing it can do about anything</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:37.080" style="s2">there&#39;s throughout most of history</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.680" end="00:44:38.370" style="s2">pandemics governments did it they just</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.080" end="00:44:40.440" style="s2">throw their hands up in the sea they</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.370" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">doom entire cities and say sorry pal</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.440" end="00:44:45.930" style="s2">that&#39;s it the idea of this intervention</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:48.540" style="s2">is government coming in and paying your</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.930" end="00:44:50.490" style="s2">bills and not making rent happen again</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.540" end="00:44:52.260" style="s2">the same rules apply the story never</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.490" end="00:44:54.390" style="s2">ends let&#39;s say people don&#39;t pay rent</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.260" end="00:44:57.120" style="s2">what does that do the economy okay well</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.390" end="00:45:00.990" style="s2">now you&#39;re not collecting rent which</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.120" end="00:45:02.940" style="s2">means which means mortgage futures are</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.990" end="00:45:04.830" style="s2">probably gonna have problems and so that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.940" end="00:45:07.050" style="s2">can cascade into even more economic</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.830" end="00:45:08.430" style="s2">effects which can now displace these</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.050" end="00:45:09.990" style="s2">people will make them homeless and if</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.430" end="00:45:11.580" style="s2">they&#39;re homeless what do you think the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.990" end="00:45:13.620" style="s2">spread of virus is when they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.580" end="00:45:14.880" style="s2">homeless and these camps together guess</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.620" end="00:45:15.360" style="s2">what we just accidentally made the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.880" end="00:45:17.670" style="s2">problem worse</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.360" end="00:45:19.470" style="s2">so these are the type of things you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.670" end="00:45:20.700" style="s2">to really really look at you have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.470" end="00:45:23.160" style="s2">look at it carefully right we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.700" end="00:45:25.560" style="s2">under I mean we&#39;re under a gun this</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.160" end="00:45:27.540" style="s2">thing right here but you still have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.560" end="00:45:28.380" style="s2">freedom to explore the interaction of</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.540" end="00:45:30.960" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.380" end="00:45:36.329" style="s2">puzzles the interaction of how these</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.960" end="00:45:37.799" style="s2">players interact that&#39;s a I was at El</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.329" end="00:45:41.309" style="s2">Tala gee I apologize but you&#39;ll be able</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.799" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">to understand you&#39;ll be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.309" end="00:45:45.630" style="s2">processes to understand how these</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:47.309" style="s2">players are influencing one another</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.630" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">because once that golf ball is on its</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.309" end="00:45:52.380" style="s2">way it&#39;s not leaving and that&#39;s it thank</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:57.539" style="s2">you for listening my Tech Talk I&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.380" end="00:46:02.340" style="s2">questions oh cool so Pat can you unshare</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.539" end="00:46:04.079" style="s2">your screen yes I think so</p>

<p begin="00:46:16.470" end="00:46:23.609" style="s2">we&#39;re open it up to questions and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.789" end="00:46:26.579" style="s2">probably and at 8 o&#39;clock Eastern Time</p>

<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:39.170" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.250" end="00:46:42.140" style="s2">so you mentioned the blue church ball I</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.170" end="00:46:45.329" style="s2">think everybody Jordan Hall coined that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.140" end="00:46:47.970" style="s2">so I&#39;m curious how do you think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.329" end="00:46:49.529" style="s2">you can first just describe what you</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.970" end="00:46:51.690" style="s2">think blue church means for the people</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.529" end="00:46:54.359" style="s2">who don&#39;t know and how do you think the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.690" end="00:46:58.380" style="s2">blue church is currently responding to</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.359" end="00:47:00.900" style="s2">the situation or how they will respond</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.380" end="00:47:04.369" style="s2">to it in the future or maybe just how</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.900" end="00:47:09.539" style="s2">they&#39;re up in their response</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.369" end="00:47:12.150" style="s2">blue church is is the conquerors of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.539" end="00:47:14.579" style="s2">scientific methodology that&#39;s how I tend</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.150" end="00:47:16.799" style="s2">to define them so these are the people</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.579" end="00:47:22.410" style="s2">the blue church finds its origin in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.799" end="00:47:27.450" style="s2">1600s during after the 30 Years War when</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.410" end="00:47:29.130" style="s2">the papacy and other Protestant actors</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.450" end="00:47:30.569" style="s2">decided and hey you&#39;ll be hilarious if</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.130" end="00:47:33.180" style="s2">we wipe each other out in a thirty year</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.569" end="00:47:35.039" style="s2">war that sounds fun I mean while the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.180" end="00:47:37.230" style="s2">that was the origin of the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.039" end="00:47:39.480" style="s2">was the idea that we need to back away</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.230" end="00:47:40.700" style="s2">from this unholy union of the papacy</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.480" end="00:47:43.430" style="s2">with kings and</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.700" end="00:47:47.030" style="s2">stop that please and let the economies</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.430" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">as they are flow on their own and so the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.030" end="00:47:53.410" style="s2">blue church today is the apex evolution</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:58.460" style="s2">of that incentive and of that drive</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.410" end="00:48:01.190" style="s2">these are players who have done</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.460" end="00:48:04.099" style="s2">fantastic work with taking</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.190" end="00:48:05.869" style="s2">rationalization and scientific</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.099" end="00:48:08.810" style="s2">methodology and really taking it to its</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.869" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">end to its furthest ends possible within</p>

<p begin="00:53:15.510" end="00:53:19.380" style="s2">noticed that behavioral economics is</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:22.170" style="s2">kind of in vogue these days also in</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.380" end="00:53:23.580" style="s2">positions of governance and it at least</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.170" end="00:53:25.680" style="s2">gives lip service to what if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.580" end="00:53:27.810" style="s2">talking about that it acknowledges our</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.680" end="00:53:29.790" style="s2">bounded rationality and we have</p>

<p begin="00:53:33.600" end="00:53:38.820" style="s2">say is the reason why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.490" end="00:53:41.010" style="s2">insufficient because it&#39;s still it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:53:41.010" end="00:53:45.780" style="s2">it&#39;s still pegged that there is a</p>

<p begin="00:53:45.780" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">there is a scientific concept of reality</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.310" end="00:53:52.050" style="s2">it&#39;s science conceives of it so</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:54.540" style="s2">therefore it is a concept of reality but</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.050" end="00:53:58.080" style="s2">it does not have a monopoly on reality</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.540" end="00:54:01.170" style="s2">and so trying to appeal to that reality</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.080" end="00:54:05.880" style="s2">is sort of a transitory step but it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.170" end="00:54:10.020" style="s2">not the only one cool thank you all</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.880" end="00:54:11.580" style="s2">right so Marshall had a question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.020" end="00:54:13.170" style="s2">related to the blue church I&#39;ll read it</p>

<p begin="00:54:19.790" end="00:54:24.730" style="s2">materialism hmm yeah don&#39;t throw the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.850" end="00:54:27.830" style="s2">baby out with the bathwater I do agree</p>

<p begin="01:00:35.079" end="01:00:40.719" style="s2">an apple is but if I knock out if I</p>

<p begin="01:00:40.719" end="01:00:44.319" style="s2">training set if I randomly say no you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:00:46.900" end="01:00:50.530" style="s2">improves the AIS performance by 50% so</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.719" end="01:00:52.750" style="s2">we can find</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.530" end="01:00:54.250" style="s2">apples 50% better if you don&#39;t feed it</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.750" end="01:00:58.600" style="s2">if you don&#39;t hand feed it everything</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.250" end="01:01:01.330" style="s2">that is a group that is nuts so even</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.600" end="01:01:04.270" style="s2">these AIS are demonstrating a need for</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.330" end="01:01:06.370" style="s2">belief without actually formally coming</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.270" end="01:01:09.070" style="s2">to that conclusion there is a benefit of</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.370" end="01:01:10.990" style="s2">belief in it by negativo unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.070" end="01:01:13.300" style="s2">it&#39;s not this reproducible thing in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.990" end="01:01:15.100" style="s2">scientific realm but this is belief via</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.300" end="01:01:16.540" style="s2">negativa that&#39;s being demonstrated and</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.100" end="01:01:18.060" style="s2">knock out training and we see the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.540" end="01:01:22.810" style="s2">thing in the super forecaster research</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.060" end="01:01:25.030" style="s2">so belief is the last great unexplored</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.810" end="01:01:27.100" style="s2">part of philosophy of mind and by</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.030" end="01:01:30.450" style="s2">default scientific methodology has no</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.100" end="01:01:32.530" style="s2">interest in it whatsoever and that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.450" end="01:01:34.120" style="s2">think that&#39;s a fascinating part and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.530" end="01:01:37.770" style="s2">think that&#39;s the oh that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.120" end="01:01:43.360" style="s2">downfall of the oh the blue church okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.770" end="01:01:53.110" style="s2">to do Julian would you like to read your</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.360" end="01:01:56.200" style="s2">question just unmute yourself I in muted</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.110" end="01:02:00.880" style="s2">you Julian oh is this working</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.200" end="01:02:06.100" style="s2">yep okay my question was going from</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.880" end="01:02:09.370" style="s2">alright down it&#39;s going from defined</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.100" end="01:02:11.530" style="s2">truths to is there a good process from</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.370" end="01:02:13.960" style="s2">going from a defined truth to coming up</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.530" end="01:02:16.390" style="s2">with a process for the green box</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.960" end="01:02:18.100" style="s2">whatever that was if you could walk</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.390" end="01:02:20.950" style="s2">through that a bit yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.100" end="01:02:23.370" style="s2">basic investigative skills help if</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.950" end="01:02:25.840" style="s2">there&#39;s like it just to get started</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.370" end="01:02:28.450" style="s2">because we&#39;re all trained in the and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.840" end="01:02:29.680" style="s2">material scientists space already so you</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.450" end="01:02:32.020" style="s2">might as well use that training to your</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.680" end="01:02:33.970" style="s2">advantage there&#39;s some there&#39;s some like</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.020" end="01:02:35.950" style="s2">how to be a private eye for example</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.970" end="01:02:37.660" style="s2">that&#39;s should do that on the weekend if</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.950" end="01:02:39.610" style="s2">you can you can learn how to do it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.660" end="01:02:43.660" style="s2">just good to figure out the basic skills</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.610" end="01:02:46.000" style="s2">of deduction but more pragmatically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.660" end="01:02:47.890" style="s2">about finding what&#39;s missing that tends</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.000" end="01:02:51.010" style="s2">to be where I&#39;m gonna give anecdotal</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.890" end="01:02:52.300" style="s2">here I tend to be where I start I see</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.010" end="01:02:53.800" style="s2">what&#39;s there and then I say now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.300" end="01:02:57.100" style="s2">missing from this how do you figure out</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.800" end="01:02:59.200" style="s2">what&#39;s missing okay well give an example</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.100" end="01:03:01.420" style="s2">right so if I was to walk in if saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.200" end="01:03:03.040" style="s2">alien ship landed right alien ship just</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.420" end="01:03:04.190" style="s2">landed right in my backyard and I have</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.040" end="01:03:06.020" style="s2">no technology</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.190" end="01:03:07.400" style="s2">you out of this world right like I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.020" end="01:03:09.410" style="s2">figure this stuff out there&#39;s alien</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.400" end="01:03:10.730" style="s2">glyphs all over the place so somehow I</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.410" end="01:03:13.369" style="s2">get in this ship cuz there&#39;s a hole on</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.730" end="01:03:14.900" style="s2">the side and I walk in and I see dead</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.369" end="01:03:16.910" style="s2">aliens that I&#39;m looking around I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.900" end="01:03:21.440" style="s2">okay how do I make sense of this right</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.910" end="01:03:23.210" style="s2">okay one for starters they crashed all</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.440" end="01:03:25.970" style="s2">right so what&#39;s missing what&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.210" end="01:03:27.859" style="s2">is why did they crash why did they not</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.970" end="01:03:30.859" style="s2">account for gravity did they not account</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.859" end="01:03:33.619" style="s2">for any type of electromagnet magnetism</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.859" end="01:03:35.210" style="s2">we have been emitting what let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.619" end="01:03:37.069" style="s2">any type of damages that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.210" end="01:03:39.829" style="s2">experiencing what&#39;s let&#39;s color the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.069" end="01:03:42.200" style="s2">blood what&#39;s what&#39;s the are they wearing</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.829" end="01:03:45.440" style="s2">clothes for starters dude this is their</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.200" end="01:03:48.050" style="s2">civilization have clothes let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.440" end="01:03:49.609" style="s2">how their organ are arranged on their on</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.050" end="01:03:51.470" style="s2">their control panels</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.609" end="01:03:53.660" style="s2">do they have finger are they finger or</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.470" end="01:03:55.730" style="s2">digit oriented are they psychically</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.660" end="01:03:57.260" style="s2">connected right so you start looking at</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.730" end="01:03:59.240" style="s2">all of them this is obviously a</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.260" end="01:04:02.089" style="s2">ridiculous example but it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.240" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">pragmatic one because I&#39;m throwing you</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.089" end="01:04:04.940" style="s2">into a space where there&#39;s no way you</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:06.589" style="s2">can actually know anything about this</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.940" end="01:04:08.810" style="s2">scenario so you try to find what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.589" end="01:04:10.700" style="s2">missing instead right you try to do a</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.810" end="01:04:12.710" style="s2">differential analysis between what do I</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.700" end="01:04:13.910" style="s2">use when I was flying this ship versus</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.710" end="01:04:15.890" style="s2">what are they using when they fly the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.910" end="01:04:17.359" style="s2">ship and from the differential analysis</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.890" end="01:04:18.950" style="s2">you can then get what&#39;s missing and from</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.359" end="01:04:25.280" style="s2">that missing you actually derive these</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.950" end="01:04:37.190" style="s2">without these green boxes cool Dan you</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.280" end="01:04:39.109" style="s2">had a question for Pat yeah I have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.190" end="01:04:41.030" style="s2">question you seem to this whole blue</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.109" end="01:04:43.400" style="s2">church thing you seem to be discounting</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.030" end="01:04:46.609" style="s2">it&#39;s like science is this and not</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.400" end="01:04:49.339" style="s2">science is that and and so my question</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.609" end="01:04:52.040" style="s2">is are not emerging complexity and chaos</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.339" end="01:04:54.290" style="s2">theory a part of science your criticism</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.040" end="01:04:56.900" style="s2">of science appears to discount these</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.290" end="01:04:58.609" style="s2">Sciences I&#39;m not familiar but as I said</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.900" end="01:05:00.140" style="s2">with you Church lingo I was trained in</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.609" end="01:05:02.420" style="s2">electrical engineering with a focus in</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.140" end="01:05:04.040" style="s2">signals and systems can you explain why</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.420" end="01:05:06.500" style="s2">you were eliminating network theory</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.040" end="01:05:08.720" style="s2">merging complexity and chaos theory from</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.500" end="01:05:10.849" style="s2">your explanations and criticisms yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.720" end="01:05:13.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a fantastic question</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.849" end="01:05:14.990" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an interest it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.460" end="01:05:16.760" style="s2">interesting for multiple layers that</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.990" end="01:05:18.080" style="s2">question because it&#39;s it on one hand</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.760" end="01:05:19.430" style="s2">it&#39;s stating</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.080" end="01:05:21.100" style="s2">we&#39;re finally ready to tackle the</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.430" end="01:05:24.320" style="s2">complexity that we didn&#39;t have before</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.100" end="01:05:28.490" style="s2">and that&#39;s true we do have that flat</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.320" end="01:05:31.040" style="s2">it&#39;s also not true and here&#39;s why so so</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.490" end="01:05:33.200" style="s2">a lot of science is trying to find this</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.040" end="01:05:35.030" style="s2">axiomatic truth and then extrapolate and</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.200" end="01:05:36.320" style="s2">build upon it this is kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.030" end="01:05:38.630" style="s2">tradition that we&#39;ve been doing for a</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.320" end="01:05:40.400" style="s2">long time well what is what is electron</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.630" end="01:05:42.710" style="s2">valence what is a transistor what is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.400" end="01:05:44.270" style="s2">what is a chip and the extrapolating you</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.710" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">keep going and going getting that fine</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.270" end="01:05:47.930" style="s2">level precision control over each step</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:50.660" style="s2">of the process who can then extrapolate</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.930" end="01:05:53.090" style="s2">to the next layer of emergence and as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.660" end="01:05:54.860" style="s2">result you naturally explode into that</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.090" end="01:05:56.870" style="s2">high level of complexity especially when</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.860" end="01:05:58.730" style="s2">you have a billion circuits all over the</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.870" end="01:06:00.890" style="s2">worlds firing asynchronously to one</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.730" end="01:06:02.480" style="s2">another so the only reason complexity</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.890" end="01:06:04.760" style="s2">science even exists is because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.480" end="01:06:06.800" style="s2">made the internet we&#39;ve always been in</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.760" end="01:06:08.540" style="s2">complexity complexity has been with us</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.800" end="01:06:09.890" style="s2">since the very beginning we just have</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.540" end="01:06:11.330" style="s2">been approaching it with the wrong tools</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.890" end="01:06:13.160" style="s2">we didn&#39;t actually look at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.330" end="01:06:14.660" style="s2">complexity it&#39;s a standalone concept and</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.160" end="01:06:17.120" style="s2">say hey we should probably address that</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.660" end="01:06:19.070" style="s2">as is we just kind of fumble along and</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.120" end="01:06:20.720" style="s2">with with these kind of like proxies to</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.070" end="01:06:22.760" style="s2">manage complexity which we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.720" end="01:06:25.640" style="s2">calling science this entire time so I</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.760" end="01:06:29.390" style="s2">would I would say that the complexity as</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.640" end="01:06:31.190" style="s2">an abstract concept even that is still</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.390" end="01:06:32.780" style="s2">technically a model it&#39;s a good model</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.190" end="01:06:35.330" style="s2">for the domain of problems its resolving</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.780" end="01:06:37.160" style="s2">for sure but the complexity that you</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.330" end="01:06:40.070" style="s2">think you&#39;re addressing it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.160" end="01:06:42.170" style="s2">beyond even that so I think complexity</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.070" end="01:06:45.440" style="s2">science is kind of a preacher phrase I</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.170" end="01:06:47.750" style="s2">think network graph theory Network</p>

<p begin="01:09:15.349" end="01:09:20.150" style="s2">hit a fresh plow of snow cars driving</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.109" end="01:09:22.099" style="s2">what do you do now well the car now</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.150" end="01:09:24.560" style="s2">shifts over to 26 totally different</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.099" end="01:09:27.349" style="s2">sensors and one of those sensors is</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.560" end="01:09:29.929" style="s2">pinging Google Maps to then find oh are</p>

<p begin="01:09:29.929" end="01:09:33.139" style="s2">and then from that orientation where is</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.670" end="01:09:34.549" style="s2">the curb in the road so I can actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.139" end="01:09:36.589" style="s2">stay in the road even though I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.549" end="01:09:38.389" style="s2">actually see it now admittedly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.589" end="01:09:39.799" style="s2">some improvements recently in lidar that</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.389" end="01:09:41.000" style="s2">can penetrate the snow and tell the</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.799" end="01:09:43.549" style="s2">difference between the snow in the road</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.000" end="01:09:45.589" style="s2">yes but before that it was then kicking</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.549" end="01:09:48.080" style="s2">off to an explosion</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.589" end="01:09:49.819" style="s2">of sensory methodologies to then come up</p>

<p begin="01:13:38.780" end="01:13:43.850" style="s2">electric engineers here I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.130" end="01:13:46.940" style="s2">reciting history but they went the</p>

<p begin="01:13:48.980" end="01:13:54.860" style="s2">to write the first programs and they</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.040" end="01:13:57.650" style="s2">were using a very primitive language I</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.860" end="01:13:58.850" style="s2">think was binary and maybe assembly and</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.650" end="01:14:00.680" style="s2">something else but</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.850" end="01:14:02.810" style="s2">I might I might be recalling that</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.680" end="01:14:05.690" style="s2">incorrectly but they were going to these</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.810" end="01:14:07.460" style="s2">very very smart and very talented people</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.690" end="01:14:09.980" style="s2">who understood every constraint and</p>

<p begin="01:14:09.980" end="01:14:14.120" style="s2">possibly exist in any permutation of</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.050" end="01:14:15.590" style="s2">multiple domains they went to these</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.120" end="01:14:17.000" style="s2">people and they said write these</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.590" end="01:14:19.130" style="s2">programs to help us in this signal</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.000" end="01:14:22.760" style="s2">analysis because the signals are doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.130" end="01:14:24.620" style="s2">weird things what what does it mean when</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.760" end="01:14:26.390" style="s2">when the Russians are sending this</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.620" end="01:14:28.760" style="s2">signal and it&#39;s bouncing in this weird</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.390" end="01:14:30.890" style="s2">way I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s outside of of</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.760" end="01:14:33.830" style="s2">what we know to be the case so how do we</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.890" end="01:14:35.390" style="s2">decipher that or worse these pattern of</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.830" end="01:14:37.490" style="s2">signals is coming through in a manner</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.390" end="01:14:38.150" style="s2">that is defying us because is this</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.490" end="01:14:39.950" style="s2">encrypted</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.150" end="01:14:41.690" style="s2">wait what&#39;s encryption is that a thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.950" end="01:14:44.380" style="s2">oh man wait they&#39;re out there up phew</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.690" end="01:14:47.900" style="s2">skating with their messages now right so</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.380" end="01:14:50.150" style="s2">when they went to these scientists their</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.900" end="01:14:52.040" style="s2">reality their way of transcending</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.150" end="01:14:54.800" style="s2">reality was it was materialism and</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.040" end="01:14:57.530" style="s2">material science ISM when not sciencism</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.800" end="01:14:59.510" style="s2">but hard actual scientific methodology</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.530" end="01:15:02.750" style="s2">you know go through the rigor and do it</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.510" end="01:15:04.090" style="s2">damn right they went to that and so when</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.750" end="01:15:06.140" style="s2">they were trying to write their code</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.090" end="01:15:10.190" style="s2">originally it just didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.140" end="01:15:13.060" style="s2">absolutely did not work they were trying</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.190" end="01:15:15.080" style="s2">to account for too much they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.060" end="01:15:17.870" style="s2">understand that they were being</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.080" end="01:15:19.280" style="s2">outplayed by other humans some of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.870" end="01:15:20.750" style="s2">Russians were sending signals that were</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.280" end="01:15:22.070" style="s2">easy to crack and when you cracked them</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.750" end="01:15:22.970" style="s2">you got the answer but it wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.070" end="01:15:24.650" style="s2">answer you were looking for because</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.970" end="01:15:26.840" style="s2">there was a secondary encryption in it</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.650" end="01:15:28.900" style="s2">so there was all these things that</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.840" end="01:15:31.610" style="s2">humans trying to outsmart each other and</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.900" end="01:15:35.630" style="s2">from my experience scientists make</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.610" end="01:15:37.190" style="s2">terrible spies from what I&#39;ve seen so</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.630" end="01:15:38.780" style="s2">what the what the NSA did instead is</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.190" end="01:15:41.720" style="s2">that they started hiring a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.780" end="01:15:44.210" style="s2">musicians and philosophers and linguist</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.720" end="01:15:45.970" style="s2">and they were writing the programs and</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.210" end="01:15:48.230" style="s2">they were performing infinitely better</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.970" end="01:15:50.480" style="s2">infinitely better in terms of getting</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.230" end="01:15:53.810" style="s2">the code to work instead of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.480" end="01:15:54.380" style="s2">get that pure scientific that scientific</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.810" end="01:15:56.780" style="s2">purism</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.380" end="01:15:58.820" style="s2">in the code to comply with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.780" end="01:16:00.920" style="s2">limitations of the machine these guys</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.820" end="01:16:04.700" style="s2">were willing to abuse those constraints</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.920" end="01:16:06.590" style="s2">just to solve the problem and that that</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.700" end="01:16:08.990" style="s2">is one of those transcendence points</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.590" end="01:16:11.540" style="s2">that had profound ramifications on the</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.990" end="01:16:12.710" style="s2">rest of our lives this is where you get</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.540" end="01:16:14.960" style="s2">your Stallman&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.710" end="01:16:18.200" style="s2">you got your linus torvalds and all of</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.960" end="01:16:20.030" style="s2">these these so-called visionaries to</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.200" end="01:16:23.140" style="s2">then look at computers in a totally</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.030" end="01:16:25.520" style="s2">different transcendent matter so</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.140" end="01:16:27.590" style="s2">everything has its place I&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.520" end="01:16:29.360" style="s2">I know I&#39;ve been lashing out at science</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.590" end="01:16:33.230" style="s2">a lot here and I don&#39;t mean to turn it</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.360" end="01:16:36.260" style="s2">into a soapbox it is a tool science is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.230" end="01:16:38.210" style="s2">tool but it&#39;s not the only tool if</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.260" end="01:16:43.780" style="s2">there&#39;s anything to take away that would</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.210" end="01:16:45.980" style="s2">be it it&#39;s not the only tool hmm so um</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.780" end="01:16:48.500" style="s2">able to sneak in one more question if</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.980" end="01:16:50.570" style="s2">that&#39;s okay with you pat so mimetic</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.500" end="01:16:52.239" style="s2">caper if you can unmute yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.570" end="01:16:53.420" style="s2">read your questions will be the last one</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.239" end="01:16:58.790" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.420" end="01:17:01.550" style="s2">hey hey Pat could science be described</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.790" end="01:17:03.380" style="s2">as a search heuristic to find other</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.550" end="01:17:14.120" style="s2">powerful heuristics that model</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.380" end="01:17:16.670" style="s2">experience heuristics like the Edina</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.120" end="01:17:18.940" style="s2">again sort of the science of a tool that</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.670" end="01:17:22.310" style="s2">allows you to find other powerful</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.940" end="01:17:24.800" style="s2">heuristic tools like you could you could</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.310" end="01:17:27.320" style="s2">say that uh you know Newtonian physics</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.800" end="01:17:29.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a powerful tool to model reality</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.320" end="01:17:35.330" style="s2">right and it was discovered through</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.840" end="01:17:40.610" style="s2">scientific methodology traditionally</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.330" end="01:17:43.400" style="s2">speaking no I I&#39;m trying to to answer</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.610" end="01:17:45.920" style="s2">that question I think it&#39;s rather</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.400" end="01:17:48.320" style="s2">apparent where my bias lies what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.920" end="01:17:52.280" style="s2">trying to do is I&#39;m trying to envision</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.320" end="01:17:55.580" style="s2">our current technologically saturated</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.280" end="01:17:57.230" style="s2">world as if science didn&#39;t exist right</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.580" end="01:18:00.020" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to this place so I can</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.230" end="01:18:02.840" style="s2">answer your question so let&#39;s assume my</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.020" end="01:18:04.850" style="s2">daughter&#39;s 21 for example one day she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.840" end="01:18:06.860" style="s2">gonna have a daughter I can tell you</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.850" end="01:18:10.640" style="s2">that when my grandparents are around</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.860" end="01:18:11.930" style="s2">cars were the high tech cars and plans</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.640" end="01:18:13.190" style="s2">with a high tech experience for that</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.930" end="01:18:16.580" style="s2">generation so you have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.190" end="01:18:18.110" style="s2">mechanics in that era then a generation</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.580" end="01:18:19.790" style="s2">after that computers are getting started</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.110" end="01:18:22.219" style="s2">so you had a lot of really solid</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.790" end="01:18:23.949" style="s2">engineers of electric engineers and like</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.219" end="01:18:25.959" style="s2">the 60s and 80s</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.949" end="01:18:27.880" style="s2">rock stars for sure and then with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.959" end="01:18:29.170" style="s2">software Fey is now my generation we</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.880" end="01:18:31.179" style="s2">come in and we understand software</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.170" end="01:18:33.190" style="s2">really well my daughter&#39;s generation</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.179" end="01:18:35.800" style="s2">does not know a damn thing about any of</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.190" end="01:18:38.039" style="s2">those three technological platforms she</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.800" end="01:18:41.739" style="s2">knows how to swipe her finger on a phone</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.039" end="01:18:43.239" style="s2">and she knows how to use that phone to</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.739" end="01:18:46.119" style="s2">get the maximum amount of social</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.239" end="01:18:47.380" style="s2">attention right so those are the problem</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.119" end="01:18:49.420" style="s2">domains that she&#39;s been exposed to</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.380" end="01:18:52.030" style="s2">inherit grandchild after her child after</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.420" end="01:18:54.699" style="s2">that the I don&#39;t even think they&#39;ll know</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.030" end="01:18:58.389" style="s2">computers even exist given the rate</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.699" end="01:19:02.590" style="s2">we&#39;re going so when when I say when you</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.389" end="01:19:05.380" style="s2">say heuristic the ability to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.590" end="01:19:07.479" style="s2">make sense of reality if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.380" end="01:19:09.309" style="s2">interpreting you correctly the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.479" end="01:19:11.260" style="s2">the rule of thumb that states okay</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.309" end="01:19:13.360" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna take the tools we have the</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.260" end="01:19:15.940" style="s2">problems we have and we&#39;re gonna solve</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.360" end="01:19:18.849" style="s2">it yeah that&#39;s effectively what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.940" end="01:19:20.229" style="s2">been doing well before you know even</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.849" end="01:19:21.729" style="s2">atomic theory well before anything so</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.229" end="01:19:24.690" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been doing I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.729" end="01:19:27.489" style="s2">it&#39;s important to step back and realize</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.690" end="01:19:30.610" style="s2">ask yourself a question am i framing</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.489" end="01:19:32.199" style="s2">this to be scientifically compliant am i</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.610" end="01:19:34.030" style="s2">trying to explore this in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.199" end="01:19:35.440" style="s2">being scientifically compliant and if</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.030" end="01:19:37.059" style="s2">the answer is yes great there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.440" end="01:19:39.190" style="s2">wrong with that it has to be done you</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.059" end="01:19:42.459" style="s2">can&#39;t just throw that tool out entirely</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.190" end="01:19:44.559" style="s2">you still need to use it so what you</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.459" end="01:19:48.820" style="s2">want to say in addition to that you want</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.559" end="01:19:50.349" style="s2">to say now let&#39;s assume I wasn&#39;t trained</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.820" end="01:19:51.369" style="s2">in science so it&#39;s assumed I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.349" end="01:19:52.809" style="s2">trained than any of this stuff I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:19:52.809" end="01:19:58.409" style="s2">is a crazy phenomenon I have no</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.599" end="01:20:01.840" style="s2">explanation of it right that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.409" end="01:20:03.489" style="s2">original base point for heuristics it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:21:11.180" end="01:21:15.890" style="s2">methodology is a reaction against that</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.250" end="01:21:19.550" style="s2">tremendously tremendous shitshow of</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.890" end="01:21:21.320" style="s2">European history and there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.550" end="01:21:24.640" style="s2">that you have a lot of the core thinkers</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.320" end="01:21:27.440" style="s2">the the primary huge scientific factors</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.640" end="01:21:29.750" style="s2">and major players at that time they were</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.440" end="01:21:31.670" style="s2">all anti people they saw what the thirty</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.750" end="01:21:35.210" style="s2">year war was it was their Holocaust</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.670" end="01:21:37.760" style="s2">before the Holocaust they were it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.210" end="01:21:41.240" style="s2">a war with like soldiers marching in</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.760" end="01:21:42.440" style="s2">like like squares and politely shooting</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.240" end="01:21:44.330" style="s2">each other it was dragging your</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.440" end="01:21:47.930" style="s2">neighbors out of their house and nailing</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.330" end="01:21:50.540" style="s2">their kids to a tree it was horrible and</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.930" end="01:21:52.790" style="s2">when you go through that for 30 years if</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.540" end="01:21:54.170" style="s2">you identify the source of that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.790" end="01:21:55.940" style="s2">gonna hate that source for the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.170" end="01:21:58.280" style="s2">your life and the rest of your in your</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.940" end="01:21:59.750" style="s2">grandchildren&#39;s lives you&#39;re gonna pass</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.280" end="01:22:00.350" style="s2">that traditional on to say please don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.750" end="01:22:02.540" style="s2">do that again</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.350" end="01:22:04.910" style="s2">like that was the never aroused like the</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.540" end="01:22:07.070" style="s2">first never again moment for Europe most</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.910" end="01:22:08.930" style="s2">of American history comes from the</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.070" end="01:22:11.750" style="s2">founding fathers founding fathers lived</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.930" end="01:22:14.210" style="s2">through that war so it&#39;s to say that</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.750" end="01:22:17.930" style="s2">scientific methodology is like this</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.210" end="01:22:19.670" style="s2">heuristic or this sum of heuristics you</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.930" end="01:22:23.060" style="s2">have to take it in the time in which it</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.670" end="01:22:25.040" style="s2">was formed it was a form of rebellion to</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.060" end="01:22:27.080" style="s2">there was a way to rebel against you</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.040" end="01:22:29.300" style="s2">know papal Authority and that&#39;s baked</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.080" end="01:22:30.650" style="s2">into the tradition as well science</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.300" end="01:22:32.780" style="s2">doesn&#39;t stand alone of the human</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.650" end="01:22:34.610" style="s2">experience it is the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.780" end="01:22:36.680" style="s2">methodology is born of the human</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.610" end="01:22:38.330" style="s2">experience not just like heuristics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.680" end="01:22:40.490" style="s2">born of the political pressures of its</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.330" end="01:22:42.290" style="s2">time as well so I think that&#39;s that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.490" end="01:22:48.790" style="s2">important thing to factor into hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.290" end="01:22:48.790" style="s2">answer your question I agree with that</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.010" end="01:22:51.650" style="s2">against them what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.240" end="01:22:57.560" style="s2">establish is that there is sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.650" end="01:22:59.090" style="s2">continuum between science and what it is</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.560" end="01:23:03.940" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about with looking at</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.090" end="01:23:10.370" style="s2">belief and what&#39;s called post science</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.940" end="01:23:11.540" style="s2">whatever it is I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.370" end="01:23:12.950" style="s2">there&#39;s anything post science I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.540" end="01:23:18.380" style="s2">science is science</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.950" end="01:23:19.910" style="s2">I mean um because you described the fine</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.380" end="01:23:22.730" style="s2">herd processes you started with a belief</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.910" end="01:23:25.700" style="s2">I pop it fits and then you go towards</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.730" end="01:23:27.890" style="s2">divine truth and then I see it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.700" end="01:23:31.100" style="s2">axiom right right and your thing that</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.890" end="01:23:35.090" style="s2">that is limited it&#39;s premature that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.100" end="01:23:37.130" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying what I&#39;m most but what</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.090" end="01:23:39.890" style="s2">this entire talk has been about is</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.130" end="01:23:42.740" style="s2">mostly saying okay before we even get to</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.890" end="01:23:45.290" style="s2">the hypothesis stage before we even get</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.740" end="01:23:47.000" style="s2">there we should probably do this due</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.290" end="01:23:49.010" style="s2">diligence first we should incorporate</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.000" end="01:23:50.930" style="s2">elements of philosophy of mind we should</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.010" end="01:23:52.880" style="s2">bring in epistemology we should we</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.930" end="01:23:54.920" style="s2">should bolt that on to the pre</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.880" end="01:23:56.980" style="s2">scientific methodology phase that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.920" end="01:24:01.010" style="s2">effectively what I&#39;m advocating for</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.980" end="01:24:04.310" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s too quick to jump in</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.010" end="01:24:07.780" style="s2">and say whether the the weirdness of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.310" end="01:24:11.420" style="s2">peer-review system the political</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.780" end="01:24:13.580" style="s2">indulgences that exist in academia these</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.420" end="01:24:17.870" style="s2">are just these aren&#39;t causes these are</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.580" end="01:24:20.540" style="s2">just culprits of of when you abuse the</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.870" end="01:24:21.890" style="s2">empire of science which has been abused</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.540" end="01:24:24.110" style="s2">since the end of World War two at the</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.890" end="01:24:26.210" style="s2">advent of nuclear weapons and once well</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.110" end="01:24:28.670" style="s2">that&#39;s not actually true it goes back to</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.210" end="01:24:30.710" style="s2">the British I mean they they horribly</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.670" end="01:24:32.450" style="s2">abused their their entropic there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.710" end="01:24:33.590" style="s2">study of entropy and came up with all</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.450" end="01:24:39.290" style="s2">kinds of weapons of war that were</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.590" end="01:24:40.730" style="s2">devastating but the I think what you</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.290" end="01:24:42.290" style="s2">want to do is kind of instead of going</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.730" end="01:24:44.030" style="s2">rushing to the scientific method I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.290" end="01:24:47.060" style="s2">recommending a triage phase basically</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.030" end="01:24:49.400" style="s2">saying okay hold on back up let&#39;s before</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.060" end="01:24:51.350" style="s2">we get the hypothesis let&#39;s just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.400" end="01:24:53.090" style="s2">really examine our premises here with</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.350" end="01:24:54.890" style="s2">with a different look and instead of</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.090" end="01:24:56.780" style="s2">tossing belief out the window let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.890" end="01:24:58.190" style="s2">bring it in you can discount it when you</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.780" end="01:24:59.300" style="s2">get that hypothesis cuz you have to</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.190" end="01:25:00.980" style="s2">because there&#39;s too much economic</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.300" end="01:25:02.690" style="s2">pressures you can&#39;t just you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.980" end="01:25:04.820" style="s2">like naked Lee Baker belief and</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.690" end="01:25:06.260" style="s2">into a hypothesis and just kind of run</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.820" end="01:25:08.750" style="s2">with that torch forever you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.260" end="01:25:11.080" style="s2">some due diligence in advance but what</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.750" end="01:25:14.000" style="s2">I&#39;m what I&#39;m basically staying is pre</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.080" end="01:25:15.530" style="s2">hypothesis let&#39;s you know let&#39;s define</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.000" end="01:25:23.150" style="s2">our terms and let&#39;s be adults and bring</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.530" end="01:25:25.010" style="s2">belief to the table as well so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.150" end="01:25:30.440" style="s2">just jump in because we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.010" end="01:25:31.640" style="s2">close up right now so packed before I</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.440" end="01:25:33.770" style="s2">make some closing announcements do you</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.640" end="01:25:37.969" style="s2">have any kind of closing thoughts for us</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.770" end="01:25:39.140" style="s2">oh no I think I&#39;ve spoken enough I thank</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.969" end="01:25:40.699" style="s2">you again for all these questions I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.140" end="01:25:47.570" style="s2">not actually used to a group Q&amp;A the</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.699" end="01:25:49.430" style="s2">first time so this is this has been good</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.570" end="01:25:53.030" style="s2">thank you again for listening and</p>

<p begin="01:26:03.500" end="01:26:06.710" style="s2">so in a moment I&#39;ll make some</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.180" end="01:26:08.930" style="s2">announcements about upcoming events but</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.710" end="01:26:12.650" style="s2">first Pat thanks so much for coming on</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.930" end="01:26:13.670" style="s2">it was greatly appreciated so I&#39;ll talk</p>
