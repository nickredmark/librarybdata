<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:55.520" style="s2">ones are the worst of the worst</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.440" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">i don&#39;t agree with that um i think</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.520" end="00:01:02.239" style="s2">that our entire society</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:03.199" style="s2">is ableist as and all of our other</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.239" end="00:01:06.720" style="s2">isms</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.199" end="00:01:10.000" style="s2">stem from our ableism racism</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.720" end="00:01:12.560" style="s2">says this group of people is x</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.000" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">because they&#39;re y right they have this</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.560" end="00:01:17.439" style="s2">trait because they&#39;re black</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:18.320" style="s2">ableism says it matters at all why does</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.439" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">it matter</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.320" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">if if a group of people is lazy why does</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">it matter if a group of people has less</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:25.600" style="s2">of an iq</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:28.720" style="s2">why does it matter if a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.600" end="00:01:30.799" style="s2">is more or less athletic</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.720" end="00:01:32.560" style="s2">i&#39;m not okay in racism i&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.799" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">that if we were more if we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.560" end="00:01:36.799" style="s2">any ableism we wouldn&#39;t have racism if</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:40.159" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have ableism we wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.799" end="00:01:42.159" style="s2">homophobia or sexism because we would</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.159" end="00:01:43.759" style="s2">see the individual instead of the gender</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.159" end="00:01:45.280" style="s2">and the race and the sexuality and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.759" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">however they showed up in</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.280" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">any of their capacities on the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:51.439" style="s2">of ability and traits</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">they would be acceptable and so when i</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.439" end="00:01:54.799" style="s2">hear people</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:56.479" style="s2">talk about trans ableism all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.799" end="00:01:58.880" style="s2">ableism comes out</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.479" end="00:02:00.159" style="s2">in today in this pandemic i cannot tell</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.880" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">you the amount of times i have heard</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.159" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">people be like well it&#39;s just people</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">with pre-existing conditions</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:07.360" style="s2">if we said that about any other group of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:09.520" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">we would see it for the racist sexist</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.520" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">homophobia it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">right as much as people might be acting</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">in a systemically racist way that this</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">that this pandemic seems to kill more</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">black and brown people</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:24.720" style="s2">than it does caucasian people um</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">no one i haven&#39;t heard a single as</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.720" end="00:02:28.239" style="s2">racist as our world is say well whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:29.200" style="s2">who cares it&#39;s just killing black and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.239" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2">brown people</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.200" end="00:02:32.879" style="s2">right they are absolutely saying that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:35.200" style="s2">about pre-existing conditions</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.879" end="00:02:37.120" style="s2">it&#39;s just the feeble weak burdens of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.200" end="00:02:39.519" style="s2">society that it&#39;s taking out</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.120" end="00:02:42.239" style="s2">and this is where i absolutely disagree</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.519" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">with society&#39;s version of disability</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.239" end="00:02:46.640" style="s2">i think our disabilities our unique</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">stance</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.640" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">place in the world our unique lived</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">experience whether our disabilities are</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:52.959" style="s2">acquired or were born with them</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">give us a unique perspective and so our</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.959" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">disabilities are actually a gift</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">to society if we&#39;re able to give it the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:04.159" style="s2">issue is society set up for able-bodied</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">neurotypical emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.159" end="00:03:08.720" style="s2">able to handle their emotions people</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">it&#39;s not set up for those with emotional</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.720" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">disabilities with physical disabilities</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:12.080" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.640" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">with mental disabilities with</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.080" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">neurodivergence it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:20.560" style="s2">and so i trigger a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">who are in the toxic positivity movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.560" end="00:03:23.440" style="s2">my family being some of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:24.640" style="s2">when they&#39;re like well if you just</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.440" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">thought better thoughts you&#39;d heal</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">one because i am very positive thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve tried all those things and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">didn&#39;t improve it</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">i have to save the world to save myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">and i&#39;m good with that</p>

<p begin="00:05:13.120" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">your subconscious and living into the</p>

<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">ends up happening but that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">difference between people who have</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">disability and people who have acquired</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">and so she talks about in her there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:30.320" style="s2">woman who got in an accident is now in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:32.960" style="s2">wheelchair</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.320" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">and is like well how dare they be like</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.960" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">that because i could cure myself i would</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">that&#39;s your own ableism why should they</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">have to deal with your own ableism</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">because i know a ton of people and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.880" end="00:05:43.440" style="s2">not wrong for feeling that way it&#39;s her</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:44.720" style="s2">lived experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.440" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">right the woman in a wheelchair being</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.720" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">like i would cure myself if i could she</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:49.759" style="s2">probably finds beauty and love in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">in that space as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.759" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">but i know people who liter list their</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">accident they got them in a wheelchair</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:57.600" style="s2">as their single most defining moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.479" end="00:06:00.080" style="s2">that they would never change</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.600" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">ever because it helped them be who they</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.080" end="00:06:02.960" style="s2">are and find their purpose and help them</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:05.520" style="s2">eat the love of their life and help them</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.960" end="00:06:07.280" style="s2">in whatever way that it helped them</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.520" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a big difference between</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2">somebody acquiring a disability and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">being like how dare anyone want this</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">this is a burden burden burden on me a</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">burden on society</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">so how dare you because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">seeing the flip side</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">of the gift that every disability gives</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">to the society</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:23.759" style="s2">the gift of having a different lived</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:25.759" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.759" end="00:06:27.520" style="s2">having a society that does not work for</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">you whatever that disability is so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.520" end="00:06:30.479" style="s2">you can help</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:31.919" style="s2">fix society society is not set up for</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.479" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">that and this is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.919" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">we&#39;re in a very competitive world and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">people with disabilities are at a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:38.800" style="s2">disadvantage in a competitive world and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.440" end="00:06:41.840" style="s2">whatever advantage we do</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.800" end="00:06:42.800" style="s2">have we need to hold on to in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.840" end="00:06:44.479" style="s2">competitive world</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.800" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">right i&#39;m a spoonie i have to really</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.479" end="00:06:47.360" style="s2">care about how i spend my energy because</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:48.960" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.360" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve had to come up with some ingenious</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.960" end="00:06:53.759" style="s2">ways to save energy and spend energy</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">that would work for anyone anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.759" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">if they did it to my extreme they would</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">be trans ambulance</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">but if they used it a little bit used it</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.520" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">find where they want to do stuff and do</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:07.039" style="s2">it when they when they</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">feel the motivation to do it if they</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.039" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">took more downtime if they did what i do</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">they would probably get a benefit out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:14.000" style="s2">but in a competitive world why would i</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:17.039" style="s2">help them</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:19.919" style="s2">in a cooperative world giving them my</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.039" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">gifts of what i&#39;ve learned from this</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.919" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">would help me because then they get to</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">show up better they get to have more</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:27.919" style="s2">energy to do whatever they&#39;re here to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">in the world which would help me</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.919" end="00:07:31.280" style="s2">but in a society that we&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:35.440" style="s2">competitive that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:35.919" style="s2">i do want to touch on um a blair is very</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.440" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.919" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">to cut to separate the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">doing it as because their body doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:46.160" style="s2">align with what they feel it should be</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:47.280" style="s2">um and calls it out as a mental disorder</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.160" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">we have different i have a different</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.280" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">view of that which i think i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">mentioned in here</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">um which is not i wouldn&#39;t expect any of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:56.840" style="s2">them to to to see my view that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">one way that it could have existed</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.840" end="00:08:00.160" style="s2">uh versus the people who are doing it</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">just for attention</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.160" end="00:08:04.960" style="s2">and she her wording exactly was um</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">they can burn in hell but she&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.960" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">they but if what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">do if other people if you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:14.000" style="s2">other people feel worse about themselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:16.960" style="s2">and it actively costs society you are a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.000" end="00:08:16.960" style="s2">problematic person</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">that is my view of what influencer</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:24.800" style="s2">culture is</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">and as blair herself is an influencer</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.800" end="00:08:28.639" style="s2">she has</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.680" end="00:08:30.000" style="s2">over half a million subscribers i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.639" end="00:08:32.800" style="s2">saying she should stop that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">but as a society influencers having that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">much power that that many people listen</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:37.360" style="s2">to them</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">that if you can&#39;t edit a video like i</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.360" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">can&#39;t you&#39;re not listened to even though</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:41.120" style="s2">you have world freaking saving problems</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:45.039" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.120" end="00:08:45.039" style="s2">solutions that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">a problem with this and if you watch the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">social dilemma where the algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">working in that way</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">their influencers are this is my biggest</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">problem with influencer culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:58.959" style="s2">if an influencer has a choice</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:01.279" style="s2">to follow their own inner guidance and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.959" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">do a topic they really care about</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.279" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">but they know it&#39;s going to get crickets</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">they know no one&#39;s going to watch it</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to make that content</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">that&#39;s too much work</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:12.399" style="s2">versus they&#39;re going to follow the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">the algorithm they&#39;re going to follow</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.399" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s going to get them the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">most views they&#39;re going to pick that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">one and making all of those decisions</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:18.480" style="s2">continuously is going to make you into a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:19.839" style="s2">different person</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.480" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">you&#39;re not becoming your own most</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.839" end="00:09:23.760" style="s2">authentic self you&#39;re becoming your most</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">influence yourself and they&#39;re two</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.760" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">different paths some people can figure</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">out how to do both some people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">natural authentic path is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">influencer</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:35.200" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna they&#39;re gonna be beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">and charismatic and articulate and be</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:40.640" style="s2">um edit and be able to get to that role</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">but then it starts to change who you</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">are or you or you&#39;re extremely strong to</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:45.839" style="s2">be able to do it even the people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:48.880" style="s2">first get involved in it</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.839" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">the reason i&#39;m on youtube is to change</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.880" end="00:09:53.760" style="s2">the world and yet i have</p>

<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">if they don&#39;t have a world changing idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.279" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">aren&#39;t on youtube which means you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">get to hear the introverts side actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:02.079" style="s2">youtubers are introverts but even when</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:02.399" style="s2">they&#39;re on camera they don&#39;t appear to</p>
