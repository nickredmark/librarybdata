<p begin="00:01:03.530" end="00:01:09.020" style="s2">juggle like the complicating factor is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.420" end="00:01:11.050" style="s2">that we want to give priority to patrons</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.020" end="00:01:14.090" style="s2">if you&#39;re supporting us on patreon then</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.009" end="00:01:25.369" style="s2">you would be more likely to answer that</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.880" end="00:01:27.320" style="s2">but then we&#39;ve got the issue that we the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.369" end="00:01:29.900" style="s2">the tags that people have on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.320" end="00:01:32.300" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily match with the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.900" end="00:01:35.149" style="s2">patron that their real names on patreon</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.300" end="00:01:38.180" style="s2">so what we&#39;re going to do if you&#39;re if</p>

<p begin="00:01:44.119" end="00:01:48.380" style="s2">a patron put a question in underneath</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.670" end="00:01:50.360" style="s2">the line here we&#39;ll we&#39;ll answer</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.380" end="00:01:53.630" style="s2">whatever we get round to but will</p>

<p begin="00:01:53.630" end="00:01:57.619" style="s2">a five-dollar patron you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.979" end="00:01:59.780" style="s2">going to get your question answered one</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.619" end="00:02:01.220" style="s2">dollar will we&#39;ll consider it more but</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.780" end="00:02:03.110" style="s2">we&#39;ll also look through the questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.220" end="00:02:04.520" style="s2">underneath this and if there&#39;s one who</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.110" end="00:02:06.830" style="s2">particularly liked them we&#39;ll definitely</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.520" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">answer those and talking of patreon</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.830" end="00:02:10.549" style="s2">we&#39;re also going to be launching some</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:13.160" style="s2">exclusive content on there very soon the</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.160" end="00:02:18.110" style="s2">so it&#39;s the two of us kind of giving a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:20.450" style="s2">little bit more background into what</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.110" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">we&#39;re doing what our mission is how this</p>
