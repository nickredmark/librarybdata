<p begin="00:00:23.590" end="00:00:29.140" style="s2">contributed significantly to our</p>

<p begin="00:00:29.140" end="00:00:34.059" style="s2">we talked about how Aristotle was</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.359" end="00:00:35.440" style="s2">centrally concerned with something that</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.059" end="00:00:38.260" style="s2">he thought Plato didn&#39;t give an adequate</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.440" end="00:00:41.680" style="s2">enough account of change but importantly</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.260" end="00:00:43.210" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s term for change is properly</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.680" end="00:00:46.270" style="s2">understood in terms of growth and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.210" end="00:00:47.980" style="s2">development and we talked about how much</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.270" end="00:00:51.160" style="s2">your sense of growth and development is</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.980" end="00:00:54.370" style="s2">constitutive of finding your life to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.160" end="00:00:56.649" style="s2">meaningful we talked about how Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.370" end="00:00:59.890" style="s2">understood that development in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.649" end="00:01:01.629" style="s2">making use of Plato&#39;s idea of idose form</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.890" end="00:01:04.180" style="s2">the structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.629" end="00:01:07.149" style="s2">and then what&#39;s happening in change and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.180" end="00:01:10.570" style="s2">in development is that something is</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.149" end="00:01:13.720" style="s2">being informed in particular something</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.570" end="00:01:15.430" style="s2">like wood is the potential to be a table</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.720" end="00:01:17.500" style="s2">or a chair and when it has the correct</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.430" end="00:01:21.640" style="s2">structural functional organization then</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.500" end="00:01:23.619" style="s2">the chair starts to act like table sorry</p>

<p begin="00:01:23.619" end="00:01:30.130" style="s2">the wood starts to act like a chair and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.710" end="00:01:34.060" style="s2">that is their the idea that when you</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.130" end="00:01:36.189" style="s2">inform some potential it gets actualized</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.060" end="00:01:38.580" style="s2">into a particular thing and so change is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.189" end="00:01:41.320" style="s2">the actual izing of potential via</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.580" end="00:01:44.650" style="s2">information&#39; and then in order to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.320" end="00:01:47.110" style="s2">understand that better we left a head to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.650" end="00:01:49.119" style="s2">look at a current account of growth and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.110" end="00:01:51.579" style="s2">development that was directly inspired</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.119" end="00:01:53.710" style="s2">by aristotle we looked at elisha</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.579" end="00:01:55.720" style="s2">Gerardo&#39;s work and we went through the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.710" end="00:01:58.119" style="s2">discussion of what a dynamical system is</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.720" end="00:01:59.829" style="s2">and how we can use it understand growth</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.119" end="00:02:02.530" style="s2">and development in terms of the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.829" end="00:02:04.149" style="s2">a virtual engine we then returned and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.530" end="00:02:06.579" style="s2">used that language to better understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.149" end="00:02:09.160" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s idea about wisdom as the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.579" end="00:02:12.220" style="s2">cultivation of character where wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.160" end="00:02:13.570" style="s2">to create a virtual engine and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.220" end="00:02:15.510" style="s2">deep connection between being a virtual</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.570" end="00:02:19.420" style="s2">engine and the cultivation of virtues</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.510" end="00:02:23.830" style="s2">right that wisdom is the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.420" end="00:02:26.550" style="s2">a virtual engine a character that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.830" end="00:02:30.150" style="s2">regulates yourself development in fact</p>

<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:40.650" style="s2">we talked about it means moving through</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.030" end="00:02:45.380" style="s2">that hierarchy that we talked about last</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.650" end="00:02:49.560" style="s2">time the hierarchy of actualization from</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.380" end="00:02:51.470" style="s2">the mere plant to the animate thing to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.560" end="00:02:54.090" style="s2">the mental thing to the rational thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.470" end="00:02:55.830" style="s2">so to be wise to live up to your</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.090" end="00:02:57.660" style="s2">potential is to cultivate a character</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.830" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">that most helps you realize your</p>

<p begin="00:03:29.580" end="00:03:33.810" style="s2">so even when you have the correct set of</p>

<p begin="00:03:33.810" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">do something you will still fall prey to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.270" end="00:03:43.970" style="s2">a crazy because you have not cultivated</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.640" end="00:03:47.730" style="s2">adequate enough character then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.970" end="00:03:50.940" style="s2">challenged you in two ways I challenged</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.730" end="00:03:53.340" style="s2">you to try and reanimate and deepen</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.940" end="00:03:56.100" style="s2">these terms that we use everyday to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.340" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">about how meaningful our lives are terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.100" end="00:04:00.690" style="s2">of growth and development and actualize</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:03.750" style="s2">in ourselves and living up to our</p>

<p begin="00:04:03.750" end="00:04:11.160" style="s2">returning and reflecting upon them using</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.230" end="00:04:14.190" style="s2">Aristotle but also a Socratic challenge</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.160" end="00:04:17.750" style="s2">via Aristotle what are you doing to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.190" end="00:04:21.780" style="s2">cultivate your character how much time</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.750" end="00:04:23.970" style="s2">are you dedicating to it since it is now</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.780" end="00:04:25.980" style="s2">reasonable given this argument that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.970" end="00:04:28.980" style="s2">plays a significant role in how</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.980" end="00:04:31.940" style="s2">meaningful your life is how much time</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.980" end="00:04:35.580" style="s2">have you devoted how much time do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.940" end="00:04:36.870" style="s2">regularly devote to it now as promised</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.580" end="00:04:39.380" style="s2">last time I want to turn to the other</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.870" end="00:04:42.020" style="s2">side of Aristotle&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.380" end="00:04:44.660" style="s2">and so in a further sense how he</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.020" end="00:04:48.740" style="s2">contributed to the axial development of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.660" end="00:04:51.140" style="s2">these ideas of meaning wisdom self</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.740" end="00:04:54.040" style="s2">transcendence and of course Aristotle is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.140" end="00:04:57.190" style="s2">understanding self transcendence as this</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.040" end="00:04:59.900" style="s2">living up to your potential</p>

<p begin="00:05:03.200" end="00:05:12.440" style="s2">fully rational human being now Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.070" end="00:05:15.110" style="s2">was interested in rationality for</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.440" end="00:05:17.690" style="s2">exactly this reason he thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.110" end="00:05:20.840" style="s2">the way of defining human beings now his</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.690" end="00:05:22.130" style="s2">understanding is axial your rationality</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.840" end="00:05:24.950" style="s2">is what we&#39;ve been talking about since</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.130" end="00:05:26.930" style="s2">the beginning of this series right the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.950" end="00:05:28.580" style="s2">actual revolution idea of second order</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.930" end="00:05:31.730" style="s2">thinking you can step back and reflect</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.580" end="00:05:33.710" style="s2">on the ways in which your self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.730" end="00:05:35.480" style="s2">and you you have a capacity for self</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.710" end="00:05:36.920" style="s2">correction and self transcendence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.480" end="00:05:39.080" style="s2">the hallmark of rationality please</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.920" end="00:05:41.030" style="s2">remember that right because we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.080" end="00:05:43.550" style="s2">tended and we&#39;ll see much later why</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.030" end="00:05:46.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve tended to reduce rationality to</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.550" end="00:05:48.590" style="s2">the idea of being logical but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.550" end="00:05:50.570" style="s2">that&#39;s not the core idea of Rash noted</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.590" end="00:05:55.310" style="s2">the core idea of rationality is your</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.570" end="00:05:56.810" style="s2">capacity for reflectively realizing your</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.310" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">capacities for self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.810" end="00:06:03.260" style="s2">illusion and for self correction and for</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:06.170" style="s2">Aristotle that self correction is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.260" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">process of also realizing your potential</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.170" end="00:06:15.760" style="s2">through the cultivation of character but</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:19.940" style="s2">what is at the heart of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.760" end="00:06:21.710" style="s2">because if we go back to the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.940" end="00:06:25.340" style="s2">model Aristotle has told us a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.710" end="00:06:26.870" style="s2">one side right character this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.340" end="00:06:28.970" style="s2">remember Plato talks about how you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.870" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">aligning the psyche but Plato also</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.970" end="00:06:34.600" style="s2">talked about right being in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:34.600" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.650" end="00:06:42.480" style="s2">how did Aristotle develop this side of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.750" end="00:06:44.960" style="s2">the Platonic equation this is his way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.480" end="00:06:47.000" style="s2">trying to give a deeper analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:51.960" style="s2">structuring the psyche to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.000" end="00:06:54.540" style="s2">self-deception what did he do to try and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.960" end="00:06:56.730" style="s2">develop Plato&#39;s idea of being in contact</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.540" end="00:06:58.530" style="s2">with reality because if you remember we</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.730" end="00:07:01.880" style="s2">also have this meta drive we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.530" end="00:07:07.620" style="s2">in contact with reality I put it to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.880" end="00:07:09.060" style="s2">that that is in fact the core feature or</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.620" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">at least the core motivation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.060" end="00:07:14.490" style="s2">rationality the core motivation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:17.040" style="s2">rationality is the desire to come into</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.490" end="00:07:19.920" style="s2">as deep a contact with reality as</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.040" end="00:07:25.140" style="s2">possible by those means that are as</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.920" end="00:07:28.290" style="s2">reliable as possible so for Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.140" end="00:07:31.830" style="s2">this brought him into a discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.290" end="00:07:33.960" style="s2">what it is to truly know something to</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.830" end="00:07:35.820" style="s2">truly know something and again he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.960" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">going to be deeply influenced by Plato</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.820" end="00:07:44.730" style="s2">well of course making his own unique</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:48.120" style="s2">changes and challenges to Plato so we</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.730" end="00:07:51.330" style="s2">have got a view in which we think we</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.120" end="00:07:52.620" style="s2">largely conceive of knowing as being</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.330" end="00:07:55.260" style="s2">able to give a very accurate description</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.620" end="00:07:58.910" style="s2">of something I know what a chair is if I</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.260" end="00:08:02.790" style="s2">can really describe it very well to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.910" end="00:08:05.090" style="s2">now the there there is a challenge to</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.790" end="00:08:07.860" style="s2">that if I were to ask you the following</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.090" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">who knows better what a chair is</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.860" end="00:08:11.160" style="s2">somebody who could describe a chair very</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:17.160" style="s2">well to you or somebody who could</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.160" end="00:08:19.320" style="s2">actually make a chair and many people</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.160" end="00:08:20.550" style="s2">would say well you know the person who</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.320" end="00:08:22.650" style="s2">can describe it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.550" end="00:08:24.180" style="s2">understand and and they&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.650" end="00:08:25.830" style="s2">struggle for words he&#39;ll and they&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.180" end="00:08:27.570" style="s2">words taken from Aristotle without</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.830" end="00:08:29.850" style="s2">realizing they don&#39;t get the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.570" end="00:08:32.640" style="s2">a chair right because if you can make a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.850" end="00:08:34.500" style="s2">chair then you&#39;ve grasped something more</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.640" end="00:08:38.460" style="s2">and this is again related to this notion</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.500" end="00:08:40.110" style="s2">if you can cause a chair to be if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.460" end="00:08:44.460" style="s2">can cause it to be then you deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.110" end="00:08:47.310" style="s2">understand what a chair is so Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.460" end="00:08:48.649" style="s2">then asked well what is it that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.310" end="00:08:51.319" style="s2">chair maker has</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.649" end="00:08:56.269" style="s2">that the accurate descriptor does not</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.319" end="00:08:57.769" style="s2">have and again it goes back to what we</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.269" end="00:08:59.689" style="s2">saw before when I gave you my</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.769" end="00:09:02.839" style="s2">description of the bird you know it has</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.689" end="00:09:05.420" style="s2">wings and beaks and all this stuff and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.839" end="00:09:06.649" style="s2">was lacking the idol I was lacking the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.420" end="00:09:08.899" style="s2">form the structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.649" end="00:09:10.999" style="s2">organization so Aristotle says what the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.899" end="00:09:13.399" style="s2">chair maker has that the good</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.999" end="00:09:16.670" style="s2">descriptive the good describe or doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.399" end="00:09:19.249" style="s2">have is the chair maker actually has in</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.670" end="00:09:33.199" style="s2">their mind the I das think of it like an</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.249" end="00:09:35.240" style="s2">architect right that has a blueprint the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.199" end="00:09:37.249" style="s2">architect has in their mind the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.240" end="00:09:39.949" style="s2">structural functional organization that</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.249" end="00:09:44.319" style="s2">is actually going to be shared in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.949" end="00:09:47.720" style="s2">building the architect has the I does</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.319" end="00:09:51.860" style="s2">the chair maker has the I das in their</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.720" end="00:09:53.959" style="s2">mind and they can actualize they can use</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.860" end="00:10:00.709" style="s2">that I das to actualize the potential in</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.959" end="00:10:04.730" style="s2">the wood to make the chair so to know</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.709" end="00:10:09.769" style="s2">something is to possess the same I Doss</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.730" end="00:10:13.249" style="s2">as it now the architect right when he</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.769" end="00:10:14.179" style="s2">has the IDIS for the the building he</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.249" end="00:10:15.860" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a he doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.179" end="00:10:18.100" style="s2">material building in his mind you</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.860" end="00:10:21.470" style="s2">couldn&#39;t go in house a family of five</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.100" end="00:10:24.410" style="s2">inside his mind right when we when we</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.470" end="00:10:26.449" style="s2">say that they has the same pattern we</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.410" end="00:10:29.509" style="s2">don&#39;t mean it&#39;s actualizing the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.449" end="00:10:35.389" style="s2">matter as wood and metal in a building</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.509" end="00:10:38.870" style="s2">but the same form is there so for</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.389" end="00:10:40.959" style="s2">Aristotle when I know something and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.870" end="00:10:44.089" style="s2">is the original meaning of this world</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.959" end="00:10:48.350" style="s2">right there&#39;s conformity I share the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.089" end="00:10:52.040" style="s2">same form with it so when I know some</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.350" end="00:10:54.920" style="s2">object or know some thing my mind takes</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.040" end="00:10:58.999" style="s2">on the same structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.920" end="00:11:02.360" style="s2">organization as the thing such that if I</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.999" end="00:11:04.990" style="s2">could take that I toss from my mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.360" end="00:11:07.730" style="s2">and actualize it in some potential I</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.990" end="00:11:12.140" style="s2">could make an instance of the thing I</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.730" end="00:11:15.529" style="s2">could cause it to be so if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.140" end="00:11:18.170" style="s2">remember shape is not the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.529" end="00:11:22.630" style="s2">form but we can use shape as Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.170" end="00:11:25.550" style="s2">does as an analogy for form so when I</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.630" end="00:11:29.329" style="s2">know the cup I could know it by standing</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.550" end="00:11:31.850" style="s2">away from it and describing it right</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.329" end="00:11:34.670" style="s2">trying to describe its shape and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.850" end="00:11:40.070" style="s2">using shape as an analogy for form or I</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.670" end="00:11:42.589" style="s2">can actually conform to the cup I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.070" end="00:11:45.649" style="s2">actually taking the shape same shape and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.589" end="00:11:48.260" style="s2">notice how this enables me to causally</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.649" end="00:11:50.930" style="s2">interact with a cup in a much more</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.260" end="00:11:53.720" style="s2">intimate and complex and sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.930" end="00:11:57.230" style="s2">fashion so when you know something for</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.720" end="00:12:00.110" style="s2">Aristotle your mind is in conformity</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.230" end="00:12:02.120" style="s2">with it now that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.110" end="00:12:04.700" style="s2">because that means when Aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.120" end="00:12:06.709" style="s2">theory of knowing there&#39;s no distinction</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.700" end="00:12:10.970" style="s2">there as we typically have between</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.709" end="00:12:14.269" style="s2">knowing and being what do I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.970" end="00:12:16.040" style="s2">again using the analogy here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.269" end="00:12:18.350" style="s2">modern view I&#39;m over here describing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.040" end="00:12:20.440" style="s2">it&#39;s over there independent I&#39;m over</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.350" end="00:12:23.949" style="s2">here describing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.440" end="00:12:28.130" style="s2">here&#39;s Aristotle&#39;s view I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.949" end="00:12:30.050" style="s2">changing my structure this isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.130" end="00:12:33.410" style="s2">I&#39;m not just knowing and having beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.050" end="00:12:35.709" style="s2">I&#39;m being changed this is a change in my</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.410" end="00:12:38.480" style="s2">being not just a change in my knowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.709" end="00:12:42.320" style="s2">the conformity Theory doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.480" end="00:12:47.890" style="s2">change your beliefs it changes the very</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.320" end="00:12:51.920" style="s2">structure and functioning of your being</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.890" end="00:12:54.260" style="s2">so the conformity theory is a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.920" end="00:12:57.110" style="s2">different way of thinking about how we</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.260" end="00:12:58.910" style="s2">know things so Charles Taylor who I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.110" end="00:13:00.890" style="s2">mentioned before Herbert Dreyfus and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.910" end="00:13:04.220" style="s2">others they talk about the conformity</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.890" end="00:13:06.920" style="s2">theory as a contact epistemology so to</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.220" end="00:13:10.279" style="s2">know something is to be in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.920" end="00:13:13.640" style="s2">it is to actually participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.279" end="00:13:15.319" style="s2">same form as the thing we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.640" end="00:13:15.940" style="s2">come back to this sense of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.319" end="00:13:18.260" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.940" end="00:13:21.500" style="s2">participatory knowing is when I shape</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.260" end="00:13:23.899" style="s2">myself in order to know the thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.500" end="00:13:27.140" style="s2">know it by conforming to it this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.899" end="00:13:29.180" style="s2">different from descriptive knowing where</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.140" end="00:13:35.120" style="s2">I stand apart and I generate</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.180" end="00:13:38.149" style="s2">propositions about the thing so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.120" end="00:13:40.430" style="s2">conformity theory has this very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.149" end="00:13:45.620" style="s2">idea of an intimate connection between</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.430" end="00:13:50.240" style="s2">the mind and reality and it&#39;s based on a</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.620" end="00:13:52.250" style="s2">very powerful idea and as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:55.010" style="s2">Aristotle is going through a significant</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.250" end="00:13:58.760" style="s2">revival in our understanding of living</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.010" end="00:14:01.399" style="s2">things understanding of mental things we</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.760" end="00:14:02.779" style="s2">are increasingly coming to see that this</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.399" end="00:14:04.940" style="s2">kind of contact</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.779" end="00:14:09.320" style="s2">knowing this participatory knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.940" end="00:14:11.180" style="s2">much more central to how cognition works</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.320" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">than we previously thought we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.180" end="00:14:16.640" style="s2">to come back to that a lot in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:21.290" style="s2">series I just want you to take note of</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.640" end="00:14:23.450" style="s2">it now notice how this what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.290" end="00:14:26.079" style="s2">notice right now is how this theory of</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.450" end="00:14:28.760" style="s2">knowing which is also a theory of being</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">satisfies that desire of being in</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.760" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">contact with reality as opposed to being</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:37.190" style="s2">like separate from it and merely</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:42.670" style="s2">pointing at it with my words or my</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.190" end="00:14:45.290" style="s2">propositions alright so if I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.670" end="00:14:47.149" style="s2">conformity with the world that tells you</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.290" end="00:14:49.910" style="s2">something very interesting the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.149" end="00:14:51.950" style="s2">structural functional organization my</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.910" end="00:14:54.200" style="s2">patterns of intelligibility member for</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.950" end="00:14:56.360" style="s2">Plato intelligibility and Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.200" end="00:14:58.300" style="s2">completely inherits this like I say</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.360" end="00:15:02.300" style="s2">again read Erich pearls book on this</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.300" end="00:15:04.579" style="s2">right how I make sense of things the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.300" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">pattern of intelligibility is the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.579" end="00:15:10.910" style="s2">pattern by which the thing is organized</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:12.980" style="s2">so when I&#39;m making sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.910" end="00:15:17.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.980" end="00:15:18.860" style="s2">organization in my mind that is shared</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.630" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">with the structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.860" end="00:15:24.829" style="s2">organization of what I&#39;m making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:26.810" style="s2">things but does that mean that you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.829" end="00:15:28.980" style="s2">everything I think is just true no</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.810" end="00:15:33.630" style="s2">Aristotle is like</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.980" end="00:15:36.779" style="s2">a genius right he he he&#39;s probably you</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.630" end="00:15:40.470" style="s2">know a clear instance of what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.779" end="00:15:42.420" style="s2">called a universal genius we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.470" end="00:15:44.250" style="s2">dismiss it what Aristotle says so easily</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.420" end="00:15:47.760" style="s2">I mean Aristotle literally writes the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.250" end="00:15:49.550" style="s2">book on everything you you you you come</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.760" end="00:15:52.050" style="s2">to say you&#39;re at a party with Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.550" end="00:15:53.940" style="s2">you say all I&#39;m interested in physics</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.050" end="00:15:55.620" style="s2">and then he&#39;ll here I wrote the book on</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.940" end="00:15:57.690" style="s2">this this is called physics this is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.620" end="00:15:59.160" style="s2">book that started physics oh well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.690" end="00:16:01.170" style="s2">also interested in philosophy I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.160" end="00:16:03.540" style="s2">interested in metaphysics here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.170" end="00:16:05.670" style="s2">boat book I wrote on metaphysics well</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.540" end="00:16:08.010" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in how animals move</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.670" end="00:16:10.410" style="s2">here&#39;s my book I wrote on how animals</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.010" end="00:16:13.500" style="s2">move I&#39;m interested in psychology here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.410" end="00:16:17.329" style="s2">my book dreams here&#39;s my book how to</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.500" end="00:16:23.930" style="s2">write books here&#39;s my book Aristotle is</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.329" end="00:16:26.190" style="s2">right just an astonishing intellect so</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.930" end="00:16:29.610" style="s2">what does he mean then well what he</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.190" end="00:16:32.760" style="s2">means is right that after we&#39;ve done all</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.610" end="00:16:35.610" style="s2">that axial age second order thinking oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.760" end="00:16:37.769" style="s2">we&#39;ve done all this Socratic and</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.610" end="00:16:40.470" style="s2">platonic argument and discussion well</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.769" end="00:16:44.010" style="s2">we&#39;ve done this rational reflection once</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.470" end="00:16:46.470" style="s2">we then get to that I toss that</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.010" end="00:16:49.140" style="s2">structural functional organization we</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.470" end="00:16:50.730" style="s2">can be confident that what structural</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.140" end="00:16:52.589" style="s2">functional organization we&#39;re finding</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.730" end="00:16:55.350" style="s2">and how we make sense of things is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.589" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">same or to put it in a slogan when we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.350" end="00:16:59.670" style="s2">made sense of things the pattern in our</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:06.000" style="s2">mind is the same as the pattern in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.670" end="00:17:07.919" style="s2">world so what are those processes</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.000" end="00:17:11.449" style="s2">Aristotle like everything he does he</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.919" end="00:17:14.100" style="s2">tries to explicate a little bit more so</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.449" end="00:17:17.339" style="s2">think about this think about how you try</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.100" end="00:17:21.150" style="s2">and determine if something was real if</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.339" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">it really is the case so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.150" end="00:17:27.689" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in Susan and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:29.580" style="s2">talking to your friend Tom and Tom and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.689" end="00:17:33.600" style="s2">Susan and yourself you&#39;re at a party the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.580" end="00:17:36.780" style="s2">previous night and Tom tells you Oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.600" end="00:17:37.890" style="s2">Susan I think Susan really likes you now</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.780" end="00:17:39.870" style="s2">this is important to you because you</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.890" end="00:17:41.130" style="s2">really like Susan you&#39;d really like it</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.870" end="00:17:43.940" style="s2">if Susan liked you</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.130" end="00:17:43.940" style="s2">this would be a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.100" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">and but you don&#39;t want to leap into this</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.860" end="00:17:49.679" style="s2">because your heart has been broken</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">before and you&#39;ve acted foolishly and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.679" end="00:17:56.280" style="s2">impulsively so you want to make sure so</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:58.440" style="s2">you say wait wait come on Tom</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.280" end="00:18:02.669" style="s2">I saw you last night you were really</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.440" end="00:18:04.919" style="s2">hammered like you were drunk then I</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.669" end="00:18:07.919" style="s2">don&#39;t believe you and this is Tom says</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.919" end="00:18:09.390" style="s2">no no no no I heard this way before I</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.919" end="00:18:11.250" style="s2">was drunk I heard this at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.390" end="00:18:13.650" style="s2">I heard Susan say this at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.250" end="00:18:16.590" style="s2">when you say come on Tom there was so</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.650" end="00:18:19.230" style="s2">many people was so noisy how can you be</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.590" end="00:18:21.270" style="s2">sure and Tom says no no this was in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.230" end="00:18:23.040" style="s2">kitchen Susan was in the kitchen when I</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.270" end="00:18:27.299" style="s2">heard her say it wasn&#39;t that noisy there</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.040" end="00:18:30.090" style="s2">and then you say I don&#39;t know and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.299" end="00:18:33.120" style="s2">Tom says yeah but Andrew and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.090" end="00:18:37.169" style="s2">Jane also heard Susan say that and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.120" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">go oh wow I think Susan likes me so you</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.169" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">do these three tests you make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:48.090" style="s2">you&#39;re the relevant organ of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:49.770" style="s2">right your your attention right your</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.090" end="00:18:51.750" style="s2">memory your brain was functioning</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.770" end="00:18:55.679" style="s2">normally yes it is it&#39;s functioning</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.750" end="00:18:58.580" style="s2">normally okay so I was sober you make</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.679" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">sure that the environment isn&#39;t creating</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.580" end="00:19:04.290" style="s2">distorting conditions too much noise</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:07.679" style="s2">right no no it&#39;s an optimal environment</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.290" end="00:19:10.890" style="s2">so let&#39;s do this or again operating</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.679" end="00:19:13.290" style="s2">optimally environment optimal or really</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.890" end="00:19:15.360" style="s2">good and then I look for did other</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.290" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">people experience it inter subjective</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.360" end="00:19:25.110" style="s2">agreement so this is what you do right</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:28.500" style="s2">you write you very carefully try to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.110" end="00:19:31.230" style="s2">your mind into an optimal state you make</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.500" end="00:19:33.299" style="s2">sure the medium is the best right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.230" end="00:19:34.890" style="s2">you do a lot of intersubjective</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.299" end="00:19:36.750" style="s2">discussion to make sure that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.890" end="00:19:38.790" style="s2">agreement with other people so you do</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.750" end="00:19:40.740" style="s2">really deep philosophy you argue and</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.790" end="00:19:42.750" style="s2">discuss you to you in act like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.740" end="00:19:44.870" style="s2">Socratic thing you really train your</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.750" end="00:19:48.299" style="s2">mind you get the appropriate conditions</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.870" end="00:19:50.220" style="s2">you do all this you get you come to some</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.299" end="00:19:52.679" style="s2">agreement and then once you get there</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.220" end="00:19:54.780" style="s2">you can have significant confidence that</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.679" end="00:19:55.010" style="s2">you&#39;re in conformity with reality that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.780" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.010" end="00:20:02.840" style="s2">pattern that&#39;s in your mind is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:20:04.280" style="s2">pattern that&#39;s in the world now I point</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.840" end="00:20:05.840" style="s2">this out to you not because I want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.280" end="00:20:07.370" style="s2">say that Aristotle&#39;s ultimately right</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.840" end="00:20:09.110" style="s2">because we&#39;re gonna see how that way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.370" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">doing things was challenged but I want</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.110" end="00:20:15.020" style="s2">to point out to you how you still do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:17.660" style="s2">now there&#39;s something deeply plausible</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.020" end="00:20:20.630" style="s2">and practical in what Aristotle saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.660" end="00:20:23.330" style="s2">this is how you on a day-to-day basis</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.630" end="00:20:27.380" style="s2">try to make sure that you&#39;re in touch</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.330" end="00:20:29.420" style="s2">with things so how are things what is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.380" end="00:20:32.020" style="s2">the structural functional pattern of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.420" end="00:20:36.380" style="s2">world when I&#39;m making sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.020" end="00:20:40.700" style="s2">so Aristotle is also as I said</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.380" end="00:20:44.600" style="s2">considered you know a foundational</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.700" end="00:20:51.220" style="s2">figure in science in fact for the for</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.600" end="00:20:51.220" style="s2">literally millennia right a millennia he</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.310" end="00:20:58.940" style="s2">he is basically identical to science</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.230" end="00:21:01.060" style="s2">knowing Aristotle&#39;s to know science he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.940" end="00:21:05.270" style="s2">building upon all the pre-socratic</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.060" end="00:21:07.790" style="s2">philosophers before him but basically he</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.270" end="00:21:10.010" style="s2">what he says is okay how is the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.790" end="00:21:18.860" style="s2">organized what is the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.010" end="00:21:21.170" style="s2">reality well how does it look to us what</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.860" end="00:21:27.650" style="s2">can we all agree on okay so we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.170" end="00:21:31.010" style="s2">stone-cold sober clear day we can all</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.650" end="00:21:33.230" style="s2">talk we can agree and this is when that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.010" end="00:21:37.000" style="s2">no try to get back to Aristotle&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.230" end="00:21:40.790" style="s2">this is how things seem to all of us</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.000" end="00:21:41.870" style="s2">we&#39;re at the center okay and that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.790" end="00:21:45.580" style="s2">this is something we&#39;re going to come</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.870" end="00:21:48.110" style="s2">back to because that&#39;s how your</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.580" end="00:21:52.460" style="s2">perceptual cognitive system seems to</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.110" end="00:21:55.180" style="s2">operate you&#39;re at the center things are</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.460" end="00:21:55.180" style="s2">moving around us</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.770" end="00:22:04.200" style="s2">so he has a geocentric worldview the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.510" end="00:22:08.100" style="s2">earth is at the center well why do</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.200" end="00:22:13.710" style="s2">things move like why are things moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.100" end="00:22:16.530" style="s2">so he has the idea again that things</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.710" end="00:22:18.150" style="s2">move for the same reason you do remember</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.530" end="00:22:20.610" style="s2">if they&#39;ll ease talked about that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.150" end="00:22:23.550" style="s2">magnet is moving you&#39;re moving look look</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.610" end="00:22:26.370" style="s2">when I lift on this and it&#39;s pushing</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.550" end="00:22:29.900" style="s2">against me that feels no different to me</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.370" end="00:22:33.450" style="s2">then when some a person is pushing on me</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.900" end="00:22:40.470" style="s2">it feels like the table is moving itself</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.450" end="00:22:42.480" style="s2">against me again don&#39;t concentrate on</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.470" end="00:22:45.900" style="s2">whether or not this is true concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.480" end="00:22:51.090" style="s2">on how much sense it makes so when I</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.900" end="00:22:53.010" style="s2">move the pan away from the earth it</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.090" end="00:22:56.670" style="s2">looks like it moves itself to get back</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.010" end="00:22:59.780" style="s2">there which looks exactly like I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.670" end="00:23:02.040" style="s2">be over there and I move myself there</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.780" end="00:23:06.290" style="s2">because I&#39;m separated from where I want</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.040" end="00:23:09.660" style="s2">to be so Aristotle&#39;s idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.290" end="00:23:12.600" style="s2">everything right is made up of elements</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.660" end="00:23:15.720" style="s2">basic elements like earth water air and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.600" end="00:23:20.040" style="s2">fire things that have a lot of earth in</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.720" end="00:23:22.140" style="s2">them like this marker want to be where</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.140" end="00:23:27.540" style="s2">center so if you as you move things away</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.690" end="00:23:32.460" style="s2">from the earth things fall back towards</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.540" end="00:23:37.350" style="s2">it water is going to be on the surface</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.460" end="00:23:38.820" style="s2">fire moves up and air is above so notice</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.350" end="00:23:40.530" style="s2">when I when I burn some wood how much</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.820" end="00:23:43.080" style="s2">sense this makes of it because when I</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.530" end="00:23:44.910" style="s2">burn the wood the fire comes up the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.080" end="00:23:48.300" style="s2">water that&#39;s evaporated spreads out is</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.910" end="00:23:53.280" style="s2">condensation right and then the ash the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.300" end="00:23:56.010" style="s2">earthen part falls down so for Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.280" end="00:23:58.020" style="s2">the earth is at the center and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.010" end="00:24:03.059" style="s2">the thing everything is moving by a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.020" end="00:24:06.290" style="s2">process of natural motion everything has</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.059" end="00:24:08.920" style="s2">an internal drive just like you</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.920" end="00:24:13.180" style="s2">it belongs everything has a natural</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.780" end="00:24:15.120" style="s2">place so and this is very important</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.180" end="00:24:18.310" style="s2">everything is moving on purpose</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.120" end="00:24:19.240" style="s2">everything is trying to get where it</p>

<p begin="00:24:19.240" end="00:24:26.650" style="s2">so notice how meaningful this view of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.230" end="00:24:29.110" style="s2">things is everything is moving just like</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.650" end="00:24:30.910" style="s2">you you&#39;re doing things to get where you</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.110" end="00:24:31.690" style="s2">belong and where you are where you</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.690" end="00:24:36.490" style="s2">then that&#39;s right the fulfillment of</p>

<p begin="00:24:36.490" end="00:24:43.930" style="s2">meaningful so all of these things the</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.930" end="00:24:48.070" style="s2">remember we talked about that we talked</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.040" end="00:25:00.910" style="s2">it&#39;s important to you that you resist</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.840" end="00:25:04.600" style="s2">the temptation here to be smug and say</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.910" end="00:25:06.670" style="s2">wow what is silly idea I mean thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.600" end="00:25:08.160" style="s2">the Earth&#39;s at the center isn&#39;t he a</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.160" end="00:25:14.440" style="s2">no because the idea that the earth is</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.920" end="00:25:17.020" style="s2">not at the center that the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.440" end="00:25:19.060" style="s2">earth is rotating was no one in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.020" end="00:25:22.210" style="s2">ancient world it&#39;s known by Aristarchus</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.060" end="00:25:23.710" style="s2">for example the problem with this view</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.210" end="00:25:26.020" style="s2">is that there are there were great</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.710" end="00:25:31.540" style="s2">counter arguments about it look if the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.020" end="00:25:32.910" style="s2">earth is rotating all right and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.540" end="00:25:36.550" style="s2">write you think the earth is rotating</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.910" end="00:25:39.100" style="s2">that means if I&#39;m on the earth and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.550" end="00:25:41.020" style="s2">rotating and I drop an object right as</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.100" end="00:25:43.480" style="s2">the object is dropping I&#39;m moving</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.020" end="00:25:45.400" style="s2">forward with rotation I end up here and</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.480" end="00:25:49.480" style="s2">the object drop should then end up</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.400" end="00:25:51.610" style="s2">behind me because as I let go of it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.480" end="00:25:53.740" style="s2">moving on the earth that&#39;s rotating and</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.610" end="00:25:56.950" style="s2">it should fall behind me so let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.740" end="00:26:03.160" style="s2">let&#39;s run the experiment oh it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.950" end="00:26:05.530" style="s2">fall behind me see what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.160" end="00:26:08.290" style="s2">realize is that until you also have an</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.530" end="00:26:10.750" style="s2">idea of something like universal</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.290" end="00:26:13.180" style="s2">gravitation and other ideas like</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.750" end="00:26:15.580" style="s2">inertial motion the idea that the earth</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.180" end="00:26:18.730" style="s2">is rotating actually doesn&#39;t make good</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.580" end="00:26:21.190" style="s2">sense of the phenomena if it&#39;s rotating</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.730" end="00:26:22.429" style="s2">why am I not feeling a breeze on my face</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.190" end="00:26:27.139" style="s2">constantly when I face</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.429" end="00:26:36.759" style="s2">one way rather than the other so there</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.139" end="00:26:36.759" style="s2">was all kinds of arguments so Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.909" end="00:26:46.970" style="s2">has a sense that we can still appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.539" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">he has a sense of well this is how we</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.970" end="00:26:52.399" style="s2">get in contact with reality and this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:52.999" style="s2">how this is the pattern that is making</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.399" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.999" end="00:26:59.360" style="s2">and what I mean by that is even though</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:27:01.789" style="s2">you and I are post Descartes post Newton</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.360" end="00:27:05.539" style="s2">right and we know and we&#39;re post right</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.789" end="00:27:09.009" style="s2">Copernicus we still move around the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.539" end="00:27:13.460" style="s2">earth as if it&#39;s at the center and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.009" end="00:27:18.879" style="s2">right the earth isn&#39;t moving and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.460" end="00:27:18.879" style="s2">objects fall directly down etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.460" end="00:27:27.970" style="s2">so given that given the tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.190" end="00:27:29.710" style="s2">plausibility of Aristotle&#39;s proposal you</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.970" end="00:27:36.210" style="s2">can now put these two sides together</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.710" end="00:27:39.070" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the geocentric right world</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.210" end="00:27:44.140" style="s2">and by world I don&#39;t just mean the earth</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.070" end="00:27:45.640" style="s2">I mean the cosmos right with the earth</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.140" end="00:27:48.490" style="s2">at the center and everything moved by</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.640" end="00:27:50.860" style="s2">natural motion and then what we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.490" end="00:27:57.070" style="s2">over here is we have the conformity</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.860" end="00:27:59.470" style="s2">Theory from knowing and I&#39;m going to</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.860" end="00:28:12.100" style="s2">want you to see is how much they</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.450" end="00:28:13.510" style="s2">mutually support each other this is very</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.100" end="00:28:15.220" style="s2">plausible that&#39;s why I told you that</p>

<p begin="00:28:15.220" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">how to make the chair and once you admit</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.160" end="00:28:22.750" style="s2">that this is plausible and you use</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:25.690" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s test it supports this view</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.750" end="00:28:29.710" style="s2">of things because if we&#39;re in if the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.690" end="00:28:32.680" style="s2">conformity theory is right and I do all</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.710" end="00:28:37.030" style="s2">of this rational reflection this is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.680" end="00:28:38.560" style="s2">intelligible pattern that I see now I</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.030" end="00:28:40.330" style="s2">can look at this and say this is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.560" end="00:28:42.670" style="s2">intelligible pattern and it&#39;s plausible</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.330" end="00:28:46.060" style="s2">that makes sense of so many things and</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.670" end="00:28:49.060" style="s2">that view that view of the world then</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.060" end="00:28:51.790" style="s2">lends evidence that I am in fact in</p>

<p begin="00:28:51.790" end="00:28:55.930" style="s2">evidence for the conformity theory and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.410" end="00:28:58.840" style="s2">notice these two things are now mutually</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.930" end="00:29:02.980" style="s2">supporting each other that&#39;s how you get</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.840" end="00:29:06.100" style="s2">a worldview right you have an account of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.980" end="00:29:09.730" style="s2">the world and you have an account of how</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.100" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">you know the world that mutually support</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.730" end="00:29:18.610" style="s2">each other in very strong bonds of</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:22.380" style="s2">plausibility now that that sets</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.610" end="00:29:22.380" style="s2">something out for us</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.990" end="00:29:31.720" style="s2">notice that there is now a deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.320" end="00:29:36.560" style="s2">connection that a deep bonding as I say</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.720" end="00:29:38.780" style="s2">between your understanding of your</p>

<p begin="00:29:38.780" end="00:29:47.350" style="s2">the world so let&#39;s try and put this</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.430" end="00:29:50.390" style="s2">together this is a view of the world</p>

<p begin="00:42:10.619" end="00:42:15.420" style="s2">mindfulness and mentioned things like</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.869" end="00:42:17.609" style="s2">meditation and contemplation our</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.420" end="00:42:20.430" style="s2">thoughts should turn of course to India</p>

<p begin="00:42:28.260" end="00:42:32.430" style="s2">mentioned at the beginning of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.790" end="00:42:34.830" style="s2">series was in the generation of Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.430" end="00:42:36.839" style="s2">and the set of practices around it now</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.830" end="00:42:38.910" style="s2">this is a very complex topic when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.839" end="00:42:41.160" style="s2">not gonna we&#39;re not gonna do it all at</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.910" end="00:42:42.839" style="s2">once right now it&#39;s gonna unfold as we</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.160" end="00:42:45.000" style="s2">move through this series but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.839" end="00:42:49.260" style="s2">talk about the axial revolution in India</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.000" end="00:42:51.240" style="s2">I want to talk about mindfulness and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.260" end="00:42:53.280" style="s2">want to talk about what what it is as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.240" end="00:42:55.170" style="s2">psycho technology house associated with</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:57.150" style="s2">wisdom and self transcendence and I want</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.170" end="00:42:59.700" style="s2">to begin the discussion of the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.150" end="00:43:03.750" style="s2">enlightenment and why enlightenment is</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.700" end="00:43:09.140" style="s2">largely a project of trying to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.750" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">threats of meaning in one&#39;s life so just</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.140" end="00:43:14.670" style="s2">the way I mean it&#39;s only analogous in</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">this way so don&#39;t draw too much but in</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.670" end="00:43:21.960" style="s2">the way Socrates was the embodiment of</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:24.150" style="s2">the axial revolution in ancient Greece I</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.960" end="00:43:27.030" style="s2">think you can see Siddhartha Gautama as</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.150" end="00:43:30.180" style="s2">the embodiment of the axial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.030" end="00:43:31.859" style="s2">in India as I mentioned of course the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.180" end="00:43:34.020" style="s2">axial revolution is being driven there</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.859" end="00:43:35.820" style="s2">by similar kinds of processes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.020" end="00:43:37.170" style="s2">there&#39;s coin edge and there&#39;s alphabetic</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.820" end="00:43:39.570" style="s2">literacy and other things like this</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.170" end="00:43:41.430" style="s2">developing but there&#39;s specific psycho</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.570" end="00:43:43.650" style="s2">technologies that seem to have come to</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.430" end="00:43:45.270" style="s2">the fore and the reasons for that are</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.650" end="00:43:47.730" style="s2">very complex I would recommend taking</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.270" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">look at Karen Armstrong&#39;s book the great</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.730" end="00:43:52.760" style="s2">transformation of because she tries to</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:56.390" style="s2">tease out why did psycho technologies a</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.760" end="00:44:00.599" style="s2">mindfulness become so prominent in</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.390" end="00:44:02.490" style="s2">ancient India and and I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.599" end="00:44:04.170" style="s2">go into that history but she gives a</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.490" end="00:44:06.330" style="s2">fairly coherent explanation about sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.170" end="00:44:08.750" style="s2">of historical cultural factors that</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.330" end="00:44:12.200" style="s2">generated it what I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.750" end="00:44:15.710" style="s2">is start talking about siddhartha as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.200" end="00:44:21.340" style="s2">way of again giving us a doorway into</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.710" end="00:44:25.700" style="s2">the axial revolution in India so</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.340" end="00:44:27.670" style="s2">Siddhartha right it&#39;s in it&#39;s all of</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.700" end="00:44:30.530" style="s2">these figures right Socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.670" end="00:44:33.590" style="s2">Siddharth later when we talk about Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.530" end="00:44:34.340" style="s2">but I&#39;m I mean trying to talk about well</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.590" end="00:44:36.410" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.340" end="00:44:39.770" style="s2">what&#39;s the historical this is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.410" end="00:44:42.950" style="s2">quixotic endeavor trying to somehow peel</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.770" end="00:44:46.849" style="s2">away and separate them from their legacy</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.950" end="00:44:49.550" style="s2">is largely a project that you can only</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.849" end="00:44:52.010" style="s2">pursue to a certain degree so I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.550" end="00:44:53.930" style="s2">and I I don&#39;t think anybody can say with</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.010" end="00:44:56.150" style="s2">certainty this is what the historical</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.930" end="00:44:58.580" style="s2">said hearted was doing and I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.150" end="00:45:00.550" style="s2">to endeavor to try and separate the myth</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.580" end="00:45:04.070" style="s2">and I told you how I use the word myth</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.550" end="00:45:05.810" style="s2">from the his the history I&#39;m gonna let</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.070" end="00:45:08.270" style="s2">them still remain seamlessly together</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.810" end="00:45:11.599" style="s2">because that&#39;s precisely how they are</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.270" end="00:45:13.040" style="s2">making an impact on the West so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.599" end="00:45:16.190" style="s2">story goes like this</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.040" end="00:45:20.030" style="s2">state hearta what when Siddhartha was</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.190" end="00:45:22.280" style="s2">born his father had all of the sages and</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.030" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">wise men come to his birth and it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.280" end="00:45:28.099" style="s2">prophesized foretold in sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:31.400" style="s2">oracle fashion that the boy had one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.099" end="00:45:36.380" style="s2">two possible futures one is he would be</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.400" end="00:45:38.420" style="s2">a great king or the other was he would</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.380" end="00:45:41.540" style="s2">enter religious life and be a really</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.420" end="00:45:45.560" style="s2">important religious figure the king</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.540" end="00:45:47.420" style="s2">being what all Kings are chose the</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.560" end="00:45:49.760" style="s2">former he wanted his son of course to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.420" end="00:45:51.680" style="s2">a great king and he decided in order to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.760" end="00:45:53.810" style="s2">do this he would try and remove all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.680" end="00:45:56.839" style="s2">the things that might trigger sit harder</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.810" end="00:45:59.150" style="s2">from pursuing a religious life a life</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.839" end="00:46:01.820" style="s2">devoted to the ideals of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.150" end="00:46:03.140" style="s2">revolution so what do you do if you do</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.820" end="00:46:05.119" style="s2">not want someone to go through the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.140" end="00:46:06.950" style="s2">actual revolution while you try and give</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.119" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">them all the benefits of the pre axial</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.950" end="00:46:11.810" style="s2">world you try and give them all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:13.670" style="s2">benefits of power and prosperity so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.810" end="00:46:16.820" style="s2">story goes that the King rigged things</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.670" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">so that said harden never saw anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.820" end="00:46:21.750" style="s2">distressing he was always surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:25.319" style="s2">beautiful women</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.750" end="00:46:32.730" style="s2">correct amount of food everything that</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.319" end="00:46:34.920" style="s2">he wanted and we can sort of just take</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.730" end="00:46:36.450" style="s2">that as it is or we can step back and do</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.920" end="00:46:37.380" style="s2">something that you should always do with</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.450" end="00:46:39.920" style="s2">things that have a methodological</p>

<p begin="00:46:49.799" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">about what the palace represents now a</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.559" end="00:46:56.880" style="s2">good way of getting at this right is</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:46:59.309" style="s2">Marcus Aurelius his famous quote that</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.880" end="00:47:02.970" style="s2">and this is how it goes it is possible</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.309" end="00:47:05.789" style="s2">to be happy even in a palace that tells</p>

<p begin="00:47:14.910" end="00:47:19.049" style="s2">we talk about stomachs like Marcus</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.049" end="00:47:24.510" style="s2">to this idea that I just explained to</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.510" end="00:47:31.109" style="s2">represents a particular existential mode</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.000" end="00:47:34.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a mythological way of trying to get</p>

<p begin="00:47:42.180" end="00:47:45.539" style="s2">so we&#39;re talking about the palace</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.559" end="00:47:47.670" style="s2">because we&#39;re talking about Siddhartha</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.539" end="00:47:50.190" style="s2">living in the palace what does this</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.670" end="00:47:51.930" style="s2">represent Fromm talks about two</p>

<p begin="00:47:51.930" end="00:47:56.970" style="s2">face again perennial patterns they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.289" end="00:48:01.980" style="s2">organized around two different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.970" end="00:48:06.809" style="s2">needs they&#39;re having needs and being</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.980" end="00:48:10.020" style="s2">needs so of course this mode is called</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.809" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">the having mode it&#39;s an existential mode</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.020" end="00:48:15.059" style="s2">it&#39;s a way in which you make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:19.619" style="s2">the world and make sense of yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.059" end="00:48:22.770" style="s2">this process of Co identification this</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.619" end="00:48:24.390" style="s2">is the being mode okay so having needs</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.770" end="00:48:26.069" style="s2">are needs that are met by having</p>

<p begin="00:48:34.970" end="00:48:43.290" style="s2">so my understanding of thing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.650" end="00:48:46.830" style="s2">categorical I put it in the correct</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.290" end="00:48:48.900" style="s2">category here&#39;s a cop like an idea it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.830" end="00:48:50.580" style="s2">like all the other cops it functions</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.900" end="00:48:52.860" style="s2">like another cop I can replace it with a</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.580" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">cop if this coin gets damaged it really</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.860" end="00:48:57.240" style="s2">improves my ability to control things I</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:48:59.070" style="s2">have this categorical way of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.240" end="00:49:01.530" style="s2">representing it and it&#39;s oriented</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.070" end="00:49:03.300" style="s2">towards me getting very effective</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.530" end="00:49:08.400" style="s2">efficient control over things because I</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.710" end="00:49:44.580" style="s2">mostly relying on here is my</p>
