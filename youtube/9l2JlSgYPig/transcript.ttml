<p begin="00:01:32.210" end="00:01:36.860" style="s2">yeah I played music for a long time then</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.340" end="00:01:38.509" style="s2">I got into some video production writing</p>

<p begin="00:02:06.140" end="00:02:10.160" style="s2">shift in your thinking or was it like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.729" end="00:02:13.730" style="s2">seed that grew or how did it work for</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.160" end="00:02:17.540" style="s2">you no it was pretty much cataclysmic I</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.730" end="00:02:19.340" style="s2">just saw you know how the world worked</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.540" end="00:02:21.440" style="s2">yeah I kind of knew a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.340" end="00:02:24.349" style="s2">the Baker&#39;s I didn&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.440" end="00:02:26.990" style="s2">the fractional reserve lending Ponzi</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.349" end="00:02:29.200" style="s2">scheme that they&#39;re controlling us with</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.990" end="00:02:32.630" style="s2">and once you learn that it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.200" end="00:02:34.130" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to stay still anymore once you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.630" end="00:02:36.200" style="s2">really know how we&#39;re being controlled</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.130" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">by the bankers and then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.200" end="00:02:42.110" style="s2">John Perkins thing with our foreign</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:43.700" style="s2">policy yeah yeah you can see that now of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.110" end="00:02:44.990" style="s2">those every country really we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.700" end="00:02:46.880" style="s2">going around stealing their resources</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.990" end="00:02:49.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.880" end="00:02:51.800" style="s2">you know about that and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.400" end="00:02:54.020" style="s2">the resource-based economy at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.800" end="00:02:56.420" style="s2">that yeah I was pretty much hooked into</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.020" end="00:02:59.060" style="s2">it and I was moving forward that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.420" end="00:03:01.819" style="s2">about the time 2011 I think I started</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.060" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">making videos I made the videos but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.819" end="00:03:05.030" style="s2">was not really serious at all it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">just trying to lay out the train of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.030" end="00:03:10.040" style="s2">thought the system works against us you</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:12.319" style="s2">know if we want to sell more pesticides</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.040" end="00:03:15.500" style="s2">or you know that&#39;s good for business</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:17.900" style="s2">it&#39;s horrible for people and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.500" end="00:03:20.299" style="s2">pharmaceuticals more kills to take</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.900" end="00:03:21.739" style="s2">that&#39;s horrible for people really is</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.299" end="00:03:23.600" style="s2">it&#39;s turning out but it&#39;s good for</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.739" end="00:03:24.709" style="s2">business so I&#39;m going to go through ten</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.600" end="00:03:26.120" style="s2">examples of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.709" end="00:03:29.660" style="s2">you know I built a house here enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.120" end="00:03:32.090" style="s2">I&#39;ve had to borrow against it and again</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.660" end="00:03:35.720" style="s2">a few times just to keep my head above</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.090" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">and just think of it how these bankers</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.720" end="00:03:40.280" style="s2">are just making up the money I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">know where you want us to pay him back</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.280" end="00:03:45.860" style="s2">with interest which is never created</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:47.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist and if you can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.860" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">they get your house they get your car</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.900" end="00:03:52.790" style="s2">but I understood it fairly quickly once</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:55.850" style="s2">I saw it laid out there of how really</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.790" end="00:03:58.609" style="s2">it&#39;s just a system to control people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.850" end="00:04:01.459" style="s2">put people into debt that they can you</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.609" end="00:04:03.109" style="s2">know never pay off you know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.459" end="00:04:05.750" style="s2">you may be lucky enough to pay it off</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.109" end="00:04:08.060" style="s2">but mostly it&#39;s just continually</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.750" end="00:04:11.569" style="s2">creating more debt and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.060" end="00:04:14.660" style="s2">borrow more to stay in the game and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.569" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">are just sucking the money out of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.660" end="00:04:18.650" style="s2">and controlling us like slaves now in</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.120" end="00:04:21.109" style="s2">this country that&#39;s you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.650" end="00:04:24.130" style="s2">student debt which is a one and a half</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.109" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">trillion dollars which is just so</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.130" end="00:04:29.630" style="s2">unconscionable that we&#39;re giving this</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:32.780" style="s2">money to bankers and putting our young</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.630" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">people in debt prison right off the bat</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.780" end="00:04:37.850" style="s2">people that have sort of been exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">the idea of the central banking fraud do</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.850" end="00:04:45.380" style="s2">you think that they appreciate the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:47.419" style="s2">the depth and the complexity of it if I</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.380" end="00:04:49.130" style="s2">try to explain it to people you know a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.419" end="00:04:51.380" style="s2">lot of times their eyes kind of glaze</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.130" end="00:04:54.349" style="s2">over after me I don&#39;t they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.380" end="00:04:57.140" style="s2">want to look into it or think about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.349" end="00:04:59.039" style="s2">too hard so some people will kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.140" end="00:05:01.439" style="s2">understand it a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.039" end="00:05:03.659" style="s2">just well this is just the way it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.439" end="00:05:06.330" style="s2">yeah you can&#39;t really do anything about</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.659" end="00:05:07.800" style="s2">it the reality of this love their</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.330" end="00:05:12.449" style="s2">slavery in the face right I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.800" end="00:05:15.180" style="s2">a hard thing yeah yes there&#39;s a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.449" end="00:05:18.330" style="s2">lack of education about the realities of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.180" end="00:05:21.449" style="s2">economics in our society deliberately so</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.330" end="00:05:25.789" style="s2">for obvious reasons right but but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.449" end="00:05:29.699" style="s2">real shocking lack yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.789" end="00:05:32.249" style="s2">Benjamin Franklin when he respect he was</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.699" end="00:05:34.649" style="s2">in France a couple decades before the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.249" end="00:05:37.740" style="s2">Revolution and the colonies were doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.649" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">great and people were asking about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.740" end="00:05:44.159" style="s2">newfound prosperity in the colonies how</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:47.580" style="s2">were you doing it and he said in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.159" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">colonies we create our own currency we</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.580" end="00:05:54.270" style="s2">make our own money and we made just</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:58.349" style="s2">enough to society have no interest to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.270" end="00:06:01.050" style="s2">pay to anyone and certainly after that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.349" end="00:06:03.809" style="s2">the King George and the bankers who</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.050" end="00:06:05.490" style="s2">really owned him they said no we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.809" end="00:06:08.219" style="s2">none of that you&#39;re gonna be on our</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.490" end="00:06:12.330" style="s2">money system you&#39;re gonna pay US taxes</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.219" end="00:06:16.199" style="s2">in gold and silver and he said within a</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.330" end="00:06:18.300" style="s2">year the conditions had reversed so</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.199" end="00:06:20.729" style="s2">dramatically from the prosperity that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.300" end="00:06:22.979" style="s2">now there were unemployed in the streets</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.729" end="00:06:24.959" style="s2">and you know once you get in the system</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.979" end="00:06:28.559" style="s2">where they&#39;re sucking and wealth out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.959" end="00:06:31.469" style="s2">him you know and he said the refusal of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.559" end="00:06:34.589" style="s2">King George to allow the colonies to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.469" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">operate an honest money system which</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.589" end="00:06:40.499" style="s2">freed the ordinary man from the clutches</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:42.719" style="s2">of the manipulators the money was</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.499" end="00:06:45.509" style="s2">probably the prime cause of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.719" end="00:06:47.449" style="s2">revolution so we never learned that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.509" end="00:06:49.949" style="s2">school that it was the bankers and their</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.449" end="00:06:52.949" style="s2">fractional reserve lending system it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.949" end="00:06:54.629" style="s2">probably the real reason you know we do</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.949" end="00:06:56.159" style="s2">it away it&#39;s just missed names right</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.629" end="00:06:57.990" style="s2">because no taxation without</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.159" end="00:06:59.789" style="s2">representation right that was there that</p>

<p begin="00:14:33.279" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">step by step trying to produce an</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.800" end="00:14:40.750" style="s2">abundance of one product and then the</p>

<p begin="00:18:24.620" end="00:18:29.540" style="s2">when we are forced to stick in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.930" end="00:18:31.850" style="s2">system work we&#39;re forced to fight each</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.540" end="00:18:33.350" style="s2">other that&#39;s what this is you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.850" end="00:18:36.710" style="s2">cutthroat competition</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.350" end="00:18:39.770" style="s2">to gain advantage over each other and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.710" end="00:18:41.690" style="s2">doesn&#39;t allow us to have any trust you</p>

<p begin="00:18:50.660" end="00:18:55.520" style="s2">know it&#39;s a system that produces</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.420" end="00:18:57.140" style="s2">selfishness and greed and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:19:00.110" style="s2">people say well this is human nature</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.140" end="00:19:03.050" style="s2">just look at us when we are able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.110" end="00:19:07.010" style="s2">collaborate when we can express our</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.050" end="00:19:08.810" style="s2">empathy and our compassion and you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.010" end="00:19:11.180" style="s2">to want to feel part of the community</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.810" end="00:19:12.560" style="s2">and be loved this is really our true</p>

<p begin="00:19:18.470" end="00:19:23.900" style="s2">do is move out of this competitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.810" end="00:19:25.790" style="s2">system move into a collaborative system</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.900" end="00:19:28.280" style="s2">where we&#39;re allowed to work together and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.790" end="00:19:30.680" style="s2">create an abundance and this is the only</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.280" end="00:19:32.210" style="s2">way out I think the charge that would</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.680" end="00:19:34.310" style="s2">get leveled at you certainly by the</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.210" end="00:19:36.440" style="s2">establishment is that you&#39;re unrealistic</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.310" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">you know what I mean this is a utopian</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.440" end="00:19:41.480" style="s2">vision you know it&#39;s a childlike fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:43.490" style="s2">you know there&#39;s you know there I&#39;m sure</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.490" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">this is what gets levelled at you and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.840" end="00:19:49.820" style="s2">unfortunately because they do control</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:53.360" style="s2">still a huge amount of the megaphone</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.820" end="00:19:56.300" style="s2">that people listen to this is this is in</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.360" end="00:19:58.460" style="s2">the minds of many many many good but</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.300" end="00:20:02.750" style="s2">conventional and not really that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.460" end="00:20:04.220" style="s2">know to people this is you get older</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.750" end="00:20:06.980" style="s2">you&#39;re a crackpot right you&#39;re you&#39;re a</p>

<p begin="00:22:05.670" end="00:22:09.600" style="s2">but it really is to most people right</p>

<p begin="00:22:33.360" end="00:22:39.900" style="s2">that as long as we&#39;re working under this</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.180" end="00:22:42.560" style="s2">constitution that&#39;s the Constitution is</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.900" end="00:22:45.620" style="s2">the playbook that&#39;s the rules</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.560" end="00:22:47.990" style="s2">of the game and you know if people in</p>

<p begin="00:22:58.370" end="00:23:03.680" style="s2">assists the structure of the government</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.020" end="00:23:06.220" style="s2">and so if we want the kind of change</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.680" end="00:23:08.600" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about we have to rewrite</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.220" end="00:23:11.840" style="s2">the Constitution we have to have an</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.600" end="00:23:14.360" style="s2">update we update everything else they</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.260" end="00:23:28.940" style="s2">it is dysfunctional and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.690" end="00:23:31.100" style="s2">Constitution that&#39;s the part we need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.940" end="00:23:33.590" style="s2">update again I come back to my question</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.100" end="00:23:35.600" style="s2">before where does the authority come to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.590" end="00:23:37.400" style="s2">create and impose that new Constitution</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.600" end="00:23:39.560" style="s2">I mean what your what you seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.400" end="00:23:40.520" style="s2">alluding to is revolution that&#39;s what I</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.080" end="00:23:45.740" style="s2">popular revolution where we say we we</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.630" end="00:23:47.330" style="s2">basically overthrow the gun whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.740" end="00:23:48.950" style="s2">violently or not but basically we</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.330" end="00:23:52.130" style="s2">overthrow the government in some way and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.950" end="00:23:53.630" style="s2">we install a new set of rules a new</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.130" end="00:23:54.020" style="s2">constitution that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.640" end="00:24:12.670" style="s2">lead here instead of having a society</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.130" end="00:24:15.890" style="s2">run a country run by bankers</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.670" end="00:24:19.070" style="s2">corporations military why not scientists</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.890" end="00:24:23.540" style="s2">and engineers futuristic nurses like</p>

<p begin="00:24:40.160" end="00:24:45.290" style="s2">what we want to do is have a</p>

<p begin="00:30:54.700" end="00:31:00.520" style="s2">but just let people continue with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.970" end="00:31:03.370" style="s2">same work but the people make the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.520" end="00:31:05.710" style="s2">decisions you know just get rid of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.370" end="00:31:06.940" style="s2">word through the core corporate and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.710" end="00:31:09.309" style="s2">says we have to overthrow the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.940" end="00:31:11.800" style="s2">corporation&#39;s and it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.309" end="00:31:14.800" style="s2">revolution it&#39;s scary to people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.800" end="00:31:16.690" style="s2">my transition a peaceful transition is</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.800" end="00:31:19.809" style="s2">better and when overthrow the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.690" end="00:31:21.040" style="s2">corporation&#39;s I like dissolve weakens</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.809" end="00:31:23.650" style="s2">where it doesn&#39;t have to it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.040" end="00:31:26.380" style="s2">to be violent right the right we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.650" end="00:31:30.280" style="s2">dissolve the corporation&#39;s and keep the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.380" end="00:31:33.820" style="s2">same structures in place what another</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.280" end="00:31:34.600" style="s2">way of saying get rid of corporations be</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.820" end="00:31:36.940" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.600" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">rid of the profit motive within the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.940" end="00:31:40.450" style="s2">doing of Commerce</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:42.850" style="s2">yeah the profit mode has to go really</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.450" end="00:31:46.150" style="s2">what it&#39;s about right I mean the issue</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.850" end="00:31:48.039" style="s2">is is that is the need to make primarily</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.150" end="00:31:50.169" style="s2">short-term profits at any cost because</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.039" end="00:31:51.880" style="s2">now the next quarters balance sheet is</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.169" end="00:31:53.890" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna determine my bonus this</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.880" end="00:31:57.160" style="s2">year you know it&#39;s that it&#39;s that kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.890" end="00:32:01.059" style="s2">of thinking that&#39;s when when we move</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.160" end="00:32:04.059" style="s2">from a competitive economic system to a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.059" end="00:32:07.720" style="s2">collaborative one the profit motive is</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.059" end="00:32:11.350" style="s2">gone in a collaborative society there</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.720" end="00:32:13.059" style="s2">yeah there is no profit motive and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.350" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">that has to be the big change we have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.059" end="00:32:19.750" style="s2">move from competitive to collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:21.610" style="s2">from corporate control to community</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.750" end="00:32:24.580" style="s2">control our being has to be at a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.610" end="00:32:27.760" style="s2">community level not to top-down anymore</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.580" end="00:32:29.980" style="s2">we control our own money system as long</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.760" end="00:32:31.570" style="s2">as we&#39;re going to need one so we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.980" end="00:32:33.820" style="s2">produce enough abundance we can get rid</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.570" end="00:32:36.669" style="s2">of it so we move from bankers to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.820" end="00:32:40.890" style="s2">community money from corporations to</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.669" end="00:32:45.850" style="s2">community control from competition to of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.890" end="00:32:47.890" style="s2">collaboration and from 40 hours we extol</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.850" end="00:32:51.580" style="s2">property to open sourcing and everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.890" end="00:32:55.270" style="s2">and so yeah that&#39;s absolutely my I keep</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.580" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">coming back to where does the pressure</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.270" end="00:32:59.799" style="s2">for these changes to occur come from and</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:01.960" style="s2">put this correct me if I&#39;m putting words</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.799" end="00:33:05.200" style="s2">into your mouth but I are you basically</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.960" end="00:33:06.610" style="s2">saying that it&#39;s a process of Education</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.200" end="00:33:10.260" style="s2">and the when sufficient number of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.610" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">are educated then this rejection of</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.260" end="00:33:14.890" style="s2">corporation and government and central</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:16.570" style="s2">banking will come about on its own is</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.890" end="00:33:17.409" style="s2">that is that basically where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.570" end="00:33:19.030" style="s2">coming from</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.409" end="00:33:21.460" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re gonna have to get a vision</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.030" end="00:33:24.549" style="s2">of what it could be like they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.460" end="00:33:25.900" style="s2">have to be able to see it right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.549" end="00:33:28.090" style="s2">our job is to provide them with that</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.900" end="00:33:29.500" style="s2">vision yeah I know Carolyn was talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.090" end="00:33:32.350" style="s2">about you know trying to make a movie</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.500" end="00:33:34.090" style="s2">and TV t British project has been</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.350" end="00:33:35.950" style="s2">talking about trying to make a movie as</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.090" end="00:33:37.929" style="s2">a way to get it in front of the people</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.950" end="00:33:41.110" style="s2">that people see what this could look</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.929" end="00:33:43.240" style="s2">like and Peter Joseph&#39;s project they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.110" end="00:33:47.080" style="s2">working on forever here is going to try</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.240" end="00:33:49.330" style="s2">to do that but it&#39;s so much harder to</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.080" end="00:33:52.270" style="s2">put together a</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.330" end="00:33:54.600" style="s2">a movie project as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.270" end="00:33:57.159" style="s2">documentary and I&#39;ve often thought about</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.600" end="00:33:58.929" style="s2">how how could you present it</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.159" end="00:34:01.210" style="s2">we&#39;ve get it getting a story to get</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.929" end="00:34:04.330" style="s2">people involved and letting them see</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.210" end="00:34:08.200" style="s2">then you need to just have this society</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.330" end="00:34:10.090" style="s2">as a backdrop sort of to the story this</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.200" end="00:34:13.690" style="s2">is always where I get stuck you know I</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.090" end="00:34:15.460" style="s2">mean III the the vision is is is clear</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.690" end="00:34:17.730" style="s2">in my head the problems here are clear</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.460" end="00:34:22.179" style="s2">in my head but the mechanism by which</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.730" end="00:34:23.530" style="s2">you create the demands for the change</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.179" end="00:34:25.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the only way it comes about right</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.530" end="00:34:27.429" style="s2">there is sufficient demand in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.000" end="00:34:29.169" style="s2">population the thing of that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.429" end="00:34:33.879" style="s2">way it comes about we&#39;re going to say to</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.169" end="00:34:36.820" style="s2">people how badly do you want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.879" end="00:34:38.889" style="s2">to actually take care of this planet so</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.820" end="00:34:41.500" style="s2">that your kids can have a decent world</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.889" end="00:34:43.690" style="s2">how badly do you want to get debt-free</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.500" end="00:34:45.639" style="s2">and never be fighting about money again</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.690" end="00:34:48.429" style="s2">how badly do you want to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.639" end="00:34:52.659" style="s2">sending our you know having a world at</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.429" end="00:34:59.650" style="s2">peace if you want to do this then let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.659" end="00:35:02.619" style="s2">elect a system that will enable that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.650" end="00:35:04.839" style="s2">so electing a new system and that&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.619" end="00:35:06.849" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna do it that way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.839" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">going to be a revolution so we really</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.849" end="00:35:12.430" style="s2">have to get into localizing all as much</p>
