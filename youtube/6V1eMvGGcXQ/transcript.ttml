<p begin="00:00:11.549" end="00:00:13.330" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.330" end="00:00:16.680" style="s2">Started that I started the beginning of the class</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.460" end="00:00:20.699" style="s2">three months ago talking to you about</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.329" end="00:00:26.429" style="s2">What it what the problem was that I was trying to address?</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.399" end="00:00:29.020" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.020" end="00:00:32.219" style="s2">The fundamental problem was the problem of belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.860" end="00:00:34.860" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.870" end="00:00:36.870" style="s2">the issue is was</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.800" end="00:00:41.340" style="s2">what precisely constitutes a belief system and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.360" end="00:00:49.290" style="s2">Then a secondary question was why are people so inclined to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.920" end="00:00:55.080" style="s2">even engage in conflict to Maintain and Expand their belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.800" end="00:01:02.759" style="s2">and then maybe a sub question of that and is there an alternative to conflict with regards to belief systems and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.909" end="00:01:05.909" style="s2">then the last issue</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.820" end="00:01:11.549" style="s2">Was something like well. Is there a way of judging the relative quality of belief systems?</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.520" end="00:01:15.299" style="s2">And so those are all very very complicated questions, I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.329" end="00:01:19.888" style="s2">mean the first one is something like</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.189" end="00:01:27.839" style="s2">How is it possible to understand the structures by which we orient ourselves in the world the second one is something like</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.189" end="00:01:32.699" style="s2">What&#39;s the pSychological significance?</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.609" end="00:01:36.839" style="s2">Precisely of those systems. What role does it play in?</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.569" end="00:01:40.499" style="s2">psychological health and maybe also in Social health</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.529" end="00:01:43.529" style="s2">the next one is</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.249" end="00:01:51.778" style="s2">can you make a [non] [relativistic] case when you assess an array of different value systems and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.439" end="00:01:55.979" style="s2">then link to that is is it possible to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.340" end="00:02:00.329" style="s2">hierarchically organized value systems in</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.849" end="00:02:06.029" style="s2">The manner that&#39;s justifiable, so that something can be reasonably considered in</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.549" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">a superior or subordinate position</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">now the last question</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.690" end="00:02:18.989" style="s2">Drew my attention because because of the implications of the first set and the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.290" end="00:02:22.859" style="s2">question drew my attention because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.280" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">Was trying to sort out the metaphysics in some sense of the cold war?</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.700" end="00:02:34.710" style="s2">the question was was this just a battleground between</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.460" end="00:02:38.820" style="s2">two hypothetically equally</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:47.250" style="s2">appropriate belief systems which would could be a morally immoral relativistic perspective right it&#39;s belief systems are arbitrary and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.070" end="00:02:54.899" style="s2">So combat between them is in some sense inevitable and even more to the point there isn&#39;t any other way</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.210" end="00:02:57.100" style="s2">around the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.100" end="00:02:59.189" style="s2">discontinuity in some sense other than</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.250" end="00:03:01.780" style="s2">combat or</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.780" end="00:03:03.780" style="s2">subordination because there&#39;s no way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.360" end="00:03:06.340" style="s2">adjudicating a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.340" end="00:03:12.060" style="s2">Victor because there&#39;s no such thing as victory if there&#39;s no way of ranking value systems. It&#39;s arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.700" end="00:03:17.550" style="s2">As a frightening prospect because it means that if you have a value system, and I have a value system</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.550" end="00:03:18.870" style="s2">And they&#39;re different and they&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.870" end="00:03:23.460" style="s2">[I] mean we can talk or you can subordinate yourself, or I could do the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.590" end="00:03:27.300" style="s2">But there&#39;s also no [reason] why we shouldn&#39;t just engage in Flat-out</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.209" end="00:03:30.100" style="s2">Conflict</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.100" end="00:03:35.700" style="s2">now it&#39;s complicated in the modern world obviously by the fact that conflict can become so</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:42.570" style="s2">[untraveled] that it risks destroying everything and that doesn&#39;t seem necessarily to be in anyone&#39;s best interest unless</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.030" end="00:03:50.280" style="s2">Your interest haps happens to be in destroying everything and certainly there are no shortage of people whose interests tilt in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.930" end="00:03:57.959" style="s2">Alright, so the first question was well. What does it mean to have a belief [system] and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.830" end="00:04:02.850" style="s2">That&#39;s a very complicated problem, and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.620" end="00:04:09.300" style="s2">It&#39;s a subset of the question of being</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.830" end="00:04:14.489" style="s2">Maybe you can break the question of being into two</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.220" end="00:04:16.900" style="s2">domains</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.900" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">Which we&#39;ve done in this class, and you could say well, you can assess being</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.190" end="00:04:26.399" style="s2">From the perspective of what exists and then you can assess being from the perspective of how?</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.980" end="00:04:28.450" style="s2">You ought to act?</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.450" end="00:04:34.049" style="s2">so it&#39;s like you walk into a room and you can describe the furniture or</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.660" end="00:04:37.830" style="s2">You can determine how your going to conduct yourself in the room</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.380" end="00:04:42.840" style="s2">Maybe it&#39;s the difference between a play and the stage setting for a play now</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.960" end="00:04:45.960" style="s2">the Modernist</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.060" end="00:04:52.169" style="s2">Perspectives Roughly speaking is that the fundamental reality is to be found in the description of the furniture?</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.330" end="00:04:56.069" style="s2">So to speak in the description of what is that&#39;s the scientific?</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.840" end="00:05:00.250" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.250" end="00:05:02.699" style="s2">[and] the scientific process seems to involve</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.790" end="00:05:05.970" style="s2">the stripping off of the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.730" end="00:05:09.870" style="s2">from perception and to some degree from action and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.660" end="00:05:13.049" style="s2">the extraction of the commonalities across</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.870" end="00:05:15.989" style="s2">perception as a means of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.500" end="00:05:19.559" style="s2">delineating the Nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.200" end="00:05:22.860" style="s2">Now obviously that&#39;s a [very] powerful</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.500" end="00:05:27.569" style="s2">process, and it has many advantages, but exactly what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.150" end="00:05:32.729" style="s2">science is doing is not precisely clear one perspective might be is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.250" end="00:05:34.570" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.570" end="00:05:36.570" style="s2">genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.140" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">Discovering the Nature of objective reality [and] perhaps even the nature of reality itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.000" end="00:05:44.590" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.590" end="00:05:46.590" style="s2">There are some problems with that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.560" end="00:05:49.560" style="s2">one of them being that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.740" end="00:05:57.960" style="s2">The scientific process seems to strip the subjective from the phenomena. It does that technically right?</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.960" end="00:06:02.789" style="s2">I mean you have [a] hypothesis about what something is and you have a hypothesis about what something is and you have [a]</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.980" end="00:06:08.819" style="s2">hypothesis [about] some [what] something is and we undertake a number of procedures to assess what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.250" end="00:06:14.550" style="s2">Fundamental phenomena is and then we look across our perceptual set and we extract out the commonalities</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.550" end="00:06:19.349" style="s2">And we dispense with everything that is superfluous everything that&#39;s merely subjective</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.420" end="00:06:25.949" style="s2">So what you feel about the chair is not relevant to the objective existence of the chair and so it</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.350" end="00:06:32.249" style="s2">eradicate subjectivity, and that&#39;s a very useful process because it does seem to enable us to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.160" end="00:06:41.069" style="s2">Grasp reality in a fundamental sense more profoundly, but it leaves the subjective behind and maybe that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:49.458" style="s2">Because it annoys okay, okay? Thank you. [what] [if] I just didn&#39;t alright appreciate it, so</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.469" end="00:06:58.638" style="s2">so then the issue might [be] well is something you retrieve ibly lost if you dispense with this objective and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.699" end="00:07:01.589" style="s2">also, how</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.589" end="00:07:04.638" style="s2">Deep a hole do you dig when you dispense with this objective?</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.719" end="00:07:08.279" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.279" end="00:07:10.019" style="s2">I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.019" end="00:07:11.249" style="s2">intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.249" end="00:07:12.809" style="s2">associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.809" end="00:07:15.379" style="s2">Problem of the relationship between is [an] [dot]</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.019" end="00:07:17.219" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.219" end="00:07:19.219" style="s2">That&#39;s an old</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.289" end="00:07:23.419" style="s2">Philosophical conundrum, I think first put forth by D. David hume</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.149" end="00:07:26.149" style="s2">Who made the claim that?</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.219" end="00:07:29.208" style="s2">No matter how much you know about something from an empirical perspective?</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.789" end="00:07:34.488" style="s2">You cannot use that as an unerring guide to action in relationship to that?</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.159" end="00:07:41.868" style="s2">To that empirical object or set of empirical objects and people it&#39;s a tricky [issue]. You know because obviously you can use empirical</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.599" end="00:07:44.599" style="s2">information to inform your decisions</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.619" end="00:07:48.619" style="s2">But I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.689" end="00:07:55.008" style="s2">But the problem is is that there&#39;s multiple pathways of action that are implied by any set of data that seems to be the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.009" end="00:07:57.949" style="s2">Problem, it&#39;s something like that. Is that you can&#39;t draw a one-To-one</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.499" end="00:08:05.388" style="s2">Specification between the empirical district description and what you should do about that and like maybe an [example] is</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.999" end="00:08:08.208" style="s2">But you can gather a lot of information about aids</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.209" end="00:08:13.309" style="s2">and you can gather a lot of information about cancer and you can gather a lot of information about educational outcomes and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.679" end="00:08:17.988" style="s2">Economic outcomes and so forth but it isn&#39;t obvious. How you then use that?</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.539" end="00:08:20.219" style="s2">empirical information</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.219" end="00:08:24.588" style="s2">For example how to guide policy decisions because you might say well, how much money should we spend on education?</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.899" end="00:08:31.309" style="s2">compared to cancer prevention and how much money should be spent on cancer prevention compared to curing aids and or</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.189" end="00:08:36.678" style="s2">Addressing disease in the third-world country what happens is that the set of variables that you?</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.019" end="00:08:43.068" style="s2">Encounter while trying to make your empirical calculation get to be so massive so rapidly that there doesn&#39;t seem to be any</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.349" end="00:08:48.888" style="s2">Logical way of linking them to a behavioral outcome now. It&#39;s kind of associated with the postmodern conundrum as well</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.889" end="00:08:53.209" style="s2">Which is well if you have a set of data, and it could be a literary work without better</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.339" end="00:08:57.498" style="s2">There&#39;s a very large number of interpretations that you can derive from [that] set of data</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.499" end="00:09:00.469" style="s2">And there&#39;s no simple way of deciding which one is going to be canonical</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.470" end="00:09:07.009" style="s2">and so it isn&#39;t it I think the reason that you can&#39;t derive a naught from an is is because you run into something like</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.319" end="00:09:11.329" style="s2">Combinatorial explosion it&#39;s like you have an infinite [number] of facts at your disposal</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.459" end="00:09:16.128" style="s2">Roughly speaking and then another infinite number of ways that you can organize those facts and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.829" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">massive array of facts and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.939" end="00:09:25.399" style="s2">[Andrey] categorized facts doesn&#39;t tell you what to do in a given situation</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.559" end="00:09:32.089" style="s2">and so maybe the question of what to do in a given situation is a different domain of question and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.970" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">I believe that to be the [case]. I think it was Stephen Jay gould who talked about religion and science as</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.220" end="00:09:43.220" style="s2">- I think he called them different</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.350" end="00:09:49.670" style="s2">Magisterium to different fundamental domains that and that each had their realm of operation and one was the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.040" end="00:09:57.110" style="s2">description of the objective world obviously that&#39;s on the scientific end and the other was the realm of ethics and so you could put</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.639" end="00:10:10.639" style="s2">because I don&#39;t see a</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.920" end="00:10:12.779" style="s2">[straightforward] way of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.779" end="00:10:17.989" style="s2">Taking a set of facts and then transforming them into a behavioral compulsion</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:23.990" style="s2">then I do think that these two [things] are reasonably regarded as overlapping and</p>

<p begin="00:10:53.279" end="00:10:55.279" style="s2">psychological and sociological</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.509" end="00:11:00.498" style="s2">phenomena that are associated with a Moral stance</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.539" end="00:11:10.408" style="s2">[Howhow] would you understand the details of that and then even more to the point is there any way of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.349" end="00:11:15.718" style="s2">subjecting different sets of ethical interpretation to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.269" end="00:11:20.908" style="s2">Testing so that you can judge their comparative validity because that&#39;s sort of the way out of Moral relativism</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.759" end="00:11:23.759" style="s2">Roughly speaking. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.359" end="00:11:30.359" style="s2">First you make the proposition that there are value structures and that they&#39;re independent from empirical investigation</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.359" end="00:11:37.439" style="s2">and then the next is that you investigate the possibility that you can compare and contrast different structures of ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.019" end="00:11:41.008" style="s2">Draw some sort of conclusion. That&#39;s not merely arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.829" end="00:11:45.688" style="s2">Now it might be turtles all the way down. That&#39;s how the old joke goes right, but</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.999" end="00:11:51.358" style="s2">But maybe not then I was interested in that again because I thought well are we fighting the cold war</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.679" end="00:11:55.949" style="s2">merely because we&#39;re having an argument or</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.269" end="00:11:59.499" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.499" end="00:12:01.299" style="s2">there some</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.299" end="00:12:06.629" style="s2">Manner in which one of these systems can be just determined to be wrong and of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.959" end="00:12:10.378" style="s2">There was more weight behind that query</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.139" end="00:12:12.819" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.819" end="00:12:18.509" style="s2">The soviet system and the maoist system and and the system. That&#39;s in place in North Korea</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.149" end="00:12:20.589" style="s2">were not only</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.589" end="00:12:27.328" style="s2">Predicated on different assumptions than in the western system, but they were also extraordinarily murderous and so that seemed to add additional</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.269" end="00:12:30.718" style="s2">Weight [to] the to the sequence of questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.069" end="00:12:35.069" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.770" end="00:12:42.449" style="s2">I was reading young at the time and young was carl young was</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.000" end="00:12:46.859" style="s2">fundamentally I would say a psychologist of narrative of story and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.380" end="00:12:48.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.760" end="00:12:50.789" style="s2">He he outlined this</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.820" end="00:12:54.359" style="s2">He outlined the idea for me that</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:57.599" style="s2">people inhabited Stories Roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:01.980" style="s2">He said actually they inhabited myths and even more to the point whether they knew it or not</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.200" end="00:13:06.269" style="s2">They inhabited archetypal myths or even that they were possessed by them</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.270" end="00:13:11.910" style="s2">And so it was the first time I&#39;d really come into contact with the idea directly put that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.820" end="00:13:14.879" style="s2">there was a direct relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.640" end="00:13:19.019" style="s2">structures that you use to orient yourself in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.810" end="00:13:22.469" style="s2">stories, and so then I started to</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.110" end="00:13:24.220" style="s2">assess</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.220" end="00:13:27.899" style="s2">the fundamental elements of stories what what - story looked like and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:32.669" style="s2">while I was doing that that was informed by a number of other things that I was reading about including a</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.210" end="00:13:36.210" style="s2">set of I</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.400" end="00:13:41.910" style="s2">Read the Neuroscience literature with regards to information processing fairly extensively</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.300" end="00:13:49.289" style="s2">And that introduced me [into] a whole set of other ideas including cybernetic ideas which have been incorporated into what I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.570" end="00:13:52.200" style="s2">describing to you, and this basic cybernetic system is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.990" end="00:13:56.159" style="s2">system [that] has [a] starting point in a system that [has] an [endpoint] and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.680" end="00:14:02.130" style="s2">A system that has a subsystem that monitors progress or deviation from progress</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.590" end="00:14:05.970" style="s2">Along the pathway to the endpoint, and I thought well [that] looks a lot like a story</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.490" end="00:14:09.870" style="s2">Or a map that&#39;s another way of thinking about it, and I thought okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.870" end="00:14:14.789" style="s2">Well that&#39;s where the overlap is and the fundamental story is something like it&#39;s very [straightforward]. It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.730" end="00:14:19.980" style="s2">it&#39;s also the frame that you inhabit when you conceptualize the world and narrow and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.350" end="00:14:25.469" style="s2">Narrow and simplify the world which you have to do because it&#39;s so complex because you have this infinite number of facts that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:33.510" style="s2">Are laying around you well so what are you doing? Well? You&#39;re a mobile creature a living creature not a static information processor and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.330" end="00:14:38.279" style="s2">You&#39;re targeted you&#39;re a targeted creature, and otherwise you wouldn&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.920" end="00:14:44.670" style="s2">Right to move is to be a targeted creature because you have to move towards something or away from something so the targeting is built</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.670" end="00:14:47.399" style="s2">Right into the fact that you&#39;re a mobile creature, and then you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.400" end="00:14:50.639" style="s2">What do you target [and] answer to that is well, you target?</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.209" end="00:14:54.058" style="s2">Target you could say you target what you aim for but?</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.309" end="00:14:58.979" style="s2">Then you could say well you you aim for what you want you target your desires</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.980" end="00:15:06.119" style="s2">And then that leads you into a discussion of the underlying neurobiology essentially you bring to the table a set of inbuilt</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.699" end="00:15:08.699" style="s2">desires and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.790" end="00:15:11.790" style="s2">the targets that you pick</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.829" end="00:15:17.489" style="s2">Have to address the fact that those desires exist and the desires are actually grounded in Necessity</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.490" end="00:15:23.519" style="s2">and this is this is a sidebar, but this is where I think piaget theory is weaker than it should be because</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.189" end="00:15:28.409" style="s2">piaget and you know I&#39;m a great admirer of piaget believed that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.050" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">Human infant came into the world with a fairly primordial set of reflexes mostly sensory motor reflexes and then bootstrapped</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.619" end="00:15:41.099" style="s2">Him or herself up on the basis of those reflexes in the sociological in</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.860" end="00:15:43.860" style="s2">the Social Surroundings</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.649" end="00:15:48.688" style="s2">Viewpoint [that] the child comes in with a few basic elements that can get it going</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.149" end="00:15:52.979" style="s2">elements of exploration and memory essentially and then it builds itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.259" end="00:15:58.829" style="s2">Of the consequence of its exploration in the social community now. I think that&#39;s true except that</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.920" end="00:16:02.879" style="s2">It&#39;s too empty because what it fails to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.600" end="00:16:07.199" style="s2">take into [consideration] is the fact that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.839" end="00:16:14.849" style="s2">I think this is this is an observation in some sense philosophically that was first made by immanuel, Kant when he criticized pure reason</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.220" end="00:16:16.839" style="s2">so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.839" end="00:16:21.448" style="s2">You can&#39;t come into the world structureless you have to come into the world with an inbuilt structure</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.449" end="00:16:23.729" style="s2">And then it&#39;s the interaction of [that] structure with the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.339" end="00:16:29.938" style="s2">That provides the information that you can use to build yourself, but the structure has to be there</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.939" end="00:16:35.399" style="s2">And I would say that&#39;s the sameness logically speaking as the idea that the [great] [father] is always there, right?</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.399" end="00:16:39.688" style="s2">There&#39;s the great mother is always there. That&#39;s Chaos itself the great father is always there that&#39;s order</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.689" end="00:16:45.719" style="s2">That&#39;s the interpretive structure that you use to interact with the Chaos and then of course the individual is always there at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.720" end="00:16:48.329" style="s2">that piaget in some sense ree-ree</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.480" end="00:16:51.160" style="s2">told that story</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.160" end="00:16:52.389" style="s2">except</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.389" end="00:16:54.220" style="s2">He didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.220" end="00:17:00.389" style="s2">give enough credence to the fact that the infant comes into the world far [more] fully formed than</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.029" end="00:17:03.029" style="s2">his theory</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.829" end="00:17:08.168" style="s2">His theory presumes now the problem see that the problem with that is [that]</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.049" end="00:17:16.989" style="s2">Without that additional underlying set of let&#39;s call them neurobiological constraints the interpretation universe gets too large you</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.630" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">[need] constraints to narrow</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.510" end="00:17:28.059" style="s2">The domain of phenomena that you&#39;re contending with and and it&#39;s in the analysis of the constraints that the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.760" end="00:17:33.819" style="s2">How do you stop drowning in an infinite number of Potential interpretations emerges?</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.850" end="00:17:37.000" style="s2">The interpretations are subject to constraints</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:40.059" style="s2">And that&#39;s also the way out of the Moral relativist</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.490" end="00:17:44.049" style="s2">Paradox as far as I can tell now one of the things I really liked about Piaget was that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.570" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">He describes some of the constraints one of the constraints was is well</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.909" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">if I&#39;m going to exist in a social world</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:55.689" style="s2">And I&#39;m going [to] because I won&#39;t exist at all if I don&#39;t exist in a social world</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.970" end="00:17:59.380" style="s2">then there are constraints on the way that I have to interact with other people and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.140" end="00:18:04.299" style="s2">Piaget is essential point was I have to organize myself</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.880" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">To play a joint game with you</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.250" end="00:18:10.659" style="s2">But the Joint game has constraints and one of them is you have to want to play?</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.090" end="00:18:14.079" style="s2">Because you have other options [and] then there are other constraints</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.710" end="00:18:20.529" style="s2">You and I have to be able to play in a way that other people don&#39;t object to or maybe even that you and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.529" end="00:18:22.490" style="s2">Have to play in a way that other people</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.490" end="00:18:24.169" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.169" end="00:18:25.059" style="s2">look support</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.059" end="00:18:27.759" style="s2">and then you can imagine another constraint which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.919" end="00:18:32.589" style="s2">You and I have to play a game in a way that other [people] would support that will last more than the moment</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.809" end="00:18:38.199" style="s2">So it has it has to work today and tomorrow and next week it has to work across the span [of] times it has [to]</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.200" end="00:18:39.039" style="s2">Work not only for you</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.039" end="00:18:43.239" style="s2">And I but it has to work for our future [cells] and so the damn constraints are starting to pile up</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.240" end="00:18:46.779" style="s2">That&#39;s just on the socio-Cultural side that&#39;s on the constructionist side only</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.389" end="00:18:53.679" style="s2">But there&#39;s about the biological constraints are equally important because not only does the [game] that you and I have to play</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.960" end="00:18:55.789" style="s2">Have to satisfy those</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.789" end="00:18:57.020" style="s2">emergent</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.020" end="00:19:03.459" style="s2">sociological constraints, but the game also has to be organized so that the internal polity that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.039" end="00:19:05.929" style="s2">that&#39;s composed of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.929" end="00:19:10.359" style="s2">Let&#39;s call them the fundamental motivational and emotional systems that make that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.630" end="00:19:18.070" style="s2">Constitute us. They have to all find satisfaction because otherwise the system grounds halt [and] so</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.590" end="00:19:24.310" style="s2">This seems to me to be the beginnings of an answer to the postmodern conundrum looks like okay?</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.680" end="00:19:29.229" style="s2">Any set of facts is amenable to an infinite [number] of interpretations fine got it</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.660" end="00:19:36.910" style="s2">That makes deriving and is from an [Oauth2] very difficult endeavor right no problem. [all] right, but that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.430" end="00:19:39.430" style="s2">Doesn&#39;t mean that any old solution will work</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.370" end="00:19:45.010" style="s2">why well first of all it&#39;s merely because we introduced work into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.620" end="00:19:50.589" style="s2">Conversation to begin with the interpretation has to be functional and again. That&#39;s what it seems</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.660" end="00:19:53.739" style="s2">That&#39;s what seems to tie. It back to the story. This is also</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.740" end="00:19:58.780" style="s2">what got me interested in pragmatism, technically speaking and so because if if</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.450" end="00:20:03.220" style="s2">your conundrum is here you are and there you have to be and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.560" end="00:20:08.589" style="s2">How to get there then one of the constraints on the Manner in which you interpret the world is</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.650" end="00:20:11.620" style="s2">When you apply your interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.620" end="00:20:15.729" style="s2">Do you end up moving from the point you&#39;re at to the point you want to be and if the answer that is no?</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.100" end="00:20:21.760" style="s2">Then the solution is insufficient now. You could call the solution untrue, but I it&#39;s dangerous, too</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.310" end="00:20:24.310" style="s2">to introduce the truth</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.860" end="00:20:31.449" style="s2">Falsity Dilemma because because it isn&#39;t its functionality more its functionality more than truth although</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.450" end="00:20:33.910" style="s2">I think you could say that in the final analysis truth</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.910" end="00:20:35.440" style="s2">Is integrally linked to function?</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.440" end="00:20:39.099" style="s2">But I&#39;m not going to touch that question for the time being the point is is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.560" end="00:20:45.789" style="s2">your interpretation of the world carries within it implicitly a theory about its own validity and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.190" end="00:20:50.739" style="s2">Theory about its own validity is that if you enacted in the world it will produce the result that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:57.550" style="s2">Desire and then the consequence of that is [that] if it doesn&#39;t produce the result that you desire then it isn&#39;t good enough theory</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.770" end="00:21:00.699" style="s2">period and that&#39;s how you grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:07.989" style="s2">The fact that although you don&#39;t know everything you still have to orient yourself in the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:14.860" style="s2">You lay out partial theories that make partial predictions, and if they do a good enough job</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.930" end="00:21:18.190" style="s2">Then you don&#39;t worry about it [any] more and you go on to the next thing, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.190" end="00:21:22.269" style="s2">So then you think there&#39;s a lot of constraints piling up on your interpretations number one</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.850" end="00:21:28.390" style="s2">They have to work for [the] creature that you are and so you know we can lay it sort of like maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.550" end="00:21:35.499" style="s2">something like that&#39;s not exactly the same because I don&#39;t [think] [that] he got the hierarchy right for for very complex reasons, but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">reasonably obvious to to</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.180" end="00:21:42.279" style="s2">Observe that well you&#39;re not going to work out very well if you don&#39;t have anything to eat</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.280" end="00:21:47.290" style="s2">And you know you&#39;ve got about a week in you if you don&#39;t have anything to drink and obviously you need shelter</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.290" end="00:21:53.199" style="s2">And you know you need you need companionship and by need what I mean is that if you don&#39;t have these things then you die</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.200" end="00:21:56.500" style="s2">The whole game comes to a halt [so] we can ground that in?</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.320" end="00:22:04.929" style="s2">Self-evident reality without any real problem, and you might say well, what&#39;s the list of human necessities and that that&#39;s that&#39;s a difficult thing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.510" end="00:22:06.650" style="s2">parameterize</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.650" end="00:22:12.609" style="s2">Because you can argue about the degree to which something is necessary, but there&#39;s some things that we know about</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.490" end="00:22:15.490" style="s2">Well, we covered the basics</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:22.839" style="s2">Temperature regulation elimination food intake shelter right, but then there&#39;s more subtle things like well</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.559" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">children for example died without touch</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.080" end="00:22:29.199" style="s2">So there&#39;s there&#39;s something integral about</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.230" end="00:22:35.110" style="s2">Tactile interaction with other people so we could call that love if you want to do that. It&#39;s not optional</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.660" end="00:22:37.660" style="s2">Right play is the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.960" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">children do not develop properly</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.570" end="00:22:43.309" style="s2">unless they play and</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.309" end="00:22:48.909" style="s2">I would say that adults also can&#39;t maintain their mental health or physical health unless they play, [too]</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.910" end="00:22:55.329" style="s2">And so you can say well, there&#39;s a core set of necessities, and then off of that. There&#39;s a secondary set of like</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.690" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">What would you call them their own ultimate necessities?</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:06.160" style="s2">But they&#39;re pretty hot they&#39;re going to be pretty highly valued by people and more or less universally pain avoidance for example under most circumstances</p>

<p begin="00:23:11.620" end="00:23:13.750" style="s2">You know you can lay out the basic emotions</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.750" end="00:23:15.340" style="s2">You can lay out the basic motivations</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.340" end="00:23:19.390" style="s2">And you can say well the [game] that you&#39;re going to play has to operate within a space</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.390" end="00:23:25.329" style="s2">That&#39;s defined by that set of a priori constraints fine now things are getting [pretty] constrained here</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.330" end="00:23:29.470" style="s2">so they had the game you play house to satisfy that set of</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.710" end="00:23:32.710" style="s2">biological demands</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.080" end="00:23:39.069" style="s2">Intrinsic biological demands and it has to be something that you can utilize with other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.160" end="00:23:46.359" style="s2">Voluntarily and it has to be something that will [be] playable across multiple iterations, and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:49.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a very limited number of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.120" end="00:23:57.130" style="s2">Interpretive interpretive structures that are going to satisfy all of those preconditions simultaneously, and to me that just blows out</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.860" end="00:24:03.939" style="s2">The two things it blows out the claims of Moral relativism, and it it it also</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.520" end="00:24:09.879" style="s2">Demolishes and this is the same thing in some sense it demolishes this ideas that the manner in which people</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.070" end="00:24:13.900" style="s2">Organize themselves in the world as individuals and in societies is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.480" end="00:24:15.530" style="s2">arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.530" end="00:24:17.829" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look to me to be arbitrary at all and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.530" end="00:24:25.329" style="s2">So in ampere days genius. I think in some part was observing that in children spontaneously in that when children</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:32.410" style="s2">passed the egocentric phase which means after they&#39;re about two years of old old, [they&#39;re] maybe [they&#39;re]</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.740" end="00:24:41.109" style="s2">What they&#39;re approaching three years old they&#39;ve more or less got their internal mechanisms organized so that there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.630" end="00:24:43.309" style="s2">unitary being</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.309" end="00:24:45.309" style="s2">Roughly speaking at</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.320" end="00:24:50.020" style="s2">Three they start to develop the ability to use fictional frames of reference</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:54.520" style="s2">So and that&#39;s an interesting thing because I would say that the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.950" end="00:24:59.860" style="s2">biological systems come armed with their own frame of reference, so [if] you&#39;re hungry</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.500" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">Poof up comes [a] frame of reference [and] within that</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.480" end="00:25:10.209" style="s2">Your perceptions are shaped the action proclivities are are</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.540" end="00:25:13.160" style="s2">primed and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.160" end="00:25:15.309" style="s2">The world lays itself out around that particular</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.710" end="00:25:20.049" style="s2">Biological Necessity and you can lay those out same if you&#39;re thirsty same if you&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.049" end="00:25:23.168" style="s2">Hot same if you want to play all those systems come</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.929" end="00:25:27.369" style="s2">built in but then the problem with that is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:31.749" style="s2">they compete because it isn&#39;t obvious which one should take priority and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.910" end="00:25:34.329" style="s2">It&#39;s not that easy to organize them in a social space</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.330" end="00:25:37.750" style="s2">[and] so what seems to have happened to human beings is that we&#39;ve been able to replace</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.270" end="00:25:40.270" style="s2">the frame that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.880" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">predicated on</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:48.548" style="s2">motivational necessity with abstracted frames that are more voluntary voluntarily constructed that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.860" end="00:25:51.250" style="s2">Incorporate multiple motivational systems simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.530" end="00:25:52.990" style="s2">And that&#39;s in some [sense]</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.990" end="00:25:56.229" style="s2">That&#39;s also what it&#39;s the same thing as we learned how to think abstractly</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:25:58.210" style="s2">and so the frame</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.210" end="00:26:01.929" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to lay out on the world if it&#39;s a good frame is one that solves a whole set of problems at the</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.140" end="00:26:04.520" style="s2">so that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.520" end="00:26:10.149" style="s2">[and] you can slot different frames you can you can experiment with [different] frames?</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.150" end="00:26:10.820" style="s2">and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.820" end="00:26:16.570" style="s2">Precondition to being able to play because one of the things that piaget pointed out you can see this when children pretend play. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.720" end="00:26:24.010" style="s2">Four and even more clearly in games that have rules, but let&#39;s say they&#39;re there in pretend play, and they&#39;re going to say well</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.010" end="00:26:26.169" style="s2">We&#39;re going to lay out a little fictional schema here</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.170" end="00:26:26.860" style="s2">We&#39;re going to play house</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.860" end="00:26:32.500" style="s2">And you can be the cat and all be the I&#39;ll be the dad and then you negotiate a bit to see if those rules</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.500" end="00:26:38.859" style="s2">Are acceptable and then you run it as a simulation, and that&#39;s what kids are doing when they&#39;re playing and they&#39;re experimenting with different</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.530" end="00:26:44.170" style="s2">Superordinate frames of reference that are active all in the world, and they&#39;re in there</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.170" end="00:26:47.440" style="s2">they&#39;re [learning] how to develop those perceptual schemes and also how to</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.840" end="00:26:55.209" style="s2">Interact in a manner that allows the scheme that they&#39;re using to find its social acceptability and its successful</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:26:57.770" style="s2">the child</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.770" end="00:26:59.450" style="s2">assumes that</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.450" end="00:27:01.630" style="s2">the Scheme is successful if</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.180" end="00:27:04.630" style="s2">both children have fun while they&#39;re doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.940" end="00:27:11.380" style="s2">So that&#39;s the volunteerism and so piaget made a very interesting point about that that I think is [absolutely] brilliant. He said that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.220" end="00:27:16.390" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between a game that people will play voluntarily and</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.940" end="00:27:20.890" style="s2">One that has to be enforced and so then you can imagine an environment</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.890" end="00:27:24.939" style="s2">Where game a is played voluntarily it has a certain end and game b</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.940" end="00:27:29.289" style="s2">is played by Force but both of them are moving towards the same end and</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:36.970" style="s2">Piaget his claim was the game that&#39;s played voluntarily or even more to the point the set of all games that are played</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.400" end="00:27:43.630" style="s2">Voluntarily will out-Compete the set of all games that are played by Force if they&#39;re put head-to-head in a competitive environment</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.020" end="00:27:51.370" style="s2">[I] thought God that&#39;s such a brilliant observation because there you have the basis for a pragmatic grounding of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.100" end="00:27:54.219" style="s2">For the evaluation of ethics. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.340" end="00:27:58.149" style="s2">You can pick the Target. It doesn&#39;t matter whatever Target</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.150" end="00:28:04.930" style="s2">You pick if the game is voluntary and aimed at the target it will defeat a game. That&#39;s imposed by Tyranny now</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.930" end="00:28:07.180" style="s2">It&#39;s a proposition, but it&#39;s a pretty good proposition</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.180" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">and I would say there&#39;s a fair bit of evidence for this proposition and a fair bit of it is actually derived from</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.630" end="00:28:19.910" style="s2">observation of animal Behavior because I ran you guys through the emerging literature on the stability say of Chimpanzee hierarchies and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.550" end="00:28:22.050" style="s2">Chimpanzee tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.050" end="00:28:27.500" style="s2">Hierarchy isn&#39;t very stable and the reason for that is that to subordinate chimps who are?</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.630" end="00:28:33.949" style="s2">3/4 as strong as the dominant tyrant can take them out and they do and so then the question might be well</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.950" end="00:28:40.309" style="s2">How do you have to conduct yourself as a high dominance chimp if you&#39;re not going to be torn apart by those who are?</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.560" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">Hypothetically your subordinates and the answer to that is well. Don&#39;t be too much of a</p>

<p begin="00:28:58.190" end="00:29:00.620" style="s2">It said ETC because that makes you unpopular</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.620" end="00:29:03.829" style="s2">And then you&#39;ll get torn to shreds and so there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.170" end="00:29:11.480" style="s2">practical limits on the expression of Tyranny that are a consequence both of biological limitations because people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.670" end="00:29:18.140" style="s2">object if the system is set up so [that] their fundamental needs are met and they&#39;re also going to object if</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.690" end="00:29:24.740" style="s2">The game that&#39;s being played isn&#39;t functioning socially and so this is very very tight set of constraints</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.960" end="00:29:28.100" style="s2">And then the question might be okay if you take that set of constraints</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.740" end="00:29:30.919" style="s2">What sort of systems can operate?</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.250" end="00:29:34.250" style="s2">What would you say well?</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.290" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">Just that what set of systems can operate within those sets of constraints?</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.460" end="00:29:43.850" style="s2">Then you might say if you take that the set of all systems that might operate within those constraints</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.850" end="00:29:49.880" style="s2">And you look at what&#39;s common across them then you could extract out what&#39;s essentially a universal morality</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.340" end="00:29:52.610" style="s2">It&#39;s something like that and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.130" end="00:29:59.959" style="s2">Don&#39;t see how that proposition is precisely questionable. It seems to me [that] all of that&#39;s built on rock like there&#39;s no [doubt] that</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.320" end="00:30:06.770" style="s2">Infants bring biological necessity to the table. I think that&#39;s fully established and it&#39;s established</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.770" end="00:30:09.770" style="s2">Physiologically, it&#39;s established</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.290" end="00:30:12.290" style="s2">behaviorally</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.330" end="00:30:16.460" style="s2">it&#39;s established with regards to evolutionary history because we can take the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.680" end="00:30:23.360" style="s2">Motivational systems that are part and parcel of our being and we can trace their development back in some cases half a billion years</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.030" end="00:30:25.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.400" end="00:30:31.879" style="s2">So the idea that the the infant is a blank slate when it&#39;s born and that&#39;s subject to infinite</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.700" end="00:30:37.640" style="s2">Sociological manipulation is a it&#39;s a dead in the water. That&#39;s just not the case</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.280" end="00:30:41.180" style="s2">So okay, so far. So we&#39;ve got that nailed down</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.180" end="00:30:44.779" style="s2">hard and then the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.750" end="00:30:48.079" style="s2">Your identity is also shaped</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.750" end="00:30:53.869" style="s2">Sociologically well I don&#39;t think anybody disputes that it doesn&#39;t matter where they are on the interpretative framework they might</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.970" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">dispute the degree to which [that] occurs and the mechanisms by which it occurs, but</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.670" end="00:31:01.909" style="s2">The fact that it occurs. That&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.670" end="00:31:05.479" style="s2">That&#39;s close enough to self evidence so we can just leave it there</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.690" end="00:31:09.980" style="s2">well then the question is what are the consequences of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.010" end="00:31:13.010" style="s2">sociological of</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.470" end="00:31:15.470" style="s2">socio of socialization and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.510" end="00:31:20.510" style="s2">Once you admit the nifty</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.030" end="00:31:25.670" style="s2">existence of the realm of biological necessity you instantly put a set of constraints on</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.980" end="00:31:30.230" style="s2">How societies can structure themselves so that they will not be?</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.470" end="00:31:33.470" style="s2">torn down and overthrown</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.100" end="00:31:41.750" style="s2">Well that if you look at. How kids are socialized. I think that psAys developmental observations are Bi and Bi correct</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.260" end="00:31:47.420" style="s2">The first two years it&#39;s mostly interactions between the infant and the parents</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.360" end="00:31:50.360" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s bi-directional though</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.670" end="00:31:55.429" style="s2">Because the infant has to come to terms with the mother but the mother also has to come to terms with the infant</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.429" end="00:31:59.059" style="s2">So it&#39;s not even top-down at the level of infant maternal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.340" end="00:32:03.260" style="s2">Quite the contrary and if you watch a new mother adapt to a baby</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.630" end="00:32:08.510" style="s2">you can see that the mother is doing as much out apt ation to the baby as the baby is to the mother because the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.670" end="00:32:12.439" style="s2">Infant has this inbuilt character already and has to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.350" end="00:32:18.319" style="s2">Charmed into a relationship that&#39;s love does that and and attention</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.320" end="00:32:24.530" style="s2">it&#39;s very little different than establishing a relationship with someone who&#39;s older it&#39;s it&#39;s lower resolution and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.320" end="00:32:29.780" style="s2">It&#39;s harder to make the observations because of course the infant is only capable of behavioral display</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.780" end="00:32:35.239" style="s2">[can&#39;t] can&#39;t speak but nonetheless the necessity for establishing the individual relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.240" end="00:32:40.819" style="s2">Is there to begin with so even in the early stages of the infant&#39;s realization the process isn&#39;t?</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.370" end="00:32:44.510" style="s2">State downward it&#39;s not great farther down work. It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.179" end="00:32:51.048" style="s2">Mutual and then of Course by the time the child is old enough to be launched out into [the] social world</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.299" end="00:32:58.609" style="s2">Then all the constraints that are associated with the playground are immediately placed on that child and that&#39;s a very unforgiving landscape</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.610" end="00:33:04.549" style="s2">right because the last thing a child wants really the last thing a child wants is not to have any friends or</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.190" end="00:33:09.140" style="s2">even perhaps equally seriously not to have a best friend [I]</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.779" end="00:33:14.569" style="s2">Read something so idiotic the other day that I couldn&#39;t believe it. So the newest prince</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.390" end="00:33:21.799" style="s2">So [queen] [Elizabeth&#39;s] I guess great grandchild is off to daycare in in the uk and in this daycare</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.899" end="00:33:26.689" style="s2">They don&#39;t let the kids have best friends because that&#39;s unfair [I] thought you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.890" end="00:33:32.359" style="s2">Something times you see something that&#39;s so stupid. You can&#39;t even believe it it</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.909" end="00:33:40.398" style="s2">Exists, and that was one of those examples because it&#39;s been known for quite a long time that one of the developmental Milestones</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.620" end="00:33:47.089" style="s2">the children attained somewhere between say the age of five and ten is they pick a best friend and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.250" end="00:33:52.189" style="s2">So they and and you know the hypothesis well that&#39;s unfair to all the other children</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.190" end="00:33:56.330" style="s2">It&#39;s like well first of all you can&#39;t be the best friend to everyone because you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.610" end="00:33:59.719" style="s2">Maybe there&#39;s a billion children so each of them gets one second</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.720" end="00:34:05.299" style="s2">It&#39;s like that&#39;s just not a very deep relationship. So the idea that you can be equally friendly with everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.299" end="00:34:11.779" style="s2">It&#39;s a preposterous, but even worse the thing is the thing [that] the child is doing is actually becoming</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:19.219" style="s2">there they&#39;re stepping out of their egocentricity because their best friend becomes more important than they are and that&#39;s a precursor for</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.589" end="00:34:21.859" style="s2">Adult relationships where you know if you&#39;re married?</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.109" end="00:34:27.199" style="s2">[well] your your partner should be at least as important as you are and the relationship should be more important</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.200" end="00:34:30.710" style="s2">But then when you have children, it&#39;s like they&#39;re more important than you [that] that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.710" end="00:34:36.500" style="s2">It&#39;s unless there&#39;s something wrong with you. You come second and your children come first and their way first</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.500" end="00:34:40.489" style="s2">They&#39;re not just a little buddy. You&#39;re necessary because without you. They&#39;re not going to manage</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.490" end="00:34:41.629" style="s2">So you have to take care of yourself?</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.629" end="00:34:44.149" style="s2">But you&#39;re not number one [anymore] once you have kids unless</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:51.588" style="s2">Seriously unless you didn&#39;t learn the lessons in the playground and when you have a best friend. You&#39;re not number one. They are and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.900" end="00:34:56.579" style="s2">So anyways there are these constraints that Emerge in in the social landscape</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.100" end="00:35:04.319" style="s2">you have to have friends and also you have to single someone out as particularly unique among those friends and establish a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.780" end="00:35:10.590" style="s2">Genuinely reciprocal and caring relationship. I can&#39;t remember the psychiatrist who studied this so intently</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:14.400" style="s2">unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.560" end="00:35:20.130" style="s2">He was the first person [to] to do a detailed analysis of the best friend relationships that children</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.530" end="00:35:26.759" style="s2">established and I&#39;d like to give him credit for his ideas, but unfortunately I can&#39;t remember his name, so</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:33.240" style="s2">Okay, so what are the propositions so far?</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.890" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">You inhabit a structure the [dorian] [Cu] in the world it has something. That&#39;s akin to a narrative structure. [I&#39;m] here</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.000" end="00:35:45.089" style="s2">[I&#39;m] going there, and this is the [way] I did it its narrative if you describe it</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.150" end="00:35:50.099" style="s2">It&#39;s based in biological necessity, but it&#39;s shaped by Social</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.710" end="00:35:52.829" style="s2">socialization and the fact of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.320" end="00:36:00.749" style="s2">Base and that shaping means that the set of interpretive schema that you can lay out in the world are bounded</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.840" end="00:36:03.460" style="s2">Those would be functional</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.460" end="00:36:09.059" style="s2">Hypothetically functional systems and maybe they compete over over the evolutionary time span</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.430" end="00:36:16.230" style="s2">but there&#39;s something in common across that set of functional interpretations, and if you extract that out you can get the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.110" end="00:36:23.970" style="s2">Initial images of what you might describe as an archetype you never cilmi. That&#39;s what archetypes are</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.000" end="00:36:26.200" style="s2">fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.200" end="00:36:33.179" style="s2">So and to say all that is no more than to say that people can extract across instances, and we can obviously do that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.430" end="00:36:39.119" style="s2">So then the question is can you start to develop an articulated picture of what that?</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.180" end="00:36:42.180" style="s2">archetyPal</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.000" end="00:36:45.510" style="s2">structure of universal morality might be and</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.030" end="00:36:52.710" style="s2">so my answer [to] that was basically well let&#39;s look at old stories as many old stories as we can collect and</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.050" end="00:36:57.660" style="s2">If their stories are stories that have survived for a very long period of time so much the better because it</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.330" end="00:36:59.710" style="s2">[that]</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.710" end="00:37:03.779" style="s2">indicates that they&#39;re acutely memorable and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.930" end="00:37:08.219" style="s2">Peculiarly functional because if they weren&#39;t memorable then they&#39;d have been forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.220" end="00:37:13.590" style="s2">and if they weren&#39;t functional they wouldn&#39;t have managed to be the foundation stories for four</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.020" end="00:37:17.159" style="s2">Cultures that lasted for thousands or even tens of thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.770" end="00:37:19.410" style="s2">So and then we could say well</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.410" end="00:37:24.090" style="s2">Let&#39;s collect a whole variety of these stories and see if there&#39;s patterns across them now the danger that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.860" end="00:37:33.059" style="s2">Have you collected an unbiased set of stories danger number one how do you know that you&#39;re not just reading into the stories?</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.210" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">That&#39;s the postmodern problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:38.610" style="s2">Reasonable reasonable objections and so that those objections have been laid</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.310" end="00:37:41.310" style="s2">against people like</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.820" end="00:37:46.350" style="s2">Wrote the Golden bough fraser who is the fraser who was one of the first?</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.840" end="00:37:51.390" style="s2">Anthropologists to collect stories from all over the world and to start to look for commonalities the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.790" end="00:37:56.909" style="s2">Objection has been laid at the feet of people like [Richie]. Le odd or carl jung or Joseph Campbell</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.910" end="00:37:58.390" style="s2">it&#39;s like how do you know you just</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.390" end="00:38:03.179" style="s2">How do you know you&#39;re not just cherry-picking your damn interpretations perfectly reasonable?</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.910" end="00:38:08.250" style="s2">Perfectly reasonable objection, and I would say that the reason I [don&#39;t] believe that</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.250" end="00:38:12.060" style="s2">I&#39;m cherry-picking my interpretations is because I used a method and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.760" end="00:38:16.590" style="s2">it&#39;s a method that&#39;s akin to the Multi Trait Multi method method of</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.260" end="00:38:22.380" style="s2">[construction] that that clinical psychology and other disciplines of psychology rely upon</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.600" end="00:38:29.339" style="s2">But it&#39;s also akin to a process put forward by  E.O Wilson that he called consilience the process is something like</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.740" end="00:38:32.040" style="s2">Well pick your level of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.770" end="00:38:36.209" style="s2">Does the phenomena manifest itself at that level of analysis? Yes?</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.420" end="00:38:42.120" style="s2">Pick another level of analysis and another level of analysis and another level of analysis and see if the same phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.280" end="00:38:48.659" style="s2">Manifests itself at every single level and then assume that the probability that that will happen by chance</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.330" end="00:38:56.729" style="s2">Decreases with each additional level of analysis [that] fits that where this concordance, and I thought okay that that that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.730" end="00:39:01.740" style="s2">So it isn&#39;t only that you can look for patterns and stories because you know what if you&#39;re a hyperactive?</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.870" end="00:39:02.760" style="s2">Pattern detector</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.760" end="00:39:06.540" style="s2">Which basically means like there are people like that people who tilt towards Paranoia?</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.670" end="00:39:11.580" style="s2">People who tilt towards conspiracy theories you can see it manifest itself in new age thinking all the time</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.130" end="00:39:14.429" style="s2">Because new age thinkers are very high in openness</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.430" end="00:39:18.180" style="s2">But not very good at critical thinking and so they see phenomena a and B and C and D</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.180" end="00:39:22.580" style="s2">they think [Pad] then they think universal pattern but they don&#39;t attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.910" end="00:39:30.289" style="s2">Disconfirm their pattern prediction and so what I tried to do when I was starting to see Patterns Emerge in the stories</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.690" end="00:39:35.330" style="s2">Informed by people like dealing in a leotta and so forth was to see if what [they] were describing</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.670" end="00:39:43.310" style="s2">Manifested itself at any other levels of analysis that [were] independent intellectually from that stream of thinking and I found it in two places</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.010" end="00:39:48.679" style="s2">targeted cybernetics, and I found it in neuroscience and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.620" end="00:39:54.140" style="s2">On and that that and the neuroscience element that includes the physiology</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.140" end="00:40:01.309" style="s2">But also the behavioral analysis that was done by by people most particularly like like like Jeffrey Gray and and the animal</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.590" end="00:40:06.620" style="s2">Experimental is who were brilliant Brilliant scientists, and who&#39;ve done a very good job of laying out the manner in which</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.220" end="00:40:10.220" style="s2">interpretive frameworks exist</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.190" end="00:40:18.169" style="s2">Within the realm of animal cognition and and and to describe how they manifest themselves in the world, so [I] thought okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.170" end="00:40:23.450" style="s2">That&#39;s not too bad because we&#39;ve got maybe four different levels of evidence all pointing in the same Direction</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.790" end="00:40:29.719" style="s2">So that&#39;s why I walk you guys through the neural psychology. It&#39;s like a story is you&#39;re going somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.720" end="00:40:33.830" style="s2">You&#39;re somewhere, and you&#39;re going somewhere, and you&#39;re tracking your progress, [okay]?</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.830" end="00:40:39.949" style="s2">That&#39;s the story well what what happens when you look at how people lay out their called cognitive maps well</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.950" end="00:40:44.689" style="s2">It&#39;s the same thing you specify a target an endpoint. You specify a beginning point</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.690" end="00:40:51.260" style="s2">Which is just where you are and then there&#39;s a mechanism a comparator mechanism that [operates] or multiple comparator mechanisms that operate?</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.780" end="00:40:53.310" style="s2">Neural</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.310" end="00:40:56.029" style="s2">Physiologically to orient yourself towards that goal and [the] emotions</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.580" end="00:41:02.929" style="s2">Basically Emerge as a as a consequence of [that] positive emotions indicating that you&#39;re moving forward properly</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.360" end="00:41:09.229" style="s2">Negative emotions indicating that you&#39;ve encountered some kind of obstacle. It&#39;s like well. That&#39;s the basic. That&#39;s the basic</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.050" end="00:41:11.750" style="s2">structure of a narrative, okay fine</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.750" end="00:41:17.989" style="s2">So now we can see how its instantiated neural physiologically that adds a fair bit [of] credence to the to the entire</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.540" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.790" end="00:41:29.790" style="s2">now normally when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.060" end="00:41:38.009" style="s2">Basic cybernetic work there&#39;s a hypothesis that the system is oriented towards a goal</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.460" end="00:41:46.439" style="s2">And that it&#39;s comparing what is manifesting itself in the world to that desired end state as the system moves?</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.450" end="00:41:48.450" style="s2">but it&#39;s too simple because</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.849" end="00:41:50.849" style="s2">People don&#39;t precisely have gold</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.339" end="00:41:54.059" style="s2">they have nested hierarchies of goals and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.819" end="00:41:56.819" style="s2">so</p>

<p begin="00:43:06.430" end="00:43:12.270" style="s2">Because the problem with an error is that you don&#39;t know what the error signifies, and that&#39;s a huge problem</p>

<p begin="00:46:22.630" end="00:46:29.789" style="s2">Or the city that buddha was raised it. It&#39;s all protected and everything inside it is beautiful and functional and</p>

<p begin="00:46:35.310" end="00:46:40.860" style="s2">then what&#39;s within it is things you control that are functional and and and and</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.980" end="00:46:52.080" style="s2">You&#39;re in the garden of Eden that&#39;s one way of [thinking] about it when the things that you&#39;re laying out in the world are delivering</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.080" end="00:46:53.410" style="s2">What they&#39;re supposed to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.410" end="00:46:58.199" style="s2">That&#39;s what you inhabit, but the problem is is that there&#39;s always a snake inside the garden</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.200" end="00:47:02.220" style="s2">And it&#39;s that&#39;s the story that&#39;s echoed in the story of Buddha in that case</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.220" end="00:47:07.020" style="s2">It&#39;s Buddha&#39;s own curiosity that happens to be the snake and you could actually say the same thing about human beings</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.090" end="00:47:10.169" style="s2">Maybe it wasn&#39;t the snake maybe it was eve&#39;s curiosity</p>

<p begin="00:47:13.050" end="00:47:20.130" style="s2">And so it&#39;s Buddha&#39;s curiosity that drives them outside the city to find disease and death and to blow apart his</p>

<p begin="00:52:07.450" end="00:52:09.809" style="s2">Something manifests itself that you didn&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.660" end="00:52:12.660" style="s2">there has to be a mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.210" end="00:52:15.299" style="s2">Orienting you in the face of error</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.509" end="00:52:18.509" style="s2">all right, so</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.519" end="00:52:24.329" style="s2">What exactly does that imply the question is what do you discover when you go down the rabbit hole?</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.109" end="00:52:30.649" style="s2">I was thinking about that [a] lot today. I</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.630" end="00:52:38.059" style="s2">Showed you that diagram that I thought was like a map of the phenomenological world</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.200" end="00:52:45.889" style="s2">The the lowest resolution Category is something like the dragon of Chaos and so you might say</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.200" end="00:52:49.429" style="s2">Well what you discover when you make an error and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.039" end="00:52:52.728" style="s2">First it&#39;s a brief manifestation of the dragon of Chaos</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.799" end="00:52:58.549" style="s2">and that&#39;s no more to say then when you encounter the incursion of</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.890" end="00:53:03.529" style="s2">Unexplored territory into explored territory the circuitry you use is</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.809" end="00:53:07.579" style="s2">the same circuits that we use to to</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.130" end="00:53:10.339" style="s2">respond instantaneously to the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.130" end="00:53:12.599" style="s2">Predatory Forces</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.599" end="00:53:16.968" style="s2">We use that circuit and that makes perfect sense because the predator is almost by definition</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.130" end="00:53:24.920" style="s2">The thing that lurks Beyond the safe confines of the community and I told you I believe a story about rats</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.589" end="00:53:27.589" style="s2">raised in naturalistic environments</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.440" end="00:53:29.910" style="s2">the Rats are</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.910" end="00:53:32.299" style="s2">We&#39;ve got the burrows on one end of the little field</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:39.559" style="s2">That hierarchy they&#39;re doing their [little] rat social things they&#39;re playing and they&#39;re laughing and they&#39;re tickling each other and they&#39;re there you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.569" end="00:53:41.808" style="s2">Raising the rat families, and that&#39;s all working out</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.809" end="00:53:46.609" style="s2">Just fine rats in that situation by the way are very difficult to get addicted to cocaine</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.949" end="00:53:51.079" style="s2">If you want to dick the rat to cocaine you have to put it in a cage and isolated</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.180" end="00:53:55.789" style="s2">It&#39;s not really a rat any more than any more than you&#39;re a person if you&#39;re in solitary confinement, right?</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.789" end="00:53:58.909" style="s2">I mean, you&#39;re sort you&#39;re mostly [your] just misery</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.969" end="00:54:05.089" style="s2">Anyways in solitary confinement [you&#39;d] be after cocaine non-stop and maybe under other circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.309" end="00:54:08.659" style="s2">but like a normal [rat] it&#39;s not that interested in cocaine, so</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.150" end="00:54:10.410" style="s2">Let&#39;s just decide</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.410" end="00:54:10.949" style="s2">No</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.949" end="00:54:16.309" style="s2">[anyways] the rats are doing their thing and then they&#39;ve learned that they can go out to the other side of the field and they</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.309" end="00:54:19.038" style="s2">can get food [and] so one day the</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.979" end="00:54:23.929" style="s2">experimenters instead of putting food out there put a cat out there and</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.479" end="00:54:29.299" style="s2">the rat goes out and gets a whiff of the cat which they do not like and then the rat runs home and</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.670" end="00:54:32.989" style="s2">Pokes is because of the burrow and screams for like two days</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.569" end="00:54:36.558" style="s2">Ultrasonic LI and all the other rats are like frozen stiff because of that</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:41.459" style="s2">They&#39;re not going anywhere, and so a 2-day rat screaming V is no a trivial [thing]</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.460" end="00:54:44.159" style="s2">That&#39;s be I calculated that be the equivalent of use</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.680" end="00:54:51.000" style="s2">Screaming for two weeks, so you have to be pretty upset to scream for two weeks, right, so this is hard on the rat</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.000" end="00:54:55.800" style="s2">But the reason I&#39;m telling you this is the rat doesn&#39;t expect the cat to be there the rat goes out</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.800" end="00:54:58.679" style="s2">And there&#39;s a cat and what it uses is its predator</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.840" end="00:55:06.389" style="s2">Detection and alert systems to signify the presence of the cat and what we&#39;ve done with the dragon imagery Roughly speaking is make an amalgam</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.390" end="00:55:11.879" style="s2">Of predatory monsters and state that&#39;s a symbol for what lurks Beyond safety</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.520" end="00:55:16.199" style="s2">because we&#39;re observing our own responses in some sense and</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.720" end="00:55:21.060" style="s2">And it&#39;s not only that we&#39;re observing our own responses, but we also have a category</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.580" end="00:55:25.350" style="s2">Categorical set of responses to Predator and we again</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.690" end="00:55:32.760" style="s2">There&#39;s no speculation about this we already know this like if you go study monkeys for example they have</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.250" end="00:55:39.540" style="s2">Distinct sets of vocalization [that] are associated with Predator Detection that have distinct circuits</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.580" end="00:55:44.369" style="s2">We know that there are predator Detection circuits, and it&#39;s not unreasonable [to] also</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.920" end="00:55:50.430" style="s2">Presuppose that they underlie the phenomena for example that human beings are [very] good at learning fear to snakes</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.830" end="00:55:55.319" style="s2">Snake fear might be innate like that&#39;s pushing the argument but at minimum</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.600" end="00:56:02.339" style="s2">Psychologists have already concluded that even if snake fear isn&#39;t innate and it probably is that it can be learned like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.590" end="00:56:06.179" style="s2">So you can condition people to be afraid of pictures of snakes?</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.000" end="00:56:13.020" style="s2">way faster than you can condition them to be afraid of pictures of electrical outlets or handguns, so</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.840" end="00:56:18.779" style="s2">And that&#39;s well documented. I don&#39;t think anybody disputes that at all, so</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.570" end="00:56:20.980" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.980" end="00:56:23.490" style="s2">Assumption is when something unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.250" end="00:56:27.300" style="s2">Emerges, so we&#39;ll call that the snake in the garden that</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.150" end="00:56:34.170" style="s2">Your prey and that&#39;s a predator and that the monster has come to get you. It&#39;s something like that now the</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.960" end="00:56:40.230" style="s2">Representation of the Dragon is more complex than mere Monster because the dragon the mythological</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.420" end="00:56:45.270" style="s2">Dragon also is the thing that hoards Treasure, and I really like that symbol</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.270" end="00:56:47.729" style="s2">I think it&#39;s I think that&#39;s also why it will never go away</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.730" end="00:56:51.869" style="s2">It&#39;s such a great symbol because it says well the unknown can take you down</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.910" end="00:56:57.979" style="s2">[it] can it can right you with its fiery breath like poisonous snake and it can burn things like fire</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.979" end="00:56:59.369" style="s2">and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.369" end="00:57:04.998" style="s2">aerial predator that can take you from the air and it&#39;s a carnivorous predator that can take you from the ground and [it&#39;s]</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.189" end="00:57:08.269" style="s2">Reptilian it&#39;s the sort of thing that can pull you down into the water</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.369" end="00:57:12.108" style="s2">And it&#39;s easy to see that as an amalgam of of the threats that have been</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.509" end="00:57:15.648" style="s2">Laid Forth for Human beings since the beginning of time and</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:21.528" style="s2">Monster is an amalgam of predator, and you might say well. There&#39;s no such thing as a dragon. It&#39;s like. Yes</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.529" end="00:57:23.529" style="s2">There is it&#39;s just a loose category</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.449" end="00:57:27.469" style="s2">What&#39;s common across all [predators] equals dragon?</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.529" end="00:57:33.888" style="s2">It&#39;s not like it&#39;s a knot. They&#39;re not real. They&#39;re hyper real. They&#39;re more real than the phenomena themselves</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.889" end="00:57:40.069" style="s2">Just like an abstraction can be more real than the phenomena the result and then the canonical dragon for human beings isn&#39;t just a predator</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.249" end="00:57:42.119" style="s2">We&#39;re not rabbits</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.119" end="00:57:45.168" style="s2">You can imagine that the dragon for a rabbit is just a dragon</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.169" end="00:57:52.638" style="s2">There&#39;s no damn treasure there at all but for human beings its ambivalent because the thing that you don&#39;t know about is</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.039" end="00:57:55.879" style="s2">Also, the thing that holds the greatest gift and why is that?</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.039" end="00:58:03.678" style="s2">It&#39;s [because] the unrealized world manifests itself when you make an error and the unrealized world is something that can take you down</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.380" end="00:58:07.339" style="s2">Obviously, but it&#39;s also the source of all new information</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.579" end="00:58:15.079" style="s2">it&#39;s an infinite source of information, and that&#39;s a really useful thing [to] know error is an infinite source of information and</p>

<p begin="00:58:32.599" end="00:58:34.609" style="s2">There&#39;s some negative emotion that comes up or or</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.859" end="00:58:40.278" style="s2">Or or you know maybe I&#39;ve said something to impress you or to be arrogant, and you respond badly</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.279" end="00:58:42.918" style="s2">It&#39;s like we&#39;ve got this melodic thing going on</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.919" end="00:58:49.579" style="s2">It&#39;s a consensual frame and something pokes itself up to put a disjunction in the conversation</p>

<p begin="01:00:11.850" end="01:00:16.309" style="s2">but the positive emotion system shut off and that that&#39;s what happens to someone who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:01:59.910" end="01:02:01.910" style="s2">threats like that to some [degree]</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.100" end="01:02:03.990" style="s2">It&#39;s an erratic level in</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.990" end="01:02:09.170" style="s2">Erratic apart of Society that would be the tyrannical aspect of the Greek king let&#39;s say you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.330" end="01:02:13.519" style="s2">We&#39;ve organized a set of punishments and threats that keep each of us in alignment</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.130" end="01:02:15.150" style="s2">however</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.150" end="01:02:19.579" style="s2">Generally speaking in a society that&#39;s functional we&#39;ve decided to adopt</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.100" end="01:02:22.789" style="s2">Agreement with that set of principles more or less voluntarily?</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.040" end="01:02:27.080" style="s2">We say well you have rights and responsibilities, and I have rights and responsibilities</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.080" end="01:02:32.210" style="s2">And I&#39;m willing to pay a price for yours including the acceptance of punishment if I transgress</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.430" end="01:02:35.899" style="s2">But you&#39;re going to do the same for me. So there are there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.420" end="01:02:40.339" style="s2">intelligent ways that punishment and threat can be used and bounded so</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.160" end="01:02:44.599" style="s2">but it that could easily degenerate into Tyranny and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.060" end="01:02:51.890" style="s2">methods that I can choose to [use] if I don&#39;t want to encounter error is just to enforce my will on everyone else and</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.170" end="01:02:54.170" style="s2">I think when that happens</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.660" end="01:02:59.720" style="s2">personally and in the family and in the community and in the state all at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.120" end="01:03:02.150" style="s2">then you get the emergence of a Tyranny and</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.150" end="01:03:08.479" style="s2">So I would consider those two counterproductive</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.800" end="01:03:17.390" style="s2">Reactions to the emergence of the unrealized world. It&#39;s like you say something. I don&#39;t like I collapse completely</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.110" end="01:03:24.170" style="s2">Children don&#39;t like other children who do that by the way right? It&#39;s something that&#39;s very interesting to [observe]</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.690" end="01:03:30.319" style="s2">So let&#39;s say kids have organized themselves to play a little game of baseball with a plastic bat in a ball</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.320" end="01:03:34.309" style="s2">And you know one child pitches and the other child hits the ball</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.520" end="01:03:38.870" style="s2">The child Catches it and puts the puts the batter out and the batter bursts into tears</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.270" end="01:03:46.580" style="s2">Well, what happens is the other kids you know the first time that happens they&#39;ll be sympathetic [the] third time that happens</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.580" end="01:03:48.580" style="s2">They won&#39;t invite that kid out to play baseball anymore</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.860" end="01:03:51.860" style="s2">so the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.050" end="01:03:59.390" style="s2">We&#39;re not getting along is not you get to burst into tears and and and manifest extraordinary emotional distress because if you do that</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.210" end="01:04:02.210" style="s2">no, one&#39;s going to want to play with you and</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.790" end="01:04:09.800" style="s2">[that&#39;s] a lesson that many people could stand learning again one of the things. I think that&#39;s really destabilizing our society right [now]</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.800" end="01:04:11.929" style="s2">Maybe is that I&#39;m not sure [that]</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.570" end="01:04:17.870" style="s2">Kids have been encouraged or allowed to play enough in the last</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.600" end="01:04:22.399" style="s2">[2530] Years and I think a lot of this identity stuff is actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.100" end="01:04:28.789" style="s2">Fantasy play, it&#39;s delayed fantasy play because it&#39;s sort of what you do when you&#39;re seven years old. It&#39;s like well</p>

<p begin="01:04:33.890" end="01:04:35.370" style="s2">It&#39;s like that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.370" end="01:04:41.359" style="s2">You don&#39;t impose that though right not not if you&#39;re a kid that has a clue you invite people to play you don&#39;t insist on</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.460" end="01:04:44.480" style="s2">Your identity and their compliance with it</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.640" end="01:04:46.430" style="s2">It&#39;s not a playable game</p>

<p begin="01:04:47.130" end="01:04:51.619" style="s2">You don&#39;t burst into tears and run off when [someone] won&#39;t play your game because then they won&#39;t play with you</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.620" end="01:04:57.049" style="s2">And then you have to turn [to] force, and that&#39;s that&#39;s fine. If that&#39;s what you want to do, but you better look out because</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.630" end="01:04:59.630" style="s2">You better be ready to use it</p>

<p begin="01:05:24.060" end="01:05:26.899" style="s2">Somewhere else that we have a responsibility [against]</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.690" end="01:05:31.580" style="s2">Good question. I mean that that&#39;s part of the question that that I in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.700" end="01:05:36.560" style="s2">Motivated in some sense motivated the American incursion into Iraq</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.500" end="01:05:45.379" style="s2">Right so what&#39;s our responsibility in relationship to tyranny that&#39;s a good question all of the increases of families are</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.930" end="01:05:53.330" style="s2">Getting is for non processing about the situation of [human] and say solidarity yeah, you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.330" end="01:05:56.989" style="s2">I think that&#39;s I [think] that criticism is more emerging because of because it&#39;s apparently</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.480" end="01:06:04.760" style="s2">it&#39;s apparently paradoxical and they&#39;ve laid out a set of principles to which in principle they they adhere and</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.120" end="01:06:11.270" style="s2">One of those principles is to reduce the destructive power of the patriarchy it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.580" end="01:06:17.000" style="s2">There is some destructive Patriarchy for you radio silence. It&#39;s like hmM now</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.000" end="01:06:20.899" style="s2">What am I supposed to do about that am I supposed to question your adherence to those principles?</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.900" end="01:06:26.810" style="s2">Which is exactly what should be done, so I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s a criticism of performative contradiction</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.150" end="01:06:34.160" style="s2">[you] say you&#39;re for this, but when it comes to acted out you don&#39;t selectively in this situation, so there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.260" end="01:06:41.359" style="s2">There&#39;s something about your game that you&#39;re not being straight about that&#39;s the criticism, and maybe there&#39;s rejoinders to that you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.020" end="01:06:45.020" style="s2">Well, okay, okay? Well</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.420" end="01:06:48.980" style="s2">responsibility well you know then you&#39;d have to look at different levels of</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.920" end="01:06:55.550" style="s2">Analysis with regards to interactions. You definitely have a responsibility to your partner and</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.400" end="01:07:01.099" style="s2">Your children okay, so your responsibility to your children as far as I&#39;m concerned is</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.010" end="01:07:07.459" style="s2">don&#39;t it&#39;s twofold one don&#39;t let your children do anything that makes you dislike them and</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.160" end="01:07:09.320" style="s2">There&#39;s a corollary to that</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.320" end="01:07:16.099" style="s2">which is don&#39;t be an idiot you know so that&#39;s partly why you need a partner because your partner has to tell you when your</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.290" end="01:07:22.159" style="s2">Demands on your children are excessive because you&#39;re kind of you know you&#39;re not 100% oriented properly</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.200" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">but still you&#39;re their target adult and</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.470" end="01:07:31.789" style="s2">So it&#39;s up to you to help them choose a path that makes you want them to be around right?</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.730" end="01:07:39.649" style="s2">And that that&#39;s your critical responsibility, and hopefully you&#39;re enough of an an analog of the broader community</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.710" end="01:07:44.449" style="s2">so that if they can figure out how to get along with you it radically increases the</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.579" end="01:07:49.548" style="s2">Probability that they&#39;ll be able to get along with everyone so for example if you&#39;re playing with your children</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:51.839" style="s2">two years old</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.839" end="01:07:55.759" style="s2">You you help them you encourage them to play in a manner</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.760" end="01:07:56.390" style="s2">That&#39;s fun</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.390" end="01:08:02.539" style="s2">And if you get that down, then you know when you introduce them to another child don&#39;t know how to play in a manner</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.539" end="01:08:04.539" style="s2">That&#39;s fun, and so great</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.920" end="01:08:11.240" style="s2">You&#39;ve solved the problem the problem is to get your child to enter into the collaborative social world, and so yes</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.240" end="01:08:16.969" style="s2">You have a primary responsibility for that and then with regards to your partner. Here&#39;s something to think about</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.310" end="01:08:22.669" style="s2">With regards to role so my wife and I have had this discussion many times and one of the discussions is well</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.670" end="01:08:24.659" style="s2">How are we to treat each other in public?</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.659" end="01:08:28.309" style="s2">And it isn&#39;t her name is Tammy the discussion isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.469" end="01:08:34.609" style="s2">How should Jordon treat Tammy in public or how should tammy treat Jordan that&#39;s not the discussion this isn&#39;t personal</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.909" end="01:08:39.469" style="s2">It&#39;s how should a wife treat her husband, and how should a husband treat his wife</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.469" end="01:08:44.719" style="s2">It&#39;s impersonal and it&#39;s partly you don&#39;t put your partner down in public</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.179" end="01:08:48.529" style="s2">Why well it&#39;s not because you&#39;re hurting that person&#39;s feelings</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.529" end="01:08:53.329" style="s2">That&#39;s not why it&#39;s that you&#39;re denigrating the relationship that you are in voluntarily</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.699" end="01:08:57.649" style="s2">You know I&#39;ve some of the most painful days. I&#39;ve ever spent one in particular</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.650" end="01:09:01.400" style="s2">I spent with a group of men who had been in therapy for their marriage and</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.529" end="01:09:03.979" style="s2">who bloody well needed that I can tell you that and</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.440" end="01:09:09.739" style="s2">They spent their whole day complaining about their wives. I could just made me sweat the whole day</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.739" end="01:09:12.109" style="s2">I thought I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m here with you guys that I</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.389" end="01:09:16.399" style="s2">Can&#39;t tell you why I was it&#39;s just you know it was just happenstance more than anything</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.400" end="01:09:19.580" style="s2">And I thought how can you be so damn dumb it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.580" end="01:09:24.709" style="s2">It&#39;s certainly possible that you marriage barbaric married Barbarian witches fine</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.020" end="01:09:32.610" style="s2">You don&#39;t have you&#39;re so lacking in sense that you would discuss that in public not noticing that you picked them</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.920" end="01:09:40.529" style="s2">So basically all you&#39;re doing is holding up a sign and waving it constantly that says I&#39;m an idiot. I&#39;m an idiot right and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.500" end="01:09:42.910" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.910" end="01:09:44.910" style="s2">back to responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.070" end="01:09:51.570" style="s2">You have a responsibility to those whom you love and are obligated to</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.300" end="01:09:58.679" style="s2">To ensure that they manifest themselves in a manner that&#39;s most beneficial to them over the long run</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.590" end="01:10:05.819" style="s2">Now you have the same responsibilities. I would say to yourself, but you&#39;ll have blind spots other people have to help you with that</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.100" end="01:10:11.550" style="s2">But so the rule is you know you don&#39;t let you don&#39;t you help your wife figure out?</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.550" end="01:10:17.759" style="s2">How not to make [a] fool [of] herself in public and she extends to you the same courtesy and it&#39;s partly</p>

<p begin="01:10:42.430" end="01:10:47.040" style="s2">You&#39;ve just admitted that you&#39;re a bigot right because you&#39;re acting about it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="01:10:57.160" end="01:11:01.050" style="s2">If that if you agree with it, no problem, you can make a case for it</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.050" end="01:11:06.029" style="s2">I [think] it&#39;s a weak and appalling case personally, but you can make a case [for] it</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.030" end="01:11:08.639" style="s2">you could say well, you know why I&#39;m interested in my</p>

<p begin="01:11:13.600" end="01:11:18.030" style="s2">But if you object to it, and you don&#39;t say anything</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.850" end="01:11:20.850" style="s2">then you&#39;re complicit and</p>

<p begin="01:11:30.870" end="01:11:37.020" style="s2">But it has this tendency to expand and you&#39;ll come home angry and upset and [you&#39;ll] go to the training program</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.020" end="01:11:41.249" style="s2">And you&#39;ll think this is ridiculous because that is what you&#39;ll think in all likelihood, and you won&#39;t say anything</p>

<p begin="01:11:45.239" end="01:11:48.839" style="s2">Gated your responsibility and so and then you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.840" end="01:11:56.009" style="s2">So then then that&#39;s how the community becomes corrupt that&#39;s how the community starts to be corrupt is that people turn a blind eye to</p>

<p begin="01:12:05.500" end="01:12:07.500" style="s2">Because he&#39;s willfully blind</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.260" end="01:12:11.070" style="s2">Willfully blind which means he knows?</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.950" end="01:12:17.669" style="s2">But refuses to he knows quote his predator Detection systems have gone off</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.520" end="01:12:23.370" style="s2">Monster well, then you&#39;re supposed to look okay? Exactly what sort of monster is this what doesn&#39;t have wings?</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.370" end="01:12:26.069" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have a tail you know you cut it down into the</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.350" end="01:12:30.600" style="s2">You cut it from the monster that it could be into the monster that it is</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.880" end="01:12:38.130" style="s2">That&#39;s the first step and then you take the appropriate steps and then you also notice the other monsters because here&#39;s something [to] think about</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.200" end="01:12:43.200" style="s2">You&#39;re going to pay a price for speaking up</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.690" end="01:12:45.690" style="s2">But you&#39;re going to pay a price for not speaking up</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.360" end="01:12:53.040" style="s2">So it&#39;s like monsters on the right monsters on the left pick the ones you want to battle with if you decide not to</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.890" end="01:12:55.570" style="s2">Make your stand</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.570" end="01:12:59.009" style="s2">You weaken yourself if you do it a hundred times</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.860" end="01:13:02.790" style="s2">Then even if the monster was only this big now</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.790" end="01:13:06.810" style="s2">You&#39;re this big it&#39;s going to eat you you know when it was this big you probably could have kicked it across the room</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.810" end="01:13:12.269" style="s2">It&#39;s too late for that you&#39;ve capitulated and capitulated you know and so what what you&#39;ve done?</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.640" end="01:13:15.689" style="s2">And this is a way to think about it from a union perspective</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.690" end="01:13:22.049" style="s2">This is what jung was trying to get [at] when he was talking about elka elka me. It&#39;s like the thing that pops up</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.660" end="01:13:23.950" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.950" end="01:13:25.870" style="s2">object to you is</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.870" end="01:13:27.870" style="s2">this incredibly complex</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.840" end="01:13:32.219" style="s2">Entity it&#39;s it&#39;s the entire world encapsulated in the event</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.670" end="01:13:35.460" style="s2">If you interact with it</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.460" end="01:13:42.569" style="s2">You unpack it you differentiate your sense of the world and you and you you gather new skills, so for example</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.670" end="01:13:47.850" style="s2">Let&#39;s say there&#39;s something going on at your workplace, and you need to object to it cuz it&#39;s driving you crazy</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.850" end="01:13:51.450" style="s2">And you talk it over with your wife so that you&#39;ve got your head screwed on straight say</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.450" end="01:13:54.179" style="s2">Oh, I&#39;ve got to say something and you go there, and you say something</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.180" end="01:13:56.639" style="s2">And you know you&#39;re stumbling and awkward and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.640" end="01:14:02.550" style="s2">But but you watch the response and maybe you get what you&#39;re aiming at. Maybe you don&#39;t but you&#39;ve learned a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.550" end="01:14:05.999" style="s2">You&#39;ve learned while I noticed coherent as I could be I&#39;m not as good at putting my arguments together</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.330" end="01:14:10.350" style="s2">My boss is more of a son of a bitch than I that he thought it was this is a worse problem that I knew</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.350" end="01:14:11.980" style="s2">about it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.980" end="01:14:17.070" style="s2">Differentiated differentiated so now the landscape is higher resolution and so are you?</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.530" end="01:14:18.600" style="s2">Well so good</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.600" end="01:14:20.050" style="s2">So maybe you&#39;re a little bit next</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.050" end="01:14:24.509" style="s2">Better prepared the next time you have to do that and so the issue here to some degree is</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.440" end="01:14:32.550" style="s2">Don&#39;t lose an opportunity to grapple with something that objects to you, especially when the object</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.190" end="01:14:35.190" style="s2">Objection is rather small</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.410" end="01:14:38.099" style="s2">Because that&#39;s something you can you say well, I can put up with it</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.130" end="01:14:41.429" style="s2">It&#39;s like fair enough like you don&#39;t want to make everything into a war</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.430" end="01:14:47.700" style="s2">I usually use a rule of three if we&#39;re interacting and you do something that I find disruptive. I&#39;ll note it</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.730" end="01:14:54.209" style="s2">It&#39;s like potential dragon go on and I&#39;ll leave it be and then if you do it again. I think oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.300" end="01:14:57.300" style="s2">That probably wasn&#39;t merely</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.850" end="01:15:04.169" style="s2">Situation but I&#39;ll leave it be because that&#39;s still not enough evidence, but if you do it a third [time], then I&#39;ll say hey</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.170" end="01:15:09.600" style="s2">I just noticed this and you&#39;ll say no that didn&#39;t happen and I&#39;ll say yeah, not only did it happen</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.600" end="01:15:13.200" style="s2">But it happened here, and it happened here, [and] I&#39;m not making this up</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.200" end="01:15:17.639" style="s2">So there&#39;s something going on here like I&#39;m not ignoring it and we can get to the bottom of it</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.700" end="01:15:22.169" style="s2">And then they&#39;ll come [up] with a bunch of objections about why that isn&#39;t necessary and you push those aside</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.170" end="01:15:25.410" style="s2">[and] they&#39;ll come up with [a] few more objections, and they&#39;ll push those aside</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.480" end="01:15:30.240" style="s2">And then usually they&#39;ll get mad or burst into tears and if you push that aside</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.150" end="01:15:33.150" style="s2">Then you get to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.700" end="01:15:35.849" style="s2">Right and then you can solve the problem</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.850" end="01:15:36.240" style="s2">but man</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.240" end="01:15:44.099" style="s2">it&#39;s you got to be a monster because first of all you need six arguments about why they&#39;re objections aren&#39;t going to stop you and</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.380" end="01:15:52.109" style="s2">then you have to not be intimidated by the Anger and you have to not be swamped by compassion about the tears and</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.410" end="01:15:56.729" style="s2">Then you can have a conversation and people don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.730" end="01:15:57.510" style="s2">They won&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.510" end="01:16:01.889" style="s2">And so they don&#39;t solve the problems and so then the problems accrue</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.380" end="01:16:08.849" style="s2">Right and if they accrue over 15 years of a relationship then that then they end up fat ugly and in divorce court</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.820" end="01:16:11.820" style="s2">so and that&#39;s you know, that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.360" end="01:16:14.360" style="s2">That&#39;s not a great outcome. It&#39;s an it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.950" end="01:16:16.950" style="s2">Divorce Court and cancer are</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.130" end="01:16:21.570" style="s2">similar in their in their seriousness, not always, but</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.510" end="01:16:29.010" style="s2">But sufficiently often so when that error emerges it&#39;s a it&#39;s a glimmering</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.890" end="01:16:31.090" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.090" end="01:16:35.880" style="s2">You know we talked a lot about the hierarchical structure of goals you know and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.520" end="01:16:38.170" style="s2">Here&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.170" end="01:16:40.170" style="s2">here&#39;s something to think about so</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.390" end="01:16:42.390" style="s2">the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.700" end="01:16:45.419" style="s2">Announces itself is error has a two-fold nature</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.730" end="01:16:51.419" style="s2">That&#39;s because it&#39;s Chaos and order at the same time or it&#39;s because it&#39;s all the archetypal structures at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.420" end="01:16:57.210" style="s2">It&#39;s dragon of Chaos. It&#39;s the great mother positive and negative. It&#39;s the great father positive and negative. It&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.730" end="01:17:02.220" style="s2">Individual hero and adversary all of that manifests itself in the moment of error</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.500" end="01:17:06.300" style="s2">Right the architects come forward did you make an error because you&#39;re a bad person?</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.090" end="01:17:13.740" style="s2">Could be now so so one of the things to [think] about with regards to that is you know in the mesopotamian creation story?</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.260" end="01:17:15.310" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.310" end="01:17:19.320" style="s2">When when time out comes flooding back. It&#39;s so interesting that story</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.220" end="01:17:23.140" style="s2">You think about what she does?</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.140" end="01:17:28.289" style="s2">So she&#39;s the archetype of error. Let&#39;s say the error that can take you out that can dissolve you in salt water</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.470" end="01:17:31.470" style="s2">tears</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.930" end="01:17:39.930" style="s2">Well, she&#39;s irritated because absolute was destroyed so that the structure is gone carelessness is destroyed the structure up comes time at she&#39;s not happy</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.510" end="01:17:44.969" style="s2">What does she do she prepares a Phalanx of Monstrous Monsters?</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.970" end="01:17:50.099" style="s2">It&#39;s exactly what the story says she produces a whole horde of monsters to come at you</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.680" end="01:17:52.979" style="s2">and she [puts] king you at their head and</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.040" end="01:17:56.040" style="s2">Kenya was the king of the Monsters and</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.320" end="01:18:03.809" style="s2">Later so he&#39;s the ultimate bad guy he&#39;s satan for all intents and purposes in the mesopotamian version. It&#39;s out of him that</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.840" end="01:18:11.910" style="s2">Marduk makes human beings out of his blood that marduk makes human beings. That&#39;s a critical issue man the mesopotamian said</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.360" end="01:18:17.310" style="s2">Imagine the worst monster you can possibly imagine the king of all the monsters</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.190" end="01:18:20.520" style="s2">That&#39;s the blood of human beings</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.220" end="01:18:22.360" style="s2">Wow</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.360" end="01:18:24.360" style="s2">So what does that mean?</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.610" end="01:18:27.170" style="s2">Well it means that one of the terrible things that lurks</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.900" end="01:18:30.349" style="s2">Let&#39;s say that you&#39;ve been in a long-term</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.079" end="01:18:34.639" style="s2">Relationship and it collapses let&#39;s say you were</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.280" end="01:18:40.730" style="s2">You know you had a tendency towards alcoholism. You weren&#39;t so great with regards to your drug use [you]</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.309" end="01:18:44.959" style="s2">[know] that conscientious, and you had like four or five kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.929" end="01:18:48.558" style="s2">low-rent affairs, and you know it</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.710" end="01:18:51.710" style="s2">your marriage collapses bang</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.289" end="01:18:55.459" style="s2">Well who do you first meet when you fall into Chaos?</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.980" end="01:19:01.039" style="s2">You meet king of the monsters and he&#39;s you it&#39;s like. Why did my marriage fall apart?</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.039" end="01:19:05.719" style="s2">[what] did I do wrong bang bang bang bang? [I] [did] all these things well? Why?</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.599" end="01:19:11.419" style="s2">Because that thing inhabits me. What is it well? That&#39;s the most horrifying question</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.119" end="01:19:13.619" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.619" end="01:19:16.998" style="s2">So down there in the archetypal space all these things lurk</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.789" end="01:19:22.639" style="s2">The hero and the adversary you&#39;ve just met the adversary right well</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.639" end="01:19:30.229" style="s2">Maybe your tyrant that&#39;s certainly possible. Maybe everything around you was chaotic. So what do you encounter when things fall apart you?</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.260" end="01:19:39.230" style="s2">[encounter] the adversary you encounter the tyrant you encounter the catastrophe of nature and you encounter the dragon of the Chaos, and they&#39;re all intermingled</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.769" end="01:19:45.049" style="s2">You have to sort that out. That&#39;s what happens to Ellis when she goes down the rabbit hole right she meets</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.900" end="01:19:47.730" style="s2">the Red Queen</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.730" end="01:19:49.730" style="s2">[and] the red queen is always running around</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.099" end="01:19:55.518" style="s2">Off with their heads off with her heads and she says in my kingdom you have to run as fast as you can just to</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.519" end="01:19:57.150" style="s2">Stay in the same place</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.150" end="01:19:59.599" style="s2">right down the rabbit hole you meet the archetypes and</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.539" end="01:20:02.539" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.760" end="01:20:09.619" style="s2">Okay, so back to [responsibilities] well one of the things solzhenitsyn detailed. We said well, how does societies. Go corrupt said it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.039" end="01:20:13.129" style="s2">one Little sin at a time</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.550" end="01:20:17.840" style="s2">You go to work someone&#39;s lording it over you you know that they&#39;re tyrannical?</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.659" end="01:20:21.618" style="s2">You don&#39;t have the wherewithal to stand up. It&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.559" end="01:20:24.559" style="s2">You&#39;re a slave</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.840" end="01:20:31.190" style="s2">And so if you continue to agree [to] be a slave you will continue to generate tyrants</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.099" end="01:20:37.819" style="s2">Right and the only thing that can stop you from doing that. I think is the right kind of terror. It&#39;s like careful</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.820" end="01:20:39.659" style="s2">What you give up?</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.659" end="01:20:42.558" style="s2">Because that&#39;s this [logos] okay, so so [alright]</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.689" end="01:20:46.729" style="s2">that&#39;s this logos the logos is the thing that enables you to mediate between a</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.010" end="01:20:50.959" style="s2">Between order and Chaos and maybe you have to have some faith in that it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.959" end="01:20:52.959" style="s2">What should you do [if] someone is harassing you?</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.099" end="01:20:55.998" style="s2">Well, you should fight back okay? What is that?</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.999" end="01:21:02.749" style="s2">What&#39;s the most effective way to fight back well sometimes it&#39;s physical, but that&#39;s not necessarily for the best</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.749" end="01:21:05.539" style="s2">Maybe it&#39;s through articulation</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.539" end="01:21:11.569" style="s2">Maybe it&#39;s through analysis right you want to be sharp you want to be able to decompose a problem you want to be able to?</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.760" end="01:21:16.820" style="s2">Formulate an argument and a counter response and maybe you want to be so good at that that people don&#39;t mess with you to begin</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.820" end="01:21:22.849" style="s2">With and then you&#39;re a perfectly articulate counter monster, and you never have to take your sword out</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.579" end="01:21:27.349" style="s2">That&#39;s that&#39;s the place that you want to be. It&#39;s like people should know</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.050" end="01:21:34.009" style="s2">after three seconds of interacting with you that harassing you [would] be a seriously bad idea and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.769" end="01:21:36.769" style="s2">You&#39;ll have a perfectly fine time with them</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.559" end="01:21:42.319" style="s2">So and that&#39;s part of you know, so there&#39;s some utility in meeting the devil in the underworld</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.110" end="01:21:46.849" style="s2">Right because maybe he&#39;s got something to teach you that&#39;s certainly possible that</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.309" end="01:21:49.819" style="s2">[and] one of the things that you can be taught is that your</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.579" end="01:21:56.299" style="s2">Normative morality which is basically your harmlessness and your naivety masquerading as virtue is</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.809" end="01:22:04.849" style="s2">Completely insufficient to protect you in the world especially against the sorts of things [that] you&#39;re talking about which are tyrant tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.939" end="01:22:09.079" style="s2">Tyrants will push until you push back. It&#39;s in their nature</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.719" end="01:22:11.719" style="s2">They don&#39;t have internal controls</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.849" end="01:22:17.029" style="s2">So they just push and push and push and push and push and push even kids do that like little kids</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.030" end="01:22:20.780" style="s2">Do that all the time they&#39;ll just push you until they hit that wall they&#39;re actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.780" end="01:22:25.009" style="s2">Happy when they hit a wall because the last thing a child wants is a universe without walls</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.860" end="01:22:30.739" style="s2">It terrifies them right they want to see while I&#39;m in a swimming pool. There&#39;s an edge</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.739" end="01:22:33.918" style="s2">They don&#39;t want to see oh, no this isn&#39;t a swimming pool</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.919" end="01:22:37.219" style="s2">This is [an] ocean [I&#39;m] in the middle of an ocean I&#39;m going to drown</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.889" end="01:22:42.078" style="s2">That&#39;s a terrible thing for children. That&#39;s why they need discipline and structure because</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.719" end="01:22:47.629" style="s2">It&#39;s consistency and predictability and routine and all the things that are extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.239" end="01:22:53.719" style="s2">helpful to them okay, so now think of that hierarchy [that] we talked about so</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.200" end="01:22:58.310" style="s2">You&#39;re not in a story. You&#39;re in nested stories</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.310" end="01:23:05.899" style="s2">And the nested stories round themselves in action [in] actual embodied action, so if you&#39;re going to sit if you&#39;re going to be a good</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.080" end="01:23:09.109" style="s2">partner maybe you help</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.140" end="01:23:15.200" style="s2">Prepare the meals and to help prepare the meals means you pick up a plate with your hand</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.200" end="01:23:19.790" style="s2">And you move it physically through space, and you put it on the table. That&#39;s where it stops being an abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.310" end="01:23:22.369" style="s2">So at the bottom of an ethical</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.280" end="01:23:25.170" style="s2">Hierarchy of value are</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.170" end="01:23:30.980" style="s2">actions not things that&#39;s the scientific world, but actions and</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.890" end="01:23:33.890" style="s2">then you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.170" end="01:23:38.029" style="s2">label the actions with abstractions as you move up the hierarchy, so</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.250" end="01:23:41.330" style="s2">You&#39;re good at setting the table so that means you&#39;re good at making dinner</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.330" end="01:23:45.139" style="s2">so that means that you&#39;ve got one element of good being a good partner [in] place and</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.420" end="01:23:49.190" style="s2">being a good partner is one element of being a good person and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.560" end="01:23:54.049" style="s2">You you&#39;re not so good at setting the table, and you say well. I&#39;m [not] a good person. It&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.050" end="01:23:58.340" style="s2">No, you should go down [to] the higher resolution levels of the hierarchy and start there</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.340" end="01:24:05.719" style="s2">and that&#39;s what you do when you&#39;re arguing with [people], but there&#39;s another thing that&#39;s really useful about conceptualizing the Hierarchy in this manner, so</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.310" end="01:24:09.800" style="s2">So I think what we&#39;ll do is</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.800" end="01:24:15.349" style="s2">We&#39;ll stop now [for] 10 minutes and all because I want to bring up this diagram because what I want to do next is</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.500" end="01:24:19.729" style="s2">it&#39;s a bleak story at the moment because the story is something like</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.700" end="01:24:25.880" style="s2">You&#39;re going to lay out oversimplifications in the world, and they&#39;re going to be prone to catastrophic error, and then you have to encounter</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.880" end="01:24:32.929" style="s2">What&#39;s terrifying in order to Progress and so what that means is that progression is always dependent on terror something like that</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.930" end="01:24:37.880" style="s2">And there&#39;s some truth [in] that and that&#39;s why people don&#39;t progress, but it&#39;s not a sufficient truth</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.880" end="01:24:43.429" style="s2">And I want to unpack that when we come back, so let&#39;s come back in 10 minutes, and then I&#39;ll die can unpack that</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.760" end="01:24:48.020" style="s2">There&#39;s this parable in the new testament [that] just came to mind</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.780" end="01:24:52.489" style="s2">I&#39;m going to mangle it a bit because it&#39;s not one that I have well memorized but</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.850" end="01:24:58.280" style="s2">And I&#39;m probably going to conflate two or three stories together, but I think I think [I&#39;ve] got it, right</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.190" end="01:25:02.960" style="s2">Christ is walking down the road and someone picks them up</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.719" end="01:25:05.719" style="s2">the person is rich and</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.829" end="01:25:07.239" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.239" end="01:25:09.239" style="s2">like well wealthy and</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.820" end="01:25:13.380" style="s2">He has a talk they have a talk and the wealthy man, basically</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.530" end="01:25:17.610" style="s2">tells him all the things that are wrong with his life and</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.880" end="01:25:21.599" style="s2">then he asks him what he should do about it and</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.479" end="01:25:26.759" style="s2">Chris says to him you have to give up everything you own and follow me</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.059" end="01:25:30.089" style="s2">And that&#39;s often be read as a criticism of wealth</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.090" end="01:25:36.090" style="s2">And that&#39;s actually not what the story means what the story means is this this guy has a lot of wealth</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.090" end="01:25:40.739" style="s2">but he&#39;s still miserable and so that means that what he has is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.079" end="01:25:46.949" style="s2">Obstacle to what he could be and so that&#39;s the message of the [story] is that if you&#39;re miserable with what you have then you?</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.949" end="01:25:50.518" style="s2">have to let go of what you have so that maybe you could have something else and</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.860" end="01:25:54.690" style="s2">And so and then there&#39;s some commentary on that story</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.690" end="01:26:00.960" style="s2">I think other people are listening and they say well if that&#39;s the price to be paid then</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.539" end="01:26:04.949" style="s2">no one is ever going to pay it, and I think that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.469" end="01:26:11.069" style="s2">statement it is easier for a man to go through the eye of a needle for a camel to go through an eye of</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.530" end="01:26:17.070" style="s2">The eye of a needle than for a rich man to [enter] paradise. [I] believe that&#39;s the derivation of that</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.590" end="01:26:23.849" style="s2">Story and like I said that&#39;s been read as a critique of wealth, but it isn&#39;t it&#39;s a critique of attachment now</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.849" end="01:26:25.849" style="s2">You know in the buddhist doctrine</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.400" end="01:26:29.400" style="s2">one of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.159" end="01:26:33.538" style="s2">impediments to enlightenment is attachment and</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.909" end="01:26:39.149" style="s2">People read that as saying. Well you shouldn&#39;t care for anything in the world, and that&#39;s there&#39;s a nihilism</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.150" end="01:26:45.839" style="s2">That&#39;s associated with that and not and there is a strong nihilistic tendency in buddhism that has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.110" end="01:26:49.059" style="s2">Abandonment of the world do you see that in?</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.059" end="01:26:54.719" style="s2">Christianity to some degree with people going off to lead ascetic lives and to you know it&#39;s part of multiple religious</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.269" end="01:26:56.760" style="s2">traditions that idea of asceticism</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.760" end="01:27:03.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s some utility in it if it is your attachment say to material things or status or whatever that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.820" end="01:27:11.070" style="s2">Interfering with your pSychological progression now the idea is that you [should] let go of whatever it is that&#39;s interfering with your pSychological</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.349" end="01:27:16.078" style="s2">Progression because no matter how valuable what it is. That&#39;s interfering is</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.619" end="01:27:18.619" style="s2">It&#39;s not as valuable as what you&#39;re giving up</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.409" end="01:27:25.228" style="s2">Okay, however the Criticism still stands and the Criticism was well</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.229" end="01:27:29.639" style="s2">if the task is that difficult then no one&#39;s going to do it and</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.159" end="01:27:32.159" style="s2">so in in</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.349" end="01:27:38.099" style="s2">the Brothers karamazov, [there&#39;s] a famous story called the Grand inquisitor and</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.189" end="01:27:41.189" style="s2">it&#39;s a story told by</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.699" end="01:27:48.688" style="s2">Ivan karamasoff to his brother [Elia] and Ivan is a very</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.959" end="01:27:51.429" style="s2">High-status</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.429" end="01:27:53.429" style="s2">intelligent attractive</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.469" end="01:27:55.469" style="s2">Tough minded</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.599" end="01:27:57.309" style="s2">Soldier and</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.309" end="01:28:02.909" style="s2">Alyosha is his younger brother and he&#39;s kind of softer and less rational</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.669" end="01:28:04.929" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.929" end="01:28:06.189" style="s2">spiritual and</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.189" end="01:28:13.409" style="s2">also training to be a no vitiate at the local monastery and Ivan likes to tear strips off it because he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.869" end="01:28:18.989" style="s2">cynic and an atheist and and and in Dostoyevsky&#39;s normal</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.570" end="01:28:22.769" style="s2">Brilliant Manner he makes Ivan an incredibly powerful</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.679" end="01:28:25.269" style="s2">articulate and</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.269" end="01:28:30.599" style="s2">Admirable character, so when dostoyevsky wants to take someone on in his literary investigations</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.599" end="01:28:33.449" style="s2">He doesn&#39;t take his enemy and turn him into some sort of weak</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.179" end="01:28:40.138" style="s2">Puppet he takes his enemy and turns them into the strongest possible enemy he can imagine and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.780" end="01:28:44.429" style="s2">Goes to battle against that it&#39;s a hallmark of Great literature</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.429" end="01:28:47.398" style="s2">It&#39;s what distinguishes dusty sp for example from [Ain] Rand</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.739" end="01:28:53.998" style="s2">Because what ain&#39;t rand does is she takes her she&#39;s a darling of the I would [say] libertarian, right?</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.369" end="01:28:56.010" style="s2">She takes her enemies</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.010" end="01:29:01.439" style="s2">And they&#39;re all the same first of all every single one of her negative characters is exactly the same as every other one</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.439" end="01:29:06.569" style="s2">And they&#39;re all bad you know there&#39;s there&#39;s no redeeming qualities whatsoever in them</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.570" end="01:29:11.219" style="s2">And they also I would say make their weak characters who make weak arguments</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.219" end="01:29:14.638" style="s2">That&#39;s not the way to progress the way to progress is to take your enemy</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.949" end="01:29:20.158" style="s2">Seriously and to even inflate them into something Beyond their [capacity] to inflate themselves</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.199" end="01:29:26.279" style="s2">and then see if you can hammer out a solution to the genuine problem that&#39;s being posed anyway, so</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.859" end="01:29:31.529" style="s2">Dusty else he does that brilliantly always and what makes him, so absolutely remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.530" end="01:29:35.159" style="s2">But anyways, I even tells le Osha this story</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.530" end="01:29:40.860" style="s2">He calls it the [grand] [inquisitor] and that in the story christ comes back to [Earth] in the Spanish inquisition</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.990" end="01:29:43.979" style="s2">[and] he&#39;s he&#39;s out by a fountain and</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.470" end="01:29:50.309" style="s2">People sort of notice him and he starts performing miracles and a big crowd Gathers around and it&#39;s like happy days. You know</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.190" end="01:29:54.419" style="s2">But then the inquisitor shows up this old, you know harsh</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.150" end="01:29:59.910" style="s2">Tyrannical guy and he has his guards arrest him [he] [throws] them in Prison and</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.900" end="01:30:04.620" style="s2">so now christ is in prison and the</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.140" end="01:30:10.709" style="s2">Inquisitor comes down and says to him while you&#39;re probably wondering why which are you in prison you know?</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.900" end="01:30:17.190" style="s2">especially given that were the members [of] the you know were the representatives of the church that you hypothetically found it and and</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.950" end="01:30:21.360" style="s2">christ remains silent through this entire episode and</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.410" end="01:30:27.749" style="s2">the inquisitor basically says look you know you laid down this ethic that</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.170" end="01:30:31.170" style="s2">it&#39;s wonderful, but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.180" end="01:30:32.340" style="s2">Superhuman no one can do it</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.340" end="01:30:38.039" style="s2">It&#39;s asking way too much, and so you&#39;re you put the burden you put on people was just far too great</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.040" end="01:30:43.769" style="s2">And so what we&#39;ve done in the catholic church in the centuries since the church was founded is was lightened the load</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.770" end="01:30:48.209" style="s2">we said well we take ordinary people and say well there here are some things you can do to be a little bit better and</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.210" end="01:30:52.830" style="s2">You [know] we&#39;ve instituted confession and repentance and all that we&#39;ve kind of toned it down</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.050" end="01:30:55.919" style="s2">So that the average person has some hope of progress</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.920" end="01:31:00.990" style="s2">And we&#39;re making Headway and the last bloody thing we need around here is you coming back and like?</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.180" end="01:31:06.689" style="s2">Screwing up all our all our good efforts is like. It was nice to have you around once but once was plenty man</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.690" end="01:31:07.740" style="s2">We don&#39;t need you around anymore</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.740" end="01:31:13.260" style="s2">and so christ listens to this doesn&#39;t say anything and then the inquisitor turns to leave and</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.540" end="01:31:18.390" style="s2">Christ grabs him and kisses him on the lips and the inquisitor turns white and</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.550" end="01:31:21.959" style="s2">Then leaves and when he leaves the door he leaves the door open</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.990" end="01:31:25.199" style="s2">And that&#39;s the end of the story and it&#39;s an amazing story</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.200" end="01:31:30.059" style="s2">It&#39;s an absolutely remarkable story in every possible way and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.030" end="01:31:37.199" style="s2">Dostoevsky was objecting to some degree to the tyranny [of] the catholic church or even of the Christian church for that matter</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.200" end="01:31:41.280" style="s2">But the thing that he did [that] was so damn brilliant is that he even made the inquisitor leave the door open</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.070" end="01:31:47.620" style="s2">No, and as a [bellas] critique of Catholicism even during the inquisition. It&#39;s so brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.750" end="01:31:54.189" style="s2">It&#39;s so emblematic of dostoyevsky&#39;s take on the world that he criticized the inquisitorial</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.950" end="01:32:02.079" style="s2">Aspect of Christianity and of course, it&#39;s the tyrannical aspect of any belief system, but noted that they bloody well left the door open</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.470" end="01:32:04.839" style="s2">Right so it&#39;s Brilliant. It&#39;s Brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.420" end="01:32:12.129" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s remarkable. So anyways the whole point that I&#39;m making here. Is that there are terrible?</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.680" end="01:32:14.680" style="s2">impediments to enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.080" end="01:32:20.140" style="s2">the light is the impediments are the necessity of sacrifice and the necessity area of</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.480" end="01:32:24.879" style="s2">Necessity of the Voluntary acceptance of suffering [I] mean you see that in buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.880" end="01:32:28.690" style="s2">You know because one [of] the canons of [buddhist] one of the fundamental [principles] of buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.690" end="01:32:32.740" style="s2">Is that life is suffering and that attachment makes it worse and well?</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.470" end="01:32:36.579" style="s2">It isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t precisely attachment [its]</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.880" end="01:32:44.980" style="s2">Attachment to things such that you cannot release the things when it&#39;s time to let them go [right] [so] like you&#39;re a Phoenix</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.320" end="01:32:50.530" style="s2">You&#39;re [a] hundred years old your feathers. They&#39;re not working anymore, right? You&#39;re all wrinkly you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.540" end="01:32:53.439" style="s2">It&#39;s time to burst into flames and be reborn</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.440" end="01:32:56.980" style="s2">but you don&#39;t want to burn off your feathers you want to cling to them and</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.110" end="01:32:59.980" style="s2">That&#39;s not good because you have to be willing to undergo that</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.740" end="01:33:02.740" style="s2">Transformation process and that involves</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.020" end="01:33:08.109" style="s2">Like you know if you if you take your po self apart because you&#39;ve made a mistake and you find out</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.330" end="01:33:10.330" style="s2">What it is about you that&#39;s not?</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.670" end="01:33:11.800" style="s2">Set up properly</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.800" end="01:33:17.410" style="s2">And that&#39;s why the mistake occurred that&#39;s really going to happen for example when an intimate relationship breaks down</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.600" end="01:33:20.140" style="s2">then you have to be in a position where you&#39;re willing to let</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.570" end="01:33:21.170" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.170" end="01:33:27.670" style="s2">Errors that are part of your character that define you right they might even be part of your [identity] you have to let you have</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.670" end="01:33:31.720" style="s2">To be willing to let them go you have to be willing to let them burn off and that&#39;s a hell of a thing to</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.720" end="01:33:39.280" style="s2">Ask and so then the [question] might be well is there a less radical solution to the problem then then then?</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.890" end="01:33:45.549" style="s2">Crucifixion and resurrection or the total emulation and regeneration because that&#39;s the archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.220" end="01:33:51.909" style="s2">What&#39;s that&#39;s the archetypal end point that if you want to put your self together you have to die and be reborn?</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.910" end="01:33:54.039" style="s2">[I] mean that in that motif comes up all the [time]</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.980" end="01:34:02.000" style="s2">In in popular popular stories and in mythology and so they here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.280" end="01:34:05.539" style="s2">How I think that problem can be?</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.510" end="01:34:08.510" style="s2">resolved so</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.150" end="01:34:12.349" style="s2">Let&#39;s go back to the Enochian Story momentarily</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.930" end="01:34:19.309" style="s2">so what happens and that the pinocchio story to me [is] analogous in its structure to the sermon on the mount so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.310" end="01:34:20.010" style="s2">make a</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.010" end="01:34:24.829" style="s2">Parallel between those two things so basically what the [sermon] on the [mount] suggests is that?</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.470" end="01:34:26.820" style="s2">you should</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.820" end="01:34:32.269" style="s2">conceptualize the highest good that you&#39;re capable of conceptualizing and orient yourself towards that and</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.640" end="01:34:35.059" style="s2">That having done that you [should] live in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.090" end="01:34:38.090" style="s2">So it&#39;s not like you should live in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.640" end="01:34:42.079" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t say [that] because that&#39;s often christ the hippie</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.080" end="01:34:45.470" style="s2">You know so the hippies who have adopted that or that?</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.930" end="01:34:49.369" style="s2">That&#39;s sort of that that element of Christianity say well</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.370" end="01:34:51.330" style="s2">you live for the moment you know and and</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.330" end="01:34:56.660" style="s2">And in meditation and other practices some of the attempt is to get you to live in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.700" end="01:34:59.780" style="s2">But you know just to tell people to live in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.780" end="01:35:04.670" style="s2">It&#39;s like what what the hell kind of advice is that what about the future? You know that is not helpful advice</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.400" end="01:35:11.420" style="s2">Somebody comes to you, and they&#39;re suffering dreadfully because you know their mother has alzheimer&#39;s and they&#39;re unemployed well live in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.430" end="01:35:15.769" style="s2">It&#39;s like that&#39;s just not helpful. It&#39;s it&#39;s and because it&#39;s even worse than that</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.770" end="01:35:17.280" style="s2">It&#39;s judgmental you say well</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.280" end="01:35:23.269" style="s2">the only reason you&#39;re suffering is because you haven&#39;t oriented yourself property to live in the moment like no you&#39;re suffering because your</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.430" end="01:35:28.610" style="s2">Mother has alzheimer&#39;s and you don&#39;t have a job. It&#39;s like. It&#39;s not because you aren&#39;t living in the moment, so</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.760" end="01:35:32.599" style="s2">Living in the moment isn&#39;t the right answer</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.270" end="01:35:40.340" style="s2">The right answer is something more like orient yourself towards the highest good that you can imagine and then act in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.340" end="01:35:45.289" style="s2">That&#39;s a whole different story now. That&#39;s what happens in the pinocchio story, basically what happens is that Geppetto?</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.990" end="01:35:48.409" style="s2">sees the star beckoning in the distance</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.410" end="01:35:54.889" style="s2">And he orient&#39;s himself towards the highest good he can imagine he wants to take this creation of his and so this is</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.670" end="01:36:04.429" style="s2">Manifesting itself conceptually at multiple levels simultaneously because there&#39;s a there&#39;s a story about the destiny of humanity in relationship to God</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.740" end="01:36:06.979" style="s2">Nested in the story. It&#39;s like take your</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.770" end="01:36:09.770" style="s2">fallible creation your puppet and</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.500" end="01:36:21.140" style="s2">Set [up] the pre. Set up the condition such that. It&#39;s capable of taking on full functional independence. It&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.140" end="01:36:25.490" style="s2">So that&#39;s what you do if you&#39;re a good parent with your children. You don&#39;t protect them. You don&#39;t offer them safety</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.770" end="01:36:29.899" style="s2">You don&#39;t do any of that except insofar as it&#39;s necessary to facilitate</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.720" end="01:36:32.130" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.130" end="01:36:34.130" style="s2">Development as</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.200" end="01:36:41.389" style="s2">Fully confident and courageous beings the purpose of the protection is only to allow that developmental process to to continue</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.390" end="01:36:49.369" style="s2">So you you orient [Geppetto] orient&#39;s himself and so the farther orient&#39;s himself and then the son undertakes the voyage and so</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.340" end="01:36:52.370" style="s2">[alright], so let&#39;s say that that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.330" end="01:36:58.249" style="s2">you orient yourself first then you can start to rely on your</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.040" end="01:37:03.140" style="s2">Then you can start to concentrate more on your orientation to the moment</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.050" end="01:37:06.050" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.450" end="01:37:12.019" style="s2">I&#39;m going to tell you another story. So you know I was just watching harry Potter the other day the first one and</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.540" end="01:37:14.540" style="s2">I was watching the quidditch game</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.570" end="01:37:19.820" style="s2">And the quidditch game is very interesting because there&#39;s a game and a meta game going on at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.980" end="01:37:22.609" style="s2">So the game is just the standard quidditch game</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.610" end="01:37:27.560" style="s2">It&#39;s kind of like basketball played on brooms right you have to throw balls through hoops and if you get enough points you win</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.720" end="01:37:31.039" style="s2">But at the same time so there&#39;s the normal players</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.040" end="01:37:36.229" style="s2">and then there&#39;s two seekers one from each team and the seekers aren&#39;t playing the same game the</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.070" end="01:37:45.140" style="s2">Game is nested inside the seeker game actually because if you&#39;re a seeker, and you perform your task that everyone wins right you win</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.170" end="01:37:48.890" style="s2">But everyone wins and so you&#39;re not even playing the normal game</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.020" end="01:37:52.580" style="s2">You&#39;re playing the seeker game and the thing that that that</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.070" end="01:37:58.550" style="s2">Harry Potter chases is this thing called the snitch and the snitch. This is one of the things that&#39;s I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.550" end="01:38:01.399" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how the hell Jk. Rowling figured this out</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.400" end="01:38:08.180" style="s2">I cannot figure it out because that snitch is a winged ball right and there&#39;s there&#39;s actually a symbol of that winged Ball</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.310" end="01:38:13.999" style="s2">Called the round Chaos which jung describes in his works on alchemy and his works on healthy are really really difficult</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.000" end="01:38:19.700" style="s2">It&#39;s [not] [easy] to figure out what he&#39;s talking [about] at all, but the round Chaos which is a winged ball is</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.460" end="01:38:28.310" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a manifest a of the spirit Mercury and Mercury is an emissary of the God, so you can think about mercury [uh] the</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.890" end="01:38:33.919" style="s2">Unconscious manifesting itself in your in your field of experience something like that</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.260" end="01:38:40.760" style="s2">In any case the the round Chaos is the container of the primordial</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.160" end="01:38:45.079" style="s2">Material from which the world is made and I think about it like this</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.080" end="01:38:48.080" style="s2">It&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.930" end="01:38:50.930" style="s2">there, it&#39;s [that]</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.719" end="01:38:55.549" style="s2">So when you encounter an anomaly an error?</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.730" end="01:39:01.430" style="s2">It&#39;s a container. That&#39;s a way of conceptualizing it and what is it contained?</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.530" end="01:39:08.090" style="s2">Well it contains in some sense it contains the whole world but but here&#39;s an example like look let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.930" end="01:39:14.149" style="s2">God let&#39;s say that you&#39;ve had repeated fights with your wife about how</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.000" end="01:39:18.200" style="s2">domestic duties are going to be arranged among around meal time and</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.810" end="01:39:21.049" style="s2">you believe me you&#39;re going to have those fights and</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.510" end="01:39:28.730" style="s2">So and so what&#39;s happening? Is that mealtimes are unpleasant because there&#39;s a war for power going on in the kitchen</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.340" end="01:39:31.170" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.170" end="01:39:34.100" style="s2">So then you think one day while you&#39;re going to you know?</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.100" end="01:39:37.100" style="s2">note that and you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.190" end="01:39:43.819" style="s2">Do an archeological investigation and find out just what the hell is going on and so you start?</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.300" end="01:39:48.440" style="s2">unpacking the fact that mealtimes are not pleasant and</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.140" end="01:39:53.149" style="s2">So what&#39;s in that little thing that you&#39;re unpacking that package well?</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.330" end="01:39:59.749" style="s2">the entire power dynamic between men and women in the Modern world is inside [that] dispute and</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.800" end="01:40:07.250" style="s2">you might find that part of the reason [that] your wife is upset about the way that mealtimes are arranged because is because</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.650" end="01:40:10.640" style="s2">Her [grandmother] was beat by her grandfather</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.640" end="01:40:17.779" style="s2">And that&#39;s playing a role in it played a role [in] determining her unconscious expectations</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.780" end="01:40:21.680" style="s2">And that&#39;s pathologizing one of the day to day rituals in the house</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.680" end="01:40:27.049" style="s2">and if you&#39;re going to unpack that you&#39;re going to have to unpack all of that into you take a</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.510" end="01:40:30.440" style="s2">Little Monster, and you decompose it you find out it&#39;s a hydra</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.440" end="01:40:36.230" style="s2">it&#39;s got 50 heads then you have to work through every single one of those it&#39;s really really difficult, so</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.659" end="01:40:40.279" style="s2">It&#39;s a container that [contains] everything, but the thing is if you unpack it</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.409" end="01:40:44.569" style="s2">Successfully let&#39;s say and you deal with it you go see eight a consensus</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.880" end="01:40:49.250" style="s2">Then all of a sudden you get you get peace say around your mealtimes. Which is a major accomplishment</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.380" end="01:40:51.889" style="s2">Man, because you have to eat three times a day</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.889" end="01:40:55.909" style="s2">And it&#39;s the center of the household and all of them, so but the thing is is that</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.969" end="01:40:58.230" style="s2">often</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.230" end="01:41:01.879" style="s2">when you&#39;re especially in the context of an intimate relationship</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.400" end="01:41:08.210" style="s2">Things will Emerge that produce discontinuities and the question is what should your attitude towards that discontinuity be?</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.460" end="01:41:11.839" style="s2">Well you can punish the person for manifesting the discontinuity</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.940" end="01:41:16.909" style="s2">That&#39;s the tyrannical aspect or you can let it take the whole thing apart and that will happen</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.909" end="01:41:21.169" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s often how relationships end. Is that a discontinuity emerges and</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.110" end="01:41:29.659" style="s2">People get into it and things go sideways so badly that the whole relationship descends into [Chaos] and people bail out of it</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.300" end="01:41:33.710" style="s2">so it&#39;s no wonder that people want to ignore it and</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.409" end="01:41:39.529" style="s2">It&#39;s also no wonder that. They want to tyrannize it. It&#39;s like quit bothering me with that well</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.809" end="01:41:50.719" style="s2">Possibly, but probably not and also if my attitude towards you is quit bothering me with that your attitude towards me when I?</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.719" end="01:41:56.239" style="s2">Have the same sort of problem in reverse. It&#39;s going to be exactly the same and so we&#39;re not going to get anywhere with it</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.059" end="01:41:58.619" style="s2">All right</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.619" end="01:42:00.619" style="s2">But that still is</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.110" end="01:42:03.290" style="s2">painful now, let&#39;s go back to the</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.230" end="01:42:07.099" style="s2">Quidditch issue now. Here&#39;s what happens is that?</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.210" end="01:42:14.929" style="s2">harry Potter is picked to be the seeker so that means he is the seeker whatever he represents is the seeker [and]</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.110" end="01:42:23.270" style="s2">He&#39;s an interesting character [because] he&#39;s touched by evil, and he&#39;s a rule breaker, and he&#39;s also kind of a normal kid</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.270" end="01:42:26.299" style="s2">He&#39;s not [a] hyper intellect or anything like that. That&#39;s hermione&#39;s rule, right?</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.730" end="01:42:32.449" style="s2">so he&#39;s normal but but super normal at the same time and he gets picked to be the seeker and and</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.730" end="01:42:38.959" style="s2">Then you think about what is it he seeks, and he seeks this thing that glimmers rioted it flashes in front of him</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.960" end="01:42:46.460" style="s2">It&#39;s made out of gold and it has wings and if he grabs it then he wins and so the question is</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.800" end="01:42:48.420" style="s2">What does [that] represent?</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.420" end="01:42:50.750" style="s2">Now it&#39;s interesting that when people watch that movie</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.750" end="01:42:53.959" style="s2">They actually find that you know they think that that&#39;s kind of cool that it&#39;s a cool game</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.600" end="01:42:55.650" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.650" end="01:42:59.629" style="s2">It is [a] cool game. She laid it out very nicely and the idea is that well</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.630" end="01:43:02.480" style="s2">There&#39;s a game and if you play it normally you win the game</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.670" end="01:43:06.319" style="s2">But in that game is a meta game and if you play that properly then not only do you win?</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.320" end="01:43:12.799" style="s2">But everybody wins so then the next rule is the meta game supersedes the game and that&#39;s the same idea that</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.800" end="01:43:14.840" style="s2">I&#39;m chasing here with you today about this</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.420" end="01:43:21.920" style="s2">Meta morality it&#39;s the it&#39;s the morality that emerges as a consequence of the analysis of a set of morality or it&#39;s the morality</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.320" end="01:43:29.630" style="s2">It&#39;s the morality to which other all other morality should [be] subjugated that&#39;s another way of [thinking] about it, and [I] said well</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.630" end="01:43:35.960" style="s2">That&#39;s a terrible thing because it involves painful sacrifice or maybe it involves confronting the thing you least want to confront</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.960" end="01:43:39.290" style="s2">That&#39;s the union dictum right if your life, isn&#39;t all that</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.290" end="01:43:45.529" style="s2">it should be then you should find out the thing that you least want to confront that you&#39;re avoiding and confront that and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.530" end="01:43:51.230" style="s2">Easy to say but it&#39;s a terrible thing because it means you&#39;re going to have to turn your gaze [to] the place where you are</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.330" end="01:43:55.279" style="s2">Weakest and most vulnerable that is asking a lot [of] people</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.830" end="01:43:58.459" style="s2">so then you might say [well] is there an alternative and</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.489" end="01:44:04.669" style="s2">I think there is an alternative, so this is the anomaly right this is the ball that contains everything</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.670" end="01:44:08.810" style="s2">I think there is an alternative. I think it&#39;s associated with this idea, so</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.330" end="01:44:11.330" style="s2">Imagine</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.969" end="01:44:16.009" style="s2">Imagine we have a we could have a conflict if we were in a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.010" end="01:44:19.400" style="s2">We could have a conflict that would blow the relationship apart all right</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.400" end="01:44:23.270" style="s2">So we don&#39;t want to have that conflict and then we could have no conflict whatsoever</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.640" end="01:44:28.249" style="s2">[which] means that you would never get to say what you wanted and I would never get to say what I wanted because</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.949" end="01:44:29.910" style="s2">We&#39;re either</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.910" end="01:44:36.680" style="s2">Identical which is just not happening or we&#39;re going to have conflict because you&#39;re going to want some things that I don&#39;t want and vice-versa</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.920" end="01:44:39.170" style="s2">So if there&#39;s no conflict, we are not in a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.810" end="01:44:47.299" style="s2">[all] right, so zero conflict is the wrong amount and conflict it destroys the [relationship] is the wrong amount and then you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.690" end="01:44:51.710" style="s2">Okay, what&#39;s the optimal amount of conflict?</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.920" end="01:44:57.020" style="s2">Well, so so so then we can think about how people respond emotionally</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.090" end="01:45:02.520" style="s2">So let&#39;s say if you go after the person that you&#39;re arguing with and you say you&#39;re a bad person</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.310" end="01:45:07.769" style="s2">And you really make that case [you&#39;re] bloody well [hammered] home you remember 50 things they&#39;ve done that</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.770" end="01:45:10.470" style="s2">We&#39;re bad and you lay them out like I&#39;m going to stomp you</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.470" end="01:45:13.199" style="s2">You&#39;re a bad person you really need to change okay?</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.200" end="01:45:15.570" style="s2">Well first of all you&#39;re going to meet tremendous resistance</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.570" end="01:45:20.249" style="s2">And that&#39;s like you&#39;ve got the hydrogen you bring in a hydrogen bomb to the war right and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.500" end="01:45:25.919" style="s2">Unless you want to destroy everything maybe that&#39;s not the most logical solution, but then by the same token</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.530" end="01:45:30.989" style="s2">Everything is [alright], and we never have any conflict that&#39;s not helpful either, and you&#39;re going to get bored of that</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.990" end="01:45:36.599" style="s2">And you&#39;re not going to develop and so then the [question] is well. Maybe there&#39;s some happy medium here</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.510" end="01:45:44.249" style="s2">Maybe you want to be repairing this structure. You know the structure that goes from micro actions up to higher-order?</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.040" end="01:45:51.180" style="s2">Conceptualizations, maybe you want to be updating that on a constant basis, and you want to update it in a manner that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.120" end="01:45:55.769" style="s2">Drop you into Chaos or place you in too much spaces</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.770" end="01:46:01.229" style="s2">And then that answer is well how then then the question is how is it that you can calibrate?</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.780" end="01:46:08.249" style="s2">your approach to error so that you get the benefits of doing it without the disadvantage of collapsing into Chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.710" end="01:46:12.060" style="s2">then the issue the answer to that is something like</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.520" end="01:46:17.520" style="s2">it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.000" end="01:46:21.180" style="s2">Once you have decided to adopt</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.300" end="01:46:27.629" style="s2">Responsibility for being and will say that what that means is that you have</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.660" end="01:46:29.800" style="s2">conceptualized</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.800" end="01:46:31.390" style="s2">A</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.390" end="01:46:37.829" style="s2">Good that you&#39;re willing to devote yourself to and I think you you&#39;re perfectly welcome to do that on an individual basis</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.830" end="01:46:45.600" style="s2">[I] think you should do it on an individual basis. You should consult with your ancestors [while] you&#39;re doing that because generally speaking</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.210" end="01:46:48.070" style="s2">the route to</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.070" end="01:46:49.510" style="s2">optimal</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.510" end="01:46:53.219" style="s2">the route to to quality of Life and productivity</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.890" end="01:46:57.899" style="s2">Has been laid [out] by other people we kind of know what the parameters are</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.150" end="01:47:01.140" style="s2">you need to do something that other people find is useful and</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.780" end="01:47:05.459" style="s2">and and you have to regard it as useful as well or</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.070" end="01:47:09.029" style="s2">At least you have to be entertaining there has to be something about you</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.030" end="01:47:12.419" style="s2">Have value to other people that you have to pursue with a fair bit [of] diligence</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.080" end="01:47:16.769" style="s2">So you have to play a productive social role?</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.670" end="01:47:20.670" style="s2">probably need friends</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.370" end="01:47:28.349" style="s2">Probably need an intimate relationship, and if it could be medium to long [term] in for an intimate relationship perhaps all the better</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.350" end="01:47:33.779" style="s2">That&#39;s what most societies hold up as ideal could assume. Well. There&#39;s probably a reason for that</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.780" end="01:47:38.640" style="s2">I think one of the reasons is is that your life gets fragmented otherwise Badly fragmented you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.980" end="01:47:41.279" style="s2">Because every time you have a long term relationship</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.860" end="01:47:48.930" style="s2">And it fragments. It&#39;s like your identity is blown into pieces you get fragmented across time it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.030" end="01:47:52.950" style="s2">It&#39;s it breaks you into pieces and you don&#39;t necessarily recover that well</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.040" end="01:47:55.840" style="s2">It makes everything</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.840" end="01:47:57.840" style="s2">much more in</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.090" end="01:47:59.680" style="s2">permanent and</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.680" end="01:48:04.859" style="s2">Unreliable all of those things so it it introduces a tremendous amount of uncertainty into your life</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.860" end="01:48:07.440" style="s2">And it also means that you don&#39;t have anyone around that you can really trust</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.440" end="01:48:12.089" style="s2">and that&#39;s bad because if you have someone around you can really trust and you have two brains instead of one and</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.280" end="01:48:16.140" style="s2">Like you probably need two brains to manage your way through life. It&#39;s pretty complicated</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.000" end="01:48:21.359" style="s2">So you orient yourself towards some good?</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.120" end="01:48:24.899" style="s2">The highest good that you can conceptualize and it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.690" end="01:48:30.690" style="s2">Through a consultation with your ancestors because you need to do the things that people have always done</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.730" end="01:48:32.879" style="s2">[and] you need to do them properly and</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.950" end="01:48:37.079" style="s2">You need to assume that that&#39;s the way that you should live unless you have a very good reason</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.330" end="01:48:41.430" style="s2">To change it dramatically and maybe you do, but you got to start with some</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.700" end="01:48:48.389" style="s2">Axiomatic set of presuppositions because otherwise you have to invent everything on your own, and you don&#39;t have enough time to do that</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.390" end="01:48:53.640" style="s2">So you have to use normative guidelines and if you don&#39;t then people won&#39;t know what to do with you</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.640" end="01:48:58.140" style="s2">That&#39;s another big problem. If you live completely outside the norm. I mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.780" end="01:49:04.770" style="s2">Remarkable artists manage that to some degree, but of course they pay [for] the privilege by being remarkable artists</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.770" end="01:49:11.310" style="s2">so if there&#39;s something truly remarkable about you perhaps you could justify deviating from the normative path, but if there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.880" end="01:49:19.560" style="s2">First of all there&#39;s nothing remarkable enough about you to justify deviating in every way [from] the normative path no matter how remarkable you are</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.930" end="01:49:21.460" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.460" end="01:49:26.790" style="s2">So that&#39;s part of the the rescuing of the father from from the depths is to</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.460" end="01:49:32.280" style="s2">Reunite yourself with the structures of your community you can do that in a way that you feel</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.370" end="01:49:40.470" style="s2">Suits your own needs best, but I don&#39;t think you cannot do it because it makes you weak, and then you&#39;ll drown</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.220" end="01:49:44.760" style="s2">All right, so let&#39;s say you have oriented yourself</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.150" end="01:49:48.960" style="s2">But not perfectly because you&#39;re full of mistakes and errors</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.930" end="01:49:54.599" style="s2">So then what do you do because you have to fix those errors, but you still have to be oriented</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.860" end="01:50:00.870" style="s2">And this is why I started getting to to get interested in the phenomena of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.870" end="01:50:09.390" style="s2">As a phenomenological experience to experience something as meaningful, it&#39;s not exactly obvious what that means to experience something is meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.390" end="01:50:12.749" style="s2">[I] think that you can you can approach it obliquely</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.750" end="01:50:18.750" style="s2">You know like if I said watch yourself for two weeks and notice when you&#39;re doing something that you regard is meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.750" end="01:50:21.060" style="s2">I could say well. Here&#39;s some here&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.880" end="01:50:27.510" style="s2">Markers you lose a sense of time you lose a sense of vulnerability, you&#39;re deeply engaged in it it seems</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.510" end="01:50:32.069" style="s2">It seems worth the effort right you forget yourself while you&#39;re doing [it]</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.710" end="01:50:35.879" style="s2">Maybe you forget your existential concerns while you&#39;re doing it you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.020" end="01:50:45.810" style="s2">Ruminating or obsessing about the meaning of your life, right so so there&#39;s markers for it&#39;s like the flow states that [cSIkszentmihalyi] described</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.860" end="01:50:49.860" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.870" end="01:50:54.390" style="s2">Then you can experience it you experience it under certain Sort of ritualistic conditions</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.390" end="01:50:58.200" style="s2">You might experience it when you go see a great movie you might experience it when you listen [to] music</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.200" end="01:51:04.169" style="s2">I think music is a very very standard pathway for people to have that kind of experience because</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.600" end="01:51:10.019" style="s2">Virtually everyone gets intimations of mute of meaning from music and I think music</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.600" end="01:51:12.490" style="s2">music is</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.490" end="01:51:18.449" style="s2">Hierarchically structured patterns that are representative of being laying itself out properly</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.450" end="01:51:23.280" style="s2">It&#39;s something like that, so it&#39;s an abstract representation of proper being and so</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.800" end="01:51:29.669" style="s2">We can we can grapple with the phenomena of music and we can we can bach or phenomena of meaning we can box it in?</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.670" end="01:51:31.670" style="s2">A little bit and start to conceptualize it</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.760" end="01:51:40.049" style="s2">We can start to conceptualize it perhaps as the manifestation of a deep instinct, and so I would say well</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.780" end="01:51:43.109" style="s2">Meaning is what NFS itself?</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.870" end="01:51:45.870" style="s2">when you are</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.750" end="01:51:49.049" style="s2">when you&#39;ve oriented yourself properly and</p>

<p begin="01:52:03.150" end="01:52:04.570" style="s2">Want it to be predictable?</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.570" end="01:52:09.840" style="s2">but you don&#39;t want it to be perfectly predictable you want to be it to be predictable with some interesting variations and</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.120" end="01:52:14.579" style="s2">Predictable with some variations that make sense. Maybe you can conceptualize that as something like this. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.219" end="01:52:17.219" style="s2">it&#39;s predictable at this order of</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.250" end="01:52:25.229" style="s2">Stability, but it&#39;s it&#39;s varying down here from time to time and so you&#39;ve got stable stability there</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.230" end="01:52:28.770" style="s2">But variability there and you can handle that so you want</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.290" end="01:52:30.640" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.640" end="01:52:33.689" style="s2">overarching structure of stability with some internal variability and</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.300" end="01:52:37.200" style="s2">Maybe that&#39;s the way that you update yourself without falling apart</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.200" end="01:52:42.329" style="s2">and then I would say you can find the pathway to the optimal rate of</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.360" end="01:52:47.850" style="s2">Update by relying on your sense of meaning. That&#39;s what it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.550" end="01:52:53.279" style="s2">what it tells you is that you&#39;re you&#39;re wandering your way through the world between the</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.730" end="01:53:00.000" style="s2">Catastrophes of Chaos and the catastrophes of order and now and then you swing into the proper locale</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.580" end="01:53:06.749" style="s2">You&#39;re where you should be and what happens is you get engaged by that you get meaningfully engaged by that and it&#39;s fragile</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.820" end="01:53:10.290" style="s2">It&#39;ll move on you right because it&#39;s very difficult to exist at that</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.020" end="01:53:12.250" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.250" end="01:53:15.899" style="s2">Constantly your bad habits all sorts of things your situation</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.900" end="01:53:17.969" style="s2">There&#39;s all sorts of things that are going to interfere [with] that</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.969" end="01:53:22.829" style="s2">But that doesn&#39;t mean that that isn&#39;t where you should be and so then you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.830" end="01:53:27.600" style="s2">That&#39;s where you should strive to be all the time and then the question might be well</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.600" end="01:53:33.329" style="s2">What would it be like if you [were] there all [the] [time], and I [think] that&#39;s where intimations of Paradise</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.810" end="01:53:41.609" style="s2">Come from I mean when words think it was wordsworth talked about intimations of immortality and childhood people tend to romanticize</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.890" end="01:53:44.129" style="s2">their childhood because of the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.830" end="01:53:52.529" style="s2">Intense engagement that goes along with [being] a child and it&#39;s one of the wonderful things about being around children actually it&#39;s it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.530" end="01:53:57.200" style="s2">They pay you for their care and the way the children pay you for their care</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.200" end="01:54:03.890" style="s2">Is that they turn normal things into Magic again when you&#39;re around them because you&#39;ve seen it a hundred times before</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.160" end="01:54:06.290" style="s2">And so when you see it, you don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.290" end="01:54:08.100" style="s2">You see what you already know</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.100" end="01:54:13.459" style="s2">But when a child sees it they don&#39;t because they don&#39;t know they see it and then when you watch them see it</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.530" end="01:54:16.670" style="s2">You see it too, and so it&#39;s just tremendous fun</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.340" end="01:54:23.270" style="s2">Leading a small child around to do things that you&#39;ve done before because they&#39;re [sold] you know, they&#39;re like this</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.340" end="01:54:28.370" style="s2">They&#39;re like all the time, and you know maybe that&#39;s too much and they cry and they get upset and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.370" end="01:54:29.750" style="s2">but a good part of the time</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.750" end="01:54:33.140" style="s2">It&#39;s just wild-eyed wonder and then you can see the world through their eyes</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.140" end="01:54:40.579" style="s2">And it&#39;s payment, and so that&#39;s that sense of being engaged like that is something that people love about children and rightly</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.580" end="01:54:42.580" style="s2">so, but it&#39;s also a marker to</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.990" end="01:54:46.699" style="s2">the proper way of being you know there&#39;s a dictum in the</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.190" end="01:54:52.640" style="s2">As a union idea that there&#39;s no difference between the archetype of the wise old man and the archetype of the child</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.640" end="01:54:58.489" style="s2">They&#39;re the same thing because the wise old man is the person who found what he had in childhood, but lost</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.130" end="01:55:06.319" style="s2">Right it said that&#39;s a very powerful motif is that the purpose of maturation is to return to the state of childhood as a mature?</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.570" end="01:55:09.080" style="s2">Being not to stay in the state of childhood</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.110" end="01:55:15.290" style="s2">That&#39;s peter pan, but to make the sacrifice is necessary for Maturation and then return</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.080" end="01:55:20.239" style="s2">So well how do you do that? Well you do that in part by noting what it is</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.240" end="01:55:27.050" style="s2">That&#39;s meaningful you for you to engage in I would say it&#39;s your nervous system reporting to you right hemisphere and left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.480" end="01:55:32.779" style="s2">Balanced that the balance between Chaos and order produces an output that says you are [in] the right place</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.850" end="01:55:39.289" style="s2">It&#39;s a perception the meaning is a perception of being in the right place. It&#39;s the genuine thing however</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.110" end="01:55:42.110" style="s2">because it can be</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.210" end="01:55:48.500" style="s2">Pathologized that&#39;s the thing and that&#39;s why I think there&#39;s a call to virtue in most great religious traditions if you&#39;re going to rely [on]</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.500" end="01:55:54.679" style="s2">Your sense of meaning to orient you you have to play a straight game because otherwise you warp and twist</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.900" end="01:56:00.920" style="s2">The inputs and then the mechanism won&#39;t function properly you [know]. It&#39;s like if you if you were only</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.740" end="01:56:06.140" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;ve blinded yourself to half the world you can&#39;t use your</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.480" end="01:56:11.329" style="s2">Perception story and your self properly because the half the world that you&#39;re ignoring is going to pop up at you</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.489" end="01:56:14.059" style="s2">unexpectedly and take you down, and so if your</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.639" end="01:56:16.639" style="s2">Relationship with the world isn&#39;t pristine</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.100" end="01:56:21.739" style="s2">Honest primarily, then you can&#39;t rely on your own internal orienting mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.739" end="01:56:24.739" style="s2">And then you either fall into Chaos which is an absolute catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.780" end="01:56:29.480" style="s2">Or you have to rely on some kind of external authority and that makes you prone to</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.150" end="01:56:31.530" style="s2">Possession by Tyrannical</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.530" end="01:56:37.190" style="s2">Ideologies for example which give you that sense of meaning that you should in fact have as a consequence of your own action</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.719" end="01:56:50.658" style="s2">but okay, so if if all relationships are</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.260" end="01:56:54.260" style="s2">our sort of</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.010" end="01:56:58.000" style="s2">predicated on of this balance between</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.640" end="01:57:00.640" style="s2">no, conflict and</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.950" end="01:57:02.950" style="s2">conflict that destruct</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.130" end="01:57:07.960" style="s2">[that] if we will look if we were to look at this at a more macro level</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.989" end="01:57:10.730" style="s2">We see this</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.730" end="01:57:12.110" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.110" end="01:57:18.880" style="s2">matte effect in in history in our world like with conflict in between countries in the two systems</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.160" end="01:57:20.750" style="s2">Ideology EtC</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.750" end="01:57:24.399" style="s2">But what is this sort of navigation between?</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.920" end="01:57:32.259" style="s2">The exact line of no consequences [conflicts] how does that not imply that some people are inherently?</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.780" end="01:57:34.700" style="s2">due to Chaos</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.700" end="01:57:36.170" style="s2">It might</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.170" end="01:57:39.190" style="s2">imply that you know what are the things so look so</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.020" end="01:57:44.020" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.200" end="01:57:47.200" style="s2">Sometimes you don&#39;t have an answer [that] works</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.469" end="01:57:51.879" style="s2">you can answer that produces the highest probability of success and</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.640" end="01:57:57.700" style="s2">Like I could view the archetypal world from a religious perspective and say that</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.400" end="01:58:03.819" style="s2">There&#39;s such a thing as ultimate and final [redemption]. That&#39;s a metaphysical claim. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to do that</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.820" end="01:58:08.860" style="s2">I think it&#39;s independent of what I&#39;m talking about what I&#39;m saying. Is that there&#39;s an archetypal path</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.860" end="01:58:12.100" style="s2">That&#39;s laid out in in the mythology of the hero, and it&#39;s your best bet</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.830" end="01:58:18.759" style="s2">That&#39;s all it&#39;s your best bet. It doesn&#39;t mean that if you apply it that everything is going to turn out</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.820" end="01:58:22.989" style="s2">The way you might want it to turn out but but I would say this</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.690" end="01:58:26.770" style="s2">There&#39;s a way of there&#39;s an interesting twist on that, too</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.780" end="01:58:31.120" style="s2">this is one of the things that I came to understand about trying to speak the truth is that</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.810" end="01:58:38.439" style="s2">You can make an assumption you can make a fundamental assumption based on your ignorance</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.440" end="01:58:45.040" style="s2">Let&#39;s say and the in eradicable quality of your ignorance, but you can&#39;t compute the best possible outcome</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.590" end="01:58:48.819" style="s2">What you can do instead is make a decision and one decision is well</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.820" end="01:58:50.820" style="s2">I&#39;m going to say what I think and see what happens and</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.950" end="01:58:54.669" style="s2">Then you can define that as the best possible outcome</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.950" end="01:58:58.689" style="s2">Now you might say well now and then that&#39;s going to lead you into Chaos. It&#39;s like yeah, it is</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.390" end="01:59:02.140" style="s2">It is it&#39;s a strange. It&#39;s a strange inversion</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.040" end="01:59:06.430" style="s2">But regardless of all doubt I would still say</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.880" end="01:59:13.150" style="s2">Human beings are finite and limited and mortal you know and death is final. Let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.310" end="01:59:15.910" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that but we could easily say [that]</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.700" end="01:59:19.059" style="s2">Doesn&#39;t matter this is still the best pathway forward</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.970" end="01:59:22.480" style="s2">it isn&#39;t certainty there&#39;s no certainty and</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.570" end="01:59:26.860" style="s2">It&#39;s very frequently in life you have poison a or poison B</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.860" end="01:59:30.700" style="s2">Like you get to pick [your] poison [you] don&#39;t get to pick the elixir of life</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.860" end="01:59:35.950" style="s2">but I would but I would say I would also say I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason to be particularly pessimistic because</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.440" end="01:59:39.700" style="s2">We don&#39;t know what would happen if [people] really tried hard to get their acts together</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.950" end="01:59:44.229" style="s2">Like if they understood the [necessity] of that and really put it forward I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.780" end="01:59:50.140" style="s2">Mean I&#39;ve had lots of experience with my clinical clients now. You know I&#39;ve seen dozens and dozens of [people] and</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.780" end="01:59:52.780" style="s2">We have tried jointly</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.910" end="02:00:00.369" style="s2">To get their lives straighter, and it works almost inevitably now that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve had clients who died. You know we were</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.070" end="02:00:02.630" style="s2">three-quarters through A</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.630" end="02:00:10.239" style="s2">Wonderful process of psychological renovation and they got cancer and died so so there&#39;s there&#39;s no certainty associated with this</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.820" end="02:00:12.820" style="s2">But it&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.880" end="02:00:15.880" style="s2">solution available [and]</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.280" end="02:00:18.969" style="s2">And it&#39;s also possible that it&#39;s a good enough solution</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.450" end="02:00:24.369" style="s2">Now I was talking to my class yesterday about this you know so you</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.830" end="02:00:31.209" style="s2">If you pursue the things in [your] life that [are] meaningful once you&#39;ve oriented yourself and that means accepting the challenges that come along with</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.210" end="02:00:36.310" style="s2">That because one of the things that you&#39;ll find you even find this in music if you know a piece of music completely</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.650" end="02:00:41.170" style="s2">Then you can not want to listen to it anymore this still has to be some challenge in it</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.170" end="02:00:43.839" style="s2">You still have to track it and sometimes music is so complex</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.840" end="02:00:47.950" style="s2">you just can&#39;t it just sounds like noise Modern music is often like that because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.140" end="02:00:54.939" style="s2">Well it tends towards the chaotic and so it&#39;s I find it difficult to listen to because I can&#39;t get a handle on it</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.040" end="02:00:59.919" style="s2">But then you know so it&#39;s too challenging, and then there&#39;s other music pop music is often like this</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.920" end="02:01:03.609" style="s2">It&#39;s Catchy the first two times you hear it then you never want to hear it [again]. It&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.610" end="02:01:08.560" style="s2">There&#39;s too much predictability and not enough Chaos and hopefully you find a piece of [music]. That&#39;s somewhere in the middle</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.560" end="02:01:11.799" style="s2">You can listen to it 50 or 100 times and each time you listen to it</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.800" end="02:01:15.730" style="s2">There&#39;s still some new nuance in it that you didn&#39;t that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.040" end="02:01:20.680" style="s2">Expect before and so well you kind of want to set up your life like that, so that</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.350" end="02:01:24.669" style="s2">And I think you see that the phenomena of meaning</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.070" end="02:01:31.090" style="s2">manifests itself at the area at the Locale of Optimal challenge</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.670" end="02:01:35.680" style="s2">So if the thing so one of the things for example, or might say well</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.680" end="02:01:41.739" style="s2">Let&#39;s say you want to set some goals for yourself. [we] say well. They&#39;re remarkable goals, but they&#39;re all there to unattainable</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.530" end="02:01:44.920" style="s2">You&#39;re just going to find it frustrating to pursue them</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.620" end="02:01:50.589" style="s2">It&#39;s going to be too punishing, and then we might say well. Here&#39;s a goal, and you think well, I could do that</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.590" end="02:01:53.590" style="s2">You know standing on my head. There&#39;s nothing in it</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.630" end="02:01:58.540" style="s2">well both of those two extremes are going to leave you in a state that isn&#39;t characterized by the</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.969" end="02:02:02.649" style="s2">Optimization of engagement and meaning one is too difficult [too] punishing</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.680" end="02:02:08.019" style="s2">It&#39;s the judge and nothing else and the [other] is the ultimate and merciful mothers. It&#39;s like you win, no matter</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.020" end="02:02:11.919" style="s2">How you play so then you calibrate and say well? You know [I] need?</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.440" end="02:02:15.520" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m up for a challenge at this level I</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.199" end="02:02:22.989" style="s2">Wouldn&#39;t recommend that because that&#39;s just a bit like people do that you [want] it might want to</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.719" end="02:02:26.379" style="s2">Investigate your character in detail and decide you know</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.900" end="02:02:30.819" style="s2">What&#39;s going on at this level of analysis? That&#39;s pretty harsh, but you can certainly</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.340" end="02:02:34.719" style="s2">continually retool yourself at more micro levels and</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.390" end="02:02:40.149" style="s2">That and I think what you do is you pick the level of retooling that</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.120" end="02:02:43.749" style="s2">optimizes your willingness to be engaged in it and</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.300" end="02:02:49.570" style="s2">then what&#39;s so interesting about that is that I think is that you get the benefits of</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.120" end="02:02:53.319" style="s2">perfection so to speak while still being imperfect</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.230" end="02:02:57.459" style="s2">The imperfect your actual imperfection has nothing to do with it</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.190" end="02:03:01.779" style="s2">what&#39;s relevant is the Jerk is the journey that you&#39;re undertaking to rectify the</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.540" end="02:03:07.239" style="s2">imperfection so instead [of] aiming to be the entity without flaws</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.550" end="02:03:12.699" style="s2">You&#39;re aiming to be the entity that continues to realize its flaws and overcome them. Well. That&#39;s a game</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.699" end="02:03:17.559" style="s2">You can play forever and that&#39;s maybe the ultimate in being an unplowed entity</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.560" end="02:03:22.629" style="s2">It&#39;s something like that so so I want to show you some pictures [that] I think are associated [with] that</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.170" end="02:03:26.170" style="s2">so this one to begin with</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.719" end="02:03:29.349" style="s2">This is an absolutely amazing picture. I think</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.870" end="02:03:35.079" style="s2">so this is bert hold [firt] meier tree of life flanked by Eve and Mary Ecclesia and</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.960" end="02:03:41.019" style="s2">This in some [sense] this this picture summarizes the biblical stories in one picture</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.020" end="02:03:44.470" style="s2">which is that&#39;s pretty amazing that that a picture can do that and</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.690" end="02:03:49.629" style="s2">So let me explain the picture a little bit so the first thing you see [here]. Is [that] this is the tree?</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.020" end="02:03:53.020" style="s2">this is the tree of life and</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.320" end="02:03:58.239" style="s2">So it echoes the tree of the [of] the knowledge of good and evil</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.240" end="02:04:00.760" style="s2">But this is [post-fall]</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.760" end="02:04:01.820" style="s2">so we</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.820" end="02:04:04.029" style="s2">interpreted the story of Adam and Eve already</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.030" end="02:04:09.610" style="s2">is that human beings became self conscious they discovered death they discovered morality it was all a consequence of</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.160" end="02:04:15.999" style="s2">Interacting with the fruit and the snake something like that, and you can read that as an as an evolutionary tale</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.670" end="02:04:18.879" style="s2">you can at least read it as a</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.760" end="02:04:24.309" style="s2">Representation of the emergence of self-consciousness in human beings, so what does that mean well it [means] that?</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.890" end="02:04:26.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.000" end="02:04:29.350" style="s2">[Apple] in some sense was equivalent to death, and that&#39;s what you see here</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.350" end="02:04:31.720" style="s2">You see eve is picking fruit from the tree here</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.940" end="02:04:38.529" style="s2">But the fruit is it&#39;s on the skull side of the tree and so eve. It&#39;s the vulnerability of Eve</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.960" end="02:04:42.789" style="s2">She&#39;s naked there and displayed to the world. It&#39;s the vulnerability of Eve</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.790" end="02:04:45.610" style="s2">That&#39;s one way of thinking about it was the vulnerability of Eve</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.740" end="02:04:51.429" style="s2">That was the catalyst to the development of human self-consciousness, and I think that that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.500" end="02:04:56.380" style="s2">It seems to me to be a reasonable proposition and so</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.080" end="02:04:58.490" style="s2">Eve</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.490" end="02:05:00.849" style="s2">eve&#39;s relationship with the fruit and the snake</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.850" end="02:05:06.340" style="s2">Doomed human beings to the realization of mortality that&#39;s what this side of the picture</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.130" end="02:05:08.960" style="s2">represents and</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.960" end="02:05:12.549" style="s2">So it&#39;s a catastrophe, and it&#39;s associated with here with the snake in the fruit</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.610" end="02:05:18.190" style="s2">It&#39;s human beings attempts to understand how it is that they emerged into a self-conscious world?</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.950" end="02:05:24.220" style="s2">Okay, so fine. So that&#39;s on this is on the the fall end of the story and this is on the</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.190" end="02:05:31.149" style="s2">Solution end of the story now what you see here [in] there&#39;s a skull there, and there&#39;s a Crucifix here, and you see</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.150" end="02:05:36.460" style="s2">There&#39;s all these little fruits on this tree, so it&#39;s the apple of death that eve is handing out on this side</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.460" end="02:05:40.869" style="s2">and it&#39;s the host that plays a role [in] the cannibalistic right that&#39;s at the center of</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.150" end="02:05:47.089" style="s2">Christian ritual that mary as the church is handing out as a medication for yes</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.820" end="02:05:49.820" style="s2">So she&#39;s handing out the antidote</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.060" end="02:05:56.749" style="s2">Well, what&#39;s the antidote well? It&#39;s a strange thing. It&#39;s associated with this Crucifix, and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:57.330" end="02:06:00.410" style="s2">Translated into this wheat and host so you&#39;re supposed to eat that and that</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.500" end="02:06:08.330" style="s2">That is the incorporation of whatever this represents well the question, then is what does that represent it to assist?</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.330" end="02:06:15.890" style="s2">It&#39;s a symbol of suffering obviously it&#39;s a symbol of the ultimate in suffering. It&#39;s the weirdest thing because the picture proposes that</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.710" end="02:06:19.579" style="s2">to ingest the ultimate in suffering is to</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.150" end="02:06:22.590" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.590" end="02:06:26.779" style="s2">Ingest the antidote to the catastrophe of the knowledge of death</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.120" end="02:06:34.670" style="s2">It&#39;s a very strange paradox but but it&#39;s the it&#39;s the proper paradox. It&#39;s at the center of this of the great drama</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.670" end="02:06:36.670" style="s2">that&#39;s represented by this picture a</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.600" end="02:06:42.590" style="s2">Little knowledge of Death destroys you</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.520" end="02:06:47.630" style="s2">Full voluntary acceptance of it is the [cure]</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.600" end="02:06:50.600" style="s2">That&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.640" end="02:06:52.970" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s a that&#39;s a hell of an [idea]</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.620" end="02:06:58.729" style="s2">It&#39;s not only to and to accept it is</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.210" end="02:07:04.099" style="s2">Simultaneously in some sense to take responsibility for it</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.910" end="02:07:09.470" style="s2">Because you don&#39;t take responsibility for things that you don&#39;t accept</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.310" end="02:07:18.740" style="s2">You only take responsibility [for] things that you do accept say well, the world is fundamentally flawed because it&#39;s fundamental nature is</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.130" end="02:07:26.179" style="s2">Vulnerability Intolerable vulnerability, I&#39;m not going to take any responsibility for that, but that&#39;s really [kane&#39;s]</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.700" end="02:07:28.700" style="s2">attitude in the in the story of</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.430" end="02:07:31.260" style="s2">cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.260" end="02:07:34.969" style="s2">he externalizes responsibility for the catastrophe of his life and</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.940" end="02:07:40.609" style="s2">Therefore he doesn&#39;t make the right sacrifices and so the paradoxical injunction here is</p>
<p begin="02:07:41.730" end="02:07:44.300" style="s2">accept responsibility for the catastrophe of your life and</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.510" end="02:07:47.510" style="s2">That way you transcend it</p>
<p begin="02:07:48.060" end="02:07:54.890" style="s2">Simultaneously, and there&#39;s a there&#39;s an unbelievably hopeful message in there and the message is you&#39;re actually strong enough to do that</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.890" end="02:07:59.300" style="s2">You just don&#39;t know it, and you won&#39;t find out till you do it. You can&#39;t find out till you do it</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.139" end="02:08:03.769" style="s2">But if you did it you&#39;d find out that it was true. It&#39;s a massive risk</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.770" end="02:08:10.459" style="s2">It&#39;s the ultimate in risks right you have to be willing to lose your life in order to find it. It&#39;s like exactly right</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.980" end="02:08:15.889" style="s2">So that picture when I started to understand that picture look every time I look at it. Just blows me away. I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.159" end="02:08:22.039" style="s2">Unbelievably, it&#39;s an unbelievably sophisticated set of ideas</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.489" end="02:08:31.339" style="s2">But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s much different really [than] this idea. I mean buddha finds his enlightenment under a tree</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.550" end="02:08:38.659" style="s2">It&#39;s not fluke that that&#39;s the case that&#39;s his natural [environment], and he&#39;s sitting in that lotus here the lotus [opens] up</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.850" end="02:08:44.719" style="s2">[it&#39;s] [a] this thing that springs up from the depths. He sits there illuminated the same way. He&#39;s got a halo</p>
<p begin="02:08:44.850" end="02:08:48.859" style="s2">that&#39;s the sun that stands for higher consciousness and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.590" end="02:08:54.409" style="s2">Transcended by accepting the fact that life is suffering he&#39;s transcended</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.260" end="02:08:57.590" style="s2">the limitations that [are] part of mortality</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.730" end="02:09:01.730" style="s2">You see that symbol there</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.940" end="02:09:06.889" style="s2">That swastika you see it there. It&#39;s reversed the Nazis reversed it</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.460" end="02:09:13.310" style="s2">Well think about that. I mean they weren&#39;t stupid as symbolism</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.310" end="02:09:17.569" style="s2">They&#39;re symbols had meaning is what the swastika were represented was what this represents?</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.330" end="02:09:20.330" style="s2">reversed</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.600" end="02:09:23.600" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s a very bad idea</p>
<p begin="02:09:24.179" end="02:09:29.509" style="s2">This is the thing that this this idea is what enables people to transcend their suffering and buddha said well</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.510" end="02:09:33.170" style="s2">Don&#39;t don&#39;t be too attached to things and what does that mean?</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.170" end="02:09:37.670" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t mean deny the world it might mean deny the world if you&#39;re too in love with the material</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.250" end="02:09:40.250" style="s2">like with material well-being</p>
<p begin="02:09:40.350" end="02:09:42.379" style="s2">Let&#39;s say then your pathway to</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.230" end="02:09:50.359" style="s2">transcendence and meaning might be to Abandon that because it&#39;s [it&#39;s] constraining you it&#39;s making you less than you could be but the</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.790" end="02:09:57.139" style="s2">Fundamental lesson the more fundamental lesson that&#39;s underneath that is don&#39;t let what you are stop you from being what you could be</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.530" end="02:10:03.770" style="s2">Right and so then the [question] is well. What do you identify with do you identify with what you are?</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.520" end="02:10:07.350" style="s2">then [your] tyrant</p>
<p begin="02:10:07.350" end="02:10:12.109" style="s2">You identify with with Chaos because that&#39;s the opposite of order say</p>
<p begin="02:10:12.970" end="02:10:14.970" style="s2">Then [you&#39;re] nihilistic</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.220" end="02:10:19.289" style="s2">Well, you don&#39;t identify with either of those you know that they&#39;re both necessary</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.290" end="02:10:22.769" style="s2">You know that you have to live with both of them, but you would you identify?</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.470" end="02:10:29.159" style="s2">With the capacity to continually transcend what you are and then you seek out error</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.710" end="02:10:33.180" style="s2">That&#39;s what humility is like. I&#39;m error ridden</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.700" end="02:10:39.869" style="s2">It&#39;s like so I want to see I want [to] put myself in the [situation] where I can discover one of my errors hopefully not</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.870" end="02:10:45.780" style="s2">In [a] way that&#39;s going to knock me completely out of the game right. I want to I want to seek out a challenge</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.780" end="02:10:49.769" style="s2">I want to find out where my limits are I want to find out where there&#39;s not enough of me yet</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.770" end="02:10:55.140" style="s2">And I want to do that in a way that&#39;s engaging because you know you can wear yourself out fighting dragons</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.240" end="02:11:02.039" style="s2">Obviously, you can exhaust yourself completely, and that&#39;s not helpful. You know [what] one of the things I learned for example when I was coaching</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.710" end="02:11:04.000" style="s2">when I was coaching</p>
<p begin="02:11:04.000" end="02:11:09.780" style="s2">Warriors who these were people who had very [high-end] careers and so they had an infinite workload no matter how much they worked?</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.910" end="02:11:14.309" style="s2">Flat-out there was always way more work that they should do. It&#39;s very difficult thing to learn to manage and</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.280" end="02:11:20.189" style="s2">So they were exhausting themselves, and I said well, you know you have to work less per day. It&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.230" end="02:11:23.730" style="s2">No, that&#39;s not happening. I can&#39;t do that and so</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.670" end="02:11:26.340" style="s2">What I learned over time was [ok]</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.340" end="02:11:31.980" style="s2">So this is what you have to do every three [months] you have to block off [4] days and go have a vacation [you] have</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.980" end="02:11:36.270" style="s2">To plan that in advance, so it&#39;s in your calendar so that your secretary doesn&#39;t book your time</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.270" end="02:11:42.149" style="s2">and then you need that because you have to recuperate enough so [that] you can work as hard as you&#39;re going to work and of</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.150" end="02:11:43.320" style="s2">Course they were nervous about that</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.320" end="02:11:45.480" style="s2">And I said well look we can we can calibrate this</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.850" end="02:11:50.189" style="s2">Let&#39;s keep track of your billable hours over the next year and see if they increase or decrease</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.260" end="02:11:56.010" style="s2">Because I bet you if you take more time off, you&#39;ll actually have more billable hours, you&#39;ll actually have your cake and eat it</p>

<p begin="02:13:57.659" end="02:13:59.659" style="s2">I think in some sense is a decision of love</p>

<p begin="02:14:25.090" end="02:14:30.689" style="s2">It&#39;s better to be engaged in the solution of a complex problem than not to have a problem at all</p>

<p begin="02:14:40.230" end="02:14:42.359" style="s2">and so if you want to have no problems</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.360" end="02:14:44.080" style="s2">then you have no being and</p>

<p begin="02:15:19.960" end="02:15:25.319" style="s2">I&#39;m talking to people a lot about responsibility, and it&#39;s young men in particular that seem to be responding to that</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.320" end="02:15:31.799" style="s2">And I [think] that&#39;s partly because I [think] that young women in some sense have their responsibility map already laid out for them</p>
<p begin="02:15:31.840" end="02:15:37.980" style="s2">It&#39;s also less voluntary in some sense for women because they have more complicated problems to solve in the first part of their life</p>
<p begin="02:15:37.980" end="02:15:44.640" style="s2">Right because they have to get the family problem solved but whatever I&#39;ve been talking very in a very</p>

<p begin="02:15:47.410" end="02:15:50.189" style="s2">responsibility, which is a strange thing to sell to people but</p>
<p begin="02:15:51.010" end="02:15:56.130" style="s2">Responsibility is what gives your life meaning and so then you might say well then take on ultimate responsibility</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.710" end="02:16:03.089" style="s2">and what happens you have an ultimately meaningful life and then you might say well if your life is ultimately meaningful doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.239" end="02:16:08.159" style="s2">Punctuated by tragedy or even predicated on tragedy. It&#39;s worth it</p>

<p begin="02:16:10.960" end="02:16:15.000" style="s2">I think that&#39;s true and everything I&#39;ve seen indicates to me. That&#39;s true</p>

<p begin="02:16:20.640" end="02:16:26.160" style="s2">You&#39;re a bad person. You should take on responsibility have nothing to do with that you can define the damn responsibility</p>
<p begin="02:16:26.160" end="02:16:29.039" style="s2">It isn&#39;t something that that someone else should impose on you</p>
<p begin="02:16:29.040" end="02:16:33.749" style="s2">It&#39;s not a matter of doing what you [should] do in some abstract Manner. It&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="02:16:34.510" end="02:16:39.630" style="s2">It&#39;s the choice of what game you&#39;re going to play and you know you can play the game of the seeker?</p>
<p begin="02:16:39.630" end="02:16:45.540" style="s2">I would say and if you play that game then everyone wins and it&#39;s the best game you can play and so the</p>

<p begin="02:17:00.000" end="02:17:03.500" style="s2">Paradoxically, it&#39;s in the willingness to do that that the solution emerges</p>

<p begin="02:17:38.130" end="02:17:42.560" style="s2">I guess that&#39;s the fundamental one. Is that I believe [that] the the</p>

<p begin="02:17:49.020" end="02:17:51.020" style="s2">derived from very different cultures</p>
<p begin="02:17:53.429" end="02:17:55.429" style="s2">It&#39;s the same idea</p>

<p begin="02:18:06.600" end="02:18:13.609" style="s2">you you voluntarily accept it and then strive to overcome the suffering that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:18:14.040" end="02:18:16.640" style="s2">Consequence of that and you do that for [you]</p>
<p begin="02:18:16.640" end="02:18:21.259" style="s2">and you do that in a way that makes it better for other people and then that works and</p>
<p begin="02:18:21.960" end="02:18:25.460" style="s2">One question might be well, how well does it work and the answer is?</p>
<p begin="02:18:26.070" end="02:18:29.239" style="s2">You the only way that you can find out is by trying it</p>
<p begin="02:18:30.270" end="02:18:34.609" style="s2">That&#39;s it. That&#39;s [the] essential element of it the proof is to be derived by the</p>

<p begin="02:18:39.360" end="02:18:41.959" style="s2">How it will work for you? It&#39;s the thing that</p>

<p begin="02:18:51.570" end="02:18:58.039" style="s2">Commitment you have to commit to it first. That&#39;s the act of faith that the kierkegaard was so insistent upon</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.560" end="02:19:01.669" style="s2">You have to say I&#39;m going to act as if being is good</p>

<p begin="02:19:40.160" end="02:19:44.990" style="s2">that&#39;s not the point the point is that there&#39;s some games you don&#39;t get to play unless you&#39;re all-in and</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.230" end="02:19:49.579" style="s2">The other thing that&#39;s so [interesting] about being alive is that you&#39;re [all-in]</p>

<p begin="02:20:47.971" end="02:20:52.551" style="s2">the right response is why are you asking me such stupid questions when when</p>

<p begin="02:21:04.820" end="02:21:09.949" style="s2">It&#39;s not because life has no meaning. It&#39;s because you&#39;re blind. I mean, that&#39;s what the image of</p>

<p begin="02:21:16.500" end="02:21:20.900" style="s2">Here&#39;s an answer. It&#39;s like well, I&#39;m going to criticize that well go right ahead</p>
<p begin="02:21:21.520" end="02:21:25.050" style="s2">You know it&#39;s like. It&#39;s like what you&#39;re like, a you like a</p>

<p begin="02:21:35.590" end="02:21:40.380" style="s2">It&#39;s blindness and it&#39;s the same thing with regards to the path of the hero</p>
<p begin="02:21:40.380" end="02:21:44.609" style="s2">It&#39;s like it glistens in front of you, and you can criticize it. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:21:46.569" end="02:21:51.329" style="s2">fine put the cart before the horse and and see how far you get</p>
<p begin="02:21:54.430" end="02:21:59.580" style="s2">So I thought to bring full closure to the class. I was trying to solve</p>
<p begin="02:22:00.580" end="02:22:05.669" style="s2">this terrible puzzle that confronted me for and many other people about</p>
<p begin="02:22:06.550" end="02:22:12.960" style="s2">How it was [that] human beings got themselves in such a tangle about what they believed such a tangle that we were pointing</p>
<p begin="02:22:13.600" end="02:22:18.000" style="s2">The ultimate weapons of destruction at one another which by the way, we are still doing [I]</p>
<p begin="02:22:20.739" end="02:22:25.559" style="s2">Thought okay. Well I understand that we need their belief systems they orient us and</p>
<p begin="02:22:26.140" end="02:22:30.210" style="s2">That means there will be conflict between belief systems and that can be a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="02:22:30.210" end="02:22:33.029" style="s2">And that&#39;s being played out everywhere again in very many ways</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.300" end="02:22:38.969" style="s2">What&#39;s the solution to that well one possibility is there&#39;s no solution. It&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:22:39.609" end="02:22:42.689" style="s2">Mayhem all the way around could be the case but</p>
<p begin="02:22:43.270" end="02:22:47.880" style="s2">[it] seemed to me as I delved into it that the proper solution to that was to live properly as</p>
<p begin="02:22:48.939" end="02:22:51.898" style="s2">An individual because you&#39;re more powerful than you think</p>
<p begin="02:22:52.870" end="02:22:57.269" style="s2">Way more powerful than you think I mean God only knows what you are in the final analysis</p>
<p begin="02:22:58.090" end="02:23:00.069" style="s2">You&#39;re blind to your own</p>
<p begin="02:23:00.069" end="02:23:05.099" style="s2">Weaknesses, but you&#39;re also blind to your own strengths and so then I think well if you&#39;ve got your act together</p>
<p begin="02:23:05.100" end="02:23:08.729" style="s2">It&#39;d be better for you, and instantly it would be better for your family assuming</p>
<p begin="02:23:08.729" end="02:23:13.889" style="s2">They wanted you to get your act together and not everyone does but and then it would be better for the community</p>
<p begin="02:23:13.890" end="02:23:20.069" style="s2">It&#39;s like how far could you take that if you stopped wasting time and if you [stopped] lying and if you oriented yourself to to</p>
<p begin="02:23:20.069" end="02:23:25.019" style="s2">The highest possible good that you could conceive of and you committed to that how much good could you do?</p>
<p begin="02:23:26.199" end="02:23:28.649" style="s2">Well, I would say might find out</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.739" end="02:23:34.799" style="s2">So that&#39;s what I think you should do</p>
<p begin="02:23:35.470" end="02:23:36.790" style="s2">You should find out</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.790" end="02:23:42.029" style="s2">You don&#39;t have anything better to do and there&#39;s nothing in it as far as I&#39;ve been able to tell there&#39;s nothing in it</p>
<p begin="02:23:42.029" end="02:23:44.029" style="s2">But good</p>
<p begin="02:23:45.159" end="02:23:46.989" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.989" end="02:23:51.299" style="s2">Maybe you could sort yourself out. So that you wanted nothing, but the good and</p>
<p begin="02:23:52.479" end="02:23:55.799" style="s2">and then maybe you could help make that manifest in the world and</p>
<p begin="02:23:56.859" end="02:24:03.568" style="s2">maybe we wouldn&#39;t have all these terrible problems then at least we&#39;d have fewer of them, and that would be a start, so</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.140" end="02:24:08.519" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s that the answer to the problem of humanity</p>
<p begin="02:24:08.520" end="02:24:13.199" style="s2">Is that is the is the integrity of the individual?</p>
<p begin="02:24:14.260" end="02:24:16.260" style="s2">That&#39;s the answer</p>
<p begin="02:24:16.899" end="02:24:21.209" style="s2">so and states that are predicated on that realization are healthy, so</p>
<p begin="02:24:22.869" end="02:24:28.559" style="s2">[in] states that aren&#39;t are doomed to stagnation and catastrophic collapse and</p>
<p begin="02:24:30.670" end="02:24:32.670" style="s2">personalities that are predicated on</p>
<p begin="02:24:34.239" end="02:24:37.019" style="s2">self Tyranny and the Tyranny of others are doomed and</p>
<p begin="02:24:38.859" end="02:24:40.859" style="s2">doomed to collapse</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.680" end="02:24:47.369" style="s2">[so] and then you think well, what&#39;s the barrier the barriers are you willing to accept the responsibility and</p>
<p begin="02:24:48.159" end="02:24:50.639" style="s2">Part of the answer to that is reduce the Dam</p>
<p begin="02:24:51.040" end="02:24:57.179" style="s2">Responsibility until it&#39;s tolerable you don&#39;t have to fix everything at once you could just start by fixing the things that you could fix</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.270" end="02:25:00.270" style="s2">Or you could even do it more?</p>
<p begin="02:25:03.220" end="02:25:07.710" style="s2">You can do it with even less self-sacrifice. You could start by fixing only the things that you want to fix</p>
<p begin="02:25:08.439" end="02:25:10.499" style="s2">God you can get a massive way that way</p>
<p begin="02:25:11.109" end="02:25:17.009" style="s2">So do it see what happens that&#39;s what you should have been talking university right from the beginning</p>
<p begin="02:25:17.229" end="02:25:24.118" style="s2">[it&#39;s] like a mathias good tool yourself into something [that] can attain it and go out there and manifest it in the world</p>
<p begin="02:25:24.670" end="02:25:27.659" style="s2">And everything that everything that comes your way will be</p>
<p begin="02:25:30.640" end="02:25:33.479" style="s2">Everything that comes your way will be a blessing and so</p>
<p begin="02:25:35.800" end="02:25:40.559" style="s2">All you have to do is give up your resentment and your hatred I know that&#39;s a hard thing to give up</p>
<p begin="02:25:40.899" end="02:25:42.899" style="s2">Because you have plenty of reason [for] it</p>
<p begin="02:25:45.819" end="02:25:49.349" style="s2">That&#39;s probably a good place to stop so to the pleasure</p>
