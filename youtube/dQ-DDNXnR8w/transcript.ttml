<p begin="00:00:07.069" end="00:00:14.150" style="s2">the last time I talked to Zach he quoted</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">his I think it was Rastafarians friend</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.150" end="00:00:19.109" style="s2">who said that school makes you stupid</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:24.230" style="s2">the money makes you poor and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.109" end="00:00:27.630" style="s2">medicine makes you sick so so Zach</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.230" end="00:00:29.400" style="s2">Zach&#39;s been probably I would say Zach is</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.630" end="00:00:31.019" style="s2">more of an activist than you are John</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.400" end="00:00:32.790" style="s2">but you&#39;re both working on different</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.019" end="00:00:36.750" style="s2">levels maybe of trying to figure things</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.790" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">out so can can you both can you both</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.750" end="00:00:46.140" style="s2">sort of give a short view of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:47.640" style="s2">education in the meaning crisis and and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.140" end="00:00:52.260" style="s2">your philosophies on education in</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.640" end="00:00:57.690" style="s2">general okay Zach do you want to go</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.260" end="00:00:59.340" style="s2">first or sure please totally thank you</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.690" end="00:01:01.559" style="s2">John it&#39;s actually great to be here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.340" end="00:01:05.700" style="s2">Andrew thank you as well it&#39;s thank you</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.559" end="00:01:08.490" style="s2">Kevin honor and so I you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.700" end="00:01:10.830" style="s2">about the meaning crisis in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.490" end="00:01:13.729" style="s2">broader meta-crisis that has these four</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.830" end="00:01:17.240" style="s2">factors the meeting crisis is one and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.729" end="00:01:24.170" style="s2">isn&#39;t perhaps the one that is the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.240" end="00:01:26.490" style="s2">dire and painful in a sense and so aside</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.170" end="00:01:29.310" style="s2">aside from it though the other three you</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:31.500" style="s2">also have what I&#39;m calling a capability</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.310" end="00:01:33.900" style="s2">crisis all right so this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.500" end="00:01:36.119" style="s2">necessarily about meaning-making it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.900" end="00:01:39.740" style="s2">about people can&#39;t do the work that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.119" end="00:01:41.970" style="s2">needs to be done is too complex or</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.740" end="00:01:43.320" style="s2">because of the meaning crisis they never</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.970" end="00:01:46.979" style="s2">gave a about it I&#39;ve never built</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.320" end="00:01:49.470" style="s2">the skills ability screams right right</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.979" end="00:01:51.509" style="s2">they so they can interact as what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.470" end="00:01:54.570" style="s2">saying yeah and that&#39;s and that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.509" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">deal the capability crisis because if</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:01:58.500" style="s2">you can&#39;t do the stuff it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:02.520" style="s2">done I don&#39;t like a logistical level</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">like maintaining infrastructure and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.520" end="00:02:07.560" style="s2">kind of stuff fighting disease you just</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:10.259" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to do it could you bility</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.560" end="00:02:11.110" style="s2">crisis and then there&#39;s also what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.259" end="00:02:14.080" style="s2">calling a sense May</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.110" end="00:02:15.250" style="s2">crisis or what Jonathan are also called</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.080" end="00:02:17.530" style="s2">after me something like an</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.250" end="00:02:18.970" style="s2">intelligibility crisis mm-hmm who does</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.530" end="00:02:21.250" style="s2">again distinct from the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.970" end="00:02:24.730" style="s2">but related and has to do with this</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.250" end="00:02:28.150" style="s2">sense that outside of the meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.730" end="00:02:28.600" style="s2">there&#39;s also just intelligibility we</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.150" end="00:02:31.180" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.600" end="00:02:32.700" style="s2">everything is illegible we can&#39;t read it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.180" end="00:02:36.040" style="s2">too hyper objects are kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.700" end="00:02:37.660" style="s2">looming over us and the descends making</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.040" end="00:02:39.610" style="s2">crisis so that just like in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.660" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">what&#39;s the case objectively with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.610" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">world that&#39;s up for grabs in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:47.440" style="s2">to the post truth and that cascades into</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:48.640" style="s2">the meaning and then it also counts</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.440" end="00:02:51.040" style="s2">gates and capability because if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.640" end="00:02:53.230" style="s2">can&#39;t think straight rather we&#39;ll began</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.040" end="00:02:54.490" style="s2">operating on it and then the fourth one</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.230" end="00:02:56.500" style="s2">is what I&#39;m calling the legitimation</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.490" end="00:02:58.420" style="s2">crisis yeah which i think is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.500" end="00:03:01.510" style="s2">important for the jetta mation crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.420" end="00:03:03.910" style="s2">in the aspect of the political it has to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.510" end="00:03:08.140" style="s2">do with basically who gets to wield</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.910" end="00:03:09.910" style="s2">authority and why and so and again</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.140" end="00:03:12.100" style="s2">they&#39;re all related but this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.910" end="00:03:15.370" style="s2">distinct insofar as it makes it so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.100" end="00:03:17.500" style="s2">we can&#39;t even decide who should be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.370" end="00:03:21.160" style="s2">charge and how the leadership should</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.500" end="00:03:23.950" style="s2">function and we don&#39;t believe in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.160" end="00:03:26.950" style="s2">forms of political justification that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.950" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">have been given misogyny so things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.950" end="00:03:30.910" style="s2">the breakdown in the belief of democracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:33.100" style="s2">in America is an example of legitimation</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.910" end="00:03:35.950" style="s2">presses that&#39;ll turn me on so you said</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.100" end="00:03:38.590" style="s2">that political but you also oh sorry you</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.950" end="00:03:40.180" style="s2">broke up I was saying that that term</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.590" end="00:03:42.700" style="s2">comes specifically from hotter boss</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.180" end="00:03:45.550" style="s2">legitimation Christmas you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.700" end="00:03:47.290" style="s2">Zach just a clarification question so</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.550" end="00:03:49.239" style="s2">you said it&#39;s largely political but you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.290" end="00:03:50.980" style="s2">think that the disenfranchisement is</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.239" end="00:03:53.980" style="s2">also in cultural institutions as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.980" end="00:03:56.019" style="s2">like established religions things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.980" end="00:03:57.430" style="s2">that is correct yeah precisely and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.019" end="00:04:00.760" style="s2">links in with my notion of teacherly</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.430" end="00:04:02.320" style="s2">Authority right right very much a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.760" end="00:04:04.120" style="s2">and the authority structure of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.320" end="00:04:06.340" style="s2">Society of the whole it&#39;s most acute</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.120" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">often in politics but in the university</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.340" end="00:04:10.239" style="s2">is a huge issue</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:12.569" style="s2">yeah yeah our our expertise to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.239" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">respected or not</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.569" end="00:04:16.650" style="s2">so I wanted to ask you one question</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:18.090" style="s2">about that as you mentioned this before</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.650" end="00:04:19.350" style="s2">and I thought this was a well this way I</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.090" end="00:04:21.209" style="s2">sort of perked up when you said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.350" end="00:04:22.650" style="s2">not the other ideas aren&#39;t good but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.209" end="00:04:24.600" style="s2">realized last time you spoke to me about</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:27.960" style="s2">this I it&#39;s made me think quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.600" end="00:04:30.150" style="s2">about it I was wondering if I&#39;m part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.960" end="00:04:33.349" style="s2">this so this is an open question</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.150" end="00:04:38.520" style="s2">I&#39;m not framing a cryptic position here</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.349" end="00:04:41.310" style="s2">it is the idea that it&#39;s not only that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.520" end="00:04:42.509" style="s2">we&#39;re getting disenfranchisement is we</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.310" end="00:04:44.310" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to adjudicate between</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.509" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">various institutions when they come into</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.310" end="00:04:50.220" style="s2">competition with each other um is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:52.229" style="s2">also part of what you mean by legit like</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.220" end="00:04:54.990" style="s2">so there isn&#39;t an overarching shared</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.229" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">normativity that allows us to adjudicate</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.990" end="00:05:00.210" style="s2">you know when because harbor mas seem to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:01.800" style="s2">think that right you know you have these</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.210" end="00:05:03.990" style="s2">can he you know these autonomous spheres</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.800" end="00:05:06.750" style="s2">and there&#39;s nothing that transcends them</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.990" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">that decides how conflicts between them</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.750" end="00:05:09.180" style="s2">are supposed to be resolved is that also</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:09.960" style="s2">part of what you&#39;re thinking as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.180" end="00:05:12.150" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.960" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">in essence yeah that&#39;s what I was seeing</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.150" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">it was a as a complete fracturing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:19.530" style="s2">he was writing that I think is like 72</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:21.270" style="s2">legitimation crisis and so it was just</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.530" end="00:05:23.669" style="s2">that when post-modernism most beginning</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.270" end="00:05:26.610" style="s2">which is what in a sense this is all</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.669" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">about really it&#39;s not all about but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.610" end="00:05:30.270" style="s2">a big factor with the breakdown in</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:31.770" style="s2">hierarchical structures and breakdowns</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.270" end="00:05:34.050" style="s2">and things like teacherly Authority and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.770" end="00:05:36.150" style="s2">political authority normative Authority</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.050" end="00:05:38.130" style="s2">parental authority all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.150" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">Authority and power are become question</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.130" end="00:05:44.370" style="s2">power itself becomes problematic as from</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:47.490" style="s2">any sense have good connotations becomes</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.370" end="00:05:48.840" style="s2">hard to even think about and so under</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.490" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">those conditions when you have that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.840" end="00:05:56.039" style="s2">fourfold venner crisis meaning crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:57.389" style="s2">in there then you it&#39;s encapsulated also</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.039" end="00:05:59.270" style="s2">in this notion of intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.389" end="00:06:02.009" style="s2">transmission being profoundly disrupted</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.270" end="00:06:03.570" style="s2">and that&#39;s what the matter is this is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.009" end="00:06:06.990" style="s2">educational crisis at its foundation</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.570" end="00:06:10.050" style="s2">only Worm those follow from a certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.990" end="00:06:12.690" style="s2">kind of failure in the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.050" end="00:06:15.449" style="s2">intergenerational transmission mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.690" end="00:06:17.190" style="s2">at least that&#39;s part of it and why</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.449" end="00:06:19.560" style="s2">there&#39;s that failure why the generation</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.190" end="00:06:21.900" style="s2">gap becomes the way it is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.560" end="00:06:24.930" style="s2">interesting question but it&#39;s hard for</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.900" end="00:06:26.940" style="s2">me not to see these as at their</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.940" end="00:06:33.419" style="s2">meta-crisis so that&#39;s my that&#39;s my and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.930" end="00:06:36.930" style="s2">your view on medic on education I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.419" end="00:06:39.660" style="s2">is larger than just schools right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.930" end="00:06:41.250" style="s2">I think that&#39;s very important like how</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.660" end="00:06:43.680" style="s2">you talk in turn how you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.250" end="00:06:46.770" style="s2">magic education and so maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.680" end="00:06:49.590" style="s2">think about education what what how is</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.770" end="00:06:51.300" style="s2">education operating today in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.590" end="00:06:53.850" style="s2">schools and then education outside of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.300" end="00:06:56.190" style="s2">schools like education that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.850" end="00:06:58.380" style="s2">let&#39;s say right now and our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.190" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">and education that&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.380" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">subcultures and everywhere else so so so</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:08.700" style="s2">John what does how does how does that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:12.479" style="s2">ring that that fourfold kind of current</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.700" end="00:07:16.410" style="s2">crisis how does that match with your way</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.479" end="00:07:17.910" style="s2">of looking at things well I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.410" end="00:07:19.110" style="s2">said that I didn&#39;t think the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.910" end="00:07:21.060" style="s2">crisis was exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.110" end="00:07:23.400" style="s2">I thought the crisis was interacting</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.060" end="00:07:31.680" style="s2">with the orphans idea of the meta-crisis</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.400" end="00:07:33.660" style="s2">and so I think Zac and I are already on</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.680" end="00:07:35.910" style="s2">convergence on that point as I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.660" end="00:07:39.630" style="s2">mentioned I think Zacks idea that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.910" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">taken over from Habermas and he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.630" end="00:07:42.030" style="s2">connecting it I think in really</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:45.660" style="s2">important ways of the legitimation</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.030" end="00:07:47.130" style="s2">crisis i yeah i think that that makes</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.660" end="00:07:51.870" style="s2">total sense to me I haven&#39;t said</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.130" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">anything about it just just because I</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.870" end="00:07:57.780" style="s2">haven&#39;t had it&#39;s not an area that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:59.880" style="s2">devoted time to work do I so my neglect</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.780" end="00:08:03.300" style="s2">indicates nothing of value</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.880" end="00:08:04.590" style="s2">it&#39;s what I&#39;m saying about that and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.300" end="00:08:08.610" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s a pleasure to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.590" end="00:08:13.380" style="s2">Zack Bowden on the sense-making and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.610" end="00:08:15.270" style="s2">intelligibility issue that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.380" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">might I&#39;m not sure so this is maybe an</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.270" end="00:08:20.940" style="s2">open for discussion and it might overlap</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:22.889" style="s2">with an aspect something that I often</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.940" end="00:08:25.350" style="s2">pair with the meaning crisis although</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.889" end="00:08:28.200" style="s2">they&#39;re not the same and it would also</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.350" end="00:08:30.300" style="s2">relate to education so I often I also</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.200" end="00:08:31.470" style="s2">talk about the wisdom famine in our</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.300" end="00:08:33.270" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.470" end="00:08:35.580" style="s2">and it seems to me when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.270" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">about sense making if we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.580" end="00:08:39.630" style="s2">beyond just sort of the accumulation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:41.729" style="s2">information that&#39;s been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.630" end="00:08:44.370" style="s2">institutionally vetted I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.729" end="00:08:45.810" style="s2">talking about you know the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.370" end="00:08:48.300" style="s2">make judgments the abilities of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.810" end="00:08:50.760" style="s2">discernment the ability to properly</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.300" end="00:08:54.360" style="s2">self-regulate in the face of information</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.760" end="00:08:58.260" style="s2">and problems and I think therefore there</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.360" end="00:09:00.750" style="s2">might be deep connections between wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.260" end="00:09:02.370" style="s2">or the Wiz what I call the wisdom famine</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.750" end="00:09:03.870" style="s2">which also has to do with some things</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.370" end="00:09:05.520" style="s2">I&#39;ve just mentioned the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.870" end="00:09:08.100" style="s2">intergenerational because part of what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.520" end="00:09:10.350" style="s2">say is we we&#39;ve lost our wisdom it</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.100" end="00:09:12.510" style="s2">traditions or wisdom institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.350" end="00:09:13.500" style="s2">the connection to education is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.510" end="00:09:15.390" style="s2">way in which I think you could</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.500" end="00:09:18.210" style="s2">understand wisdom as you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.390" end="00:09:21.030" style="s2">project of educating sense-making to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.210" end="00:09:25.310" style="s2">reduce self deception and manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.030" end="00:09:27.720" style="s2">by others and so there might I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.310" end="00:09:31.500" style="s2">that Jack and I might be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.720" end="00:09:34.230" style="s2">related in similar things there mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.500" end="00:09:38.850" style="s2">I excuse me the trip I also want to tie</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.230" end="00:09:40.589" style="s2">into Zacks notion of Education and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.850" end="00:09:44.820" style="s2">relate that to religion in a way and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.589" end="00:09:48.360" style="s2">you mentioned wisdom and so so you add</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.820" end="00:09:51.089" style="s2">John has a notion of religio right which</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.360" end="00:09:54.210" style="s2">is a bit distinct from religion proper</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.089" end="00:09:57.300" style="s2">and and I&#39;ve heard that speak about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.210" end="00:09:59.820" style="s2">importance of let&#39;s say or we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.300" end="00:10:01.800" style="s2">talked Zack a little bit about how a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.820" end="00:10:04.860" style="s2">kind of there&#39;s a gonna be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.800" end="00:10:07.680" style="s2">religious Renaissance going on so so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.860" end="00:10:09.960" style="s2">found that that John speaks about how</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.680" end="00:10:13.320" style="s2">we&#39;re not able to take religion</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.960" end="00:10:16.140" style="s2">seriously anymore and and and Zack has</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.320" end="00:10:18.180" style="s2">been saying that religion is becoming is</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.140" end="00:10:20.550" style="s2">it&#39;s coming back kind of in spades or</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.180" end="00:10:21.810" style="s2">this is religio or religion or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.550" end="00:10:24.660" style="s2">you want to call it seems to be coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.810" end="00:10:27.930" style="s2">back and that that has to be somehow</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.660" end="00:10:32.280" style="s2">fused with with education does that ring</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.930" end="00:10:34.230" style="s2">true I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.280" end="00:10:35.970" style="s2">very opportune connection you just made</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.230" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">for having us the three together three</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.970" end="00:10:38.620" style="s2">together I&#39;d like that framing that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:43.990" style="s2">just gave</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.620" end="00:10:46.200" style="s2">I I guess what yeah I think when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.990" end="00:10:50.530" style="s2">using the term wisdom although I</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.200" end="00:10:56.050" style="s2">mentioned discernment and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.530" end="00:11:00.100" style="s2">judgment wisdom also has it within an</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.050" end="00:11:02.440" style="s2">aspiration and self transcendence as as</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.100" end="00:11:03.670" style="s2">integral to the notion and that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.440" end="00:11:06.250" style="s2">brings with it immediately</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.670" end="00:11:08.650" style="s2">I think together these two notions of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.250" end="00:11:10.300" style="s2">Education broadly construed Plato set up</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.650" end="00:11:12.700" style="s2">the first school the first Academy</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.300" end="00:11:15.070" style="s2">literally right and it was for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.700" end="00:11:16.570" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom and it was spoke</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.070" end="00:11:20.620" style="s2">it was a place where you were supposed</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.570" end="00:11:22.420" style="s2">to be able to receive the affordance and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.620" end="00:11:24.940" style="s2">the guidance for the Socratic the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.420" end="00:11:26.890" style="s2">project of aspiring to Socratic wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.940" end="00:11:29.290" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s very clear but that</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.890" end="00:11:32.140" style="s2">also brings in something that was also</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.290" end="00:11:34.660" style="s2">too pointed to by Plato which is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.140" end="00:11:37.690" style="s2">that self transcendence makes very</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.660" end="00:11:39.880" style="s2">little sense if people do not have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.690" end="00:11:41.100" style="s2">reverence for an order that transcends</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.880" end="00:11:44.380" style="s2">their ego centrism</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.100" end="00:11:47.230" style="s2">if they do not have a sense of where I</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.380" end="00:11:49.030" style="s2">mean by reverence a sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.230" end="00:11:53.410" style="s2">connected to something that is in some</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.030" end="00:11:56.290" style="s2">it it has a it is greater than them from</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.410" end="00:11:59.320" style="s2">which they can view their previous</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.290" end="00:12:01.180" style="s2">perspectives in a self corrective self</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.320" end="00:12:02.830" style="s2">transformative manner so I think if</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.180" end="00:12:04.450" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about wisdom wisdom we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.830" end="00:12:06.130" style="s2">talking about not just discernment and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.450" end="00:12:08.020" style="s2">judgment we&#39;re talking about aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.130" end="00:12:09.520" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about aspirations to self</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.020" end="00:12:11.560" style="s2">transcendence and that links us</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.520" end="00:12:15.250" style="s2">simultaneously on one hand to education</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.560" end="00:12:18.490" style="s2">and on the other hand to getting back</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.250" end="00:12:21.940" style="s2">that sense of connectedness to what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.490" end="00:12:25.180" style="s2">consider sacred that which puts us into</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.940" end="00:12:27.520" style="s2">connection with you know a greater</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.180" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">reality the inexhaustible nature of</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.520" end="00:12:34.680" style="s2">reality and so I do I think that those</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">things are all tightly bound together</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.680" end="00:12:44.320" style="s2">tunneling I couldn&#39;t agree more and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:46.600" style="s2">know the I mean there&#39;s many many things</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.320" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">to say I mean the the first schools or</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.600" end="00:12:51.040" style="s2">wisdom schools really yes you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:52.300" style="s2">and it was only much later that we got</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.040" end="00:12:54.010" style="s2">this thing that we know of as a school</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.300" end="00:12:56.460" style="s2">before that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.010" end="00:12:59.890" style="s2">intergenerational transmission was</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.460" end="00:13:01.800" style="s2">religious family based etc but the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.890" end="00:13:04.840" style="s2">things that were built like in these</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.800" end="00:13:06.820" style="s2">places between worlds like outside in</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.840" end="00:13:09.400" style="s2">the wilderness between civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.820" end="00:13:11.080" style="s2">like on the road when there wasn&#39;t code</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.400" end="00:13:14.230" style="s2">and there wasn&#39;t norms you had this</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.080" end="00:13:16.150" style="s2">mystery school and yeah it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.230" end="00:13:18.420" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very important concept</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.150" end="00:13:20.920" style="s2">education and of course it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.420" end="00:13:22.450" style="s2">misconstrue it I alive I really</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.920" end="00:13:24.790" style="s2">appreciated the way you construed it but</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.450" end="00:13:28.210" style="s2">much of the wisdom research I find kind</p>

<p begin="00:13:28.210" end="00:13:32.950" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s interesting to that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.910" end="00:13:34.390" style="s2">sense making is tied into the wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.950" end="00:13:36.220" style="s2">that you can almost think about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.390" end="00:13:39.190" style="s2">different each of the different of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.220" end="00:13:40.750" style="s2">four crises as having some resolution</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.190" end="00:13:42.540" style="s2">and certain learning them in the realm</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.750" end="00:13:47.430" style="s2">of sense making it seems to be wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.540" end="00:13:52.150" style="s2">and it may be that wisdom operates on</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.430" end="00:13:53.860" style="s2">all of them in a helpful way but besides</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.150" end="00:13:55.840" style="s2">making in particular because right right</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.860" end="00:13:58.300" style="s2">now when the problems is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.840" end="00:14:01.150" style="s2">facing situations where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.300" end="00:14:03.220" style="s2">something that needs to be fixed in fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.150" end="00:14:04.900" style="s2">that the sense making needs to us to</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.220" end="00:14:07.450" style="s2">confront something that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.900" end="00:14:10.270" style="s2">understood perfectly in an objective way</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.450" end="00:14:11.890" style="s2">and so therefore we have to take the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.270" end="00:14:14.920" style="s2">forms of discernment and self</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.890" end="00:14:17.530" style="s2">transcendence in decision-making in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.920" end="00:14:19.510" style="s2">realm of objectivity in causality right</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.530" end="00:14:21.790" style="s2">and this is born this point without the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.510" end="00:14:24.970" style="s2">hyper object embarrasses the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.790" end="00:14:26.950" style="s2">function and we&#39;re we&#39;re left to be in</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.970" end="00:14:29.050" style="s2">community with one another facing</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.950" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">problems that are actually intractable</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.050" end="00:14:36.490" style="s2">from a purely causal we have to think</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:37.990" style="s2">about choice and the basis of choice and</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.490" end="00:14:40.780" style="s2">the weight choice works then you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.990" end="00:14:41.830" style="s2">the realm of wisdom and as I said last</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.780" end="00:14:43.540" style="s2">night with your Andrew yeah you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.830" end="00:14:44.860" style="s2">get an education without real living</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.540" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">religion that&#39;s what I called it</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.860" end="00:14:50.470" style="s2">yeah I actually met religio not like</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:52.540" style="s2">Catholicism that&#39;s working or but isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.470" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">it&#39;s working but this actual</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.540" end="00:14:56.980" style="s2">transmission of wisdom yeah but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:58.750" style="s2">teacher-student that&#39;s the only way it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.980" end="00:15:00.300" style="s2">happens and right now that&#39;s what holds</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.750" end="00:15:03.840" style="s2">the education system together</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.300" end="00:15:09.570" style="s2">despite the education so I get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.840" end="00:15:11.670" style="s2">that you have you have more maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.570" end="00:15:15.060" style="s2">trying to think of the right word that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.670" end="00:15:17.460" style="s2">you have more affinity for for actual</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.060" end="00:15:19.590" style="s2">religion than John does or something</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.460" end="00:15:21.900" style="s2">like that or for the let&#39;s say the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.590" end="00:15:28.230" style="s2">myth or poetic aspect of religion or the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.900" end="00:15:30.740" style="s2">the wilder aspects of of religiosity</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.230" end="00:15:32.970" style="s2">that&#39;s the word I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.740" end="00:15:34.740" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s true I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.970" end="00:15:38.520" style="s2">John well enough to know that but I it</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.740" end="00:15:40.770" style="s2">may be I mean I I really think that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.520" end="00:15:43.550" style="s2">religions are quite a remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.770" end="00:15:47.190" style="s2">cultural resource and so in that respect</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.550" end="00:15:48.930" style="s2">would never take the view that you find</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.190" end="00:15:50.400" style="s2">among the New Atheists and people of</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.930" end="00:15:53.460" style="s2">that nature who think religion was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.400" end="00:15:55.230" style="s2">huge mistake I think it was not</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.460" end="00:15:58.770" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying john thinks it is you</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.230" end="00:16:01.020" style="s2">think no no no yeah yeah totally and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.770" end="00:16:03.420" style="s2">but the question of how you bring it in</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.020" end="00:16:05.940" style="s2">to contemporary contexts is super loaded</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.420" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">because it&#39;s very difficult in some</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.940" end="00:16:13.500" style="s2">rooms and in some cities and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:16.740" style="s2">niches to use religion in a constructive</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.500" end="00:16:20.610" style="s2">way in fact it can only be perceived in</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.740" end="00:16:23.370" style="s2">a usually like a in a destructive way</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.610" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">and so so I&#39;m sensitive to those</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.370" end="00:16:28.980" style="s2">dynamics but but I do think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">a there&#39;s something that&#39;s like there</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.980" end="00:16:33.330" style="s2">are typically loaded they&#39;re like are in</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:35.430" style="s2">terms of their over determined they like</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.330" end="00:16:39.690" style="s2">there&#39;s so much saturated with meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.430" end="00:16:41.460" style="s2">and so I think they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.690" end="00:16:43.470" style="s2">continued to be useful to humanity for</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.460" end="00:16:45.180" style="s2">an extremely long time and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.470" end="00:16:47.430" style="s2">come to terms with that well we&#39;ll never</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.180" end="00:16:51.000" style="s2">forget Jesus will ever forget but our</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.430" end="00:16:53.390" style="s2">Socrates for as long as what we know of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.000" end="00:16:57.840" style="s2">as civilization continues in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.390" end="00:17:00.750" style="s2">way and for as long as we think that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.840" end="00:17:02.610" style="s2">can some have overcome it entirely and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.750" end="00:17:04.980" style="s2">create this conflict between let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.610" end="00:17:08.339" style="s2">science and religion that seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.980" end="00:17:10.080" style="s2">be really weird like why are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.339" end="00:17:11.160" style="s2">that like for ratings or something you</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.080" end="00:17:12.169" style="s2">know like it doesn&#39;t make actual</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.160" end="00:17:13.879" style="s2">estimate</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.169" end="00:17:17.869" style="s2">that there&#39;s a conflict between science</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.879" end="00:17:19.629" style="s2">and religion so yeah so I you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.869" end="00:17:22.699" style="s2">not suggesting again prayer in schools</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.629" end="00:17:25.039" style="s2">but I am suggesting that part of being</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.699" end="00:17:27.079" style="s2">educated is grappling with the key</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.039" end="00:17:28.879" style="s2">symbols and practices of the great</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.079" end="00:17:31.519" style="s2">traditions with the kind of world</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.879" end="00:17:35.570" style="s2">spirituality that&#39;s Daphne and Oprah</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.519" end="00:17:37.580" style="s2">called it or a new perennialism as a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.570" end="00:17:38.600" style="s2">to think about this which is some of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.580" end="00:17:40.669" style="s2">work I&#39;m doing at the Center for</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.600" end="00:17:43.309" style="s2">integral wisdom Wow new perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.669" end="00:17:45.889" style="s2">yeah yeah so this is Gaffney&#39;s term that</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.309" end="00:17:47.779" style="s2">we&#39;ve been building out as part of cosmo</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.889" end="00:17:50.029" style="s2">erotic humanism and the perennial list</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.779" end="00:17:51.649" style="s2">was an amazing movement and it was like</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.029" end="00:17:54.109" style="s2">all of a sudden taboo you know ken</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.649" end="00:17:57.769" style="s2">wilber was a Mentalist um there were</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.109" end="00:17:59.779" style="s2">many of them of course Huxley and so org</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.769" end="00:18:02.989" style="s2">and T liard I mean the list goes on and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.779" end="00:18:08.840" style="s2">on but looking for those under key</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.989" end="00:18:10.429" style="s2">underlying dimensions and is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.840" end="00:18:11.869" style="s2">reconfiguring of Education that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.429" end="00:18:13.279" style="s2">necessary it&#39;s one of the key themes in</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.869" end="00:18:14.570" style="s2">my book it&#39;s like we need to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.279" end="00:18:17.720" style="s2">this a new form of relaunch</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.570" end="00:18:20.269" style="s2">excuse me religiosity and spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.720" end="00:18:23.600" style="s2">need to characterize the educational</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.269" end="00:18:26.570" style="s2">institutions of the future yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:30.350" style="s2">especially for one piece and meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.570" end="00:18:33.320" style="s2">other things so do you agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.350" end="00:18:35.989" style="s2">John did I did I misconstrue something</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.320" end="00:18:37.700" style="s2">that you said or let me try and say what</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.989" end="00:18:39.830" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you do I did Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.700" end="00:18:41.629" style="s2">first of all I liked what exact just had</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.830" end="00:18:43.970" style="s2">to say although I want to I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.629" end="00:18:46.039" style="s2">a bit of a perennialism in a bit I want</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.970" end="00:18:48.669" style="s2">to I want to know what&#39;s new I want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.039" end="00:18:51.350" style="s2">know what&#39;s new and Neil perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.669" end="00:18:55.519" style="s2">differs it from I like Huxley and</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.350" end="00:19:01.249" style="s2">perennialism for example so we can come</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.519" end="00:19:03.590" style="s2">back to that I have a set of conference</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.249" end="00:19:06.590" style="s2">that I was just talking about you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.590" end="00:19:09.049" style="s2">that I was giving a argument that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.590" end="00:19:11.379" style="s2">cannot go through self transfer you</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.049" end="00:19:13.279" style="s2">cannot you you cannot use inferential</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.379" end="00:19:16.039" style="s2">computational procedures to go through</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.279" end="00:19:21.190" style="s2">self transcendence that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.039" end="00:19:25.880" style="s2">very deep arguments for that and so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.190" end="00:19:28.490" style="s2">think I clearly articulated this ghost</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.880" end="00:19:31.510" style="s2">mythopoetic point injured that i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.490" end="00:19:34.420" style="s2">two things are really important for</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.510" end="00:19:39.740" style="s2">aspiration and self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.420" end="00:19:41.900" style="s2">serious play and us symbolism where</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.740" end="00:19:46.430" style="s2">symbolism doesn&#39;t mean a culture a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.900" end="00:19:51.020" style="s2">cognitive ornamentation symbolism is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.430" end="00:19:55.760" style="s2">particularly of relating to the imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.020" end="00:19:59.390" style="s2">that allows us to move between John with</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:20:02.660" style="s2">this identity in this frame to that John</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.390" end="00:20:04.280" style="s2">with a new identity in that frame which</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.660" end="00:20:06.740" style="s2">is what taught what we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.280" end="00:20:09.980" style="s2">talking about John is talking about he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.740" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">aspiring to how to be and to write and</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.980" end="00:20:13.340" style="s2">to be in a world because it&#39;s always</p>

<p begin="00:20:13.340" end="00:20:19.640" style="s2">talks about things like wisdom I mean or</p>

<p begin="00:20:27.830" end="00:20:34.760" style="s2">that&#39;s Jane is faced in that liminal</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.870" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">place between so that I can keep I can</p>

<p begin="00:20:38.720" end="00:20:45.050" style="s2">it can lift me towards the next frame so</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.210" end="00:20:47.960" style="s2">I think symbolic activity is really</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.050" end="00:20:49.820" style="s2">important I think serious play is really</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.960" end="00:20:52.130" style="s2">important and my prototypical example of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.820" end="00:20:55.160" style="s2">serious play is ritual serious play is</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.130" end="00:20:58.730" style="s2">how we go into and play with that space</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.160" end="00:21:01.910" style="s2">between identities and worlds so that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.730" end="00:21:04.490" style="s2">can get a taste of what it would be like</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.910" end="00:21:06.620" style="s2">to what it would be like to be in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.490" end="00:21:09.140" style="s2">world and have that identity without</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.620" end="00:21:10.490" style="s2">fully committing to it then I was in my</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.140" end="00:21:11.990" style="s2">toe in the talk I just gave I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.490" end="00:21:15.440" style="s2">pointing out about all these emerging</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.990" end="00:21:18.800" style="s2">forms of serious play and ritual like</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:20.660" style="s2">Jeep forming in Scandinavia where people</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.800" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">are doing live-action role-playing and</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.660" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:27.230" style="s2">create a situation where they&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:29.390" style="s2">not doing Dungeons &amp; Dragons what</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.230" end="00:21:32.510" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is enacting a real-life</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.390" end="00:21:33.890" style="s2">situations and and the dungeon master is</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.510" end="00:21:36.080" style="s2">actually like a director that will get</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.890" end="00:21:37.640" style="s2">them to cut scenes and switch roles and</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:39.049" style="s2">give them various props and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.640" end="00:21:40.460" style="s2">phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.049" end="00:21:43.220" style="s2">they&#39;re seeking is the phenomenon called</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.460" end="00:21:45.049" style="s2">bleed and what they&#39;re after and bleed</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.220" end="00:21:46.940" style="s2">is that the distinction between what</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.049" end="00:21:49.190" style="s2">they&#39;re doing in their pretence of game</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.940" end="00:21:52.879" style="s2">and their real life that boundary bleeds</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.190" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">so they&#39;re getting a taste on what this</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.879" end="00:21:58.249" style="s2">could be like in their real life well</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:22:00.009" style="s2">that it took for me is deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.249" end="00:22:03.590" style="s2">analogous although it&#39;s taking place</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.009" end="00:22:05.840" style="s2">formally with in a secular discourse and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.590" end="00:22:08.119" style="s2">people who consider them suck that is so</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.840" end="00:22:09.889" style="s2">similar to what people do when they went</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.119" end="00:22:12.440" style="s2">into church right that kind of serious</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.889" end="00:22:14.269" style="s2">play that kind of ritual I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.440" end="00:22:16.039" style="s2">going in like the you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.269" end="00:22:18.619" style="s2">playing with identities you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.039" end="00:22:21.049" style="s2">with alternative frameworks other than</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.619" end="00:22:23.029" style="s2">your your your your own and you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.049" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">this all within active symbolism think</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.029" end="00:22:28.070" style="s2">about baptism for example within the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:29.690" style="s2">Christian complex so I think what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.070" end="00:22:31.159" style="s2">difference then sorry to interrupt like</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.690" end="00:22:34.129" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s the difference here</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.159" end="00:22:36.019" style="s2">between well you know is who was it who</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.129" end="00:22:37.940" style="s2">said everything is religion in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.019" end="00:22:40.809" style="s2">like well well then Dimity I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.940" end="00:22:45.590" style="s2">to do that useless category right I</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.809" end="00:22:49.850" style="s2">don&#39;t think everything is the difference</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.590" end="00:22:52.249" style="s2">is and this comes up and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.850" end="00:22:54.409" style="s2">address that point you know the new</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.249" end="00:22:56.539" style="s2">atheist assumed that most of the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.409" end="00:22:58.759" style="s2">that are the nuns the N o NES are</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.539" end="00:23:00.799" style="s2">basically they&#39;ve been convinced of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.759" end="00:23:01.399" style="s2">falsity of religion and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:04.249" style="s2">atheists</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.399" end="00:23:06.309" style="s2">but that is overwhelmingly not the case</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.249" end="00:23:09.529" style="s2">only about 10% of those people</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.309" end="00:23:12.580" style="s2">self-identify as atheist many of them</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.529" end="00:23:14.779" style="s2">you know have you know really crazy</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.580" end="00:23:17.450" style="s2">worldviews and they have you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.779" end="00:23:19.489" style="s2">hodgepodge of spiritual practices the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.450" end="00:23:21.559" style="s2">hunger for self transcendence the hunger</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.489" end="00:23:24.350" style="s2">for serious play the hunger for ritual</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.559" end="00:23:27.289" style="s2">all right and the hunger to get outside</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.350" end="00:23:29.659" style="s2">of the the prison of the ego these these</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.289" end="00:23:32.629" style="s2">I&#39;ll use sucks terms these are perennial</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.659" end="00:23:35.710" style="s2">these these don&#39;t go away but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.629" end="00:23:38.869" style="s2">different between the nuns right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.710" end="00:23:43.480" style="s2">people who would identify as religious</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.869" end="00:23:47.149" style="s2">has to do with commitments right to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.480" end="00:23:50.720" style="s2">particular institutions and particulars</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.149" end="00:23:52.490" style="s2">of propositions I think I think we</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.720" end="00:23:55.400" style="s2">should pay very careful attention</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.490" end="00:23:58.040" style="s2">to the religions in terms of how they</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.400" end="00:24:01.640" style="s2">can be valuable sources for ecology keys</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.040" end="00:24:03.470" style="s2">of practice that we should pay very</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.640" end="00:24:07.240" style="s2">careful attention to when we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.470" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">to cultivate ecologies or practices but</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.240" end="00:24:15.770" style="s2">for me those religions are off have been</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:17.270" style="s2">often bound up with and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.770" end="00:24:18.950" style="s2">and there&#39;s a spectrum here from liberal</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.270" end="00:24:22.130" style="s2">to fundamentalist so I am acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.950" end="00:24:24.290" style="s2">the spectrum right now but right they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.130" end="00:24:25.940" style="s2">been but let&#39;s but they have often been</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.290" end="00:24:28.250" style="s2">bound up with adherence to particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.940" end="00:24:33.410" style="s2">sets of doctrines about the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.250" end="00:24:35.059" style="s2">structure of a worldview and I find the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.410" end="00:24:37.970" style="s2">metaphysical structure of many of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.059" end="00:24:39.080" style="s2">worldviews well first of all I&#39;ll speak</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.970" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">on behalf for the nuns because I had</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.080" end="00:24:42.320" style="s2">brought it up they find that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:44.120" style="s2">metaphysical structure and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.320" end="00:24:45.920" style="s2">institutions that identify with it they</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.120" end="00:24:47.780" style="s2">find it and I am viable they do it just</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.920" end="00:24:51.500" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t catch them it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.780" end="00:24:53.300" style="s2">resonate with them or it feels to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.500" end="00:24:55.429" style="s2">that it&#39;s kind of a no-man&#39;s land</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.300" end="00:24:57.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like either you make it all up as</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.429" end="00:25:00.530" style="s2">you go along or you&#39;re you&#39;re trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.800" end="00:25:01.820" style="s2">some kind of formal structure well well</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.530" end="00:25:03.260" style="s2">you can understand why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.820" end="00:25:08.540" style="s2">traumatized right they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.260" end="00:25:10.490" style="s2">traumatized by the fact in fact the a</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.540" end="00:25:12.050" style="s2">secular alternatives drench the world in</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.490" end="00:25:14.800" style="s2">blood and so they don&#39;t want to belong</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.050" end="00:25:20.660" style="s2">to put you know big political machines</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.800" end="00:25:23.390" style="s2">but they many of them have seen the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.660" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">various religions traditions fragment</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.390" end="00:25:30.740" style="s2">around them and be admired in</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:34.070" style="s2">controversy and scandal and also too</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.740" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">often many people myself included have</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.070" end="00:25:38.450" style="s2">you know have suffered personal psycho</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:41.030" style="s2">psychodynamic trauma at the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.450" end="00:25:43.070" style="s2">established religions and so they feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.030" end="00:25:44.809" style="s2">they make a mistake I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.070" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">mistake but I want to explain what well</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.809" end="00:25:49.100" style="s2">I think it&#39;s an understandable mistake</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:51.890" style="s2">they think allegiance to any group or</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.100" end="00:25:53.809" style="s2">any tradition will automatically make</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.890" end="00:25:56.390" style="s2">them vulnerable to all of these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.809" end="00:25:58.850" style="s2">terrors once again what they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.390" end="00:26:00.530" style="s2">acknowledge enough and I think what you</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.850" end="00:26:03.679" style="s2">put your finger on is that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.530" end="00:26:05.960" style="s2">autodidactic fragmented thing is really</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.679" end="00:26:11.000" style="s2">really prone to self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.960" end="00:26:12.620" style="s2">and all kinds of you know which</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.000" end="00:26:14.750" style="s2">you see if you actually look at sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.620" end="00:26:16.760" style="s2">the things they espouse and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.750" end="00:26:18.950" style="s2">practices they try to cobble together</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.760" end="00:26:21.230" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m thinking of Zach&#39;s term</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.950" end="00:26:25.490" style="s2">teaching Billy Authority the crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.230" end="00:26:27.380" style="s2">teacherly authority as being maybe I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.490" end="00:26:33.169" style="s2">key right here like we need teachers</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.380" end="00:26:34.549" style="s2">right we need hmm do you want to comment</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.169" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">on that sorry</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.549" end="00:26:40.549" style="s2">yeah I mean I agree with with John I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:41.809" style="s2">mean I think the the issue of what to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.549" end="00:26:43.460" style="s2">with their religions is a big one</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.809" end="00:26:44.899" style="s2">because they&#39;ve been massively probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.460" end="00:26:48.700" style="s2">Mac they&#39;ve also drenched the world in</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.899" end="00:26:52.850" style="s2">blood and this drama that has many many</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.700" end="00:26:54.500" style="s2">many people and and so yeah it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.850" end="00:26:56.929" style="s2">interesting because I think it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.500" end="00:26:58.880" style="s2">compare like the worst religious</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.929" end="00:27:01.190" style="s2">discourse to like the best scientific</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.880" end="00:27:03.890" style="s2">discourse well correct we need to look</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.190" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2">at the best religious discourse yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.890" end="00:27:06.770" style="s2">and we could look at the worst</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:08.450" style="s2">scientific discourse where you&#39;re giving</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.350" end="00:28:16.730" style="s2">reforms in schools in the United States</p>

<p begin="00:28:40.040" end="00:28:45.980" style="s2">to look again at the things we used to</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.860" end="00:28:47.480" style="s2">worship before and think about how we</p>

<p begin="00:28:47.480" end="00:28:51.860" style="s2">as you&#39;re describing Jon like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.030" end="00:28:54.549" style="s2">actually have the archetypes to step</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.860" end="00:28:56.990" style="s2">into the mystery schools were theaters</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.549" end="00:28:58.760" style="s2">rights to your point about the role</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.990" end="00:29:01.520" style="s2">playing and the seer display their</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.760" end="00:29:04.490" style="s2">mystery schools were theaters and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.520" end="00:29:09.710" style="s2">many of the initiation rites that went</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.490" end="00:29:12.290" style="s2">down were theatric and the ritual being</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.710" end="00:29:14.210" style="s2">like the mass being the living symbol</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.290" end="00:29:16.760" style="s2">then right up to steiner who actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.210" end="00:29:18.890" style="s2">resuscitated some of those it&#39;s the at</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.760" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">tricks to encode a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.890" end="00:29:27.110" style="s2">initiation ceremony and so yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:30.220" style="s2">seeing some need to find a way you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.110" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">some needs to work with these symbols</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.220" end="00:29:38.480" style="s2">and to kind of grapple with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.120" end="00:29:43.160" style="s2">resurgence of religion which could be an</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.480" end="00:29:45.799" style="s2">invitation to refine it so again and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.160" end="00:29:47.450" style="s2">difference between the theatrics of non</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.799" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">religion and the theatrics of religion</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.450" end="00:29:51.380" style="s2">let&#39;s say if we want to call it the at</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:54.559" style="s2">record the two kind of ritual would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.380" end="00:29:59.299" style="s2">something to do with the historicity of</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.559" end="00:30:01.669" style="s2">the religious right when I chant Hebrew</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.299" end="00:30:05.150" style="s2">chant this has been chanted for</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.669" end="00:30:06.440" style="s2">thousands of years when I make up a</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.150" end="00:30:07.970" style="s2">chant with my friends and we chant then</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.440" end="00:30:09.470" style="s2">we take it very seriously and we can get</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.970" end="00:30:11.090" style="s2">into an altered state that the chant has</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.470" end="00:30:14.419" style="s2">not been chanted for thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.090" end="00:30:16.280" style="s2">by humans mm-hmm and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.419" end="00:30:17.990" style="s2">transmission that you are speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.280" end="00:30:20.690" style="s2">it&#39;s nothing to do with transmission</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.990" end="00:30:23.330" style="s2">it&#39;s something to do with less calm more</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.690" end="00:30:24.470" style="s2">for genetic fields if I can bring the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.330" end="00:30:26.200" style="s2">shrill Drake into the room which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.470" end="00:30:29.020" style="s2">perhaps controversial</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.200" end="00:30:30.700" style="s2">at least to the scientism ground but it</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.020" end="00:30:34.890" style="s2">has so it has to do with the insolvent</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.700" end="00:30:37.450" style="s2">of humanity as an ontological factor</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.890" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">which is to say that even in a whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.450" end="00:30:43.210" style="s2">e&#39;en sense we&#39;re moving through a</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:46.299" style="s2">sequence and there are patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.210" end="00:30:50.440" style="s2">remain and so we step into temples in</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.299" end="00:30:53.620" style="s2">space and temples in time and so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.440" end="00:30:55.059" style="s2">ritual can create those you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.620" end="00:30:57.520" style="s2">one of the notions of the Sabbath right</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.059" end="00:31:00.220" style="s2">that it&#39;s not a temple in space it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.520" end="00:31:03.429" style="s2">temple in time and it&#39;s been made for</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.220" end="00:31:06.520" style="s2">thousands of years so that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.429" end="00:31:09.010" style="s2">from creating a focal space to do Improv</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.520" end="00:31:11.950" style="s2">Theater and as amazing as that is as</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.010" end="00:31:14.260" style="s2">important as on this to do in that space</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.950" end="00:31:19.750" style="s2">a ritual that&#39;s been done for thousands</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.260" end="00:31:22.090" style="s2">of years it&#39;s different and so so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.750" end="00:31:25.059" style="s2">and can schools plug into that in any</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.090" end="00:31:26.350" style="s2">way right schools the United States</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.059" end="00:31:27.280" style="s2">don&#39;t plug into that we plug into your</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.350" end="00:31:29.140" style="s2">additions that are a couple hundred</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.280" end="00:31:31.690" style="s2">years old at best and we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.140" end="00:31:34.600" style="s2">really buy them like the you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.690" end="00:31:36.460" style="s2">saluting the flag and on defense so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.600" end="00:31:39.190" style="s2">question of how to unite humanity again</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.460" end="00:31:42.130" style="s2">around things it&#39;s an interesting one</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.190" end="00:31:44.350" style="s2">and right now we&#39;re desperate for it</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.130" end="00:31:46.200" style="s2">we&#39;re super longing for like the Super</p>

<p begin="00:34:00.080" end="00:34:04.700" style="s2">and the debate between like for men and</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.639" end="00:34:08.240" style="s2">cats I won&#39;t burn the viewers with all</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.700" end="00:34:12.049" style="s2">of that but there here&#39;s what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.240" end="00:34:14.809" style="s2">say I guess I see perennialism as</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.049" end="00:34:17.450" style="s2">pointing to what&#39;s importantly invariant</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.809" end="00:34:21.440" style="s2">and I see the constructivist pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.450" end="00:34:23.599" style="s2">what is importantly varied and deep</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.440" end="00:34:26.149" style="s2">learning it actually cycles between</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.599" end="00:34:28.579" style="s2">those two you you expect what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.149" end="00:34:30.379" style="s2">invariant and then you have to know how</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.579" end="00:34:32.149" style="s2">to vary it so that you get appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.379" end="00:34:34.609" style="s2">fitted it to many different environments</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.149" end="00:34:38.869" style="s2">and you need to be able to move very</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.609" end="00:34:41.750" style="s2">effectively between you know compression</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.869" end="00:34:43.280" style="s2">for what&#39;s invariant and generation of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.750" end="00:34:46.329" style="s2">variation I mean that&#39;s how evolution</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.280" end="00:34:48.290" style="s2">biological evolution for example works</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.329" end="00:34:49.730" style="s2">and of course I think ultimately that</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.290" end="00:34:51.100" style="s2">has to do with things about relevance</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.730" end="00:34:53.690" style="s2">realization so</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.100" end="00:34:55.550" style="s2">we might bring this up as I explained in</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.690" end="00:34:59.090" style="s2">explaining this idea was Jordan Hall and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.550" end="00:35:01.730" style="s2">some of our discussions that maybe could</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.090" end="00:35:03.770" style="s2">we get past that that way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.730" end="00:35:05.240" style="s2">the you know perennial list versus</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.770" end="00:35:07.580" style="s2">constructivist and instead of go to a</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.240" end="00:35:09.590" style="s2">dynamic model where what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.580" end="00:35:13.310" style="s2">do is not say no what people should be</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.590" end="00:35:15.650" style="s2">doing instead of trying to get a stable</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.310" end="00:35:18.980" style="s2">set of doctrines what we should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.650" end="00:35:21.470" style="s2">is teaching people again an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.980" end="00:35:24.200" style="s2">practices that allows them right to</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.470" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">extract what&#39;s invariant but also then</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.200" end="00:35:28.460" style="s2">run right to learn how to make run the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:31.280" style="s2">variations off of it so they actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.460" end="00:35:34.310" style="s2">get this they actually instantiate the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:37.220" style="s2">adaptivity rather than trying to see</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.310" end="00:35:39.140" style="s2">through the my criticism I like Huxley</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.220" end="00:35:42.340" style="s2">by the way we have a family I can you</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.140" end="00:35:45.500" style="s2">know I mean how can you not like right</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.340" end="00:35:46.910" style="s2">and you should and I and what I might</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.500" end="00:35:47.900" style="s2">say next might be a little bit unfair to</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.910" end="00:35:49.850" style="s2">actually because you should read the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.900" end="00:35:51.740" style="s2">doors of perception alongside the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.850" end="00:35:54.050" style="s2">perennial philosophy but if you read</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.740" end="00:35:56.120" style="s2">just the perennial philosophy it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.050" end="00:35:57.350" style="s2">it&#39;s and how could it not be again I</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.120" end="00:35:58.790" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be unfair to because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.350" end="00:36:00.350" style="s2">a book but you can get the impression</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.790" end="00:36:02.360" style="s2">that it&#39;s about trying to find the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.350" end="00:36:05.170" style="s2">shared doctrines their shared</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.360" end="00:36:07.850" style="s2">propositions and tomorrow in mind um</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.170" end="00:36:10.190" style="s2">this is this is this is still a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.850" end="00:36:13.100" style="s2">problematic way of thinking that what</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.190" end="00:36:15.080" style="s2">they what we need to be doing is not</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.100" end="00:36:17.750" style="s2">trying to find the perennial</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.080" end="00:36:19.880" style="s2">propositions what we need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.750" end="00:36:23.450" style="s2">affording people like I said that</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.880" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">process of well can you can you look at</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.450" end="00:36:27.710" style="s2">all these traditions then draw out</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.520" end="00:36:30.110" style="s2">what&#39;s invariant and then also can you</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.710" end="00:36:32.510" style="s2">go back and in this context it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.110" end="00:36:34.100" style="s2">this way and this context becomes this</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.510" end="00:36:36.430" style="s2">one you see my model for this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.100" end="00:36:39.170" style="s2">Socrates what&#39;s impresses about Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.430" end="00:36:40.610" style="s2">seems to be like he&#39;s a you know what it</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.170" end="00:36:41.950" style="s2">looks like his although he&#39;s looking for</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.610" end="00:36:44.060" style="s2">his definition so that&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.950" end="00:36:45.710" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a part of what</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.060" end="00:36:47.360" style="s2">Socrates is doing is he&#39;s trying to he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.710" end="00:36:48.770" style="s2">trying to get what&#39;s invariant but you</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.360" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">know it&#39;s also masterful about Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.770" end="00:36:54.620" style="s2">how he buries that to whomever he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:56.120" style="s2">talking to right yeah that&#39;s what makes</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.620" end="00:36:59.360" style="s2">him the great teacher not just the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.120" end="00:37:01.730" style="s2">abstraction of what&#39;s invariant but the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.360" end="00:37:02.730" style="s2">generative the creative ability to vary</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.730" end="00:37:05.070" style="s2">it as</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.730" end="00:37:07.200" style="s2">and those two are constantly cycling</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.070" end="00:37:13.500" style="s2">right when you&#39;re doing engaged in deep</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.200" end="00:37:15.210" style="s2">learning so that that&#39;s why I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.500" end="00:37:17.790" style="s2">I sort of don&#39;t identify as a perennials</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.210" end="00:37:20.160" style="s2">or a constructivist I think I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.790" end="00:37:22.320" style="s2">to I&#39;m trying to try to break out of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:24.300" style="s2">that at least how I see that often</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.320" end="00:37:26.940" style="s2">argued about and discussed and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.300" end="00:37:28.590" style="s2">wondered what this what this might say</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.940" end="00:37:30.060" style="s2">how it could enter into dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.590" end="00:37:31.859" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about exactly you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.060" end="00:37:35.369" style="s2">talking about sort of a new perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.859" end="00:37:35.850" style="s2">oh and I kind of let the cat out of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.369" end="00:37:38.400" style="s2">bag</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.850" end="00:37:40.050" style="s2">because that was that&#39;s caveny it&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.400" end="00:37:41.400" style="s2">he&#39;s been working on this for about a</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.050" end="00:37:42.480" style="s2">year and I&#39;ve been in close conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.400" end="00:37:45.090" style="s2">with him can Wilbur&#39;s been in close</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:48.810" style="s2">conversation and but there&#39;s a very real</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.090" end="00:37:51.890" style="s2">need to get beyond that false dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.810" end="00:37:55.640" style="s2">and to see that even the staunchest</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.890" end="00:37:58.470" style="s2">constructivist admit that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.640" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">commonalities and even the staunchest</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.470" end="00:38:01.170" style="s2">people looking at commonalities are the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.000" end="00:38:03.480" style="s2">first thing they say is that well</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.170" end="00:38:05.430" style="s2">different engines are all different</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.480" end="00:38:06.750" style="s2">stones it&#39;s actually been a false debate</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.430" end="00:38:07.980" style="s2">for a long time again one of those</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.750" end="00:38:09.900" style="s2">things that&#39;s like it&#39;s visit for</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.980" end="00:38:11.580" style="s2">ratings or why why are we making this</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.900" end="00:38:14.850" style="s2">such a big deal why can&#39;t we actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.580" end="00:38:18.720" style="s2">agree here because there&#39;s a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.850" end="00:38:21.119" style="s2">amount there&#39;s a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.720" end="00:38:22.920" style="s2">important work to do in that domain and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.119" end="00:38:24.600" style="s2">so I&#39;m loving what you in Jordan they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.920" end="00:38:26.609" style="s2">saying the share Jordan as interlocutor</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.600" end="00:38:29.720" style="s2">and yeah there&#39;s a sense in which I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.609" end="00:38:31.500" style="s2">you know in a friendly way and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.720" end="00:38:32.580" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a sense in which what</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.500" end="00:38:34.859" style="s2">you&#39;re getting outs to as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.580" end="00:38:38.090" style="s2">developmental issue that there&#39;s a an</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.859" end="00:38:41.280" style="s2">ability to work at a level of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.090" end="00:38:44.330" style="s2">abstraction and compress complexity with</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.280" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">domains of practice and propositions</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.330" end="00:38:50.430" style="s2">that does allow like the Huxley like</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:53.180" style="s2">move of pulling out things for ones Oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.430" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">making one&#39;s own personal synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.180" end="00:39:00.450" style="s2">perennial tradition for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.920" end="00:39:04.190" style="s2">basically um and so that&#39;s a quite a</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.450" end="00:39:09.180" style="s2">hefty task demand on the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.190" end="00:39:10.109" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.180" end="00:39:11.819" style="s2">when you start breaching the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.109" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">constructivist view with the / Ilyas</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.819" end="00:39:16.710" style="s2">view and you start to see what it would</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:18.650" style="s2">look like to have both somehow you end</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.710" end="00:39:21.630" style="s2">up with that as the educational</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.650" end="00:39:22.920" style="s2">recommendation so I love what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.630" end="00:39:24.089" style="s2">like theoretically it&#39;s like well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.920" end="00:39:26.760" style="s2">not in the theory anymore I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.089" end="00:39:30.020" style="s2">about in ecology of practice I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.760" end="00:39:32.730" style="s2">to create yeah we write informed by the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.020" end="00:39:33.869" style="s2">informed by this new neo perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.730" end="00:39:35.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s a whole bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.869" end="00:39:40.140" style="s2">things to say about it which I&#39;ll leave</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.760" end="00:39:41.309" style="s2">for when the books you know but one one</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.140" end="00:39:45.510" style="s2">of them is basically that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.309" end="00:39:47.089" style="s2">there&#39;s a common sense there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.510" end="00:39:49.829" style="s2">what we call an anthro ontological</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.089" end="00:39:52.619" style="s2">Givens and so these are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.829" end="00:39:55.230" style="s2">when Socrates epitomize them these are</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.619" end="00:39:58.050" style="s2">the kind of natural working of the human</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.230" end="00:40:01.079" style="s2">that moves into the realms that would</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.050" end="00:40:03.630" style="s2">create a religion right and like what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.079" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">that dynamic of the human being that</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.630" end="00:40:08.309" style="s2">leads up and through those are very</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:09.599" style="s2">complex stack to create these things</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.309" end="00:40:12.059" style="s2">which you&#39;re identifying John which are</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.599" end="00:40:16.380" style="s2">like the underlying structural features</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.059" end="00:40:19.140" style="s2">of religiosity and so being able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.380" end="00:40:20.579" style="s2">distill some of that and saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.140" end="00:40:22.319" style="s2">result of that in almost any domain</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.579" end="00:40:24.750" style="s2">you&#39;ve started to see things like first</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.319" end="00:40:28.130" style="s2">hand for like life matters I got an</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.750" end="00:40:30.900" style="s2">interesting proposition let me first</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.130" end="00:40:34.470" style="s2">write that there is right and wrong I</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.900" end="00:40:35.819" style="s2">mean these kinds of things like not not</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.470" end="00:40:38.309" style="s2">here&#39;s what&#39;s right here&#39;s our drawing</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.819" end="00:40:41.250" style="s2">can&#39;t say that but that there is right</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.309" end="00:40:44.520" style="s2">and wrong right so you start to get to</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.250" end="00:40:46.589" style="s2">these anthro ontological gibbons and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.520" end="00:40:49.349" style="s2">start to be able to look to work with</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.589" end="00:40:51.660" style="s2">them in different contexts and at you</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.349" end="00:40:54.210" style="s2">end up getting something that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.660" end="00:40:57.270" style="s2">a set of propositions eventually but</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.210" end="00:40:59.579" style="s2">also like a way to craft Ecology&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.270" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">practice after that people can have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.579" end="00:41:04.920" style="s2">refined perception and those become</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:06.180" style="s2">things that they could prove basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.920" end="00:41:10.650" style="s2">instead of things they have to believe</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.180" end="00:41:12.960" style="s2">and so so yeah so I think we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.650" end="00:41:14.369" style="s2">in it from similar angles like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.960" end="00:41:17.070" style="s2">coming in from different sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.369" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">mountain to some three middle</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.070" end="00:41:22.350" style="s2">and you know maybe we&#39;re taking the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">faster longer route but you&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.350" end="00:41:28.950" style="s2">like this direct route and the yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:32.190" style="s2">so I think yeah we&#39;re talking in similar</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.950" end="00:41:34.290" style="s2">similar vein here that feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.190" end="00:41:37.890" style="s2">convergence in the sense that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.290" end="00:41:40.380" style="s2">talking about Commandments or rules of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.890" end="00:41:42.300" style="s2">behavior but you&#39;re talking about some</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.380" end="00:41:45.690" style="s2">kind of something more dynamic or</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.300" end="00:41:49.650" style="s2">something more something edgy or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.690" end="00:41:51.210" style="s2">it&#39;s a negative and yeah sorry did I cut</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.650" end="00:41:54.750" style="s2">you off it&#39;s not gonna mean - no I</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.210" end="00:41:56.100" style="s2">please well I was just gonna say I yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.750" end="00:41:58.770" style="s2">I think so and it comes back to this</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.100" end="00:42:00.690" style="s2">notion of serious play yeah I think of</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.770" end="00:42:04.290" style="s2">Sinclair&#39;s work on you actually watch</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.690" end="00:42:06.870" style="s2">how children learn you see if you see</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.290" end="00:42:08.760" style="s2">you see this dynamic process let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.870" end="00:42:10.080" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to learn something for</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.760" end="00:42:11.490" style="s2">solving a set of problems to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.080" end="00:42:15.240" style="s2">some goal they&#39;ll come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.490" end="00:42:17.370" style="s2">strategy for it right but what will they</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.240" end="00:42:19.080" style="s2">do is they will they will they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.370" end="00:42:20.910" style="s2">stick with that strategy initially and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.080" end="00:42:22.920" style="s2">this is what happens in play they will</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.910" end="00:42:24.630" style="s2">generate all kinds of variations on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.920" end="00:42:26.010" style="s2">strategy and then they will put the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.630" end="00:42:27.690" style="s2">strategies into competition with each</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.010" end="00:42:29.280" style="s2">other and then they&#39;ll until they get</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.690" end="00:42:31.890" style="s2">one that sort of wins that out and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.280" end="00:42:34.230" style="s2">they go with that right and and so what</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.890" end="00:42:36.750" style="s2">I&#39;m saying is you see this movement of</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.230" end="00:42:38.820" style="s2">they&#39;ll update here&#39;s the situation</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.750" end="00:42:40.050" style="s2">they abstract some invariant thing they</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.820" end="00:42:41.610" style="s2">come up with a strategy but then they</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.050" end="00:42:43.860" style="s2">don&#39;t stop there then they do this</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.610" end="00:42:45.870" style="s2">generative variation right and then they</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.860" end="00:42:49.710" style="s2">keep cycling and cycling and cycling and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.870" end="00:42:51.000" style="s2">cycling and I want I want I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.710" end="00:42:53.940" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to say and you see the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.000" end="00:42:55.740" style="s2">thing in you know in Hinton&#39;s deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.940" end="00:42:58.130" style="s2">learning that&#39;s how these things work</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.740" end="00:43:04.230" style="s2">they they cycle between compression and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.130" end="00:43:06.690" style="s2">particularization I want to put an</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.230" end="00:43:10.110" style="s2">emphasis on keeping the cycling going</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.690" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">rather than trying to stabilize it into</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.110" end="00:43:17.600" style="s2">a complete set of propositions that have</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:19.800" style="s2">sort of resolved you know the the baffle</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.600" end="00:43:21.090" style="s2">between the constructivists and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.800" end="00:43:22.590" style="s2">perennial list but that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.090" end="00:43:24.930" style="s2">trying to advocate sounds like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.590" end="00:43:27.510" style="s2">saying something similar Zac am i right</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.930" end="00:43:29.980" style="s2">yeah I mean and I think it&#39;s that focus</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.510" end="00:43:31.720" style="s2">on the theologies of practice that</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.980" end="00:43:34.600" style="s2">allow for the self-transformation that</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.720" end="00:43:37.150" style="s2">allow for the personal synthesis like</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.600" end="00:43:39.930" style="s2">that are you each end up being able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.150" end="00:43:42.760" style="s2">have for yourself a set of propositions</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.930" end="00:43:44.650" style="s2">many of which will be in overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.760" end="00:43:47.619" style="s2">consensus with the propositions of</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.650" end="00:43:48.790" style="s2">others and pedagogically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.619" end="00:43:51.609" style="s2">interesting because you do end up</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.790" end="00:43:54.970" style="s2">needing simple lists of propositions to</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.609" end="00:43:58.030" style="s2">tell kids and so when I think of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.970" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">free play and I think of the way rituals</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.030" end="00:44:01.930" style="s2">spontaneously emerges actually think of</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:03.940" style="s2">PJs the moral judgment of the child when</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.930" end="00:44:05.590" style="s2">the kids are playing marbles and so is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.940" end="00:44:07.090" style="s2">completely free and it&#39;ll actually talk</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.590" end="00:44:09.369" style="s2">about Jordan about this there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.090" end="00:44:11.050" style="s2">employee up in space like literally the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.369" end="00:44:12.520" style="s2">kids have like the teachers are there</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.050" end="00:44:14.350" style="s2">but they&#39;re not teaching the kids how to</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.520" end="00:44:17.320" style="s2">play marbles the kids literally create</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.350" end="00:44:19.600" style="s2">the game of marbles and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.320" end="00:44:22.030" style="s2">serious game in which there are right</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.600" end="00:44:23.650" style="s2">and wrong and morally good and bad and</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.030" end="00:44:25.600" style="s2">they have the young kids don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.650" end="00:44:27.400" style="s2">rules but the older kids give the rules</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.600" end="00:44:30.730" style="s2">basically but the rules are flexible</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.400" end="00:44:31.930" style="s2">often they know that can change them at</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.730" end="00:44:33.400" style="s2">the beginning when you ask a kid who</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.930" end="00:44:38.440" style="s2">invented the rules of marbles he says</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.400" end="00:44:40.060" style="s2">basically a god dad some of that but by</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.440" end="00:44:41.619" style="s2">the end by the adolescence planning</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.060" end="00:44:42.820" style="s2">marbles when it&#39;s my very high stakes</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.619" end="00:44:44.920" style="s2">because they&#39;re taking the marbles home</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.820" end="00:44:47.500" style="s2">they should get marbles to take away if</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.920" end="00:44:50.320" style="s2">you win you get a bunch of marbles they</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.500" end="00:44:52.180" style="s2">know that they created the rules and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.320" end="00:44:54.820" style="s2">play there is both physiological with</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.180" end="00:44:57.490" style="s2">the marble they would also die illogical</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.820" end="00:44:59.590" style="s2">we just say how do they without parental</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.490" end="00:45:02.800" style="s2">intervention without the teacher coming</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.590" end="00:45:06.070" style="s2">in how do they resolve a conflict either</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.800" end="00:45:08.050" style="s2">is the rule being applied or is the rule</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.070" end="00:45:10.510" style="s2">a problem and then how do you know if</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.050" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">rules a problem is it fair and then you</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.510" end="00:45:17.380" style="s2">go right up and into the rosianna</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:19.390" style="s2">Kohlberg in developmental sequence but</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.380" end="00:45:20.590" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s the there&#39;s the creation</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.390" end="00:45:22.630" style="s2">of the free play in these different</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.590" end="00:45:25.030" style="s2">realms and the free play in the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.630" end="00:45:28.000" style="s2">the intersubjective and specifically in</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.030" end="00:45:30.520" style="s2">the realm of let&#39;s save Africa bone is</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.000" end="00:45:31.990" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting I think pedagogy and</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.520" end="00:45:35.140" style="s2">hard to create those environments</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.990" end="00:45:36.520" style="s2">because and so this gets your point</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.140" end="00:45:38.650" style="s2">about we can&#39;t count if I a list of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.520" end="00:45:40.420" style="s2">rules that makes those environments</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.650" end="00:45:42.350" style="s2">disappear right we need to create</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.420" end="00:45:45.290" style="s2">environments precisely where</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.350" end="00:45:48.890" style="s2">young people and young adults and adults</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.290" end="00:45:53.030" style="s2">probably find a way to resolve their</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.890" end="00:45:55.220" style="s2">disputes through dialogue and through</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.030" end="00:45:57.530" style="s2">the creation of norms together as</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.220" end="00:45:59.660" style="s2">opposed to the procedural application of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.530" end="00:46:03.890" style="s2">a norm to a situation like legal for</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.660" end="00:46:05.810" style="s2">example or force and so yet with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.890" end="00:46:10.670" style="s2">disappearance of the playground and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.810" end="00:46:13.910" style="s2">retreat into the digital the total</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.670" end="00:46:15.650" style="s2">intermediation of that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.910" end="00:46:17.830" style="s2">they&#39;re developing a conflict in</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.650" end="00:46:21.230" style="s2">asynchronous text-based exchange is</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.830" end="00:46:25.460" style="s2">given then doing so I mean in you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.230" end="00:46:26.870" style="s2">there&#39;s so-called real-world experiment</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.460" end="00:46:28.910" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.870" end="00:46:30.650" style="s2">that going to be exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.910" end="00:46:32.900" style="s2">disappearance of the playground can join</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.650" end="00:46:34.580" style="s2">to the virtual exodus we&#39;re running this</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.900" end="00:46:36.770" style="s2">huge social experiment that&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.580" end="00:46:40.040" style="s2">I think some pretty nasty consequences</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.770" end="00:46:42.350" style="s2">or that are kind of unforeseen by us</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.040" end="00:46:44.120" style="s2">right now I I think you mentioning that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.350" end="00:46:45.110" style="s2">zach is I just want to put a pin in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.120" end="00:46:47.540" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.110" end="00:46:49.700" style="s2">important that needs to be brought more</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.540" end="00:46:52.370" style="s2">into the public discussion as something</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.700" end="00:46:56.270" style="s2">that we need to be thinking about more</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.370" end="00:46:59.630" style="s2">much more carefully can I ask you</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.270" end="00:47:00.860" style="s2">another question then sure because you</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.630" end="00:47:03.080" style="s2">said something more provocative and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.860" end="00:47:04.970" style="s2">gonna really I&#39;m gonna really commit to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.080" end="00:47:09.910" style="s2">trying to stay open and relaxed here I</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.970" end="00:47:13.070" style="s2">mean I I am a scientist by a profession</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.910" end="00:47:15.770" style="s2">and I also think by vocation I love</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.070" end="00:47:21.380" style="s2">doing science I don&#39;t just do it for a</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.770" end="00:47:25.210" style="s2">salary I do it because I believe in its</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.380" end="00:47:28.010" style="s2">capacity to make things better I&#39;m not I</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.210" end="00:47:29.690" style="s2">think I get what you say about scientism</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.010" end="00:47:33.290" style="s2">I&#39;m definitely not a positivist I do not</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.690" end="00:47:35.450" style="s2">think that meaning is based on our</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.290" end="00:47:37.910" style="s2">capacity for verification of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.450" end="00:47:39.100" style="s2">statements i I think positivism is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.910" end="00:47:40.970" style="s2">self-defeating</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.100" end="00:47:43.460" style="s2">epistemological view so I completely</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.970" end="00:47:44.990" style="s2">reject that I think I know what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.460" end="00:47:47.420" style="s2">by scientism I think I&#39;ve said something</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.990" end="00:47:50.360" style="s2">similar along those lines and that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.420" end="00:47:52.670" style="s2">talk and Kris and I talked about you</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.360" end="00:47:53.900" style="s2">know propositional tyranny that we think</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.670" end="00:47:55.940" style="s2">we&#39;ve tried to reduce all forms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.900" end="00:47:58.040" style="s2">knowing to inferential</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.940" end="00:48:00.110" style="s2">computational propositional knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.040" end="00:48:03.110" style="s2">a generation of theory and belief and</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.110" end="00:48:05.360" style="s2">that has cut us off from a procedural</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.110" end="00:48:08.750" style="s2">knowing respectable and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.360" end="00:48:10.850" style="s2">and those which are much more embodied</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.750" end="00:48:13.160" style="s2">and embedded and inactive kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.850" end="00:48:16.400" style="s2">knowing are the main locus of where</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.160" end="00:48:19.100" style="s2">religio and meaning is made and so that</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.400" end="00:48:21.290" style="s2">that propositional tyranny which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.100" end="00:48:26.180" style="s2">tried to trace the history out I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.290" end="00:48:27.950" style="s2">is a significant cause of at least the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.180" end="00:48:30.470" style="s2">meaning Christ is part of the fourfold</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.950" end="00:48:34.460" style="s2">crisis so I&#39;m deeply critical of that so</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.470" end="00:48:36.860" style="s2">I guess I I guess I&#39;m also dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.460" end="00:48:40.700" style="s2">a bit of cognitive dissonance right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.860" end="00:48:44.240" style="s2">myself I&#39;m trying to my my like I say my</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.700" end="00:48:46.100" style="s2">vocational allegiance to science and my</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:48.470" style="s2">rejection of pop which I&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.100" end="00:48:51.800" style="s2">found a way I think of holding those two</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.470" end="00:48:53.750" style="s2">together consistently but I want to know</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.800" end="00:48:56.360" style="s2">what you think about that and and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.750" end="00:48:57.470" style="s2">of course and you know I think we should</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.360" end="00:48:59.750" style="s2">pursue this because I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.470" end="00:49:01.100" style="s2">directly relevant to how we see the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.750" end="00:49:03.260" style="s2">Academy right now because I do agree</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.100" end="00:49:06.440" style="s2">with Zack that we&#39;ve tried to tsiyon</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.260" end="00:49:08.900" style="s2">ties the Academy in wait that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.440" end="00:49:10.940" style="s2">inappropriate I was talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.900" end="00:49:15.500" style="s2">today that you know that this this</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.940" end="00:49:17.420" style="s2">fixation on stem is removing the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.500" end="00:49:21.020" style="s2">training of imagination and serious play</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.420" end="00:49:23.240" style="s2">and symbolic and the imaginal and in all</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.020" end="00:49:25.160" style="s2">the process despite and which oppose</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.240" end="00:49:27.470" style="s2">also with the disappearance of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.160" end="00:49:30.230" style="s2">playground I those are right those go</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.470" end="00:49:33.410" style="s2">together which were the places where we</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.230" end="00:49:37.730" style="s2">really cultivated perspectival and</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.410" end="00:49:41.120" style="s2">participatory transformation so what do</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.730" end="00:49:42.860" style="s2">you like yeah I mean it&#39;s sort of a blob</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.120" end="00:49:45.020" style="s2">of words but I&#39;m just trying to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.860" end="00:49:46.610" style="s2">lay out at no for me this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.020" end="00:49:48.020" style="s2">obviously what I&#39;m saying this is not</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.610" end="00:49:49.850" style="s2">just a theoretical issue this is an</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.020" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">existential issue for me and I have</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.850" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">great respect for your thinking so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:54.890" style="s2">want to you know enter into some</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:57.230" style="s2">dialogue here totally and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.890" end="00:49:58.850" style="s2">I may have said a little estoppel but do</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.230" end="00:50:00.740" style="s2">you remember I was saying we sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.850" end="00:50:03.020" style="s2">compare the worst of religion to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.740" end="00:50:04.490" style="s2">best of scientific discourse now saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.020" end="00:50:06.260" style="s2">could compare the best of religious</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.490" end="00:50:07.820" style="s2">discourse to the worst a scientific this</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.260" end="00:50:08.960" style="s2">person I call the worst of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.820" end="00:50:11.270" style="s2">discourse scientist</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.960" end="00:50:13.490" style="s2">right as if it was a religion capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.270" end="00:50:16.010" style="s2">right then I said something like</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.490" end="00:50:18.170" style="s2">military-industrial complex and a couple</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.010" end="00:50:20.330" style="s2">of things and another way to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.170" end="00:50:23.599" style="s2">scientism is something like techno</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.330" end="00:50:27.740" style="s2">industrial scientific reductionism which</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.599" end="00:50:29.480" style="s2">is the key is because I I couldn&#39;t say I</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.740" end="00:50:31.400" style="s2">couldn&#39;t say actually I haven&#39;t spent</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.480" end="00:50:34.369" style="s2">enough time to hide it maybe but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.400" end="00:50:36.430" style="s2">it&#39;s much more running at it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.369" end="00:50:39.220" style="s2">obsession with propositions that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.430" end="00:50:41.770" style="s2">it is in fact an obsession with</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.220" end="00:50:45.770" style="s2">applications specifically for</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.770" end="00:50:49.400" style="s2">renumeration and a capital gain</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.770" end="00:50:51.680" style="s2">so after Bhaskar wrote its philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.400" end="00:50:54.740" style="s2">science he then went on to a dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.680" end="00:50:57.140" style="s2">period where he cashed in the cheque</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.740" end="00:50:58.369" style="s2">that he had written to the positivist</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.140" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">about the fact that there was something</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.369" end="00:51:03.800" style="s2">and this that had to do with the nature</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:05.869" style="s2">of how the economic system was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.800" end="00:51:07.640" style="s2">so basically scientism the reason</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.869" end="00:51:10.010" style="s2">scientist some holds strong even though</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.640" end="00:51:14.180" style="s2">it&#39;s actually not great for us has to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.010" end="00:51:15.710" style="s2">with messed up incentive systems in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.180" end="00:51:18.410" style="s2">production of scientific knowledge so</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.710" end="00:51:20.000" style="s2">that in many cases it&#39;s not the unforced</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.410" end="00:51:21.410" style="s2">force of the better argument it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.000" end="00:51:24.770" style="s2">even the thing that makes the most</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.410" end="00:51:26.920" style="s2">scientific sense and so that is one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.770" end="00:51:30.290" style="s2">the key vectors there that&#39;s had down</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.920" end="00:51:31.970" style="s2">downstream impact on I think leading us</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.290" end="00:51:35.630" style="s2">to these forms of the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.970" end="00:51:37.369" style="s2">obsession and kind of reductive way of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.630" end="00:51:39.020" style="s2">thinking about right and bit of</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.369" end="00:51:40.580" style="s2">knowledge and wisdom doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.020" end="00:51:43.040" style="s2">there&#39;s no interior or gates and all</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.580" end="00:51:45.470" style="s2">that stuff but mostly the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.040" end="00:51:47.599" style="s2">worries me has to do with the places</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.470" end="00:51:49.550" style="s2">where we can&#39;t even really do I love</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.599" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">science I also consider myself a</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.550" end="00:51:55.040" style="s2">scientist and I want to save science</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:58.430" style="s2">from scientism and I want to save some</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.040" end="00:52:01.400" style="s2">specifically from the techno industrial</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.430" end="00:52:05.020" style="s2">opportunism and instrumentalization of</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.400" end="00:52:07.490" style="s2">science which is different than science</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.020" end="00:52:09.589" style="s2">like is that a good place to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.490" end="00:52:11.089" style="s2">the iatrogenic plague that you talked</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.589" end="00:52:12.410" style="s2">about last time yeah I mean that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.089" end="00:52:14.210" style="s2">most scary place where it happens but</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.410" end="00:52:15.619" style="s2">happens everywhere I I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.210" end="00:52:18.410" style="s2">you&#39;re referring to with that term can</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.619" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">you answer Janek has to do with injury</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.410" end="00:52:22.470" style="s2">caused by</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.160" end="00:52:25.770" style="s2">medical care basically oh I should</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.470" end="00:52:27.839" style="s2">insert the notion being that if we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.770" end="00:52:31.559" style="s2">a medical system that runs not ons not</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.839" end="00:52:33.119" style="s2">for science right but for profit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.559" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">you could say it doesn&#39;t run for profit</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.119" end="00:52:37.319" style="s2">well in America it does right and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.000" end="00:52:39.119" style="s2">pharmaceutical industries retur</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.319" end="00:52:41.099" style="s2">multinational which make more capital</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.119" end="00:52:43.799" style="s2">than almost any other industry or for</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.099" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">profit I&#39;m not reducing everything to</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.799" end="00:52:48.539" style="s2">the profit motive but I am talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.079" end="00:52:50.369" style="s2">an incentive structure if that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.539" end="00:52:52.559" style="s2">so that advertising revenues</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.369" end="00:52:54.960" style="s2">direct-to-consumer advertising revenues</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.559" end="00:52:59.130" style="s2">occupy most of what&#39;s a pharmaceutical</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.960" end="00:53:04.319" style="s2">spend its money on not a research and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.130" end="00:53:06.510" style="s2">the question of also how to bring to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.319" end="00:53:09.030" style="s2">public attention things that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.510" end="00:53:10.049" style="s2">problematic with the medical</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.030" end="00:53:11.819" style="s2">infrastructure from a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.049" end="00:53:13.980" style="s2">perspective when they&#39;ve been so encoded</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.819" end="00:53:15.960" style="s2">in the social fabric that it becomes too</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.980" end="00:53:17.609" style="s2">hard to even talk about them but this</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.960" end="00:53:19.289" style="s2">happens in all fields right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.609" end="00:53:20.670" style="s2">there&#39;s scientific discussions that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.289" end="00:53:22.020" style="s2">had about fossil fuels which can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.670" end="00:53:24.900" style="s2">had their scientific discussions we had</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.020" end="00:53:27.420" style="s2">about solar panels and the fact that can</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.900" end="00:53:29.250" style="s2">we create net positive energy production</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.420" end="00:53:30.839" style="s2">from solar panels or not that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.250" end="00:53:32.069" style="s2">a scientific debate it&#39;s not clear you</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.839" end="00:53:34.650" style="s2">know if you put them in space we good</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.069" end="00:53:37.890" style="s2">for right now it costs more energy to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.650" end="00:53:39.660" style="s2">make them then they can pull so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.890" end="00:53:42.119" style="s2">scientific debate for example it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.660" end="00:53:45.270" style="s2">being had that needs to be had but</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.119" end="00:53:47.789" style="s2">because of certain motions in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.270" end="00:53:49.859" style="s2">culture and specifically in industry and</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.789" end="00:53:53.549" style="s2">economic growth and incentives of those</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.859" end="00:53:55.849" style="s2">nature will you get scientism which is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.549" end="00:53:58.049" style="s2">set of propositions about what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.849" end="00:53:59.910" style="s2">that set of propositions about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.049" end="00:54:01.710" style="s2">true about the objective world or about</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.910" end="00:54:03.960" style="s2">your own body or about your own mind</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.710" end="00:54:05.670" style="s2">that proposition becomes the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.960" end="00:54:07.650" style="s2">regulates all these institutional</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.670" end="00:54:12.170" style="s2">domains and interactions and ritual</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.650" end="00:54:14.160" style="s2">spaces and question them it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.170" end="00:54:16.500" style="s2">all right how do you question it you</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.160" end="00:54:19.940" style="s2">actually have to become a expert PhD</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.500" end="00:54:23.599" style="s2">expert and so you&#39;re at the whim of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.940" end="00:54:26.490" style="s2">propositions wielded by sign to some</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.599" end="00:54:30.109" style="s2">future capture that&#39;s like the most</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.490" end="00:54:30.109" style="s2">negative way to paint scientism now</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.170" end="00:54:34.780" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was asking for</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.560" end="00:54:40.000" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s you&#39;re doing a great</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.780" end="00:54:42.550" style="s2">job so I actually know somebody like</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.000" end="00:54:45.190" style="s2">personally here in Canada who&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.550" end="00:54:46.870" style="s2">very hard to address the the plague you</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.190" end="00:54:49.270" style="s2">were talking about we&#39;re trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.870" end="00:54:52.120" style="s2">a lot of transparency into and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.270" end="00:54:54.280" style="s2">getting like legal success on this into</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.120" end="00:54:56.860" style="s2">the funding of pharmaceutical research</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.280" end="00:54:59.050" style="s2">medical research this is a big movement</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.860" end="00:55:02.470" style="s2">that&#39;s gaining steam largely due to</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.050" end="00:55:04.110" style="s2">environment one individual and because</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.470" end="00:55:07.030" style="s2">we Canada has a different culture</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.110" end="00:55:10.600" style="s2">towards healthcare it gets more traction</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.030" end="00:55:12.600" style="s2">here so ideally appreciate what you said</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.600" end="00:55:16.120" style="s2">now that I understand the play you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.600" end="00:55:18.490" style="s2">referring to so I was talking with</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.120" end="00:55:21.250" style="s2">Johannes about you know the high</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.490" end="00:55:22.810" style="s2">daguerreian idea about science and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.250" end="00:55:26.560" style="s2">technology being and did some framing</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.810" end="00:55:30.310" style="s2">and a way in which it sort of traps us</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.560" end="00:55:33.520" style="s2">into you know a cultural having mode we</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.310" end="00:55:36.100" style="s2">see we see the world as heidegger&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.520" end="00:55:38.140" style="s2">as a standing reserve and it exists only</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.100" end="00:55:41.470" style="s2">in its service to service that it can</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.140" end="00:55:46.750" style="s2">provide to us and that we lack an</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.470" end="00:55:49.810" style="s2">ability to even ask how we might matter</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.750" end="00:55:55.740" style="s2">to it or how we might be in service to</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.810" end="00:55:59.380" style="s2">it or that it might how to what degrees</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.740" end="00:56:00.970" style="s2">it transcends our grasp of it and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.380" end="00:56:02.920" style="s2">we should therefore respect it precisely</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.970" end="00:56:06.460" style="s2">because of that this is or the high</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.920" end="00:56:08.710" style="s2">daguerreian critique and it meshes back</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.460" end="00:56:10.180" style="s2">with what we were talking about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.710" end="00:56:14.740" style="s2">because I think of Thomas björkman</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.180" end="00:56:19.090" style="s2">argument that as we&#39;ve lost as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.740" end="00:56:22.480" style="s2">lost sort of you know religion and</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.090" end="00:56:24.610" style="s2">perhaps science at least in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.480" end="00:56:29.350" style="s2">way maybe you and I Thomas are all using</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.610" end="00:56:32.130" style="s2">attack we basically what&#39;s the market</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.350" end="00:56:36.540" style="s2">has been left as the default authority</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.130" end="00:56:36.540" style="s2">we don&#39;t have anything that represents</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.840" end="00:56:43.120" style="s2">values from the being mode we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.740" end="00:56:45.730" style="s2">anything that does that we don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.120" end="00:56:51.309" style="s2">institution</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.730" end="00:56:52.630" style="s2">and I&#39;m just wondering because you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.309" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">we used to have we used to have three</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.630" end="00:56:56.319" style="s2">things that played off against we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.160" end="00:56:58.119" style="s2">to the market and we have the church and</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.319" end="00:57:00.309" style="s2">we had the king right and you could</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.119" end="00:57:01.660" style="s2">always play them off against each other</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.309" end="00:57:04.180" style="s2">and so there was this tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.660" end="00:57:07.480" style="s2">capacity for you know self correction</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.180" end="00:57:12.880" style="s2">and self constraint and not just in</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.480" end="00:57:15.309" style="s2">action but also in theory and so what</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.880" end="00:57:16.599" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to put my finger on is it</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.309" end="00:57:20.170" style="s2">seems like we&#39;ve got this homogenization</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.599" end="00:57:22.509" style="s2">of power down to the market and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.170" end="00:57:23.920" style="s2">we&#39;ve got right hamato were like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.509" end="00:57:26.680" style="s2">getting into deep moral confusion the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.920" end="00:57:28.359" style="s2">only mode is the market mode following</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.680" end="00:57:30.700" style="s2">from which is you know the having mode</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.359" end="00:57:33.759" style="s2">and modal confusion and then this lines</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.700" end="00:57:35.859" style="s2">up with perhaps what I think I hear</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.759" end="00:57:37.839" style="s2">you&#39;re saying we&#39;re where science is</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.859" end="00:57:40.630" style="s2">understood or I would say misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.839" end="00:57:42.970" style="s2">as the halving of propositions and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.630" end="00:57:44.920" style="s2">all of those things would line up like</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.970" end="00:57:48.460" style="s2">they would mutually reinforce each other</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.920" end="00:57:50.049" style="s2">in a powerful way is that does that land</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.460" end="00:57:51.819" style="s2">with you does that does that sound like</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.049" end="00:57:52.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s connecting with what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.819" end="00:57:54.819" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.359" end="00:57:56.499" style="s2">yeah I mean very precisely and your</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.819" end="00:57:59.289" style="s2">canons point about the fact that all</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.499" end="00:58:00.910" style="s2">authority so the crisis of authority</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.289" end="00:58:01.599" style="s2">that we were talking about legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.910" end="00:58:03.519" style="s2">doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.599" end="00:58:05.559" style="s2">the result of that is that well it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.519" end="00:58:08.140" style="s2">market now that&#39;s the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.559" end="00:58:10.390" style="s2">can serve and so that means that yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.140" end="00:58:11.799" style="s2">science you can apply the commodity form</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.390" end="00:58:13.660" style="s2">to science itself</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.799" end="00:58:15.789" style="s2">yeah which is you put the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.660" end="00:58:17.410" style="s2">finding on the shelf and you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.789" end="00:58:18.759" style="s2">occlude everything that created the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.410" end="00:58:21.009" style="s2">scientific finding actually applied to</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.759" end="00:58:23.140" style="s2">the line so that it speaks to you as as</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.009" end="00:58:26.109" style="s2">a commodity almost like second nature</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.140" end="00:58:29.230" style="s2">and then you just accept Oakland and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.109" end="00:58:30.970" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s and that&#39;s the weekend the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.230" end="00:58:33.220" style="s2">worst scientific discourse right but</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.970" end="00:58:35.349" style="s2">there is science going on or poor we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.220" end="00:58:36.910" style="s2">be dead back amazingly so somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.349" end="00:58:39.430" style="s2">there are institutional niches where</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.910" end="00:58:40.869" style="s2">there&#39;s been a preservation of the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.430" end="00:58:42.460" style="s2">of interpersonal relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.869" end="00:58:44.650" style="s2">personal practices that actually allow</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.460" end="00:58:46.119" style="s2">for science to exist and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.650" end="00:58:46.930" style="s2">everything to remember about science is</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.119" end="00:58:50.230" style="s2">that where I should talk about</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.930" end="00:58:51.730" style="s2">scientists right here are people and</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.230" end="00:58:54.849" style="s2">their capacities and their meaning</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.730" end="00:58:57.339" style="s2">making nation and all of that stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.849" end="00:58:58.440" style="s2">where are they and how did they get</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.339" end="00:59:00.990" style="s2">trained and</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.440" end="00:59:03.720" style="s2">and so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.990" end="00:59:05.369" style="s2">because as much as I am trying to I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.720" end="00:59:07.740" style="s2">critical of stem and the over emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.369" end="00:59:10.470" style="s2">on stem but I&#39;m also like we really need</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.740" end="00:59:13.440" style="s2">actually better scientists and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.470" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">not that I want stem to be dialed back</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.440" end="00:59:17.339" style="s2">instead I want somehow there to be an</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">understanding that you can actually do</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.339" end="00:59:23.400" style="s2">stem if you don&#39;t have the human figured</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.640" end="00:59:24.839" style="s2">out that the scientists won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.400" end="00:59:26.490" style="s2">work if I can&#39;t make meaning of their</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.839" end="00:59:29.339" style="s2">lives like this is just what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.490" end="00:59:31.470" style="s2">happen and if that&#39;s the case then we</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.339" end="00:59:33.150" style="s2">actually have to handle these other</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.470" end="00:59:35.160" style="s2">dimensions of Education or to prepare</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.150" end="00:59:38.240" style="s2">scientists actually be able to value</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.160" end="00:59:40.980" style="s2">truth for example as opposed to value</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.240" end="00:59:44.599" style="s2">renumeration which is the default value</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.980" end="00:59:48.630" style="s2">that decides what you should value</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.599" end="00:59:50.220" style="s2">exactly and so yet the call for the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.630" end="00:59:52.530" style="s2">humanistic education is actually to save</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.220" end="00:59:55.829" style="s2">scientists and to save scientific</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.530" end="00:59:57.240" style="s2">civilization it&#39;s not to pull the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.829" end="00:59:59.190" style="s2">funding from science it&#39;s to say no</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.240" end="01:00:01.650" style="s2">actually look at this world we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.190" end="01:00:03.839" style="s2">created with your pure scientists who</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.650" end="01:00:05.849" style="s2">haven&#39;t been trained holistically as</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.839" end="01:00:07.279" style="s2">let&#39;s say Plato or Socrates would have</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.849" end="01:00:12.119" style="s2">demanded they would they were trained</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.279" end="01:00:14.130" style="s2">and so yeah that&#39;s interesting kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.119" end="01:00:15.510" style="s2">confluences of where the conversations</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.130" end="01:00:17.160" style="s2">led and I think it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.510" end="01:00:20.880" style="s2">right because who&#39;s the wise scientist</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.160" end="01:00:22.859" style="s2">where&#39;s the wise well I think we need</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.880" end="01:00:24.660" style="s2">why scientists I&#39;ve actually made that</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.859" end="01:00:26.849" style="s2">argument I just wondering then if</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.660" end="01:00:29.220" style="s2">because we&#39;ve now circled back again to</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.849" end="01:00:30.779" style="s2">our educational history because I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.220" end="01:00:33.059" style="s2">part of the problem has been at least</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.779" end="01:00:34.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve made this argument that provides</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.059" end="01:00:37.260" style="s2">historical reasons we separated two</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.980" end="01:00:39.119" style="s2">educational institutions I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.260" end="01:00:40.770" style="s2">fair to call them this given their the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.119" end="01:00:43.440" style="s2">broad notion of Education we both for</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.770" end="01:00:44.910" style="s2">all all three of us are using here you</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.440" end="01:00:47.250" style="s2">know when we separated the monastery</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.910" end="01:00:51.329" style="s2">from the University in the Middle Ages I</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.250" end="01:00:54.569" style="s2">think that has had that has sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.329" end="01:00:56.490" style="s2">reverberate it and it it&#39;s let I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.569" end="01:00:58.140" style="s2">because then then the university touches</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.490" end="01:01:00.480" style="s2">to the state and then the university</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.140" end="01:01:02.400" style="s2">then attaches via the deconstruction of</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.480" end="01:01:04.559" style="s2">the state to the market and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.400" end="01:01:08.630" style="s2">well I think in a very powerful way how</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.559" end="01:01:10.710" style="s2">we ended up where we are right now I</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.630" end="01:01:12.750" style="s2">mean that&#39;s an incredibly exciting</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.710" end="01:01:14.820" style="s2">what you said to me because that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.750" end="01:01:16.170" style="s2">that&#39;s like the thread through and it</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.820" end="01:01:19.050" style="s2">has to do with what happened when the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.170" end="01:01:21.690" style="s2">Enlightenment got going right and the 30</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.050" end="01:01:24.780" style="s2">Years War and the fear of religion right</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.690" end="01:01:27.480" style="s2">and the meeting for yep that&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.780" end="01:01:28.830" style="s2">separate these things and eventually the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.480" end="01:01:30.599" style="s2">separation of church and state but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.830" end="01:01:33.119" style="s2">you get the powers of truth and beauty</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.599" end="01:01:36.810" style="s2">and goodness if you if I can say that</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.119" end="01:01:38.250" style="s2">attach to the state as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.810" end="01:01:40.730" style="s2">chance to the church so there was a</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.250" end="01:01:43.470" style="s2">deadly the University gotta hand it over</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.730" end="01:01:45.960" style="s2">to eventually the state apparatus and</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.470" end="01:01:48.210" style="s2">then eventually in the market yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.960" end="01:01:51.480" style="s2">and so yeah the question of how to pull</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.210" end="01:01:54.119" style="s2">the Academy back into the sacred and</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.480" end="01:01:57.359" style="s2">make and the the places that make the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.119" end="01:01:58.650" style="s2">person which are you know traditionally</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.359" end="01:02:00.660" style="s2">the religions but ever as we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.650" end="01:02:01.859" style="s2">saying that needs to be rethought so now</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.660" end="01:02:04.920" style="s2">you&#39;re imagining academic knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.859" end="01:02:07.859" style="s2">production know what did with the kinds</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.920" end="01:02:10.020" style="s2">of apologies have practice that that</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.859" end="01:02:12.720" style="s2">produces and look that way you just said</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.020" end="01:02:16.859" style="s2">that I like that idea about trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.720" end="01:02:19.230" style="s2">make the creation of a person within a</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.859" end="01:02:21.540" style="s2">community of persons the central task</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.230" end="01:02:23.220" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.540" end="01:02:23.490" style="s2">not we&#39;re not oriented that way right</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.220" end="01:02:26.040" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.490" end="01:02:29.640" style="s2">I mean we&#39;re not oriented that way we</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.040" end="01:02:33.270" style="s2">wanted to towards you know making making</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.640" end="01:02:36.089" style="s2">consumer producers as effectively as we</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.270" end="01:02:38.700" style="s2">can but I think I just what you just</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.089" end="01:02:41.400" style="s2">said there I think that&#39;s a real gem in</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.700" end="01:02:43.830" style="s2">the dialogue trying to make that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.400" end="01:02:45.510" style="s2">know that that that awesome and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.830" end="01:02:48.630" style="s2">that in the sense of filling us with all</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.510" end="01:02:51.180" style="s2">that awesome project that sacred project</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.630" end="01:02:53.700" style="s2">of making persons within a community of</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.180" end="01:02:57.869" style="s2">persons that the central thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.700" end="01:02:59.040" style="s2">trying to were we&#39;re trying to do I I</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.869" end="01:03:01.650" style="s2">think that that I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.040" end="01:03:01.830" style="s2">beautiful thing to have said yeah thank</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.650" end="01:03:06.089" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.830" end="01:03:07.890" style="s2">I was as well also Bonita said the same</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.089" end="01:03:10.020" style="s2">thing when I talked to her it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.890" end="01:03:12.359" style="s2">redefinition of the human being or going</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.020" end="01:03:15.359" style="s2">back to another vision of the human</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.359" end="01:03:20.369" style="s2">being right as not being some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.359" end="01:03:23.630" style="s2">end product or or but a process and that</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.369" end="01:03:26.930" style="s2">that should be the the main thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.630" end="01:03:28.400" style="s2">yeah main main main point of Education</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.930" end="01:03:31.759" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just it seems like an almost</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.400" end="01:03:34.819" style="s2">uh overly obvious thing which every</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.759" end="01:03:36.950" style="s2">missing out completely right right and</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.819" end="01:03:38.569" style="s2">the way you articulated and the slope</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.950" end="01:03:41.809" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying Andrews correct and</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.569" end="01:03:43.609" style="s2">it&#39;s because of what what John was</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.809" end="01:03:45.349" style="s2">saying about Heidegger&#39;s notion of</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.609" end="01:03:46.819" style="s2">technology right that we don&#39;t we asked</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.349" end="01:03:50.869" style="s2">what it can do for us basically we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.819" end="01:03:51.890" style="s2">ask but we do for it yeah even in school</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.869" end="01:03:53.420" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about it well I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.890" end="01:03:54.650" style="s2">go get this job so I can get that money</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.420" end="01:03:56.059" style="s2">and then do that thing right or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.650" end="01:03:58.249" style="s2">if you&#39;re they can conventionally or</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.059" end="01:04:00.019" style="s2">something but you&#39;re not thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.249" end="01:04:02.720" style="s2">what wait a second if I get that job how</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.019" end="01:04:04.880" style="s2">much of my labor time will actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.720" end="01:04:06.739" style="s2">contribute to the wages that go to that</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.880" end="01:04:08.359" style="s2">guy and if I buy this thing how much of</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.739" end="01:04:09.950" style="s2">that goes to so you&#39;re not thinking</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.359" end="01:04:11.900" style="s2">about how you were actually needed by</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.950" end="01:04:13.339" style="s2">the system your um and so if you flip</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.900" end="01:04:15.769" style="s2">the script you realize now that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.339" end="01:04:18.979" style="s2">school is actually making me so I can be</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.769" end="01:04:20.479" style="s2">useful to that as it goes through a lot</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.979" end="01:04:21.890" style="s2">alright so then if you flip it as we</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.479" end="01:04:22.970" style="s2">discussed and you and put the tempo of</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.890" end="01:04:24.950" style="s2">learning at the top of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.970" end="01:04:28.489" style="s2">economic stack and then you end up</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.950" end="01:04:30.249" style="s2">saying oh no what it wants from what it</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.489" end="01:04:32.599" style="s2">wants for me but the whole technological</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.249" end="01:04:35.299" style="s2">civilization apparatus once for me is</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.599" end="01:04:38.599" style="s2">for me to be me there me to develop that</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.299" end="01:04:40.999" style="s2">seems to be a deep complexification of</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.599" end="01:04:44.420" style="s2">everything because one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.999" end="01:04:47.029" style="s2">why we&#39;re in this state when I think of</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.420" end="01:04:49.549" style="s2">my students is weird entirely confused</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.029" end="01:04:53.869" style="s2">about that question about what it means</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.549" end="01:04:54.950" style="s2">to be to be human is that make it I</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.869" end="01:04:58.609" style="s2">don&#39;t know we should ask that question</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.950" end="01:05:00.920" style="s2">Oh Andrew I think the question we had</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.609" end="01:05:03.650" style="s2">before ism is is a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.920" end="01:05:05.180" style="s2">precise question which is what does it</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.650" end="01:05:07.099" style="s2">mean to be a person in a community of</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.180" end="01:05:08.420" style="s2">persons because I think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.099" end="01:05:10.999" style="s2">we&#39;re what we&#39;re pointing to with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.420" end="01:05:13.009" style="s2">word human the problem I have with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.999" end="01:05:14.539" style="s2">word human is its nebulous and it shows</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.009" end="01:05:16.640" style="s2">up in multiple domains you can get into</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.539" end="01:05:19.339" style="s2">all kinds of equivocations but when</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.640" end="01:05:25.130" style="s2">we&#39;re working right whereas I think this</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.339" end="01:05:27.589" style="s2">notion of person making and and and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.130" end="01:05:29.180" style="s2">I keep I keep hearing Tillich in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.589" end="01:05:30.650" style="s2">you never have a person without a</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.180" end="01:05:32.599" style="s2">community of persons around it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.650" end="01:05:34.309" style="s2">that&#39;s just a developmental truth right</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.599" end="01:05:36.309" style="s2">persons are not made in an</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.309" end="01:05:38.150" style="s2">individualistic fashion</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.309" end="01:05:41.989" style="s2">they&#39;re made of the communitarian</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.150" end="01:05:43.609" style="s2">fashion always okay I don&#39;t I hope you</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.989" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">don&#39;t feel any no no worry no no worries</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.609" end="01:05:48.589" style="s2">I just I&#39;m also maybe a human is</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:51.140" style="s2">something that&#39;s we&#39;re all human but a</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.589" end="01:05:52.400" style="s2">person is something that we become well</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.140" end="01:05:53.749" style="s2">that&#39;s but that&#39;s what I want that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.400" end="01:05:56.660" style="s2">what I want ever you want to say right</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.749" end="01:05:59.509" style="s2">yeah I want to emphasize your humanity</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.660" end="01:06:01.699" style="s2">is something you have but I want to talk</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.509" end="01:06:03.469" style="s2">about to go back to what we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.699" end="01:06:06.769" style="s2">about I want to talk about this you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.469" end="01:06:09.319" style="s2">that to which you aspire right right</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.769" end="01:06:11.779" style="s2">which is the being mode there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.319" end="01:06:14.299" style="s2">element of transcendence there yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.779" end="01:06:19.579" style="s2">exactly what we&#39;re saying and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.299" end="01:06:23.299" style="s2">it carries with it it carries with it it</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.579" end="01:06:25.429" style="s2">carries with it the the the deep</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.299" end="01:06:28.729" style="s2">connections to well as we said the deep</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.429" end="01:06:31.059" style="s2">connections to education and to a sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.729" end="01:06:36.049" style="s2">of reverence for something that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.059" end="01:06:39.319" style="s2">possesses sacredness for us don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.049" end="01:06:40.670" style="s2">actually like the reframing of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.319" end="01:06:42.410" style="s2">question from what is a human to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.670" end="01:06:43.459" style="s2">question of what is a person or what</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.410" end="01:06:45.019" style="s2">does it mean to be a person in a</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.459" end="01:06:46.429" style="s2">community of persons and the question</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.019" end="01:06:47.839" style="s2">what is a human is one that I ask a lot</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.429" end="01:06:52.640" style="s2">and I realize I&#39;m actually asking that</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.839" end="01:06:54.140" style="s2">question that the human is perhaps the</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.640" end="01:06:57.619" style="s2">only thing we know that can become a</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.140" end="01:06:58.880" style="s2">person right and different from being</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.619" end="01:07:01.910" style="s2">sentient different from being</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.880" end="01:07:05.479" style="s2">intelligent as being a person and this</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.910" end="01:07:08.890" style="s2">is part of the AI problem is the making</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.479" end="01:07:11.329" style="s2">of a person and the being of a person is</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.890" end="01:07:12.920" style="s2">it&#39;s actually interesting because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.329" end="01:07:15.259" style="s2">part again that talked about the best of</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.920" end="01:07:17.049" style="s2">religious discourse right very very</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.259" end="01:07:20.900" style="s2">interesting stuff about the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.049" end="01:07:23.569" style="s2">person in the theistic traditions like</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.900" end="01:07:25.279" style="s2">it was to get Corbin&#39;s work on the Borg</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.569" end="01:07:27.469" style="s2">angelology and the notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.279" end="01:07:30.140" style="s2">imaginal and that it&#39;s populated with</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.469" end="01:07:32.059" style="s2">the person&#39;s then you get all of these</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.140" end="01:07:34.429" style="s2">possible transcendental operators that</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.059" end="01:07:38.029" style="s2">can we do through the imagine but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.429" end="01:07:41.989" style="s2">mystic wants the person not human which</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.029" end="01:07:43.789" style="s2">is very interesting so thank you is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.989" end="01:07:46.759" style="s2">human also something to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.789" end="01:07:48.049" style="s2">transcend it in a way or am I going too</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.759" end="01:07:50.050" style="s2">far here that&#39;s the thing like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.049" end="01:07:53.350" style="s2">from zero like if there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.050" end="01:07:55.210" style="s2">human nature you know like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.350" end="01:07:56.950" style="s2">question of limitation all right but the</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.210" end="01:07:59.950" style="s2">person is kind of playing an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.950" end="01:08:02.950" style="s2">game if I can say that like that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.950" end="01:08:05.680" style="s2">hand because you&#39;re lifted up into this</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.950" end="01:08:08.950" style="s2">realm of person making which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.680" end="01:08:10.540" style="s2">something like this communicative realm</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.950" end="01:08:14.620" style="s2">it&#39;s linguistically mediated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.540" end="01:08:16.270" style="s2">imaginal and and so again now we&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.620" end="01:08:18.190" style="s2">to the Hebrew tradition but that notion</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.270" end="01:08:21.190" style="s2">that we&#39;ve each got a letter in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.190" end="01:08:24.609" style="s2">Torah right that sense that the person</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.190" end="01:08:29.380" style="s2">lifts the human into something deeper</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.609" end="01:08:34.870" style="s2">than just material reality and yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.380" end="01:08:36.880" style="s2">the new etic and the imaginal basically</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.870" end="01:08:39.250" style="s2">are the qualities of the person you</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.880" end="01:08:42.100" style="s2">don&#39;t find in material or that animal</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.250" end="01:08:44.830" style="s2">arguably now animals have personality</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.100" end="01:08:49.720" style="s2">personality is different from personhood</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.830" end="01:08:53.770" style="s2">begins right we sort of misuse ended up</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.720" end="01:08:55.180" style="s2">misusing that term and in psychology and</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.770" end="01:08:57.549" style="s2">when we talk about personality theory</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.180" end="01:08:59.350" style="s2">now because that&#39;s fine we we need to</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.549" end="01:09:01.900" style="s2">talk about sort of dispositional traits</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.350" end="01:09:03.790" style="s2">I get that but we when when we when we</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.900" end="01:09:04.930" style="s2">started using the word personality for</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.790" end="01:09:07.150" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t replace it with</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.930" end="01:09:10.150" style="s2">personhood as another phenomenon that</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.150" end="01:09:12.160" style="s2">needed to be talked about and so we got</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.150" end="01:09:14.770" style="s2">a neglect because of an impoverishment</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.160" end="01:09:18.330" style="s2">of our conceptual repertoire that I</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.770" end="01:09:23.080" style="s2">think has been sort of disastrous for us</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.330" end="01:09:25.450" style="s2">so this did I mean I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.080" end="01:09:28.030" style="s2">guys know but I got to talk directly to</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.450" end="01:09:29.890" style="s2">Tom at Thomas Cheetham about Korbin and</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.030" end="01:09:35.620" style="s2">all the work he&#39;s done on it we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.890" end="01:09:40.510" style="s2">talk again about it and about Korbin so</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.620" end="01:09:44.859" style="s2">this this brings me again to something</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.510" end="01:09:46.810" style="s2">about maybe I want to move question</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.859" end="01:09:51.160" style="s2">about a reformulation of the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.810" end="01:09:54.400" style="s2">person in some way I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.160" end="01:09:56.440" style="s2">think it&#39;s a degradation of concept so</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.400" end="01:09:59.110" style="s2">Zach you talked about you know Corbin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.440" end="01:10:01.170" style="s2">you know in geology and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.110" end="01:10:03.460" style="s2">talked about the sacred second self</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.170" end="01:10:04.030" style="s2">staying talks about the divine double</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.460" end="01:10:06.730" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.030" end="01:10:09.369" style="s2">talks about us not being individuals but</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.730" end="01:10:12.070" style="s2">being individuals that we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.369" end="01:10:14.110" style="s2">there&#39;s all it&#39;s like Apple Annie&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.070" end="01:10:16.449" style="s2">that attention is always a from - it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.110" end="01:10:20.679" style="s2">not just a single thing we are always</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.449" end="01:10:23.920" style="s2">from - were from this self right to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.679" end="01:10:26.170" style="s2">sacred second self right and so and we</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.920" end="01:10:27.699" style="s2">and and Angliss Keller talks about that</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.170" end="01:10:29.770" style="s2">and about how you have that weird</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.699" end="01:10:31.300" style="s2">structure and aspiration that I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.770" end="01:10:34.510" style="s2">cause of the future self but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.300" end="01:10:37.000" style="s2">actually the normative authority over me</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.510" end="01:10:43.750" style="s2">and if we&#39;re gonna really wrestle with</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.000" end="01:10:46.409" style="s2">that we can we this is a difficult</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.750" end="01:10:50.260" style="s2">question and because we have a long</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.409" end="01:10:52.599" style="s2">heritage of the self being just the</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.260" end="01:10:54.369" style="s2">secular version of the soul and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.599" end="01:10:56.139" style="s2">again you guys both know I&#39;m deeply</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.369" end="01:10:57.639" style="s2">respectful to the mystic religion so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.139" end="01:10:59.230" style="s2">not I&#39;m not trying to be insulting here</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.639" end="01:11:01.960" style="s2">but there was the idea of something</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.230" end="01:11:04.090" style="s2">encased or at least it&#39;s come to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.960" end="01:11:05.770" style="s2">understood that popular cultural I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.090" end="01:11:07.780" style="s2">that&#39;s fair for me to say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.770" end="01:11:10.989" style="s2">something that&#39;s you know encased inside</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.780" end="01:11:13.360" style="s2">of me in my head right and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.989" end="01:11:15.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what my self is and then I</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.360" end="01:11:19.000" style="s2">understand personhood in a completely</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.280" end="01:11:23.079" style="s2">interior way and it completely almost</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.000" end="01:11:24.969" style="s2">like you know brain centric way such you</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.079" end="01:11:27.099" style="s2">know well you could like the matrix you</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.969" end="01:11:31.059" style="s2">could so much just download me somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.099" end="01:11:33.039" style="s2">else right and you know you know the</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.059" end="01:11:34.780" style="s2">cosmic the kind of cognitive science I</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.039" end="01:11:36.489" style="s2">practice sort of calls all of those</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.780" end="01:11:39.940" style="s2">assumptions deeply into question and</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.489" end="01:11:42.340" style="s2">says no no you are you you know your</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.940" end="01:11:44.800" style="s2">body isn&#39;t clay your your cognition is</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.340" end="01:11:47.139" style="s2">constituted by you being embodied you</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.800" end="01:11:49.960" style="s2">being embedded you being like I say</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.139" end="01:11:53.079" style="s2">enacted and now you know I even want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.960" end="01:11:55.300" style="s2">add this extra component that your your</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.079" end="01:11:57.789" style="s2">personhood is constituted aspirationally</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.300" end="01:12:00.969" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s right and so you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.789" end="01:12:03.699" style="s2">you&#39;re much more you&#39;re much more</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.969" end="01:12:05.800" style="s2">distributed than you are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.699" end="01:12:08.500" style="s2">isolated and compressed and locked in</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.800" end="01:12:10.869" style="s2">sort of a brain centric notion of what a</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.500" end="01:12:12.070" style="s2">person is did that make any sense it was</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.869" end="01:12:14.740" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.070" end="01:12:18.220" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s beautiful I mean I have I</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.740" end="01:12:19.570" style="s2">completely agree and there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.220" end="01:12:21.220" style="s2">things the same in that notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.570" end="01:12:23.710" style="s2">divine double is just beautiful yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.220" end="01:12:26.560" style="s2">just love this notion and there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.710" end="01:12:27.850" style="s2">many ways to I think work with it in one</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.560" end="01:12:29.500" style="s2">of the ways I think about sometimes is</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.850" end="01:12:31.840" style="s2">with regard to like someone like Hillman</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.500" end="01:12:33.730" style="s2">it&#39;s all there&#39;s actually probably many</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.840" end="01:12:36.010" style="s2">right that you&#39;re you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.730" end="01:12:37.780" style="s2">monotheistic about your divine yep</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.010" end="01:12:41.320" style="s2">double but actually they&#39;re probably on</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.780" end="01:12:43.600" style="s2">the set of trajectories that your divine</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.320" end="01:12:45.850" style="s2">double as a museum as a musician like</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.600" end="01:12:47.740" style="s2">the pan architectonic it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.850" end="01:12:52.570" style="s2">different from my divine double as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.740" end="01:12:55.990" style="s2">scholar or something I mean they&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="01:14:39.159" end="01:14:43.030" style="s2">that there&#39;s actually but there&#39;s any</p>

<p begin="01:14:43.030" end="01:14:47.770" style="s2">practice of any kind there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.460" end="01:14:50.140" style="s2">you create an imaginal shell around the</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.770" end="01:14:52.030" style="s2">body and actually move into the frankly</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.140" end="01:14:53.650" style="s2">what psyche of the imagination yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.030" end="01:14:57.010" style="s2">that&#39;s very it&#39;s very much like he works</p>

<p begin="01:14:57.010" end="01:15:00.100" style="s2">there&#39;s that notion that yeah actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.270" end="01:15:02.260" style="s2">when you&#39;re holding the divine double</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.100" end="01:15:04.840" style="s2">correctly you&#39;re holding the full image</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.260" end="01:15:06.010" style="s2">of the body and in a sense the way of</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.840" end="01:15:11.469" style="s2">thinking about the resurrection of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.010" end="01:15:13.360" style="s2">whole body your refine the actual matter</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.469" end="01:15:14.800" style="s2">of your body through exercise of</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.360" end="01:15:17.679" style="s2">imagination it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.800" end="01:15:20.020" style="s2">material it just means that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.679" end="01:15:27.520" style="s2">this imaginal worship of death instead</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.020" end="01:15:29.320" style="s2">of being in some bag of skin it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.520" end="01:15:31.420" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.320" end="01:15:36.520" style="s2">how&#39;s it good I&#39;m glad we got up and</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.420" end="01:15:39.159" style="s2">into that the logos project that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.520" end="01:15:41.770" style="s2">engaging in right now right because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.159" end="01:15:45.130" style="s2">trying to get what&#39;s going on in deal</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.770" end="01:15:46.719" style="s2">logos and dialectic as you know an</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.130" end="01:15:48.699" style="s2">ecology of practices for trying to</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.719" end="01:15:52.270" style="s2">afford the logos and how it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.699" end="01:15:54.750" style="s2">much more beyond dialogue as we where we</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.270" end="01:15:58.630" style="s2">use that as a synonym now for discourse</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.750" end="01:16:00.520" style="s2">and you know so this kind of stuff we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.630" end="01:16:01.989" style="s2">talking about here&#39;s exactly you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.520" end="01:16:05.140" style="s2">and you see aspects of this in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.989" end="01:16:07.540" style="s2">Neoplatonic tradition around dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.140" end="01:16:08.920" style="s2">I&#39;m so I&#39;m just I&#39;m just saying I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.540" end="01:16:10.210" style="s2">think I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t want to waste</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.920" end="01:16:12.310" style="s2">everybody&#39;s time I&#39;m just explaining why</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.210" end="01:16:13.840" style="s2">I find it very helpful and then and it</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.310" end="01:16:16.300" style="s2">is I mean I found it I found reading</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.840" end="01:16:19.420" style="s2">Hillman and then Corbin and looking into</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.300" end="01:16:21.760" style="s2">these ways of thinking about the</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.420" end="01:16:23.260" style="s2">imaginal realm within basically has</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.760" end="01:16:24.820" style="s2">extremely therapeutically helpful</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.260" end="01:16:27.250" style="s2">because once you understand the divine</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.820" end="01:16:28.570" style="s2">Devils not one then you get that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.250" end="01:16:31.420" style="s2">going to be internal tension between</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.570" end="01:16:32.800" style="s2">your divine elements basically that even</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.420" end="01:16:33.489" style="s2">the best parts of you could be in</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.800" end="01:16:35.170" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.489" end="01:16:37.630" style="s2">for time and attention let&#39;s say in your</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.170" end="01:16:39.880" style="s2">life and that&#39;s going to cause emotional</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.630" end="01:16:41.380" style="s2">tension and so then you can actually set</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.880" end="01:16:43.179" style="s2">up internally and sometimes you can put</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.380" end="01:16:46.630" style="s2">it out in front of your constellations</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.179" end="01:16:48.340" style="s2">which I&#39;ve seen done we create you</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.630" end="01:16:50.230" style="s2">actually create a dialogue in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.340" end="01:16:54.489" style="s2">constructive imagination between your</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.230" end="01:16:57.099" style="s2">two divine but that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.489" end="01:16:59.019" style="s2">addition to this dialogue Louis idea too</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.099" end="01:17:00.639" style="s2">isn&#39;t it that you&#39;re not just dialoguing</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.019" end="01:17:01.659" style="s2">with another person you&#39;re dialoguing</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.639" end="01:17:04.110" style="s2">with all your different sub</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.659" end="01:17:07.119" style="s2">personalities and that was always here</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.110" end="01:17:08.860" style="s2">that was always there yeah I just am</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.119" end="01:17:10.510" style="s2">hearing it for the first time popular</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.860" end="01:17:14.289" style="s2">Republic right it has it all through the</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.510" end="01:17:16.900" style="s2">Republic and young young also has it to</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.289" end="01:17:19.989" style="s2">some degree too but what I what what</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.900" end="01:17:24.639" style="s2">came out for that for me was what the</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.989" end="01:17:27.420" style="s2">this move of of taking that sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.639" end="01:17:31.269" style="s2">sort of the intrapsychic</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.420" end="01:17:33.010" style="s2">you know you know dialogue and also</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.269" end="01:17:35.469" style="s2">putting it out into the aspirational</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.010" end="01:17:36.940" style="s2">dialogue and then so there there&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.469" end="01:17:38.499" style="s2">of this dialogue and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.940" end="01:17:40.900" style="s2">dialogue out and then there&#39;s a dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.499" end="01:17:42.219" style="s2">between all of the angels right if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.900" end="01:17:43.809" style="s2">get a lamp with that symbol</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.219" end="01:17:45.940" style="s2">so there&#39;s actually sort of three</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.809" end="01:17:47.889" style="s2">dialogues that need to be brought into</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.940" end="01:17:49.659" style="s2">consonant together that&#39;s what sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.889" end="01:17:53.110" style="s2">lighting up in my mind right now Andrew</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.659" end="01:17:54.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m sort of like aha yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.110" end="01:17:55.800" style="s2">and I&#39;ve never seen all three of those</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.340" end="01:17:57.849" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen a couple of them in isolation</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.800" end="01:17:59.860" style="s2">tonight when I think of the divine</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.849" end="01:18:02.829" style="s2">double I think of this one thing I that</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.860" end="01:18:06.010" style="s2">so I&#39;m very not what&#39;s lighting up in me</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.829" end="01:18:08.199" style="s2">is is is is it just makes total sense</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.010" end="01:18:13.449" style="s2">then it&#39;s the pagan Gloria it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.199" end="01:18:15.699" style="s2">pagan glory of polytheism right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.449" end="01:18:19.090" style="s2">also the HOS the Elohim a right right</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.699" end="01:18:22.329" style="s2">right yeah beautiful it is the Elohim</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.090" end="01:18:24.039" style="s2">you know and yeah and that yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.329" end="01:18:25.809" style="s2">there&#39;s that there&#39;s the refinement of</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.039" end="01:18:29.110" style="s2">that conversation within which helps to</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.809" end="01:18:30.730" style="s2">get the actions basically correct and</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.110" end="01:18:32.769" style="s2">Hannah dog it becomes this much more</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.730" end="01:18:34.869" style="s2">multi-dimensional process that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.769" end="01:18:35.860" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking which isn&#39;t really really</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.869" end="01:18:39.269" style="s2">interesting to me</p>
