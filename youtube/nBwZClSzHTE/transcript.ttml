<p begin="00:03:43.140" end="00:03:48.100" style="s2">because it&#39;s worth it deciding spoons on</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.180" end="00:03:49.600" style="s2">and I&#39;m just sitting here anyway</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.100" end="00:03:52.450" style="s2">and it&#39;s the automatic it&#39;s the flow</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.600" end="00:03:54.340" style="s2">it&#39;s not forcing it in any way which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.450" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">stressful in its own way and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.340" end="00:03:59.049" style="s2">stress I think people do and should</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:00.850" style="s2">allow but I can&#39;t I can&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.049" end="00:04:02.380" style="s2">stress of like no you need to sit in you</p>

<p begin="00:04:13.630" end="00:04:20.260" style="s2">it&#39;s neurologically hurt like it makes</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.650" end="00:04:25.810" style="s2">sense to me but sharing that peace that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.260" end="00:04:26.830" style="s2">it does sometimes I&#39;m clearly not</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.810" end="00:04:28.810" style="s2">in tears</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.830" end="00:04:31.330" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t over there and something told</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.810" end="00:04:35.560" style="s2">me to come on here and that has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.330" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">because the surrender to the not having</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.560" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">stress in my life and having to reassess</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:45.099" style="s2">what everything he basically means to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:49.590" style="s2">has been the greatest gift that I want</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.099" end="00:04:54.490" style="s2">to be able to help other people tap into</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.590" end="00:04:56.919" style="s2">and just like the project where I fall</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.490" end="00:05:00.580" style="s2">short is in the communication of it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.919" end="00:05:02.469" style="s2">being able to express it but even if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.580" end="00:05:05.289" style="s2">not perfect to that I do so much better</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.469" end="00:05:07.990" style="s2">when I just go with the flow and allow</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.289" end="00:05:09.849" style="s2">it which is what I do do when I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.990" end="00:05:12.909" style="s2">this by myself you know he no one&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.849" end="00:05:14.349" style="s2">gonna see it versus being on here if I</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.909" end="00:05:17.289" style="s2">knew the difference if I could just be</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.349" end="00:05:19.090" style="s2">the other thing I would but I it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:05:28.539" end="00:05:31.360" style="s2">little better</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.050" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">because I do feel like I&#39;m exactly where</p>
