<p begin="00:01:04.159" end="00:01:08.000" style="s2">and a lot of times it&#39;s how our</p>

<p begin="00:01:18.400" end="00:01:23.200" style="s2">and with my tbi having memory issues and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">just not being able to remember people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.200" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">names not people remember</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">pronunciation um and then feeling</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:29.119" style="s2">awkward and not always wanting to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:31.360" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.119" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">so sometimes i do find workarounds to</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.360" end="00:01:34.000" style="s2">remember people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">names to try like i have workarounds to</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.000" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">try to remember them but i also have um</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">workarounds to to not say them to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">like okay i know i&#39;m not going to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">this right how can we talk to this</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">person without using their name</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:50.079" style="s2">or talk around this person right because</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to tell a story</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.079" end="00:01:52.880" style="s2">about them or trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">and can&#39;t remember their name or can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.880" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">pronounce it right what you end up doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:01:58.719" style="s2">if we&#39;re not dealing with humans as</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">humans it is natural that humans can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.719" end="00:02:02.079" style="s2">pronounce words they didn&#39;t grow up with</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">and it is natural that we feel awkward</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.079" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">when we cannot if we make them wrong for</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:06.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.720" style="s2">we are hurting the people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:10.479" style="s2">help people who don&#39;t care that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.720" end="00:02:11.920" style="s2">being racist are just going to call you</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.479" end="00:02:12.640" style="s2">whatever horrible thing comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.920" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">their mouth</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.640" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">people who want to get to know you and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">want to but then every</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:18.239" style="s2">if they mispronounce your name you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">going to think it&#39;s a slight if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.239" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">just going to think it&#39;s a slight</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">it separates us instead of bringing us</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:25.760" style="s2">together and so i just want to share</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">uh what the post itself said i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.760" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">going to put it up on the screen because</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">otherwise it&#39;s going to show</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">my friend&#39;s name everyone else and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do that so it&#39;s just um</p>

<p begin="00:02:35.120" end="00:02:40.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s things you never say i&#39;m never</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">going to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.480" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">do you have something shorter for that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">and can i just call you blank</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:48.560" style="s2">instead and they have little things</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">underneath like i&#39;m never going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.560" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">remember that so sometimes the name can</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">be hard to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">but you are being dismissive and showing</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:56.319" style="s2">that you don&#39;t value the person</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">when that you say i&#39;m never going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.319" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">remember that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:02.080" style="s2">is the problem that we think that if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:03.680" style="s2">say i&#39;m never going to remember that</p>

<p begin="00:03:51.680" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">other people are fine with it i like</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">being tapped on the shoulder because i</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:56.879" style="s2">can&#39;t hear and i can&#39;t tell direction of</p>

<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">um so if you need to get my attention it</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">can be really hard for me to hear and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">so being tapped on the shoulder but i</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:04.879" style="s2">don&#39;t mind a tap on the shoulder it</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.879" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t trigger me in any way whereas</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:08.879" style="s2">for other people it might and this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.159" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">where like</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.879" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">having blanket rules for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:14.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work because it&#39;s not dealing</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">with people as the individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.159" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">pointing to them in a meeting instead of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">saying their name</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">replacing their name with him her or</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:25.199" style="s2">them and hoping you&#39;ll get away with it</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">how to help one repeat their name after</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:28.240" style="s2">they introduce themselves i do this</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">every time and then i&#39;ll repeat it about</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.240" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">20 times in my head which is hard</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">because then you can&#39;t hear the next</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">thing they say</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">when you don&#39;t repeat their name it can</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">be quite frustrating because we</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.160" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">to assume have</p>

<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:53.199" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry until my little brain gets it</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:55.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.199" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">my amazing brain is deficient in some</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.440" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">and you know i have i have facial</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">blindness i facial blindness with</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">everyone it&#39;s really hard to watch a</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:04.560" style="s2">show</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">where where there&#39;s a bunch of um a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.560" end="00:08:08.400" style="s2">bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">one type of person in it uh my brain</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:12.879" style="s2">because it grew up with</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">in with white media with caucasian media</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">and um in 80s where there wasn&#39;t as much</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:18.960" style="s2">diversity</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">um and when there was it was token</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.960" end="00:08:22.000" style="s2">diversity it&#39;s like one black person one</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">asian person</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.000" end="00:08:27.039" style="s2">so like white people i have</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">different colored hair so it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.039" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">the blonde person the red hair person</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">but if there&#39;s two blonde people with</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.680" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">short hair i</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">can&#39;t tell them apart it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">still not happening but</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.680" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">but my facial blindness is even more</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.760" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">with somebody of a different race</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">and so if i&#39;m watching an entire cast of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">black people</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to know what&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">difference between them it&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.880" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">i think they&#39;re all the same it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">because my brain thinks</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">like you just can&#39;t distinguish between</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">them and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">i can&#39;t work on that it doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">better it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">if i&#39;d seen them when i was a child i</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">might have the same for other races as i</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">do for</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">for caucasians but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">changing like it&#39;s like a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:07.760" style="s2">when i&#39;m in a new group of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:09.760" style="s2">my brain will put people into categories</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.760" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">and be like oh yes the old white guy</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.760" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">and if there&#39;s more than one old white</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">guy it&#39;s like you&#39;re either this name or</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">this name</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">um and i&#39;ll get you confused all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:20.800" style="s2">time and it will just always happen</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">and then i i mean forget if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:01.040" style="s2">is part of what we&#39;re saving the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">with and it&#39;s been very much because</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">autistic people know how different we</p>

<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">so even if we made a world that only</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.920" end="00:10:17.519" style="s2">worked for autistic people</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">we would it would have to be so much</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:22.320" style="s2">because there are people who are sensory</p>

<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">and because of people who um can</p>

<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">because of that if we make a world that</p>

<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">silence and other people need to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">loud noise so they&#39;re not hearing all</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">the other noises</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">and to be able to work with the</p>

<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">that if you&#39;ve met me in person you</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">probably know i&#39;m deaf within 30 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">because i&#39;m going to tell you because i</p>

<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">extreme</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">to have to where i did give myself</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">permission to let go of</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:34.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t need to think about every action</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">every word is going to affect somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.560" end="00:11:38.240" style="s2">before i say it</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:39.279" style="s2">and the repercussions down the line i am</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.240" end="00:11:42.399" style="s2">going to speak</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.279" end="00:11:45.440" style="s2">my heart and when i when i mess up</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:47.440" style="s2">when i hurt somebody tell me but</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">but there&#39;s a big difference between</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.440" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">wokeness which is like you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">and i do this you broke the rule my</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">brain you broke the rule you need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:54.639" style="s2">know the rule</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:57.440" style="s2">right like you you can&#39;t ask someone to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.639" end="00:12:00.240" style="s2">repronounce their name that&#39;s racist</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.440" end="00:12:00.240" style="s2">keep up my brain</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">or like don&#39;t say it quite that way or</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.279" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">approaching people as individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.959" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">find out what we need right if we had</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:23.440" style="s2">where if i was able to give you mine you</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:25.120" style="s2">would know that i&#39;m deaf</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.440" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">in one ear and not to talk to me my</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.120" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">right side you would know that i forget</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">things in your name and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">personal you&#39;d be able to put in your</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">name with the pronunciation so i could</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:38.639" style="s2">on my own if you want me to get it right</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">like there are two ways that we can get</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.639" end="00:12:42.000" style="s2">everyone&#39;s needs met</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">but it&#39;s not what these blanket rules</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.000" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s not with</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:46.560" style="s2">racism trumps everything your ableism</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">trumps everything</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.560" end="00:12:51.279" style="s2">we have to deal with each other on an</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">individual level and um</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.279" end="00:12:57.519" style="s2">it takes more work it does but it also</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">works out better because then we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.519" end="00:13:00.480" style="s2">help each other we can&#39;t help those</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:01.360" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s going to bother me that i</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">didn&#39;t finish what i was going to say</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.360" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">about cultural appropriation</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:07.040" style="s2">um that the people who it&#39;s meant to</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.040" end="00:13:12.959" style="s2">right artists and people of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">it hurts because i&#39;m not gonna buy</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.959" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">moccasins</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">from you know a uh one of the nation&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">artists because i don&#39;t want to have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:23.200" style="s2">explain that every time right oh no i</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:24.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t get it at urban urban outfitters</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.200" end="00:13:27.360" style="s2">i got it from them</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.480" end="00:13:29.120" style="s2">and and the very people who care carry</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.360" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">like it&#39;s like blanket nobody can wear</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:34.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s like right but and so because</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:35.120" style="s2">it opens up the awkward conversation i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.079" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">just not buying it we&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.120" end="00:13:37.600" style="s2">wearing it</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">and so we&#39;re not supporting who we</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.600" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">should be supporting because of the very</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:42.560" style="s2">rule that&#39;s supposed to be there to help</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">them and hurts them instead</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:45.920" style="s2">and i think most of our racism most of</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">our ableism is that because</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.920" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">it pits us against each other and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:50.800" style="s2">like oh you broke the rule and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:53.120" style="s2">gotta call you out</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.800" end="00:13:54.880" style="s2">as opposed to hey did you know that this</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.120" end="00:13:57.839" style="s2">rule like if somebody was like you&#39;re</p>
