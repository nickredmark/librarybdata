<p begin="00:00:00.079" end="00:00:06.359" style="s2">all right hello YouTube welcome to our</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.540" end="00:00:09.630" style="s2">idea cafe today we are discussing what</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.359" end="00:00:13.969" style="s2">have you learned from failing who would</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.630" end="00:00:16.440" style="s2">like to go first or I can&#39;t go first</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.969" end="00:00:19.109" style="s2">well you go first you haven&#39;t gone first</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.440" end="00:00:22.859" style="s2">and I just want to go first all right a</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.109" end="00:00:24.710" style="s2">fail at failing did not make any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.859" end="00:00:27.689" style="s2">notes before it&#39;s funny this topic I</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.710" end="00:00:31.080" style="s2">could not recall failing I like could</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.689" end="00:00:33.000" style="s2">not not that I&#39;ve never failed just in</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.080" end="00:00:35.820" style="s2">that instance like that wasn&#39;t that was</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.000" end="00:00:38.190" style="s2">big a not just a little um momentary</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.820" end="00:00:40.829" style="s2">failure and then I remembered that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.190" end="00:00:42.420" style="s2">tried to start countless businesses and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.829" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">have never made a dollar at any of them</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.420" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">I was like oh right that failure but it</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">was mainly a failure of not knowing what</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:56.340" style="s2">my values are not like realizing I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:00:59.690" style="s2">never gonna feel okay making money in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.340" end="00:01:01.859" style="s2">game a system and so that failure</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.690" end="00:01:03.329" style="s2">repeatedly it needed to repeat because</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.859" end="00:01:05.790" style="s2">family not at once wouldn&#39;t have been a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.329" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">repeat enough for me to start realizing</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.790" end="00:01:13.500" style="s2">that for me I need to make sure anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:15.890" style="s2">I create to make money myself has to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.500" end="00:01:17.960" style="s2">Omni when and working for other people</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.890" end="00:01:20.340" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to have that same problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.960" end="00:01:22.350" style="s2">but it does have the problem of other</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.340" end="00:01:23.640" style="s2">people being in hierarchy over me which</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.350" end="00:01:30.960" style="s2">is not really a failure things let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.640" end="00:01:33.420" style="s2">stay on topic um finding now this far</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.960" end="00:01:37.619" style="s2">into my journey I can see well I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.420" end="00:01:41.130" style="s2">through failure that there is beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.619" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">learning in it and so it was the shame</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.130" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">of failing the shame that happened with</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:49.710" style="s2">failure that held me back way more than</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:51.750" style="s2">the failure itself and now knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.710" end="00:01:54.930" style="s2">knowing it&#39;s just a lesson from life I</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.750" end="00:01:58.799" style="s2">don&#39;t have shame with failure I still</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.930" end="00:02:00.780" style="s2">might have shame from the repercussions</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.799" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">for my actions the actual effect it has</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.780" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">on other people but not trying and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:09.209" style="s2">failing so I don&#39;t have that what if it</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">fails and I&#39;m living more and more into</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.209" end="00:02:14.270" style="s2">that as as life goes on where I&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:17.010" style="s2">I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.270" end="00:02:20.670" style="s2">putting out I don&#39;t know where it is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.010" end="00:02:22.770" style="s2">image of the failures okay it&#39;s okay to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.670" end="00:02:25.290" style="s2">show up and be imperfect it&#39;s okay and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.770" end="00:02:27.720" style="s2">the more the more of us are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.290" end="00:02:30.510" style="s2">do that the easier it is to create game</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.720" end="00:02:32.310" style="s2">B game B is gonna happen along not like</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.510" end="00:02:34.950" style="s2">we released something that&#39;s all perfect</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.310" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">and then it works it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.950" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">something that&#39;s good enough and then we</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:40.200" style="s2">have to keep perfecting it which means</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:42.600" style="s2">learning from our individual and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.200" end="00:02:50.910" style="s2">collective failures and I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.600" end="00:02:53.400" style="s2">all I&#39;m gonna share today finally so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.910" end="00:02:54.810" style="s2">couldn&#39;t think of a time you&#39;d failed</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.400" end="00:02:56.820" style="s2">when he first started thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.810" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">cuz I went through a somewhat similar</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.820" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">process myself and I actually started</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">thinking about the work about the notion</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:08.550" style="s2">of failure itself and what does it</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:09.690" style="s2">actually mean to fail the comment where</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.550" end="00:03:11.519" style="s2">I heard it might have been some</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.690" end="00:03:13.080" style="s2">throwaway line even if some shitty film</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.519" end="00:03:15.180" style="s2">but it stuck with me that you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.080" end="00:03:17.730" style="s2">failed until you give up right if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:19.260" style="s2">still on the path of trying then you may</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.730" end="00:03:21.480" style="s2">not have succeeded yet but you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.260" end="00:03:26.130" style="s2">failed until you stopped trying right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.480" end="00:03:28.200" style="s2">yeah I think that yes being wrong is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.130" end="00:03:29.790" style="s2">source of failure right but being wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.200" end="00:03:31.290" style="s2">should be you know you should actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.790" end="00:03:32.430" style="s2">celebrate it when you realize you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.290" end="00:03:34.470" style="s2">wrong about something because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.430" end="00:03:36.060" style="s2">elevated your understanding to a higher</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.470" end="00:03:37.739" style="s2">level in order to realize you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.060" end="00:03:39.450" style="s2">you must have understood something you</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.739" end="00:03:44.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand before right and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.450" end="00:03:46.109" style="s2">you know this kind of face so yeah I for</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.040" end="00:03:48.150" style="s2">me what I ended up coming back to is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.109" end="00:03:50.670" style="s2">so much a personal what have I learned</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.150" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">from failure but what I have learned</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.670" end="00:03:57.510" style="s2">about the notion of failure as I got</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:04:01.109" style="s2">older and evolved that the whole what</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.510" end="00:04:03.690" style="s2">failure is is is is is how you view it</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.109" end="00:04:06.090" style="s2">right if it knocks the stuffing out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.690" end="00:04:07.980" style="s2">you and this way leads you from having</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.090" end="00:04:11.310" style="s2">another go then yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.980" end="00:04:13.019" style="s2">failure but I mean even that it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:14.609" style="s2">complete failure until you&#39;re dead right</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.019" end="00:04:16.979" style="s2">because you might at some point come</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.609" end="00:04:20.760" style="s2">back to it and have another go so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.979" end="00:04:22.860" style="s2">it&#39;s so yeah that&#39;s kind of where I am I</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.760" end="00:04:24.930" style="s2">mean I that&#39;s how I would actually hope</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:26.910" style="s2">we could maybe explore the I what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.930" end="00:04:29.580" style="s2">what the notion of failure actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.910" end="00:04:31.170" style="s2">is and how it evolves as a concept in</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.580" end="00:04:32.820" style="s2">one&#39;s life as you get older and gaining</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.170" end="00:04:41.460" style="s2">perspective but that&#39;s that I&#39;ll stop</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.820" end="00:04:44.250" style="s2">there for now I think that you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.460" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">failure is the norm that that won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.250" end="00:04:48.480" style="s2">surprise anybody like if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:49.860" style="s2">think of it statistically like pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.480" end="00:04:52.950" style="s2">a business you have like a one in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.860" end="00:04:54.330" style="s2">thousand chance right right that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.950" end="00:04:58.380" style="s2">competing with all these other people</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.330" end="00:04:59.760" style="s2">right so you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re prone to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.380" end="00:05:04.020" style="s2">fail mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.760" end="00:05:05.790" style="s2">but like there&#39;s so many ways things can</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.020" end="00:05:08.760" style="s2">fail it&#39;s not always our fault and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.790" end="00:05:12.600" style="s2">not always clear what the lesson is um I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.760" end="00:05:16.830" style="s2">mean I think I think we all easily agree</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.600" end="00:05:18.150" style="s2">that failure is a great teacher and mmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.830" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">you know we we learn from our past</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.150" end="00:05:29.370" style="s2">mistakes but sometimes that&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:32.910" style="s2">so I mean the takeaway is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.370" end="00:05:36.300" style="s2">mm-hmm you know don&#39;t give up like Eric</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.910" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">saying like if you if you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.300" end="00:05:39.870" style="s2">depending on what you&#39;re trying if</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:42.930" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to you know achieve</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.870" end="00:05:44.730" style="s2">something that&#39;s right or a positive</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.930" end="00:05:47.760" style="s2">systems change or whatever you like we</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.730" end="00:05:50.340" style="s2">it&#39;s not a question of giving up or</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.760" end="00:05:59.210" style="s2">being defeated like it&#39;s just a question</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.340" end="00:06:02.130" style="s2">of when right when when we succeed so</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.210" end="00:06:05.490" style="s2">yeah I think we&#39;re all we&#39;re all humbled</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.130" end="00:06:07.530" style="s2">by that we&#39;re all failures and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.490" end="00:06:09.810" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.530" end="00:06:12.360" style="s2">what like one thing I thought about when</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.810" end="00:06:14.580" style="s2">I saw this question today because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.360" end="00:06:17.760" style="s2">prompt is what have you learnt from</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.580" end="00:06:20.100" style="s2">failure and you know we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.760" end="00:06:24.570" style="s2">that all day I can go on about how much</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.100" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve failed um but it but it you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.570" end="00:06:28.830" style="s2">because Hillary Clinton&#39;s in the news it</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:32.520" style="s2">makes me think of her like what what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.830" end="00:06:35.570" style="s2">she learnt from failure and and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.520" end="00:06:35.570" style="s2">that the answer is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.330" end="00:06:42.780" style="s2">absolutely nothing you know just from</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.349" end="00:06:46.919" style="s2">what I&#39;ve seen today it&#39;s a lot of just</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.780" end="00:06:48.389" style="s2">you know already you know you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.919" end="00:06:50.189" style="s2">about what happens okay well there is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.389" end="00:06:52.590" style="s2">documentary there&#39;s a documentary</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.189" end="00:06:54.449" style="s2">released with Hillary Clinton or about</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.590" end="00:06:56.099" style="s2">Hillary Clinton I haven&#39;t watched it yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.449" end="00:06:58.919" style="s2">but I reckon it&#39;s probably like an hour</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.099" end="00:07:01.710" style="s2">or so and it&#39;s you know about you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.919" end="00:07:03.629" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a you know interview and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.710" end="00:07:05.219" style="s2">stuff like that and documentary so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.629" end="00:07:07.770" style="s2">imagine there&#39;s a lot of content but</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.219" end="00:07:11.219" style="s2">what people are highlighting and what</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.770" end="00:07:13.500" style="s2">the news is is running with mmm is how</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.219" end="00:07:17.340" style="s2">she attacked Bernie in it basically she</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.500" end="00:07:19.800" style="s2">says um like Bob the the quote the quote</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.340" end="00:07:22.560" style="s2">that&#39;s making the rounds is nobody likes</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.800" end="00:07:25.740" style="s2">Bernie mm-hmm right so Hillary Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.560" end="00:07:28.860" style="s2">is is saying nobody likes Bernie which</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.740" end="00:07:31.050" style="s2">which isn&#39;t you know contradiction of of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.860" end="00:07:34.169" style="s2">the data obviously patently untrue</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.050" end="00:07:36.569" style="s2">there&#39;s one person who&#39;s absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.169" end="00:07:39.150" style="s2">and and you know technically he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.569" end="00:07:40.979" style="s2">the most popular senator you know all</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.150" end="00:07:42.509" style="s2">these sorts of things you know he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.979" end="00:07:44.069" style="s2">winning by many metrics you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.509" end="00:07:46.440" style="s2">speaking of failure and and Hillary</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.069" end="00:07:48.990" style="s2">Clinton failed and it&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.440" end="00:07:50.520" style="s2">how she failed why she failed and what</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.990" end="00:07:56.159" style="s2">she thinks about it and what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.520" end="00:07:59.310" style="s2">learned from her failure sorry yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.159" end="00:08:02.610" style="s2">just trying to a you know Ray Ray&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.310" end="00:08:05.610" style="s2">parallel to our discussion uh like like</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.610" end="00:08:07.860" style="s2">just just to touch on and um not</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.610" end="00:08:10.650" style="s2">necessarily to say that she hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.860" end="00:08:11.699" style="s2">learned anything I&#39;m sure she has or</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.650" end="00:08:14.580" style="s2">that or that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.699" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">I always know better but it&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.580" end="00:08:18.830" style="s2">interesting you know thing how we talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:20.930" style="s2">about failure especially at this scale</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.830" end="00:08:23.819" style="s2">when you know we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.930" end="00:08:25.529" style="s2">movements and organization and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.819" end="00:08:27.389" style="s2">it&#39;s not just her that failed it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.529" end="00:08:29.520" style="s2">kind of culture and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.389" end="00:08:34.890" style="s2">just trumped at one it&#39;s a kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.520" end="00:08:37.529" style="s2">you know sixty plus million people got</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.890" end="00:08:41.839" style="s2">what they voted for in a sense but are</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.529" end="00:08:46.730" style="s2">also failing and being failed on with uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.839" end="00:08:46.730" style="s2">with delivery and you know resources</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">all right I was gonna comments I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.870" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">know I mean Hillary did fail she didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:02.460" style="s2">get the presidency but so did Bernie</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:06.540" style="s2">Bernie failed in the primary and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.460" end="00:09:10.860" style="s2">a certain amount of we can&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.540" end="00:09:13.140" style="s2">gauge somebody else&#39;s failure hmm we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.860" end="00:09:15.560" style="s2">only gauge our own but we can learn from</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.140" end="00:09:18.140" style="s2">other people&#39;s without making</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.560" end="00:09:21.540" style="s2">requirement that they learn from it so</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.140" end="00:09:23.280" style="s2">what can America learn from the failure</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.540" end="00:09:27.330" style="s2">if it&#39;s a failure that happened during</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.280" end="00:09:29.370" style="s2">2016 and what can Bernie learn from his</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.330" end="00:09:32.430" style="s2">failure if he wants to I mean bring that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.370" end="00:09:35.310" style="s2">that forward into 2020 wants to learn</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.430" end="00:09:40.170" style="s2">and have a better outcome in this one</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.310" end="00:09:41.610" style="s2">and yeah that like failure is and I like</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.170" end="00:09:44.580" style="s2">Eric&#39;s suggestion of like what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.610" end="00:09:46.650" style="s2">failure I think it is it stopped it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.580" end="00:09:48.660" style="s2">when you stop trying so I guess because</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.650" end="00:09:50.700" style="s2">Hillary isn&#39;t running for the president</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.660" end="00:09:52.590" style="s2">is that failure is that success cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.700" end="00:09:54.450" style="s2">don&#39;t think we wanted her to run I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.590" end="00:09:56.250" style="s2">think she wanted to run I think she had</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.450" end="00:09:58.830" style="s2">her shot and now she will find other</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.250" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">ways to live her permission her life</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.830" end="00:10:05.100" style="s2">whatever she&#39;s here to do that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:07.620" style="s2">failure but she did fail fail at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.100" end="00:10:11.700" style="s2">thing and she will never get there right</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.620" end="00:10:13.830" style="s2">like she might get to win at something</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.700" end="00:10:17.040" style="s2">but not that not to be the president of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.830" end="00:10:19.740" style="s2">the United States and that sucks if that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.040" end="00:10:23.640" style="s2">was your ultimate dream yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.740" end="00:10:25.530" style="s2">where she failed was authenticity right</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.640" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">she failed to convince the American</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.530" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">public that she was in any way authentic</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:33.000" style="s2">about what she was talking about and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:35.670" style="s2">perhaps what she might be able to learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.000" end="00:10:37.500" style="s2">from it is you know the need to remain</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.670" end="00:10:39.090" style="s2">authentic if you wish to bring people</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.500" end="00:10:41.430" style="s2">with you right if you wish to convince</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.090" end="00:10:44.400" style="s2">me you can&#39;t convince people to believe</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.430" end="00:10:46.460" style="s2">in yourself you know I mean I use a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.400" end="00:10:48.930" style="s2">certain extent you can but no really way</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.460" end="00:10:50.760" style="s2">discerning people I&#39;m not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.930" end="00:10:53.160" style="s2">swayed by stuff that you don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.760" end="00:10:56.610" style="s2">me so just coming back to the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.160" end="00:10:58.530" style="s2">what failure is I mean apart from when</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.610" end="00:11:01.020" style="s2">you give up right I actually really like</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.530" end="00:11:01.520" style="s2">that definition but I think in in so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.020" end="00:11:03.500" style="s2">common</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.520" end="00:11:06.410" style="s2">parlance and this is this is another</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.500" end="00:11:09.770" style="s2">really interesting idea that failure as</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.410" end="00:11:11.840" style="s2">measured by yourself is your endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.770" end="00:11:14.570" style="s2">not living up to whatever pre</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.840" end="00:11:17.270" style="s2">expectations you put into it right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.570" end="00:11:20.450" style="s2">so you know you&#39;ve only failed because</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.270" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">it fell short of whatever hopes you</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.450" end="00:11:23.540" style="s2">might have had for that particular</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:26.450" style="s2">endeavor you know it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.540" end="00:11:28.010" style="s2">by a different set of metrics that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.450" end="00:11:29.750" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been a success do you see what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.010" end="00:11:32.540" style="s2">mean and so you you have you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.750" end="00:11:34.460" style="s2">defined what failure and success are</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.540" end="00:11:38.870" style="s2">kind of before you even started which I</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.460" end="00:11:40.700" style="s2">think put some kind of constraint on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.870" end="00:11:42.680" style="s2">project from the start right because</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.700" end="00:11:45.740" style="s2">it&#39;s forced into conforming to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.680" end="00:11:47.450" style="s2">set of success but measurable success</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.740" end="00:11:50.090" style="s2">parameters that you&#39;ve laid out at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.450" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">start so I think they thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.090" end="00:11:54.980" style="s2">success and failure is is maybe really</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.360" end="00:11:59.330" style="s2">constraining right because it keeps you</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.980" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">on a particular part yeah we were</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.330" end="00:12:05.480" style="s2">talking about what was that my</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:08.630" style="s2">microphone that was horrific what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.480" end="00:12:12.320" style="s2">that anyway seems to have gone down so</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.630" end="00:12:14.750" style="s2">yeah the exclusionary piece of winning</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.320" end="00:12:16.850" style="s2">in certain areas like the president the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.750" end="00:12:19.850" style="s2">United States is one person for four</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.850" end="00:12:21.530" style="s2">years so you&#39;re almost guaranteed to</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.850" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">fail at it right like there&#39;s only gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.530" end="00:12:26.060" style="s2">be one Democratic candidate out of all</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:27.170" style="s2">the ones that are running and they may</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.060" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">or may not fail but there will</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.170" end="00:12:30.860" style="s2">definitely be one person who fails I</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:32.960" style="s2">think the same thing happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.860" end="00:12:34.430" style="s2">Olympics where there&#39;s like one gold</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.960" end="00:12:37.430" style="s2">medal winner and if your silver you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.430" end="00:12:39.230" style="s2">the first failure and you might never</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.430" end="00:12:41.690" style="s2">get a chance to compete there and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.230" end="00:12:44.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain amount that when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.690" end="00:12:46.340" style="s2">have your metric be I have to be the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.180" end="00:12:49.520" style="s2">best at this instead of I have to be the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.340" end="00:12:53.110" style="s2">best I can be at this and even that</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.520" end="00:12:55.520" style="s2">comes with a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.110" end="00:12:58.490" style="s2">exclusionary that you fail like if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.520" end="00:13:00.380" style="s2">were in your 20s and able to run a you</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.490" end="00:13:02.540" style="s2">know seven-minute mile and now you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.380" end="00:13:04.460" style="s2">run SFM in a mile never be able to beat</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.540" end="00:13:05.540" style="s2">that number if that&#39;s the number you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.460" end="00:13:07.160" style="s2">trying to beat you might have a new</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.540" end="00:13:10.670" style="s2">number in your 40s right you might have</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.160" end="00:13:12.860" style="s2">a new metric to gauge with and to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.670" end="00:13:15.200" style="s2">how how close can I get to that as</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.860" end="00:13:18.250" style="s2">opposed to having</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.200" end="00:13:18.250" style="s2">be the bar</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.519" end="00:13:34.519" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to know them whether</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.600" end="00:13:38.420" style="s2">you&#39;re setting the bar high enough for</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.519" end="00:13:40.149" style="s2">yourself right this is the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.420" end="00:13:42.910" style="s2">being your own judges obsessive I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.149" end="00:13:45.860" style="s2">something like the presidency right you</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.910" end="00:13:47.839" style="s2">can only ever be one winner right so by</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.860" end="00:13:51.049" style="s2">definition everyone else must play up</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.839" end="00:13:52.819" style="s2">and so the the Olympics for example I</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.049" end="00:13:54.379" style="s2">think is quite I think that&#39;s a nice</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.819" end="00:13:56.149" style="s2">result because there are various levels</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.379" end="00:13:58.509" style="s2">of aspiration you can have I mean at a</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.149" end="00:14:00.470" style="s2">certain level just to get the Olympics</p>

<p begin="00:14:50.869" end="00:14:57.319" style="s2">is like if you want to have access to</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.739" end="00:14:58.129" style="s2">doing the luge you can do it but you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.319" end="00:14:59.989" style="s2">know what I mean you&#39;re not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.129" end="00:15:02.059" style="s2">gonna be a gold the gold medal winner at</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.989" end="00:15:04.069" style="s2">it I think that&#39;s a very very different</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.059" end="00:15:06.410" style="s2">like everyone can have access to playing</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.069" end="00:15:08.239" style="s2">sports by definition there&#39;s only gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.410" end="00:15:10.759" style="s2">be a tiny tiny minority</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.239" end="00:15:16.100" style="s2">who&#39;s going to excel at it to the point</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.759" end="00:15:18.949" style="s2">where that&#39;s their entire life and just</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.100" end="00:15:20.869" style="s2">Joe average doing the luge say what what</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.949" end="00:15:23.029" style="s2">now becomes your I mean do you even</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.869" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">think in terms of success and failure or</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.029" end="00:15:27.079" style="s2">is it is its success I had a good time</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:29.720" style="s2">and failure is it was boring I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.079" end="00:15:31.309" style="s2">don&#39;t know what loss is it is it even</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.720" end="00:15:33.290" style="s2">meaningful to think in terms of success</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.309" end="00:15:35.949" style="s2">and failure I don&#39;t I&#39;m asking I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.290" end="00:15:40.509" style="s2">know yeah and I think that is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.949" end="00:15:42.710" style="s2">question is like if you can just access</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.509" end="00:15:45.560" style="s2">doing the luge plane hockey</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.710" end="00:15:47.060" style="s2">whenever it happens to be and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.560" end="00:15:51.200" style="s2">just there to participate in the game</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.060" end="00:15:53.630" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a number of people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.200" end="00:15:54.860" style="s2">like the pre no effect of or going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.630" end="00:15:59.450" style="s2">succeed at it right they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.860" end="00:16:00.410" style="s2">the best at that but if that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.450" end="00:16:02.600" style="s2">you&#39;re doing if you&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.410" end="00:16:04.670" style="s2">happy unless you&#39;re in the NHL unless</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.600" end="00:16:06.230" style="s2">you&#39;re getting then you&#39;re not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.670" end="00:16:08.570" style="s2">probably not going to be happy like</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.230" end="00:16:12.740" style="s2">you&#39;re going to probably fail at that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.570" end="00:16:15.650" style="s2">and but finding the joy in the plane of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.740" end="00:16:18.530" style="s2">hockey in the plane of the sport is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.650" end="00:16:20.570" style="s2">success and then yes you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.530" end="00:16:24.680" style="s2">going to get to be be the best of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.570" end="00:16:26.990" style="s2">that being said we need we need we need</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.680" end="00:16:33.260" style="s2">an expanded vocabulary in this area</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.990" end="00:16:36.200" style="s2">right is gaining you know increased</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.260" end="00:16:38.330" style="s2">personal capacity increased whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.200" end="00:16:43.040" style="s2">know whatever it might be but in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.330" end="00:16:46.850" style="s2">personal level as opposed to on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.040" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">global level be actually being at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.850" end="00:16:53.290" style="s2">really pinnacle of it needs new more</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:57.680" style="s2">nuance language to for these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.290" end="00:17:01.340" style="s2">yeah make a lot of new language yes that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:04.820" style="s2">just keeps coming up I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.340" end="00:17:06.830" style="s2">started playing hockey mm-hmm and you</p>

<p begin="00:17:09.140" end="00:17:13.190" style="s2">street hockey when I was younger and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.910" end="00:17:14.990" style="s2">like the odd pond hockey thing but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.190" end="00:17:18.800" style="s2">never been good at it I&#39;ve never owned</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.990" end="00:17:20.990" style="s2">my own equipment until recently and like</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.800" end="00:17:23.510" style="s2">now when I go out there I still have fun</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.990" end="00:17:27.620" style="s2">but I but I suck like I&#39;m I&#39;m the worst</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.510" end="00:17:30.620" style="s2">person out there playing with like over</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.620" end="00:17:33.590" style="s2">50 year olds right it&#39;s a it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.620" end="00:17:35.810" style="s2">just dropping but but you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.590" end="00:17:39.140" style="s2">constantly learning from that because if</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.810" end="00:17:40.550" style="s2">you&#39;re that that&#39;s a good like I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.140" end="00:17:42.260" style="s2">the right attitude and it&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.550" end="00:17:44.270" style="s2">learning environment where I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.260" end="00:17:52.850" style="s2">continue to fail and can and you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.270" end="00:17:54.680" style="s2">iteratively improve like very quickly in</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.850" end="00:17:57.410" style="s2">a way not failure right it&#39;s progress</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.680" end="00:17:58.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not failure is progress yeah I wish</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.410" end="00:18:00.800" style="s2">I wish we could do the same with</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.820" end="00:18:02.270" style="s2">discourse and with ideas you know if</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.800" end="00:18:04.700" style="s2">people came to it but with the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.270" end="00:18:08.930" style="s2">humility and an experience that I come</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.700" end="00:18:10.850" style="s2">to with hockey we might uh we might be</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.930" end="00:18:12.950" style="s2">able to have a proper game in the first</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.850" end="00:18:17.180" style="s2">place right but but real life is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.950" end="00:18:19.370" style="s2">Messier I think people can I do that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.180" end="00:18:21.140" style="s2">mean not I don&#39;t succeed at it all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.370" end="00:18:23.960" style="s2">the time but like there are times I</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.140" end="00:18:25.100" style="s2">succeed at that and I think what you</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.960" end="00:18:26.750" style="s2">were saying about hockey that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.100" end="00:18:28.430" style="s2">you&#39;re playing with like 50 year olds</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.750" end="00:18:30.620" style="s2">and you&#39;re the worst why and I was it</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.430" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">had this you know like the the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.620" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">like a big fish in a small pond or a</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:36.560" style="s2">small fish in a big pond right like you</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:37.790" style="s2">decide okay well because if you are</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.560" end="00:18:39.920" style="s2">playing with five-year-olds you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.790" end="00:18:41.300" style="s2">probably be the best right like confide</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.920" end="00:18:43.610" style="s2">girls are Nestle to play with you but</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.300" end="00:18:45.230" style="s2">like you kind of want to have people you</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.610" end="00:18:46.940" style="s2">want to be surrounded by people who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.230" end="00:18:48.680" style="s2">gonna pull you up right who you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.940" end="00:18:50.330" style="s2">to be the worst at but maybe not the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.680" end="00:18:52.730" style="s2">worse right maybe you want to be in like</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.330" end="00:18:55.720" style="s2">the lower 40th percentile and not the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.730" end="00:18:59.750" style="s2">like bottom 5% eyelet for that like and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.720" end="00:19:02.540" style="s2">the what is that like the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.750" end="00:19:04.310" style="s2">experience we&#39;re getting to play hockey</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.540" end="00:19:06.140" style="s2">with people that you that are better</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.310" end="00:19:07.790" style="s2">than you and able to pull you up and</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.140" end="00:19:09.410" style="s2">also people that are worse than you had</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.790" end="00:19:11.300" style="s2">ever been on skates that aren&#39;t Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.410" end="00:19:13.880" style="s2">and you know to be there like to learn</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.300" end="00:19:15.410" style="s2">and you can you can train them not</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.880" end="00:19:19.460" style="s2">that&#39;s necessarily something you want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.410" end="00:19:21.290" style="s2">do but like that that is absolutely an</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.460" end="00:19:24.620" style="s2">intellectual we can do that right</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.290" end="00:19:25.700" style="s2">there&#39;s people who I think of is</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.620" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">brilliant and I would love to have</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.700" end="00:19:30.860" style="s2">conversations with them and and to draw</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:32.780" style="s2">that out I don&#39;t I said I think I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.860" end="00:19:37.490" style="s2">brilliant than other people but finding</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.780" end="00:19:38.090" style="s2">that space of I&#39;m a rookie here and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.490" end="00:19:39.770" style="s2">okay with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.090" end="00:19:42.410" style="s2">because I&#39;m here to learn and here I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.770" end="00:19:44.300" style="s2">genius right and owning that piece</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.410" end="00:19:45.800" style="s2">because I say I&#39;m living my genius I</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.300" end="00:19:47.690" style="s2">don&#39;t mean I&#39;m smarter than other people</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.800" end="00:19:49.790" style="s2">and I feel like Eric they froze that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.820" end="00:20:00.500" style="s2">myself like this is the space that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.710" end="00:20:02.930" style="s2">easy and fun and what I&#39;ve struggled and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.500" end="00:20:04.760" style="s2">where I seem to be yes it does happen to</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.930" end="00:20:07.850" style="s2">be better than other people but not</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.760" end="00:20:09.530" style="s2">because of that because your genius is</p>

<p begin="00:20:18.620" end="00:20:21.740" style="s2">bad like where are you bad that you want</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.510" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">to excel at but you but you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.740" end="00:20:25.880" style="s2">keep showing up if you hated hockey it</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:28.280" style="s2">would be a horrible place to be bad and</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.880" end="00:20:30.620" style="s2">not enjoying it but if you enjoy it</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.280" end="00:20:34.960" style="s2">you&#39;re more okay to be bad on it right</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.620" end="00:20:38.060" style="s2">and keep showing up and improve on it I</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.960" end="00:20:39.680" style="s2">want to touch back on politics for a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.060" end="00:20:41.270" style="s2">second because because I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.680" end="00:20:44.330" style="s2">like you like you&#39;re right like like</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.270" end="00:20:46.340" style="s2">both Hillary and Bernie lost in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.330" end="00:20:50.030" style="s2">which is an interesting observation and</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.340" end="00:20:52.370" style="s2">I think I think Bernie has learned a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.030" end="00:20:55.040" style="s2">and the Bernie movement has learned a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.370" end="00:20:56.930" style="s2">lot you know they&#39;ve they if they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.040" end="00:20:59.630" style="s2">incorporated a lot of that essentially</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.930" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">and and throughout that the time you</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.630" end="00:21:05.720" style="s2">know Hillary and Obama have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:07.550" style="s2">slinked away into semi-retirement only</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.720" end="00:21:10.850" style="s2">to come out occasionally to like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.550" end="00:21:15.020" style="s2">know like put down Bernie or something</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.850" end="00:21:17.330" style="s2">but a Bernie has continued to like work</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.020" end="00:21:19.910" style="s2">for the cause right so things like fight</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.330" end="00:21:22.700" style="s2">fighting Amazon and Disney for like</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.910" end="00:21:26.180" style="s2">minimum wage and stuff like that is like</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.700" end="00:21:28.100" style="s2">like keeping going despite failure right</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.180" end="00:21:30.530" style="s2">because it&#39;s it comes back to this idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.100" end="00:21:32.090" style="s2">of an end game and you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.530" end="00:21:33.860" style="s2">fighting for a bigger cause and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.090" end="00:21:36.040" style="s2">not gonna you&#39;re never gonna fail in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.860" end="00:21:38.630" style="s2">long run</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.040" end="00:21:40.670" style="s2">whereas Hillary or Obama they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.630" end="00:21:44.180" style="s2">being more strategic about it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.670" end="00:21:46.790" style="s2">of wins and losses and and what they</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.180" end="00:21:49.010" style="s2">learn from that you know like there just</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.790" end="00:21:54.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be the same degree of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.010" end="00:21:56.120" style="s2">reflection and humility and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.470" end="00:21:58.760" style="s2">progress from learning from those</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.120" end="00:22:01.660" style="s2">failures so you know like when when when</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.760" end="00:22:03.950" style="s2">Bernie lost as he did or was whatever</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.660" end="00:22:06.980" style="s2">stabbed in the back you know he&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.950" end="00:22:09.500" style="s2">campaigned for Hillary a lot right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.980" end="00:22:11.480" style="s2">so that was Bernie kind of sucking it up</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.500" end="00:22:16.100" style="s2">learning his lesson doing what he</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.480" end="00:22:17.900" style="s2">thought had to be done and you know when</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.100" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">when Hillary&#39;s asked what will she</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.900" end="00:22:23.659" style="s2">support</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:26.299" style="s2">you know and and she says you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.659" end="00:22:30.950" style="s2">gonna sort of wait until we see who the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.299" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">nominee is then we&#39;ll see you know it</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.950" end="00:22:37.429" style="s2">just seems to me that mmm there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:38.870" style="s2">lessons not just one but many lessons</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.429" end="00:22:44.919" style="s2">not being learned they&#39;re from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.870" end="00:22:48.440" style="s2">failure the failure to you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.919" end="00:22:50.450" style="s2">earlier she I don&#39;t think she ever</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.440" end="00:22:53.029" style="s2">thinks that her failure was that she</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.450" end="00:22:55.159" style="s2">didn&#39;t put herself behind Bernie in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.029" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">or now she doesn&#39;t believe in Bernie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.159" end="00:23:01.220" style="s2">mission right she&#39;s that&#39;s not her thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:02.750" style="s2">and so she&#39;s and when you said Obama and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.220" end="00:23:04.580" style="s2">Hillary both have kind of like retired</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.750" end="00:23:06.890" style="s2">retired but they come up to critique him</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.580" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">or so Obama gets to retire once you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.890" end="00:23:10.850" style="s2">the president what else do you go to</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:12.200" style="s2">right like that is don&#39;t get to continue</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.850" end="00:23:13.909" style="s2">on you don&#39;t kind of get to go back into</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.200" end="00:23:16.370" style="s2">politics and become a senator that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.909" end="00:23:18.860" style="s2">what the presidents do our man he has</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.370" end="00:23:20.390" style="s2">tried and can&#39;t and she&#39;s not she</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.860" end="00:23:21.559" style="s2">couldn&#39;t go back to being a senator I</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.390" end="00:23:22.429" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what she actually is</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.559" end="00:23:24.230" style="s2">doing at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.429" end="00:23:26.000" style="s2">yeah I mean I think she&#39;s younger than</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.230" end="00:23:27.830" style="s2">Bernie and of course Obama is much</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.000" end="00:23:29.779" style="s2">younger than both of them so even though</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.830" end="00:23:33.020" style="s2">he&#39;s been president you know he still</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.779" end="00:23:34.850" style="s2">has power and and a potential career in</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.020" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">many directions it&#39;s just a question of</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.850" end="00:23:39.830" style="s2">what you choose right and Obama has</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:42.740" style="s2">really chosen to kind of you know build</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.830" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">the kind of nonprofit legacy like just</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.740" end="00:23:48.140" style="s2">like Clinton did you know kind of be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:51.110" style="s2">be a be a cosmopolitan globalist but not</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.140" end="00:23:53.419" style="s2">support the you know the leftists and</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.110" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">the unions and the and the Socialists</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.419" end="00:23:57.350" style="s2">and all that mm-hmm and so I think you</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:23:59.600" style="s2">know we&#39;re failing as a planet I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.350" end="00:24:01.220" style="s2">trying to single out Clinton or Obama&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.600" end="00:24:02.809" style="s2">particular failures but but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.220" end="00:24:04.039" style="s2">collective failure the group failure</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.809" end="00:24:06.289" style="s2">right so what are we learning</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.039" end="00:24:11.659" style="s2">collectively and when I see these things</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.289" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">in the news like you know that that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.659" end="00:24:18.100" style="s2">know they just quite frankly can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:21.590" style="s2">converge on policy and on on you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.100" end="00:24:23.210" style="s2">morals and whatever it&#39;s like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.590" end="00:24:25.429" style="s2">failure you know and we&#39;re gonna end so</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.210" end="00:24:28.399" style="s2">there&#39;s this unbuttoned on all sides of</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.429" end="00:24:30.950" style="s2">life now there&#39;s this you know constant</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.399" end="00:24:32.120" style="s2">kind of threat like oh that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.950" end="00:24:34.160" style="s2">guarantee Trump</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.120" end="00:24:35.900" style="s2">or for years you know there&#39;s all that</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.160" end="00:24:37.820" style="s2">that kind of insults is being thrown in</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.900" end="00:24:41.240" style="s2">all directions because everyone&#39;s afraid</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.820" end="00:24:44.600" style="s2">of what will actually backfire in terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.240" end="00:24:46.750" style="s2">of strategy and and give Trump another</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.600" end="00:24:49.340" style="s2">four years and this is a very you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.750" end="00:24:51.560" style="s2">credit you know credible possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.340" end="00:24:54.710" style="s2">outcome if we can&#39;t get our shit</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.560" end="00:24:57.410" style="s2">together and and yeah unify mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.710" end="00:24:59.990" style="s2">watching the weekly and they were I</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.410" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">think it was the New York the New York</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.990" end="00:25:03.320" style="s2">Times who did who puts their weight</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:04.490" style="s2">behind one candidate and they were</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.320" end="00:25:07.460" style="s2">interviewing all the candidates the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.490" end="00:25:10.790" style="s2">Democratic Party and I totally forgot</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.460" end="00:25:13.460" style="s2">what I was gonna say which was there was</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.790" end="00:25:15.050" style="s2">a very important point of like no it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.460" end="00:25:18.280" style="s2">come back to me and then I will bring it</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.050" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">up but like I think there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.280" end="00:25:22.550" style="s2">like I said we can criticize our own</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:25.880" style="s2">failure oh that was it it was that Trump</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.550" end="00:25:28.670" style="s2">is not the disease he is a symptom of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.880" end="00:25:30.110" style="s2">the disease and nobody is so like there</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.670" end="00:25:32.600" style="s2">are a few candidates like Bernie who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.110" end="00:25:34.370" style="s2">dealing with the underlying issues but</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.600" end="00:25:36.230" style="s2">the the thing is you can&#39;t just put</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.370" end="00:25:38.570" style="s2">Biden in there and be like well you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.230" end="00:25:40.910" style="s2">he can establish it&#39;s like the American</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.570" end="00:25:42.890" style="s2">people the world is hurting you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.910" end="00:25:46.040" style="s2">disconnected they are addicted they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.890" end="00:25:48.350" style="s2">like we have so many issues and so this</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.040" end="00:25:51.490" style="s2">fact like we&#39;re polarizing and on on</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.350" end="00:25:56.900" style="s2">race on gender on these things that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.490" end="00:25:59.900" style="s2">symptoms they&#39;re not the thing and so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.900" end="00:26:01.970" style="s2">also can&#39;t find commonality with that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.900" end="00:26:03.410" style="s2">right like when because we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.970" end="00:26:05.000" style="s2">with the symptoms we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.410" end="00:26:07.070" style="s2">that level whether we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.000" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">commonality like there isn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.070" end="00:26:13.610" style="s2">the people who think that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:15.830" style="s2">immigrants fault aren&#39;t going to stop</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.610" end="00:26:18.380" style="s2">being racist and stop being is that a</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.830" end="00:26:20.120" style="s2">phobic especially when you haven&#39;t dealt</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.380" end="00:26:21.380" style="s2">with the underlining reason they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.120" end="00:26:22.700" style="s2">there which is that they&#39;re scared</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.380" end="00:26:24.470" style="s2">they&#39;re scared for their children</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.700" end="00:26:25.880" style="s2">they&#39;re scared for their economy and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.470" end="00:26:28.160" style="s2">instead they&#39;re just being yelled at to</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.880" end="00:26:29.720" style="s2">stop doing that and which makes them</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.160" end="00:26:31.910" style="s2">take their heels and further right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.720" end="00:26:33.710" style="s2">be like no it&#39;s it&#39;s thrown people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.910" end="00:26:36.440" style="s2">the fact that people it&#39;s you know not</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.710" end="00:26:40.190" style="s2">the 1% not giving us jobs and eroding</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.440" end="00:26:42.200" style="s2">our economic system it&#39;s the them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.190" end="00:26:44.660" style="s2">it&#39;s always kind of the wrong them when</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.200" end="00:26:45.820" style="s2">really I think statistics and stuff do</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.660" end="00:26:47.980" style="s2">show now</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.820" end="00:26:49.780" style="s2">1% are necessarily evil but they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.980" end="00:26:53.860" style="s2">that have the greatest effect in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.780" end="00:26:55.480" style="s2">greatest power and we all have that in</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.860" end="00:26:57.340" style="s2">common like we all want our families to</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.480" end="00:26:58.840" style="s2">be fed we all want them to be healthy we</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.340" end="00:27:01.000" style="s2">all want them to be so we can find the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.840" end="00:27:02.950" style="s2">common ground and go from there but to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.000" end="00:27:04.450" style="s2">need people to first get along it</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.950" end="00:27:06.310" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work like we&#39;re gonna fail at</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.450" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">that that&#39;s gonna be a failure</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.310" end="00:27:09.040" style="s2">there&#39;s and then I want to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:11.260" style="s2">something else or to let someone else</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.040" end="00:27:12.790" style="s2">talk I&#39;ll bring it well I was just</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.260" end="00:27:14.950" style="s2">thinking how nonviolent communication</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.790" end="00:27:18.460" style="s2">offers a really really really handy</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.950" end="00:27:21.910" style="s2">framework that can because I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.460" end="00:27:25.120" style="s2">know what you&#39;re talking about is people</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.910" end="00:27:26.920" style="s2">have a need for security and belonging</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.120" end="00:27:30.790" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the need</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.920" end="00:27:33.430" style="s2">that&#39;s not being met right and so rather</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.790" end="00:27:35.380" style="s2">than acknowledging that this is a common</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.430" end="00:27:37.180" style="s2">need that we all share and but we all</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.380" end="00:27:39.700" style="s2">have different strategies to meet that</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.180" end="00:27:41.980" style="s2">need and how can we each engage in our</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.700" end="00:27:43.230" style="s2">own unique individual or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.980" end="00:27:44.980" style="s2">collective strategies without</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.230" end="00:27:47.800" style="s2">interfering in other people&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.980" end="00:27:51.400" style="s2">ability to meet their own similar needs</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.800" end="00:27:53.140" style="s2">right and so you get tangled up in its</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.400" end="00:27:54.490" style="s2">the brown people for it&#39;s the immigrants</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.140" end="00:27:55.630" style="s2">for it&#39;s the poor people&#39;s fault it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.490" end="00:27:58.960" style="s2">the rich people&#39;s fault it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.630" end="00:28:01.300" style="s2">capitalists or whatever right but but</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.960" end="00:28:03.730" style="s2">actually as you said these are these are</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.300" end="00:28:06.100" style="s2">all symptoms of the fact that people</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.730" end="00:28:10.030" style="s2">aren&#39;t having basic needs psychological</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.100" end="00:28:12.490" style="s2">needs primarily being met and and and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.030" end="00:28:17.740" style="s2">the other the ring and the lashing out</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.490" end="00:28:19.390" style="s2">is simplicity a bad one right but it</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.740" end="00:28:21.610" style="s2">like if we could get rid of these people</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.390" end="00:28:23.770" style="s2">then this need that I feel is not being</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.610" end="00:28:25.510" style="s2">met would be met right it&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.770" end="00:28:28.720" style="s2">strategy but that&#39;s but that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.510" end="00:28:30.670" style="s2">is it&#39;s a and and yeah so sorry coming</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.720" end="00:28:32.560" style="s2">back saying the the the separation of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.670" end="00:28:33.940" style="s2">strategy from me because the need is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.560" end="00:28:35.320" style="s2">common ground that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.940" end="00:28:37.240" style="s2">about the need for the common ground to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.320" end="00:28:39.130" style="s2">start from that&#39;s that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.240" end="00:28:40.630" style="s2">acknowledging the common need is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.130" end="00:28:42.790" style="s2">common ground and acknowledging that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.630" end="00:28:43.690" style="s2">where we are in conflict is over our</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.790" end="00:28:46.540" style="s2">strategies</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.690" end="00:28:47.890" style="s2">that&#39;s that also is common ground then</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.540" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a difficult discussion but</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.890" end="00:28:54.190" style="s2">yeah right like the the one side is like</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:57.100" style="s2">well we just got rid of the immigrants</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.190" end="00:28:58.790" style="s2">and the poor people we&#39;d be fine and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.100" end="00:28:59.870" style="s2">left is very much back like</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.790" end="00:29:02.450" style="s2">no no we just something a rid of you</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.870" end="00:29:05.180" style="s2">right right we have do we need you to</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.450" end="00:29:06.950" style="s2">stop being you and start being and brené</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.180" end="00:29:09.310" style="s2">Brown has I don&#39;t remember which</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.950" end="00:29:11.780" style="s2">interview it&#39;s in but she talks about</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.310" end="00:29:13.460" style="s2">the difference like if who you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.780" end="00:29:16.420" style="s2">dealing with whether it&#39;s an individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.460" end="00:29:19.280" style="s2">or an entire group does it change your</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.420" end="00:29:21.040" style="s2">impression of them if you knew they were</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.280" end="00:29:23.900" style="s2">doing the best they could</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.040" end="00:29:26.480" style="s2">yeah yeah I&#39;ve had to say that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.900" end="00:29:30.320" style="s2">really powerful idea I agree I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.480" end="00:29:31.850" style="s2">come from the assumption that ever you</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.320" end="00:29:33.890" style="s2">know like Hillary Clinton&#39;s doing the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.850" end="00:29:38.060" style="s2">best job she can Trump is doing the best</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.890" end="00:29:39.950" style="s2">job he can not so if we need the system</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.060" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">to be better we can&#39;t leave it up to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.950" end="00:29:43.940" style="s2">them right they&#39;re doing the best they</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:46.610" style="s2">can we have to do better like as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.940" end="00:29:48.530" style="s2">collective we have to be like what do</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.610" end="00:29:51.650" style="s2">you need to do better what would get</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.530" end="00:29:53.150" style="s2">Trump to do better actually better and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.650" end="00:29:55.490" style="s2">it&#39;s not really net it was too bad</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.150" end="00:29:58.540" style="s2">already doing the best we can right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.490" end="00:29:58.540" style="s2">therefore we can&#39;t do any better</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.900" end="00:30:04.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a dangerous assumption like it</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.820" end="00:30:06.230" style="s2">might very well be true and I hear it a</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.880" end="00:30:08.660" style="s2">lot but I think it&#39;s a dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.230" end="00:30:11.000" style="s2">assumption like - especially if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.660" end="00:30:13.430" style="s2">like putting the best of intentions and</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.000" end="00:30:15.410" style="s2">knew all these you know projecting the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.430" end="00:30:20.780" style="s2">good intentions into all these people</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.410" end="00:30:22.610" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah I mean sometimes winning</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.780" end="00:30:27.020" style="s2">is failure let&#39;s put it that way like</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.610" end="00:30:30.050" style="s2">Trump won right um but but but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.020" end="00:30:33.620" style="s2">system failed you know like the effect</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.050" end="00:30:36.830" style="s2">of Trump&#39;s win as a kind of plutocrat or</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.620" end="00:30:39.950" style="s2">plutocracy is just to really get nothing</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.830" end="00:30:43.250" style="s2">done in terms of governance and to you</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.950" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">know cut taxes on rich people uh and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.250" end="00:30:48.560" style="s2">stuff like that right so kind of flips</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:49.700" style="s2">the question is like what what did you</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.560" end="00:30:51.590" style="s2">learn from failure well what did you</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.700" end="00:30:53.480" style="s2">learn from success look at what look at</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.590" end="00:30:56.500" style="s2">what success does to people sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.480" end="00:31:02.690" style="s2">when when you&#39;re just continually</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.500" end="00:31:05.510" style="s2">rewarded her for for being a criminal or</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.690" end="00:31:08.660" style="s2">or whatever you know yeah but he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.510" end="00:31:10.250" style="s2">the best job he can so if we need him</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.660" end="00:31:11.570" style="s2">like he&#39;s going to continue doing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.250" end="00:31:12.200" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna continue being Trump he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.570" end="00:31:13.610" style="s2">gonna continue</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.200" end="00:31:15.710" style="s2">looking at his own narcissistic best</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.610" end="00:31:19.429" style="s2">interest he doesn&#39;t know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.710" end="00:31:21.919" style="s2">different so the collective people need</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.429" end="00:31:24.110" style="s2">to come up with solutions for even if</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.919" end="00:31:26.450" style="s2">he&#39;s doing that how do we come up with</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.110" end="00:31:28.429" style="s2">solutions together how can we and when</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.450" end="00:31:29.929" style="s2">you look at it from any point of view</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.429" end="00:31:32.149" style="s2">you want like people are in poverty</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.929" end="00:31:33.799" style="s2">people who have addictions to stop doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.149" end="00:31:35.899" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing they can&#39;t ask them</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.799" end="00:31:38.690" style="s2">what they need we don&#39;t have to give it</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.899" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">to them but it&#39;s a better place to come</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.690" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">from it&#39;s like right there are diction</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:44.750" style="s2">levels the best job they can do right</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:46.850" style="s2">now so what would get them more and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.750" end="00:31:51.019" style="s2">generally love and connection and actual</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.850" end="00:31:52.490" style="s2">resources and a system that works that</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.019" end="00:31:54.340" style="s2">gets people what they need even when</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.490" end="00:31:57.139" style="s2">it&#39;s not with any like even when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.340" end="00:31:59.720" style="s2">you know when I get my when I have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.139" end="00:32:01.490" style="s2">relationship I&#39;ll be happy the best way</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.720" end="00:32:03.559" style="s2">to prove yourself wrong is to get the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.490" end="00:32:06.289" style="s2">relationship right to be like oh look</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.559" end="00:32:07.940" style="s2">happiness isn&#39;t here and so we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.289" end="00:32:09.760" style="s2">busy yelling at people to not be in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.940" end="00:32:11.960" style="s2">position they&#39;re in that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.760" end="00:32:13.940" style="s2">helping them get any better and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.960" end="00:32:17.149" style="s2">that is where we&#39;re failing I think is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.940" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">by like failing ourselves not realizing</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.149" end="00:32:20.450" style="s2">that we are the best we can be in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.320" end="00:32:21.889" style="s2">moment and failing everyone else that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.450" end="00:32:23.960" style="s2">like need them to be doing better when</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.889" end="00:32:26.029" style="s2">they can&#39;t they don&#39;t have that they</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.960" end="00:32:28.039" style="s2">could they would be doing it yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.029" end="00:32:30.830" style="s2">we&#39;re all we&#39;re all gonna fail at many</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.039" end="00:32:34.750" style="s2">things and then in order to have those</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.830" end="00:32:38.210" style="s2">be lessons just need to lower the stakes</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.750" end="00:32:40.159" style="s2">structurally a lot right so like like</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.210" end="00:32:43.070" style="s2">I&#39;m saying with hockey and something</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.159" end="00:32:44.899" style="s2">that so if everyone&#39;s stakes are low and</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.070" end="00:32:47.419" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of game affine they have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.899" end="00:32:49.159" style="s2">opportunity like in a classroom you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.419" end="00:32:51.950" style="s2">similar is you have the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.159" end="00:32:54.440" style="s2">to learn to fit and to fail of course</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.950" end="00:32:56.179" style="s2">mm-hmm and and to continually improve</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.440" end="00:32:59.389" style="s2">and so it&#39;s all about creating the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.179" end="00:33:03.159" style="s2">conditions for a healthy range of you</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.389" end="00:33:05.750" style="s2">know trying and failing to do things and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.159" end="00:33:08.480" style="s2">just to take him in the other direction</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.750" end="00:33:10.639" style="s2">III can give a couple personal examples</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.480" end="00:33:13.190" style="s2">from from the lasts from yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.639" end="00:33:14.929" style="s2">actually because I really felt like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.190" end="00:33:17.960" style="s2">failure so this is really small small</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.929" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">scale stuff but the point is like what</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.960" end="00:33:25.670" style="s2">did I learn right I spilled water on my</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:27.470" style="s2">keyboard yesterday and end mmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.670" end="00:33:29.660" style="s2">not right away but almost immediately it</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.470" end="00:33:31.340" style="s2">started acting up in the buttons started</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.660" end="00:33:33.680" style="s2">doing the wrong thing and very key</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.340" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">buttons like backspace like delete and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.680" end="00:33:39.380" style="s2">and you know return like I couldn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:41.060" style="s2">couldn&#39;t use and the command key so my</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.380" end="00:33:43.130" style="s2">whole interface was ruined right I</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.060" end="00:33:46.910" style="s2">couldn&#39;t use the computer I felt like an</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.130" end="00:33:48.440" style="s2">idiot because I effectively caused it</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.910" end="00:33:51.290" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.440" end="00:33:52.850" style="s2">and I tried I tried taking some keys off</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.290" end="00:33:55.940" style="s2">and cleaning it and I tried blow drying</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.850" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">it and nothing worked it it didn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.940" end="00:34:02.510" style="s2">to be wet but it also didn&#39;t work and</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:05.920" style="s2">and I dried it out overnight in front of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.510" end="00:34:08.090" style="s2">a heat source and and it works today so</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.920" end="00:34:09.980" style="s2">you know there was a lesson there in</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.090" end="00:34:13.429" style="s2">terms of like patience in terms of not</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.980" end="00:34:15.500" style="s2">beating myself up you know and then just</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.429" end="00:34:17.570" style="s2">dealing with the problem like like step</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.500" end="00:34:19.130" style="s2">by step and hoping that things work out</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.570" end="00:34:21.530" style="s2">because you don&#39;t you don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.130" end="00:34:22.910" style="s2">you failed until the end right you have</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.530" end="00:34:25.460" style="s2">to keep trying you have to not give up</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.910" end="00:34:27.500" style="s2">so I fixed my keyboard and sit you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.460" end="00:34:28.850" style="s2">saved a bunch of trouble I also broke</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.500" end="00:34:31.610" style="s2">the button on my coffee machine</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.850" end="00:34:36.830" style="s2">yesterday and I have not had success</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.610" end="00:34:40.580" style="s2">with repairing yet so yeah yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.830" end="00:34:43.550" style="s2">I&#39;m still learning and I think those are</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.580" end="00:34:47.330" style="s2">the kind of things that we can offer one</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.550" end="00:34:50.030" style="s2">another both I mean that wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.330" end="00:34:52.550" style="s2">failure right like even when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.030" end="00:34:54.380" style="s2">your shame the collective community</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.550" end="00:34:55.940" style="s2">being able to that&#39;s not a failure right</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.380" end="00:34:57.980" style="s2">like we&#39;ve all spill water on our</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.940" end="00:34:59.360" style="s2">keyboard you&#39;re not a failure of a human</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.980" end="00:35:02.660" style="s2">being for it because we can get in those</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.360" end="00:35:04.220" style="s2">moments but also the like collective</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.660" end="00:35:05.720" style="s2">learning what do you do when you do</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.220" end="00:35:10.610" style="s2">spill water on our keyboard what are</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.720" end="00:35:12.470" style="s2">effective ways to deal with it and to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.610" end="00:35:14.090" style="s2">able to learn from people&#39;s past failure</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.470" end="00:35:17.480" style="s2">right like we all make mistakes how do</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.090" end="00:35:20.180" style="s2">you actually clean it up what is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.480" end="00:35:22.190" style="s2">solution because we collectively can</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.180" end="00:35:24.950" style="s2">share that information much more easily</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.190" end="00:35:26.750" style="s2">so we don&#39;t have to each learn from only</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.950" end="00:35:28.910" style="s2">our own failures right we can learn from</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.750" end="00:35:30.020" style="s2">each others as well be like oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.910" end="00:35:31.760" style="s2">what you do when you spill water on</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.020" end="00:35:34.250" style="s2">keyboard unplug it immediately don&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.760" end="00:35:35.630" style="s2">it right up I got my phone way a week</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.250" end="00:35:37.970" style="s2">ago and it does it takes overnight to</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.630" end="00:35:39.290" style="s2">sort itself out either the some reason</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.970" end="00:35:42.100" style="s2">they kept thinking ahead headphone</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.290" end="00:35:45.970" style="s2">right so there was no sound coming out</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.100" end="00:35:48.860" style="s2">and yeah I thought God was hand it off</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.970" end="00:35:57.470" style="s2">on sweet works so yeah I could have told</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.860" end="00:36:00.320" style="s2">you it takes 24 hours all right like I</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.470" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">feel like that is a big solution for us</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.320" end="00:36:07.160" style="s2">as a planet is figuring out how we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:08.150" style="s2">share in each other&#39;s failures so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.160" end="00:36:09.980" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to make them all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.150" end="00:36:12.290" style="s2">themselves I mean the amount of times</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.980" end="00:36:13.370" style="s2">that especially in technology people are</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.290" end="00:36:16.220" style="s2">like well that&#39;s been tried and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.370" end="00:36:18.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a failure no one wanted it well</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.220" end="00:36:21.200" style="s2">what went wrong but what actually went</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.770" end="00:36:23.210" style="s2">wrong in the implementation of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:25.790" style="s2">because maybe we can learn and grow I</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.210" end="00:36:29.780" style="s2">was just watching this documentary</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.790" end="00:36:32.750" style="s2">called Wild West something like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.780" end="00:36:36.650" style="s2">it&#39;s about a cults that started in in</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.750" end="00:36:38.360" style="s2">America in the 80s and and there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.650" end="00:36:39.980" style="s2">much beauty there like they start this</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.360" end="00:36:41.780" style="s2">land and it&#39;s really because one</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.980" end="00:36:43.850" style="s2">person&#39;s a narcissist yet loves her guru</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.780" end="00:36:47.390" style="s2">bit like this all goes chaotically wrong</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.850" end="00:36:49.790" style="s2">and you by the way they it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.390" end="00:36:51.740" style="s2">any cult is gonna be a disruption right</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.790" end="00:36:53.570" style="s2">like and it&#39;s like well there&#39;s beauty</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.740" end="00:36:54.920" style="s2">here like what went wrong and we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.570" end="00:36:57.950" style="s2">actually have the good without the bad</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.920" end="00:36:59.840" style="s2">they also kind of like bulldozed the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.950" end="00:37:01.130" style="s2">community they were right nearby that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.840" end="00:37:02.390" style="s2">didn&#39;t want them there and didn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.130" end="00:37:05.030" style="s2">there were things that definitely went</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.390" end="00:37:07.160" style="s2">wrong there are things that went right</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.030" end="00:37:09.500" style="s2">and most of the people who were there</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.160" end="00:37:11.750" style="s2">were good kind people working towards a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.500" end="00:37:14.510" style="s2">common good there was nothing broken</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.750" end="00:37:16.610" style="s2">about that it was the one person who was</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.510" end="00:37:18.260" style="s2">like well we need to like poison the</p>

<p begin="00:37:21.850" end="00:37:27.620" style="s2">outcomes because there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.510" end="00:37:29.360" style="s2">transparency and like she gave a coli</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.620" end="00:37:31.220" style="s2">poisoning to the town and you even later</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.360" end="00:37:32.500" style="s2">she was like people get sick why should</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.120" end="00:37:41.840" style="s2">different thing there for a while that</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.160" end="00:37:42.710" style="s2">plot I&#39;ve seen that wild wild country</p>

<p begin="00:37:52.430" end="00:37:59.330" style="s2">absolutely real but I mean it does it</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.080" end="00:38:01.250" style="s2">does only take one person in a position</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.330" end="00:38:03.020" style="s2">of authority in an organization which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.250" end="00:38:05.030" style="s2">not completely transparent and boom I</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.020" end="00:38:08.420" style="s2">mean it seems to be almost an</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.030" end="00:38:11.870" style="s2">inevitability so yeah that their optimum</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.420" end="00:38:13.790" style="s2">transparency but also the ability to try</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.870" end="00:38:18.200" style="s2">self out on a scale which is not</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.790" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">everyone right that ability to you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.200" end="00:38:22.340" style="s2">forbidding the instrument experiment</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.480" end="00:38:23.630" style="s2">knowing that outside of the boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.340" end="00:38:25.130" style="s2">of that experiment you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.630" end="00:38:26.990" style="s2">fuck the whole world up if it goes wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.130" end="00:38:29.420" style="s2">right and there are people out there</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.990" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">willing to clean up the mess when it all</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.420" end="00:38:33.380" style="s2">goes wrong right and reset okay that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:38.660" style="s2">didn&#39;t work let&#39;s let&#39;s try this version</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.380" end="00:38:40.850" style="s2">whatever so that setting things up so</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.660" end="00:38:44.660" style="s2">that you can try since you know having</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.850" end="00:38:46.370" style="s2">one government or whatever telling 200</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.660" end="00:38:47.780" style="s2">million people 300 million people this</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.370" end="00:38:49.130" style="s2">is what we&#39;re going to be doing when bad</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.780" end="00:38:51.350" style="s2">decisions are made this is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.130" end="00:38:54.580" style="s2">dangerous right you have to have the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.350" end="00:38:57.290" style="s2">ability to contain the effects of</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.580" end="00:38:59.330" style="s2">drastic failure of catastrophic failure</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.290" end="00:39:00.680" style="s2">right I mean it&#39;s all very well yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.330" end="00:39:02.630" style="s2">need to learn from failure and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.680" end="00:39:04.370" style="s2">true but you also need to contain the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.630" end="00:39:06.920" style="s2">worst effects so you know be able to</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.370" end="00:39:08.600" style="s2">contain the worst effects of it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.920" end="00:39:10.310" style="s2">and I like the idea of starting small</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.600" end="00:39:12.170" style="s2">for that very reason if you can figure</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.310" end="00:39:13.490" style="s2">it out with you know ten people you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.170" end="00:39:15.140" style="s2">figure out 100 people you can figure out</p>

<p begin="00:39:15.140" end="00:39:22.160" style="s2">looking to expand it if it wants to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.260" end="00:39:24.380" style="s2">expanded or create a copy of it that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.160" end="00:39:25.700" style="s2">wants to be expanded right like not</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.380" end="00:39:27.200" style="s2">everyone can eat with my community</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.700" end="00:39:29.600" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of like forty people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.200" end="00:39:30.860" style="s2">can fit in that dining room but they</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.600" end="00:39:34.600" style="s2">could have their own community that they</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.860" end="00:39:40.100" style="s2">eat with like there&#39;s certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.600" end="00:39:41.690" style="s2">recreating what works and also learning</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.100" end="00:39:43.190" style="s2">from each other&#39;s failures I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.690" end="00:39:44.870" style="s2">guarantee you in the next Co housing</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.190" end="00:39:46.820" style="s2">starts there&#39;s things our Co housing can</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.870" end="00:39:48.350" style="s2">teach them be like here&#39;s what you want</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.820" end="00:39:51.890" style="s2">to not do and here&#39;s what you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.350" end="00:39:54.260" style="s2">especially in Vancouver and like the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.890" end="00:39:55.730" style="s2">not documentary it was also very clear I</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.260" end="00:39:58.600" style="s2">mean that is kind of the definition of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.730" end="00:40:01.820" style="s2">cult but when it&#39;s around one leader</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.600" end="00:40:03.560" style="s2">both there&#39;s all the loyalty to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.820" end="00:40:05.869" style="s2">leader which then makes people somehow</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.560" end="00:40:08.559" style="s2">do bad horrible things</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.869" end="00:40:10.489" style="s2">or if there&#39;s a higher possibility there</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.559" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">they weren&#39;t transparent about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.489" end="00:40:14.059" style="s2">finances or wasn&#39;t it was like very</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:17.209" style="s2">clear there&#39;s a tiny group in charge</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.059" end="00:40:18.709" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t and so that&#39;s what when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.209" end="00:40:20.119" style="s2">look at what has happened with cults</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.709" end="00:40:22.189" style="s2">that happens time and time and time</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.119" end="00:40:24.469" style="s2">again that there&#39;s like a tiny group of</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.189" end="00:40:26.239" style="s2">leaders and they have more power and</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.469" end="00:40:28.489" style="s2">more and so when something goes wrong</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.239" end="00:40:29.989" style="s2">goes catastrophic ly wrong they decide</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.489" end="00:40:32.599" style="s2">that like their things falling apart so</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.989" end="00:40:34.400" style="s2">everyone commits mass suicide like if</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.599" end="00:40:36.650" style="s2">it&#39;s never that because you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.400" end="00:40:38.839" style="s2">like cohousing doesn&#39;t have a leader</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.650" end="00:40:40.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a downfall with that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.839" end="00:40:43.459" style="s2">know how to go do to ask for permission</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.150" end="00:40:47.719" style="s2">but no one person leaving that community</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.459" end="00:40:49.849" style="s2">is gonna destroy it it might devolve</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.719" end="00:40:51.410" style="s2">over time when a lot of people leave and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.849" end="00:40:54.499" style="s2">new people come in and they weren&#39;t part</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.410" end="00:40:57.079" style="s2">of the creation of it but that is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.499" end="00:40:58.309" style="s2">different process than like one guru and</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.079" end="00:41:03.170" style="s2">then they leave and then it just</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.309" end="00:41:04.729" style="s2">collapses around them when they fall</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.170" end="00:41:10.219" style="s2">from the pedestal that like community</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.729" end="00:41:11.779" style="s2">falls from its pedestal yeah I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.219" end="00:41:18.609" style="s2">one of the great challenges isn&#39;t it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.779" end="00:41:22.189" style="s2">to create an architecture where</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.609" end="00:41:24.619" style="s2">co-opting of power by a small group of</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.189" end="00:41:26.449" style="s2">individuals is simply not possible right</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.619" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">it simply can&#39;t be done because if it</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.449" end="00:41:30.410" style="s2">can be done sooner or later it seems</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:31.670" style="s2">like it will be done so is that yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.410" end="00:41:34.249" style="s2">designing an architecture that makes</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.670" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">that impossible with a the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.249" end="00:41:44.059" style="s2">nature of you know it&#39;s stove deep down</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:47.089" style="s2">in the soil right that there isn&#39;t a way</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.059" end="00:41:49.009" style="s2">of coops I don&#39;t know I mean I have no</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.089" end="00:41:51.469" style="s2">idea how to do that but it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.009" end="00:41:54.170" style="s2">seems to be essential and grab all the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.469" end="00:41:59.719" style="s2">power of the One Ring but he will it</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.170" end="00:42:01.789" style="s2">seems big historical question like we</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.719" end="00:42:03.499" style="s2">like I said earlier like we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.789" end="00:42:05.119" style="s2">about all day about our personal</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.499" end="00:42:09.289" style="s2">failures but when we&#39;re trying to do a</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:11.420" style="s2">collective project and movement and</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.289" end="00:42:14.059" style="s2">thought experiments like we have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.420" end="00:42:16.729" style="s2">of know history together know the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.059" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">history and that&#39;s not so that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.729" end="00:42:22.460" style="s2">tough like like yesterday was</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:25.100" style="s2">luther king day right and you know there</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.460" end="00:42:27.650" style="s2">is there&#39;s always there&#39;s always on</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.100" end="00:42:30.530" style="s2">martin luther king day like conservative</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.650" end="00:42:32.330" style="s2">articles that try to co-opt the history</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.530" end="00:42:35.450" style="s2">are trying to rewrite the history and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.330" end="00:42:37.940" style="s2">and it&#39;s a ritz revisionism right but</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.450" end="00:42:39.710" style="s2">not in the good sense of trying to you</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.940" end="00:42:43.340" style="s2">know correct the historical record it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.710" end="00:42:45.980" style="s2">more like saying like like you know at</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.340" end="00:42:47.470" style="s2">the extreme end that bet MLK was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.980" end="00:42:51.620" style="s2">conservative well he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.470" end="00:42:53.330" style="s2">conservatives hated him and in fact they</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.620" end="00:42:55.850" style="s2">hated him so much that at the time they</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.330" end="00:42:58.370" style="s2">even got a lot of affluent black people</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.850" end="00:43:00.560" style="s2">to hate him you know he was hated that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.370" end="00:43:03.500" style="s2">the point right and it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.560" end="00:43:05.240" style="s2">happens every year uh on martin luther</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.500" end="00:43:06.950" style="s2">king day it&#39;s like there&#39;s lots of great</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.240" end="00:43:08.390" style="s2">content that comes out of course but</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.950" end="00:43:10.940" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s content that tries to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.390" end="00:43:13.790" style="s2">whitewash the history and it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.940" end="00:43:18.920" style="s2">this big you know kind of skirmish</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.790" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">online and and you know so so i saw a</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.920" end="00:43:23.000" style="s2">lot of that yesterday and and this</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:24.710" style="s2">morning and it&#39;s like okay this is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.000" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">collective failure like we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.710" end="00:43:30.650" style="s2">learning the history what have we what</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:32.840" style="s2">have we learnt right like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.650" end="00:43:34.970" style="s2">question we have to ask like together</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.840" end="00:43:36.980" style="s2">and learn and learn together because</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.970" end="00:43:41.450" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily a personal failure</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.980" end="00:43:44.330" style="s2">uh you know in this case but of course</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.450" end="00:43:46.670" style="s2">people&#39;s understanding of these things</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.330" end="00:43:48.830" style="s2">are made up by tons of little decisions</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.670" end="00:43:51.380" style="s2">which includes failure so if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.830" end="00:43:54.820" style="s2">failing to you know understand the true</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.380" end="00:43:57.230" style="s2">history that could be a big gap to close</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.820" end="00:43:59.750" style="s2">but but learn learning is difficult</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.230" end="00:44:01.970" style="s2">right whether there&#39;s failure involved</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.750" end="00:44:04.670" style="s2">or not the process of learning is</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.970" end="00:44:06.470" style="s2">difficult and what I&#39;m getting at is</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.670" end="00:44:10.010" style="s2">just that the public discourse keeps</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.470" end="00:44:11.660" style="s2">failing because you know we&#39;re not we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.010" end="00:44:16.010" style="s2">not learning from our personal failures</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.660" end="00:44:18.590" style="s2">in research and in discussion etc so you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.010" end="00:44:20.600" style="s2">know that&#39;s I hope we can just get</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.590" end="00:44:21.830" style="s2">better at that quickly yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.600" end="00:44:23.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a tendency to try and cover</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.830" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">failures up isn&#39;t that a role yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.600" end="00:44:28.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a tendency to try to pretend</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:30.470" style="s2">they never happened exactly it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.760" end="00:44:31.940" style="s2">famous person but I can&#39;t think who it</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.470" end="00:44:33.349" style="s2">is we&#39;ll all know the name but I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.940" end="00:44:35.329" style="s2">think for the likelihood is that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.349" end="00:44:37.729" style="s2">I thought is it Aldous Huxley I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.329" end="00:44:39.949" style="s2">it&#39;s Aldous Huxley the the most</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.729" end="00:44:41.839" style="s2">important lesson of history is that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.949" end="00:44:49.009" style="s2">absolutely fail to learn the lessons of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.839" end="00:44:49.999" style="s2">history that is like having MLK was not</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.009" end="00:44:52.849" style="s2">a perfect human being</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.999" end="00:44:54.739" style="s2">oh not cuz I know distinct things he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.849" end="00:44:56.299" style="s2">done because he was a human being so</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.739" end="00:45:00.529" style="s2">therefore I know he was not a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.299" end="00:45:02.809" style="s2">human being right but so what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.529" end="00:45:05.390" style="s2">that that to me anyway in my mind has no</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.809" end="00:45:09.650" style="s2">impact on you know what he was about in</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.390" end="00:45:12.259" style="s2">terms of his life and so girlfriend</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.650" end="00:45:15.949" style="s2">whatever you know a way to truly know</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.259" end="00:45:18.799" style="s2">what historical figures did and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.949" end="00:45:21.319" style="s2">do in a way that is as easy as looking</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.799" end="00:45:25.279" style="s2">up on IMDB who starred in something</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.319" end="00:45:26.029" style="s2">right it&#39;s not so that we can have we</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.279" end="00:45:28.549" style="s2">don&#39;t need to have that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.029" end="00:45:30.079" style="s2">every MLK Day it doesn&#39;t need to be well</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.549" end="00:45:31.940" style="s2">he was this and that he was this the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.079" end="00:45:36.140" style="s2">truth is he wasn&#39;t popular when he was</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.940" end="00:45:37.910" style="s2">getting started and alive and is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.140" end="00:45:39.259" style="s2">the truth I just I saw a meme that said</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.910" end="00:45:41.150" style="s2">that yesterday it was like how</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.259" end="00:45:43.579" style="s2">interesting that like even though now</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.150" end="00:45:46.609" style="s2">he&#39;s revered he wasn&#39;t at the time</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.579" end="00:45:48.019" style="s2">because he was earned shut up yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.609" end="00:45:51.229" style="s2">wasn&#39;t he was a little bit I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.019" end="00:45:53.749" style="s2">obviously he was controversial and</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.229" end="00:45:57.589" style="s2">disliked when he was doing all his uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.749" end="00:45:59.359" style="s2">kind of racial equality campaigning but</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.589" end="00:46:01.549" style="s2">but the point is that he actually won</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.359" end="00:46:04.640" style="s2">that victory and then became accepted</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.549" end="00:46:06.650" style="s2">but then became after that became hated</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.640" end="00:46:08.809" style="s2">again and more hated because of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.650" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">economic justice stuff right so it</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.809" end="00:46:13.579" style="s2">became not about race at that point it</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">became about you know poverty and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.579" end="00:46:20.390" style="s2">and then the you know the the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:23.930" style="s2">history of it goes that that&#39;s when he</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.390" end="00:46:24.979" style="s2">became more of an enemy of the state and</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.930" end="00:46:29.229" style="s2">was killed</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.979" end="00:46:32.209" style="s2">I guess if success means everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.229" end="00:46:34.279" style="s2">perfect history everyone knows perfect</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.209" end="00:46:37.249" style="s2">science we&#39;re never going to get there</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.279" end="00:46:39.979" style="s2">we&#39;re not even supposed to get there but</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.249" end="00:46:42.769" style="s2">having access to something that is more</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.979" end="00:46:44.359" style="s2">of a black-white agreed to love like did</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.769" end="00:46:45.829" style="s2">this happen or did it not happen if it</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.359" end="00:46:48.529" style="s2">did happen who did it when did it like</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.829" end="00:46:51.980" style="s2">where did it sit in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.529" end="00:46:54.380" style="s2">history that is create a ball that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.980" end="00:46:55.819" style="s2">something we can create together when we</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.380" end="00:46:59.450" style="s2">don&#39;t have access to it it becomes this</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.819" end="00:47:00.349" style="s2">endless debate of like well did he do</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.450" end="00:47:01.789" style="s2">that did he not do that he was a</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.349" end="00:47:04.789" style="s2">horrible person he was the best person</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.789" end="00:47:05.749" style="s2">and not finding the truth which is like</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.789" end="00:47:07.460" style="s2">he was a human being</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.749" end="00:47:10.599" style="s2">there was good things and bad things and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.460" end="00:47:13.130" style="s2">what did he give us and more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.599" end="00:47:14.809" style="s2">what are we doing with how are we</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.130" end="00:47:17.269" style="s2">learning from that history how are we</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.809" end="00:47:18.829" style="s2">showing up in alive today because I</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.269" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">think we kind of are all cult leaders</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.829" end="00:47:22.039" style="s2">that are following like sorry cult</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.480" end="00:47:24.019" style="s2">followers we&#39;re following these leaders</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.039" end="00:47:25.640" style="s2">I know I have in the past when people</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.019" end="00:47:28.130" style="s2">have fallen from grace it&#39;s like they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.640" end="00:47:29.900" style="s2">just crumble like it&#39;s just like well if</p>

<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:36.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a some amount of truth there</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.599" end="00:47:41.359" style="s2">Bill Cosby&#39;s never coming back</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.950" end="00:47:43.130" style="s2">like there&#39;s no Bill Cosby was an</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:46.609" style="s2">example he is what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.130" end="00:47:49.339" style="s2">right because he&#39;s undeniably abused his</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.609" end="00:47:52.910" style="s2">position of you know celebrity and power</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.339" end="00:47:55.420" style="s2">and so on to to rape women right but at</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.910" end="00:47:57.650" style="s2">the same time he has also done a</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.420" end="00:47:59.630" style="s2">phenomenal number of good things I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.650" end="00:48:01.220" style="s2">he has apparently put thousands of kids</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.630" end="00:48:03.470" style="s2">through college for example through</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.220" end="00:48:05.420" style="s2">various scholarships and awards schemes</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.470" end="00:48:06.950" style="s2">and so on and so on you know he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.420" end="00:48:08.900" style="s2">made the careers of loads of people I</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.950" end="00:48:10.609" style="s2">mean he transformed the image of black</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.900" end="00:48:13.910" style="s2">people in the American consciousness you</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.609" end="00:48:16.069" style="s2">know I mean he&#39;s he did remarkably he</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.910" end="00:48:18.499" style="s2">made remarkable positive contributions</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.069" end="00:48:22.519" style="s2">with his life and I mean I without</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.499" end="00:48:24.799" style="s2">wanting to in any way minimize you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.519" end="00:48:27.769" style="s2">the the horror of the experiences of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.799" end="00:48:29.869" style="s2">women that he&#39;s abused but you do kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.769" end="00:48:31.339" style="s2">of you know you can&#39;t just throw out all</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.869" end="00:48:33.019" style="s2">the good shit he&#39;s done and ylabel in an</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.339" end="00:48:34.099" style="s2">evil person because of the because of</p>

<p begin="00:48:34.099" end="00:48:39.380" style="s2">know it&#39;s just I think it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.230" end="00:48:43.910" style="s2">excellent example of the need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.380" end="00:48:45.349" style="s2">separate the evil that exists in every</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.910" end="00:48:46.880" style="s2">so but single human being from each</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.349" end="00:48:48.710" style="s2">other and learn from the good and profit</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.880" end="00:48:51.650" style="s2">from the good and and and celebrate the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.710" end="00:48:53.930" style="s2">good and and you know condemn and try</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.650" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">and minimize the future attacks of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.930" end="00:48:59.080" style="s2">evil obviously but I also feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:00.790" style="s2">like everything caused me touch us from</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.080" end="00:49:02.680" style="s2">now on is tainted including going back</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.790" end="00:49:04.150" style="s2">it&#39;s tainted like I&#39;m you can&#39;t watch</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.680" end="00:49:06.520" style="s2">The Cosby Show and not know that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.150" end="00:49:07.900" style="s2">he&#39;s who he is now however that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.520" end="00:49:09.370" style="s2">take away from what he&#39;s actually done</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.900" end="00:49:10.930" style="s2">like he put people through school he</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.370" end="00:49:13.570" style="s2">actually put people through school they</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.930" end="00:49:16.210" style="s2">exist with university degrees and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.570" end="00:49:17.740" style="s2">that ripple effect is still in the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.210" end="00:49:19.210" style="s2">having good</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.740" end="00:49:21.460" style="s2">you&#39;re not taking back their degrees</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.210" end="00:49:22.900" style="s2">right we&#39;re taking back his well you</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.460" end="00:49:26.320" style="s2">don&#39;t I mean like his degree but like</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.900" end="00:49:27.850" style="s2">his right sorry and all the other stars</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.320" end="00:49:28.960" style="s2">at The Cosby Show now you don&#39;t I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.850" end="00:49:30.280" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna get the royalties</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.960" end="00:49:31.870" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna get because no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.280" end="00:49:33.850" style="s2">gonna watch it or at least way less</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.870" end="00:49:35.530" style="s2">people are gonna watch it there&#39;s a cost</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.850" end="00:49:37.990" style="s2">to that and it&#39;s rippling back through</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.530" end="00:49:39.700" style="s2">time in a way that maybe is a little</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.990" end="00:49:41.410" style="s2">unfair not with Cosby but with some of</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.700" end="00:49:43.420" style="s2">them but it&#39;s like wait we were all like</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.410" end="00:49:45.400" style="s2">we didn&#39;t know about Cosby we knew about</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.420" end="00:49:46.900" style="s2">the lot of the other ones and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.400" end="00:49:48.520" style="s2">looking back and being like well we you</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.900" end="00:49:49.990" style="s2">should have known and how dare you we</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.520" end="00:49:50.950" style="s2">were there we were physically present</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.990" end="00:49:54.070" style="s2">while it was happening</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.950" end="00:49:56.170" style="s2">we had movies designed around these</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.070" end="00:49:57.700" style="s2">themes and nobody boycotted them nobody</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.170" end="00:49:59.530" style="s2">was like gee this isn&#39;t how we should</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.700" end="00:50:02.260" style="s2">treat women and minorities we were all</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.530" end="00:50:06.820" style="s2">complicit in it and so there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.260" end="00:50:08.740" style="s2">amount of like I don&#39;t know like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.820" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">seeing ourselves in the reflection of</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.740" end="00:50:14.140" style="s2">history and we&#39;re like reacting to that</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.720" end="00:50:16.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like well yeah this is everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.140" end="00:50:18.250" style="s2">be as well as we are now like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.180" end="00:50:21.190" style="s2">how that works this is sort of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.250" end="00:50:23.530" style="s2">getting at to is like you know as we all</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.190" end="00:50:26.050" style="s2">grow up kind of together regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.530" end="00:50:28.060" style="s2">what age we&#39;re at and as history marches</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.050" end="00:50:31.270" style="s2">on and as the internet you know puts</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.060" end="00:50:35.520" style="s2">more of it online and mm-hmm we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.270" end="00:50:38.950" style="s2">this huge opportunity and imperative to</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.520" end="00:50:40.690" style="s2">you know collectively learn from from</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.950" end="00:50:42.820" style="s2">these cultural failures you know like</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.690" end="00:50:45.640" style="s2">the like the Cosby case is a personal</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.820" end="00:50:48.550" style="s2">and sort of systemic failure but it also</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.640" end="00:50:50.770" style="s2">gives the audience a Jag a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.550" end="00:50:56.320" style="s2">reflect on that failure and on their own</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.770" end="00:50:58.270" style="s2">failures you know for I mean I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.320" end="00:51:02.500" style="s2">to say like the failure of not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.270" end="00:51:05.560" style="s2">better but how would we know right but</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.500" end="00:51:07.690" style="s2">just the the collective failure and</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.560" end="00:51:09.820" style="s2">lesson that we that we haven&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.690" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">news is interesting in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.820" end="00:51:14.890" style="s2">because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:17.920" style="s2">always bad news and there&#39;s always some</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.890" end="00:51:19.510" style="s2">narrative about you know things going</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:21.070" style="s2">wrong and there&#39;s so you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.510" end="00:51:23.020" style="s2">always a chance to learn and like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.070" end="00:51:25.270" style="s2">interesting with the Iraq war right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.020" end="00:51:26.740" style="s2">like so what do we what did we learn</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.270" end="00:51:28.480" style="s2">from the failure of that well it&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.740" end="00:51:31.990" style="s2">a long time it&#39;s taken you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.480" end="00:51:34.710" style="s2">seventeen years for for more of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.990" end="00:51:38.950" style="s2">consensus to be built that it was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.710" end="00:51:41.290" style="s2">some people still no don&#39;t don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.950" end="00:51:43.480" style="s2">it was wrong but you get what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.290" end="00:51:45.640" style="s2">getting at here is you know how much</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.480" end="00:51:47.320" style="s2">time it takes for us to learn our</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.640" end="00:51:49.800" style="s2">collective failures and what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.320" end="00:51:49.800" style="s2">about it right now</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.980" end="00:51:54.910" style="s2">mm-hmm maybe that is learning from</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.360" end="00:52:05.230" style="s2">better collectively together so what</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.880" end="00:52:07.110" style="s2">does that look like without leaving it</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.230" end="00:52:12.970" style="s2">up leaving it up to our cult leaders</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.110" end="00:52:16.300" style="s2">what are they gonna do no no that was</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.970" end="00:52:19.270" style="s2">just I&#39;m done know that the Iraq war is</p>

<p begin="00:52:20.380" end="00:52:23.920" style="s2">because I mean the American and British</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.690" end="00:52:25.270" style="s2">governments lied extensively about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.920" end="00:52:26.980" style="s2">whole weapons of mass destruction thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.270" end="00:52:28.480" style="s2">right you know and we all know that now</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.980" end="00:52:30.610" style="s2">but we knew it at the time right there</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:33.280" style="s2">are reporters reporting this at the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.610" end="00:52:36.900" style="s2">and you know the majority of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.280" end="00:52:39.070" style="s2">population still bought into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.900" end="00:52:41.140" style="s2">official weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.070" end="00:52:42.700" style="s2">narrative right even though there were</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.140" end="00:52:44.440" style="s2">plenty of voices at the time saying is</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.700" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">bullshit it&#39;s been sexed up it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.440" end="00:52:50.470" style="s2">know there is no intelligence to ground</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.680" end="00:52:51.880" style="s2">this in reality and it&#39;s not like this</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.470" end="00:52:52.900" style="s2">is the first thing it&#39;s not that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.880" end="00:52:54.250" style="s2">first time it&#39;s just happened has</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.900" end="00:52:56.200" style="s2">happened many many times before I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.250" end="00:52:58.420" style="s2">there are documents now which show that</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.200" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">Pearl Harbor was encouraged and known</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.420" end="00:53:01.510" style="s2">about in advance that the Gulf of Tonkin</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:03.460" style="s2">incident didn&#39;t happen that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.510" end="00:53:05.860" style="s2">Lusitania was an admiralty ship with</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.460" end="00:53:07.750" style="s2">guns beneath the terrace you know that</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.860" end="00:53:09.610" style="s2">all of this stuff now which was at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.750" end="00:53:11.530" style="s2">time using them they were attacked</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.610" end="00:53:14.140" style="s2">civilians all they&#39;ve bombed one of our</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.530" end="00:53:15.700" style="s2">ships you know with no provocation so</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.140" end="00:53:18.490" style="s2">these lies have been told in the past</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.700" end="00:53:20.230" style="s2">and we were told these lies again and we</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.490" end="00:53:23.170" style="s2">went to war again and nothing was</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.230" end="00:53:24.220" style="s2">different so it would be nice to think</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.170" end="00:53:26.230" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.220" end="00:53:27.900" style="s2">that&#39;s a really really really recent</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.230" end="00:53:30.430" style="s2">example of how we were blatantly</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.900" end="00:53:32.619" style="s2">blatantly lie - it just went ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.430" end="00:53:35.080" style="s2">17 years later we&#39;re still arguing about</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.619" end="00:53:36.430" style="s2">well there are still some people arguing</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.080" end="00:53:37.080" style="s2">about whether it was right or wrong do</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.430" end="00:53:39.790" style="s2">you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.080" end="00:53:42.609" style="s2">yeah I think what&#39;s interesting here</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.790" end="00:53:44.619" style="s2">actually is you know you just helped me</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.609" end="00:53:47.880" style="s2">realize that that the neo-cons</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.619" end="00:53:51.490" style="s2">that planned and executed the war</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.880" end="00:53:55.090" style="s2">probably think that they succeeded still</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.490" end="00:53:56.590" style="s2">and maybe in their terms they did right</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.090" end="00:54:00.760" style="s2">there&#39;s this there&#39;s this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.590" end="00:54:03.340" style="s2">bullshit not know yeah like I&#39;m yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.760" end="00:54:05.320" style="s2">gonna I&#39;m gonna have to to speculate a</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.340" end="00:54:08.470" style="s2">little bit about you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.320" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">honesty and intentions of of that of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.470" end="00:54:12.580" style="s2">Iraq war but let&#39;s just say for example</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:14.260" style="s2">that all the liars about WMDs knew they</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.580" end="00:54:16.810" style="s2">were lying right you&#39;re not just going</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.260" end="00:54:19.119" style="s2">on with it but they knew and that so in</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.810" end="00:54:21.340" style="s2">that sense they didn&#39;t fail to know the</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.119" end="00:54:24.450" style="s2">truth because they knew the truth they</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.340" end="00:54:26.560" style="s2">succeeded in you know selling the lie</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.450" end="00:54:29.260" style="s2">right so from their perspective they</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.560" end="00:54:31.510" style="s2">were successful because you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.260" end="00:54:33.040" style="s2">so when I when I say speculative it also</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.510" end="00:54:35.109" style="s2">gets into the territory of you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.040" end="00:54:37.750" style="s2">foreign policy in geopolitics and we</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.109" end="00:54:41.099" style="s2">don&#39;t have all of the information there</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.750" end="00:54:43.480" style="s2">right so you know neo cons and realists</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.099" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">would make the argument that oh well if</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.480" end="00:54:47.920" style="s2">we didn&#39;t go into Iraq the the Middle</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:50.140" style="s2">East would have destabilized further and</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.920" end="00:54:50.770" style="s2">that would have been you know terrorism</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.140" end="00:54:53.109" style="s2">and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.770" end="00:54:55.480" style="s2">we just don&#39;t know we can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.109" end="00:54:57.310" style="s2">know what would have happened if the</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.480" end="00:54:59.609" style="s2">Iraq war didn&#39;t happen and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.310" end="00:55:01.630" style="s2">the neo cons can retain the power</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.609" end="00:55:04.750" style="s2">because they had so much power and</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.630" end="00:55:07.000" style="s2">control over you know selling the lies</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.750" end="00:55:09.910" style="s2">and and carrying out the war that</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.000" end="00:55:11.950" style="s2">they&#39;ve almost made it so they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.910" end="00:55:14.890" style="s2">fail it&#39;s kind of this too big to fail</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.950" end="00:55:16.800" style="s2">idea you know and that&#39;s that&#39;s again to</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.890" end="00:55:19.990" style="s2">come back to what we&#39;re culturally</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.800" end="00:55:22.660" style="s2">collectively trying to reckon with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.990" end="00:55:25.180" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s those people that are too</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.660" end="00:55:26.980" style="s2">big to fail and that are making these</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.180" end="00:55:29.140" style="s2">executive decisions they get lots of</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.980" end="00:55:32.290" style="s2">innocent people killed ostensibly</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.140" end="00:55:35.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s for the greater good but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.290" end="00:55:36.790" style="s2">think is a society but and also gets</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.200" end="00:55:37.660" style="s2">redefined whenever they fucking like</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.790" end="00:55:39.609" style="s2">what dispenser</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.660" end="00:55:42.549" style="s2">but what success and failure actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.609" end="00:55:45.970" style="s2">look like right what it is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.549" end="00:55:49.569" style="s2">exactly so we we need to take a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.970" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">meta perspective on on their hegemony</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.569" end="00:55:54.539" style="s2">over what success and failure means in</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.240" end="00:55:57.220" style="s2">the world because I think as</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.539" end="00:56:00.640" style="s2">progressives we want mm-hmm we want uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.220" end="00:56:03.220" style="s2">you know success is no war and and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.640" end="00:56:04.990" style="s2">addressing all the the problems whether</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.220" end="00:56:07.329" style="s2">its resources or religious</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.990" end="00:56:10.150" style="s2">fundamentalism or whatever that lead to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.329" end="00:56:13.839" style="s2">war we want to be able to address those</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.150" end="00:56:17.559" style="s2">with other means that aren&#39;t appeasement</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.839" end="00:56:20.170" style="s2">that aren&#39;t pacifism but aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.559" end="00:56:24.369" style="s2">militaries army either you know we need</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.170" end="00:56:26.260" style="s2">to we need to work work with people yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.369" end="00:56:28.240" style="s2">I think there are solutions that know</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.260" end="00:56:30.339" style="s2">that we can come to that aren&#39;t leaving</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.240" end="00:56:32.799" style="s2">it up to our cult leaders ie politicians</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.339" end="00:56:34.030" style="s2">and CEOs and things that are like they</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.799" end="00:56:35.020" style="s2">have more power so they should be the</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.030" end="00:56:37.660" style="s2">ones dealing with it</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.020" end="00:56:39.730" style="s2">we can deal with it in a way that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.660" end="00:56:42.250" style="s2">okay well we can&#39;t go back and undo the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.730" end="00:56:44.049" style="s2">Iraq war but we can look to the future</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.250" end="00:56:45.430" style="s2">of like when something happens like</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.049" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with Iran what happened</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.430" end="00:56:50.980" style="s2">with the plane what happened what</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:54.190" style="s2">happened is a different thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.980" end="00:56:56.349" style="s2">what I mean we know a plane God fell out</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.190" end="00:56:59.859" style="s2">of the sky and people died or actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.349" end="00:57:02.200" style="s2">do we know that how do we know that and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.859" end="00:57:03.880" style="s2">then but then from there like why did it</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.200" end="00:57:06.460" style="s2">happen and who is responsible for it and</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.880" end="00:57:08.920" style="s2">at no point in time are the Iranian</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.460" end="00:57:10.420" style="s2">people responsible for it so my rating</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.920" end="00:57:12.730" style="s2">people might be right the government</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.420" end="00:57:15.940" style="s2">might be Trump and his administration</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.730" end="00:57:17.559" style="s2">might be but the people aren&#39;t and so to</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.940" end="00:57:19.839" style="s2">be able to say well why did this happen</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.559" end="00:57:23.200" style="s2">and be able to actually follow that line</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.839" end="00:57:24.700" style="s2">like the life of MLK like what happened</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.200" end="00:57:27.010" style="s2">and yes there&#39;ll be great area of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.700" end="00:57:28.960" style="s2">well we don&#39;t know the Israeli idea of</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.010" end="00:57:33.339" style="s2">the history versus the Palestinian idea</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.960" end="00:57:35.289" style="s2">of history is conflicting at the same</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.339" end="00:57:36.940" style="s2">time they&#39;re events they agree on they</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.289" end="00:57:39.789" style="s2">might not have agree why they happens</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.940" end="00:57:41.710" style="s2">that they agree they happens and so to</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.789" end="00:57:44.170" style="s2">have that like what happens and how do</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.710" end="00:57:45.730" style="s2">we know that&#39;s what happens and what how</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.170" end="00:57:47.950" style="s2">much of this can we agree on and how</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.730" end="00:57:48.940" style="s2">much of it is is gray area right like we</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.950" end="00:57:50.829" style="s2">know a plane fell from the sky</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.940" end="00:57:51.520" style="s2">theoretically we don&#39;t necessarily know</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.829" end="00:57:53.410" style="s2">was it bomb</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.520" end="00:57:55.570" style="s2">you know was it train malfunction and we</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.410" end="00:57:58.150" style="s2">know more now but also watch it unfold</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.570" end="00:58:07.510" style="s2">and watch what is the moment of truth</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.150" end="00:58:10.060" style="s2">now and I did see a video of it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.510" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">we at the end of the day we still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.060" end="00:58:15.400" style="s2">know like you&#39;re saying but I saw a</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:17.770" style="s2">video of uh you know as a rocket or</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.400" end="00:58:20.050" style="s2">missile or whatever you you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.770" end="00:58:21.869" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a nighttime very far away</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.050" end="00:58:24.160" style="s2">videos all you see is a little light</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.869" end="00:58:26.140" style="s2">going into another light and then it</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.160" end="00:58:30.700" style="s2">exploding right but I saw the the video</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.140" end="00:58:35.560" style="s2">of ostensibly what what happened is you</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.700" end="00:58:42.490" style="s2">know that&#39;s that&#39;s the official story</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.560" end="00:58:43.990" style="s2">exactly pretty obscene to see it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.490" end="00:58:45.970" style="s2">you see this rocket going to a</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.990" end="00:58:47.230" style="s2">commercial plane and then boom and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.970" end="00:58:51.670" style="s2">a ball of fire in the air and</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.230" end="00:58:53.170" style="s2">everybody&#39;s dead like it&#39;s I mean we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.670" end="00:58:55.330" style="s2">believe the official story that it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.170" end="00:58:57.280" style="s2">an accident but that doesn&#39;t give me any</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.330" end="00:59:00.190" style="s2">comfort that&#39;s pretty disturbing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.280" end="00:59:02.920" style="s2">like get your fucking fingers off of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.190" end="00:59:05.050" style="s2">buttons or whatever it is and you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.920" end="00:59:10.240" style="s2">like like like decommission these</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.050" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">weapons I know it&#39;s people responsible</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.240" end="00:59:13.840" style="s2">actually responsible and these things</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.920" end="00:59:15.160" style="s2">happen when someone&#39;s saying hey there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.840" end="00:59:17.800" style="s2">weapons of mass destruction in this</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.160" end="00:59:19.869" style="s2">country if we don&#39;t go in and hurt their</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.800" end="00:59:22.210" style="s2">I mean do give them freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.869" end="00:59:23.740" style="s2">democracy we&#39;re going to pay the price</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.210" end="00:59:25.210" style="s2">okay well how do we know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.740" end="00:59:26.950" style="s2">weapons of mass destruction give us the</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.210" end="00:59:29.760" style="s2">freaking evidence and if there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.950" end="00:59:31.990" style="s2">what are you willing to put on the line</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.760" end="00:59:40.930" style="s2">your are you going to go to jail if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.990" end="00:59:42.460" style="s2">a lie yeah you&#39;re gonna find out what</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.930" end="00:59:43.990" style="s2">price are you gonna pay if you go to</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.460" end="00:59:45.280" style="s2">find there wasn&#39;t anything in the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.990" end="00:59:49.480" style="s2">yeah I like that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.280" end="00:59:51.070" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s a good point to close out</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.480" end="00:59:53.619" style="s2">and to because we&#39;re at a time but</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.070" end="00:59:55.960" style="s2">basically just the idea that like I said</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.619" end="00:59:57.730" style="s2">these neo Cotton&#39;s like like wolf woods</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.960" end="00:59:59.080" style="s2">and Rumsfeld and stuff they knew that</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.730" end="01:00:00.730" style="s2">they were what they were doing was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.080" end="01:00:04.359" style="s2">and that they would you know likely</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.730" end="01:00:05.330" style="s2">succeed on their own terms but none of</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.359" end="01:00:08.180" style="s2">that was carried out</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.330" end="01:00:10.040" style="s2">in a context where their failures would</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.180" end="01:00:12.310" style="s2">have consequences for them and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.040" end="01:00:20.180" style="s2">that&#39;s precisely the point</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.310" end="01:00:23.140" style="s2">absolutely absolutely is because there</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.180" end="01:00:25.580" style="s2">are consequences to fellows often anyway</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.140" end="01:00:28.040" style="s2">exactly and if you&#39;re if you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.580" end="01:00:30.290" style="s2">elite those consequences can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.040" end="01:00:33.500" style="s2">neutralized or mitigated and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.290" end="01:00:35.330" style="s2">not fair yeah yeah I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.500" end="01:00:38.630" style="s2">they&#39;re failures have catastrophic</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.330" end="01:00:41.290" style="s2">cascading effects for hours like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.630" end="01:00:43.970" style="s2">a certain amount</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.290" end="01:00:45.470" style="s2">personal failures and learn from them</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.970" end="01:00:47.150" style="s2">and grow and were allowed to make</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.470" end="01:00:49.580" style="s2">collective failures and learn from them</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.150" end="01:00:52.100" style="s2">and grow but individual failures that</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.580" end="01:00:53.240" style="s2">have horrific implications we need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.100" end="01:00:55.100" style="s2">deal with them before they even happen</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.240" end="01:00:56.330" style="s2">we need to look at yard there weapons of</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.100" end="01:00:58.130" style="s2">mass destruction how do you know you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.330" end="01:01:00.800" style="s2">have an inkling sorry that&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.130" end="01:01:02.180" style="s2">to go to war with actual evidence okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.800" end="01:01:04.340" style="s2">and then what happens if that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.180" end="01:01:06.440" style="s2">what happens if you faked that I like</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.340" end="01:01:11.000" style="s2">what are the actual implications before</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.440" end="01:01:13.210" style="s2">it ever happens um yeah I guess that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.000" end="01:01:15.050" style="s2">you can say goodbye to YouTube and</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.210" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">discuss what we want to discuss next</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.050" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">week on YouTube</p>
