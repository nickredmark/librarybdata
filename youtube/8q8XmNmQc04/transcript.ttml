<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:07.080" style="s2">so we we want to start with your</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.920" end="00:00:11.940" style="s2">question on transcendence and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.080" end="00:00:14.089" style="s2">to allow my running need to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.940" end="00:00:17.220" style="s2">non orden interest in non-ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.089" end="00:00:19.439" style="s2">experiences to inform how our</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.220" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">conversation on transcendence how&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:26.039" style="s2">sound that sounds fine I would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:28.019" style="s2">that we set that as it I would it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.039" end="00:00:30.300" style="s2">better to me to set that as an intention</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.019" end="00:00:32.730" style="s2">and then stay in open space together</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.300" end="00:00:34.910" style="s2">because when we said when we did that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.730" end="00:00:39.000" style="s2">last time our conversation was like</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.910" end="00:00:41.820" style="s2">novel and buoyant and fun and yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.000" end="00:00:45.000" style="s2">was more of a sense of co-creation than</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.820" end="00:00:47.730" style="s2">before yeah I&#39;m we won&#39;t have we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.000" end="00:00:51.719" style="s2">de force the direction but I&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.730" end="00:00:54.120" style="s2">every time now talking to you there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.719" end="00:00:55.530" style="s2">little voice in my head about I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.120" end="00:00:58.500" style="s2">even know what the question is but this</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.530" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">disinterest in it in it so we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.500" end="00:01:07.489" style="s2">we&#39;ll see what&#39;s up yeah that&#39;s great ok</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:07.489" style="s2">so my my feeling about transcendence is</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.299" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">that I sometimes don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.500" end="00:01:20.280" style="s2">word means especially when spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:22.290" style="s2">teachers use it and I think I used to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.280" end="00:01:23.640" style="s2">know what the word meant or used to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.290" end="00:01:25.979" style="s2">think that I knew what the word meant</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.640" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">and in the past had experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.979" end="00:01:32.100" style="s2">would make more sense to call</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:34.890" style="s2">transcendent but more and more over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.100" end="00:01:37.350" style="s2">last couple years especially under the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.890" end="00:01:44.090" style="s2">influence of waking down and mutuality</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.350" end="00:01:49.619" style="s2">transmission and teachers I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.090" end="00:01:55.350" style="s2">somehow trance transcendence as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.619" end="00:02:01.880" style="s2">descriptor of a reality which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.350" end="00:02:01.880" style="s2">conceived of as more basic or truer</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.590" end="00:02:11.650" style="s2">perhaps even as more contextual doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.050" end="00:02:14.829" style="s2">really make sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.650" end="00:02:20.349" style="s2">and in a feeling way I fall further</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.829" end="00:02:24.750" style="s2">towards a very paradoxical why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.349" end="00:02:28.329" style="s2">difficult but very very doc sickle</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.750" end="00:02:33.269" style="s2">innate or not innate but like kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.329" end="00:02:37.540" style="s2">my heart sensing of some subtle kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.269" end="00:02:40.659" style="s2">the non separateness between context and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.540" end="00:02:47.129" style="s2">content being so profound that context</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.659" end="00:02:50.019" style="s2">itself is no longer highlighted as even</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.129" end="00:02:57.069" style="s2">truer or made more basic or something</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.019" end="00:03:03.010" style="s2">like that so I&#39;m not I sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.069" end="00:03:04.959" style="s2">emphasis on like on reality like a true</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.010" end="00:03:07.060" style="s2">reality or more important to a more</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.959" end="00:03:09.540" style="s2">valuable reality or more valuable</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.060" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">perspective or experience being one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.540" end="00:03:16.629" style="s2">for example feeling like life and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:19.060" style="s2">everything is moving within something</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.629" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">that isn&#39;t moving and you are that thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.060" end="00:03:27.730" style="s2">that isn&#39;t moving or whatever that feels</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:31.829" style="s2">like a limit or sometimes I think of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.730" end="00:03:34.510" style="s2">as a stage and then there&#39;s a beyond</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.829" end="00:03:36.069" style="s2">that that isn&#39;t beyond because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.510" end="00:03:37.810" style="s2">metaphor of transcendent isn&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.069" end="00:03:40.870" style="s2">for me anymore for me it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.810" end="00:03:43.659" style="s2">falling in we&#39;re all experiences even</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.870" end="00:03:46.359" style="s2">absolute experiences this is how I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.659" end="00:03:47.979" style="s2">been unhelpful it&#39;s all experiences have</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.359" end="00:03:50.319" style="s2">been relativized even absolute</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.979" end="00:03:53.949" style="s2">experiences there&#39;s only transition and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.319" end="00:03:56.139" style="s2">change in in the sense that they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.949" end="00:04:01.780" style="s2">originals have the same source which I</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.139" end="00:04:05.019" style="s2">call the heart and the end and context</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.780" end="00:04:07.540" style="s2">and content art both fused and inter</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.019" end="00:04:09.549" style="s2">penetrative and can give windows on each</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.540" end="00:04:12.519" style="s2">other and temporary and all this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.549" end="00:04:14.859" style="s2">things so there&#39;s no I don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.519" end="00:04:16.299" style="s2">what it would mean to and it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.859" end="00:04:19.659" style="s2">changing and there&#39;s always opening up</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.299" end="00:04:21.310" style="s2">to more more everything everything is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.659" end="00:04:24.039" style="s2">infinite everything is infinite</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.310" end="00:04:25.600" style="s2">including the finite and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.039" end="00:04:28.180" style="s2">infinite is finite it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.600" end="00:04:30.130" style="s2">as well so I&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.180" end="00:04:32.500" style="s2">transcendence means anymore and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.130" end="00:04:35.890" style="s2">sure whether emphasizing it spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.500" end="00:04:39.430" style="s2">teachers emphasizing it is altogether as</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.890" end="00:04:42.340" style="s2">helpful as I think it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.430" end="00:04:45.390" style="s2">instrumentally helpful utilitarian and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.340" end="00:04:47.350" style="s2">then utilitarian sense and not true or</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.390" end="00:04:51.010" style="s2">absolutely helpful or something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.350" end="00:04:54.450" style="s2">that so but I don&#39;t get the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.010" end="00:04:57.670" style="s2">many people think or talk this way and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.450" end="00:04:59.260" style="s2">it leaves me wondering whether I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.670" end="00:05:01.780" style="s2">missing something or what this</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.260" end="00:05:11.100" style="s2">transcendence is that spiritual teachers</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.780" end="00:05:13.810" style="s2">are referring to yeah so I think your</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.100" end="00:05:19.650" style="s2">intuition or you&#39;re feeling sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.810" end="00:05:24.520" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking around is real and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.650" end="00:05:31.060" style="s2">the one of the quotes out so that one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.520" end="00:05:34.390" style="s2">the questions is you know can we create</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.060" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">a language or two or a framework to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.390" end="00:05:39.160" style="s2">better articulate what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:42.610" style="s2">say so then I can start to make some</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.160" end="00:05:48.550" style="s2">distinctions you know so that that would</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.610" end="00:05:51.880" style="s2">be important and so we&#39;ll just I want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.550" end="00:05:55.590" style="s2">just start easy and simple and then we</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.880" end="00:06:00.670" style="s2">can try to grow this into something more</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.590" end="00:06:02.590" style="s2">complex but you know so the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.670" end="00:06:04.840" style="s2">I wrote down when you said that this</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.590" end="00:06:08.440" style="s2">easy thing is this concept of when</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:09.790" style="s2">people use the term transcendence I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.440" end="00:06:12.580" style="s2">not saying you&#39;re doing this we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.790" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">to start just talking about the common</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.580" end="00:06:17.080" style="s2">ways that people work with this notion</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.280" end="00:06:19.660" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll get out to that edge</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.080" end="00:06:20.680" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about right so that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.660" end="00:06:24.070" style="s2">can figure out what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.680" end="00:06:26.400" style="s2">so one of the ways people use that is in</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.070" end="00:06:28.990" style="s2">terms they have like they&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.400" end="00:06:33.000" style="s2">setting up some kind of spatialized</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.990" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">metaphor right so transcendent is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.000" end="00:06:37.330" style="s2">farther from something and closer to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:39.330" style="s2">something right so people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.330" end="00:06:44.920" style="s2">that transcend</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.330" end="00:06:47.050" style="s2">God the Creator is farther away somehow</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.920" end="00:06:53.980" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of spatial metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.050" end="00:07:00.310" style="s2">that&#39;s being enacted so if so if i have</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.980" end="00:07:03.220" style="s2">a non-ordinary experience and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.310" end="00:07:04.860" style="s2">says that&#39;s transcendent you know uses</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.220" end="00:07:10.030" style="s2">that term the site transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.860" end="00:07:12.070" style="s2">experience then the overtone in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.030" end="00:07:15.730" style="s2">spatial category somehow that&#39;s closer</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.070" end="00:07:18.550" style="s2">to God right yeah and I&#39;m hearing you</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.730" end="00:07:22.780" style="s2">saying that you disagree with this or</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.550" end="00:07:24.820" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t seem to be the case or you</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.780" end="00:07:27.550" style="s2">reject that I mean I rejected too you</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.820" end="00:07:30.490" style="s2">know so i will say yeah i mean you could</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.550" end="00:07:35.020" style="s2">categorize that as a transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.490" end="00:07:37.860" style="s2">experience but it&#39;s not closer or</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.020" end="00:07:41.920" style="s2">further to God you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.860" end="00:07:44.680" style="s2">disentangle this the spatial metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.920" end="00:07:46.270" style="s2">from it now some people that is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.680" end="00:07:50.350" style="s2">overtone that they&#39;re using when they</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.270" end="00:07:53.430" style="s2">use that term a transcendent truth is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.350" end="00:08:00.420" style="s2">somehow closer to the real truth than a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.430" end="00:08:05.770" style="s2">relative truth you know so so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.420" end="00:08:11.190" style="s2">use of the word that can create some</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.770" end="00:08:11.190" style="s2">problematic aspects of spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:27.530" style="s2">so the other thing that is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.080" end="00:08:29.870" style="s2">experiential I think aspect of the term</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.530" end="00:08:31.970" style="s2">transcendent transcend I&#39;m going to keep</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.870" end="00:08:34.099" style="s2">talking until you you formulate</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.970" end="00:08:38.270" style="s2">something that really catches what your</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.099" end="00:08:41.260" style="s2">question is okay I mean is the at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.270" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">ability for the self to create multiple</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.260" end="00:08:48.740" style="s2">recursive witnesses right this is a</p>

<p begin="00:09:05.960" end="00:09:13.280" style="s2">self-reflection and Julian Jane&#39;s talks</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.950" end="00:09:16.810" style="s2">about it the transitional phase when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.280" end="00:09:22.220" style="s2">read homers first book The Iliad those</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.810" end="00:09:25.490" style="s2">that viewpoint was associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.220" end="00:09:29.540" style="s2">gods these demigods and then by the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.490" end="00:09:35.450" style="s2">you get to the Odyssey that viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.540" end="00:09:38.270" style="s2">was recognized as a human capacity so so</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.450" end="00:09:41.030" style="s2">his argument is right around then this</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.270" end="00:09:43.600" style="s2">capacity have people with so you know I</p>

<p begin="00:09:43.600" end="00:09:50.120" style="s2">have so many notes the hall of mirrors</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.660" end="00:09:55.730" style="s2">you tell people get there there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.120" end="00:10:00.200" style="s2">many layers of you know and and each one</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.730" end="00:10:03.740" style="s2">of those is considered transcendent to</p>

<p begin="00:10:12.070" end="00:10:22.339" style="s2">transcend and can see all others ok so</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:25.620" style="s2">so that term transcendence has to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.339" end="00:10:31.200" style="s2">with this ability of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.620" end="00:10:36.330" style="s2">mind to create these gaps between</p>

<p begin="00:10:36.330" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">let&#39;s say one level of recursion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.910" end="00:10:47.640" style="s2">relatively ordinary experience at</p>

<p begin="00:10:47.640" end="00:10:54.480" style="s2">modern Western education and that a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.400" end="00:10:56.880" style="s2">higher level experience you have people</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.480" end="00:10:59.610" style="s2">that go through let&#39;s say psychodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.880" end="00:11:02.279" style="s2">therapy or the spiritual traditions</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.610" end="00:11:04.830" style="s2">where you start really getting very</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.279" end="00:11:08.760" style="s2">recursive making object out of</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.830" end="00:11:10.830" style="s2">everything and then the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.760" end="00:11:15.570" style="s2">traditions will hypothesize this</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.830" end="00:11:17.700" style="s2">ultimate witness and different spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.570" end="00:11:21.060" style="s2">dish traditions do different things with</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.700" end="00:11:27.529" style="s2">that so some spiritual traditions will</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.060" end="00:11:27.529" style="s2">talk about that as the ultimate I am</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.730" end="00:11:37.410" style="s2">Wilbur actually talks about the witness</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.990" end="00:11:43.500" style="s2">is the last barrier toward yep one taste</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.410" end="00:11:46.110" style="s2">right so labor so now that&#39;s another way</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.500" end="00:11:49.290" style="s2">of looking at that go ahead well I</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.110" end="00:11:50.910" style="s2">haven&#39;t it that I was just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.290" end="00:11:53.130" style="s2">about that last night I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.910" end="00:11:54.510" style="s2">question is I&#39;m bringing up this</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.130" end="00:11:56.339" style="s2">question now because I was reading some</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.510" end="00:12:00.209" style="s2">Wilbur last night and thinking of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.339" end="00:12:07.200" style="s2">and watch bunch of Thomas who will this</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.209" end="00:12:09.779" style="s2">morning interviews with him and so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.200" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">question is sparked by that and I have</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.779" end="00:12:14.520" style="s2">clarified the reason I wanted to ask the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:18.990" style="s2">question was mostly just because I feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.520" end="00:12:24.450" style="s2">differently but i doubt it and wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.990" end="00:12:26.310" style="s2">know what you thought well I in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.450" end="00:12:29.610" style="s2">that like for example if we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.310" end="00:12:31.380" style="s2">Wilbur&#39;s thing I was reflecting that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.610" end="00:12:36.860" style="s2">actually glad that I went through a</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.380" end="00:12:36.860" style="s2">process of emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.780" end="00:12:44.900" style="s2">went through a period of stable e</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.010" end="00:12:49.690" style="s2">emphasizing having emphasized it being</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.900" end="00:12:52.760" style="s2">an experience of the witness because the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.690" end="00:12:54.980" style="s2">after that the clarity and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.760" end="00:12:59.180" style="s2">perspective that came from it was still</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.980" end="00:13:02.450" style="s2">there but for example on waking down</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.180" end="00:13:06.440" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of a I think it&#39;s at least a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.450" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">theme amongst many students certainly</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.440" end="00:13:16.280" style="s2">not everyone that they kind of fall into</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:19.520" style="s2">for this paradoxical mmm relative is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.280" end="00:13:21.670" style="s2">shin of all experience including witness</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.520" end="00:13:25.280" style="s2">experiences or absolute experiences are</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.670" end="00:13:28.210" style="s2">enlightened states and stages but</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.280" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">without having gone through a period of</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.210" end="00:13:35.330" style="s2">radical clarification of the object</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:39.110" style="s2">nature of all experiences and then they</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.330" end="00:13:42.440" style="s2">don&#39;t have that confidence and clarity</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.110" end="00:13:45.410" style="s2">that comes from it and so again in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.440" end="00:13:49.580" style="s2">sense I that still strengthens my my</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.410" end="00:13:53.150" style="s2">argument that the wit that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.580" end="00:13:55.340" style="s2">that transcendent experiences of many</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.150" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">different flavors I really think are you</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.340" end="00:14:01.760" style="s2">are tools they&#39;re actually just they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:06.170" style="s2">just tools not ends in themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.760" end="00:14:11.900" style="s2">that and it&#39;s an and resting one&#39;s hat</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.170" end="00:14:18.050" style="s2">there for any reason any reason at all</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.900" end="00:14:25.090" style="s2">is is it&#39;s more than just silly it</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.050" end="00:14:29.900" style="s2">actually feels untrue and a little bit a</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.090" end="00:14:32.680" style="s2">little bit immature and a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.900" end="00:14:32.680" style="s2">also not</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.990" end="00:14:48.390" style="s2">not it feels like a view based on that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.690" end="00:14:53.160" style="s2">even a realization authentic realization</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.390" end="00:14:55.290" style="s2">can somehow miss people who are in there</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.160" end="00:14:57.990" style="s2">all right that&#39;s hard to describe for me</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.290" end="00:15:03.060" style="s2">but like Miss people who are living a</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.990" end="00:15:04.680" style="s2">more paradoxical sort of non special</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.060" end="00:15:08.610" style="s2">experience non not an ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.680" end="00:15:10.140" style="s2">experience and yet they are at the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.610" end="00:15:12.450" style="s2">time it just doesn&#39;t show up as</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.140" end="00:15:14.220" style="s2">emphasizing the absolute for example or</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.450" end="00:15:16.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t show up as emphasizing the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.220" end="00:15:20.670" style="s2">experiences being that which all things</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.740" end="00:15:22.980" style="s2">move through cetera so I don&#39;t really I</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.670" end="00:15:25.890" style="s2">I would love to you know hear thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.980" end="00:15:28.050" style="s2">and yeah what what just we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.890" end="00:15:30.600" style="s2">talking around so so what that made me</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.050" end="00:15:33.510" style="s2">think of is it you know when you say</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.600" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">immature or something I think the word I</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.510" end="00:15:40.260" style="s2">would use is there&#39;s a confusion you</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:46.310" style="s2">know you can see people are tied or lost</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.260" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">in some confusion and confusion can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.310" end="00:15:51.720" style="s2">disentangled by making some of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:57.650" style="s2">distinctions that you&#39;re making and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.720" end="00:15:57.650" style="s2">one of the confusions that I see is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:05.240" style="s2">you will have people like postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.400" end="00:16:09.270" style="s2">secularists and they will argue that</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.240" end="00:16:12.420" style="s2">spiritual views are conditioned by</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.270" end="00:16:14.640" style="s2">cultures and we can understand you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.420" end="00:16:17.220" style="s2">relativize all these spiritual views is</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.640" end="00:16:19.980" style="s2">conditioned by cultures but then a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.220" end="00:16:23.010" style="s2">religious community a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.980" end="00:16:25.550" style="s2">community will say that spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.010" end="00:16:30.030" style="s2">absolutes transcend cultural</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.550" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">conditioning right and you can argue</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.030" end="00:16:36.540" style="s2">this forever because both of them are</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:39.210" style="s2">meta views right one is saying that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.540" end="00:16:40.680" style="s2">you know that for example there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.210" end="00:16:46.230" style="s2">great book I can&#39;t remember it comes</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.680" end="00:16:50.850" style="s2">from it talks about how Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.230" end="00:16:53.700" style="s2">in India was developed developed within</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.850" end="00:16:57.690" style="s2">the caste system there and so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.700" end="00:17:00.150" style="s2">Buddhist scholastics were born into</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.690" end="00:17:01.890" style="s2">these monastic traditions where they</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.150" end="00:17:03.630" style="s2">didn&#39;t work the fields they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.890" end="00:17:05.100" style="s2">allowed to work the fields because if</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.630" end="00:17:07.740" style="s2">you work the fields even if you were</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.100" end="00:17:10.680" style="s2">strict vegetarian you would kill some</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.740" end="00:17:15.090" style="s2">things by working the fields and so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.680" end="00:17:19.500" style="s2">had these monks that had this certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.090" end="00:17:21.810" style="s2">way of absolute izing existence and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.500" end="00:17:23.910" style="s2">when this travelled into China and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.810" end="00:17:26.240" style="s2">Buddhist scholastics the main teachings</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.910" end="00:17:28.650" style="s2">gets incorporated into Chinese society</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.240" end="00:17:33.350" style="s2">where everybody is working the fields</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.650" end="00:17:37.050" style="s2">and the Taoist scholastics took that</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.350" end="00:17:40.560" style="s2">then that became the foundation for Zen</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.050" end="00:17:45.870" style="s2">and a lot of the Zen monastic process</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.560" end="00:17:48.210" style="s2">was to do a lot of hard labor to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.870" end="00:17:52.590" style="s2">know watch rotting corpses to it was</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.130" end="00:18:37.500" style="s2">got to be bigger or smaller than the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.170" end="00:18:40.680" style="s2">other when in reality we can switch in</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.500" end="00:18:42.020" style="s2">one view can hold compute you know the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.680" end="00:18:44.460" style="s2">cultural view can contextualize</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.020" end="00:18:47.550" style="s2">spirituality and spirituality can</p>

<p begin="00:18:47.550" end="00:18:55.160" style="s2">know so so arm this seems to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.340" end="00:19:00.920" style="s2">for all</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.160" end="00:19:03.590" style="s2">meta views meta commentaries so it can</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.920" end="00:19:06.200" style="s2">be frustrating because I like to tell</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.590" end="00:19:08.030" style="s2">this story you know you live all your</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.200" end="00:19:09.950" style="s2">life on the side of the mountain and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.030" end="00:19:11.660" style="s2">then you start and you think that all</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.950" end="00:19:13.310" style="s2">reality is what you can see and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.660" end="00:19:15.470" style="s2">start to climb the mountain and now you</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.310" end="00:19:17.510" style="s2">can see where you lived and you realize</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.470" end="00:19:21.260" style="s2">the higher you can go the more you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.510" end="00:19:23.420" style="s2">see until you get to the top and when</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.260" end="00:19:27.290" style="s2">you get to the top you just see 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.420" end="00:19:29.540" style="s2">melons you know so there&#39;s no end to</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.290" end="00:19:37.340" style="s2">that process either as what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.540" end="00:19:39.080" style="s2">and you don&#39;t get to an absolute view so</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.340" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what I would say with a confusion</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.080" end="00:19:47.470" style="s2">was in terms of people who get to a med</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:50.060" style="s2">of you or a transcendent view or can and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.470" end="00:19:54.950" style="s2">don&#39;t understand that what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.060" end="00:19:59.780" style="s2">looking at can also be turned around and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.950" end="00:20:02.270" style="s2">look and contextualize them and in many</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.780" end="00:20:06.920" style="s2">cases there&#39;s a big food food fight</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.270" end="00:20:09.950" style="s2">about that right so if that happened to</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.920" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">Wilbur&#39;s aqua theory and that he claims</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.950" end="00:20:14.210" style="s2">it can contextualize everything and now</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:16.930" style="s2">people are saying oh you know only a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.210" end="00:20:19.700" style="s2">Western developmentalist epigenetic</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.930" end="00:20:22.190" style="s2">psychologists grown up in middle-class</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.700" end="00:20:26.870" style="s2">America could even come up with a such a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.190" end="00:20:35.030" style="s2">thing so they&#39;re the this this seems to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.870" end="00:20:38.420" style="s2">be always the case so that relat I</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.030" end="00:20:40.130" style="s2">devises all these men of use right in</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.420" end="00:20:44.200" style="s2">and so that was a little bit of what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.130" end="00:20:47.060" style="s2">were saying right all right really and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.200" end="00:20:50.110" style="s2">that&#39;s only one definition of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.060" end="00:20:50.110" style="s2">transcendence is</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.620" end="00:20:56.110" style="s2">you know the witness is the experiential</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:20:59.690" style="s2">version of it the med of you is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.110" end="00:21:03.530" style="s2">theoretical version of it right like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.690" end="00:21:05.780" style="s2">can see your view my view can see your</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.530" end="00:21:13.940" style="s2">view so it must be higher you know like</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.780" end="00:21:17.000" style="s2">that is interesting right right so I so</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.940" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">it sounds like you&#39;re agreeing I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.000" end="00:21:21.410" style="s2">trying to make sure I just try to help</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:24.620" style="s2">you articulate what I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.410" end="00:21:27.830" style="s2">saying so we can move slowly into where</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.620" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">the question is yes so so far we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.830" end="00:21:34.910" style="s2">agreeing yeah yes so so far you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:36.590" style="s2">that&#39;s been helpful yes yeah but you</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.910" end="00:21:40.280" style="s2">know we you know some subtle caveats</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.590" end="00:21:42.470" style="s2">because I&#39;m painting I&#39;m I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.280" end="00:21:45.650" style="s2">making a big I feel like I&#39;m making a</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.470" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">very big claim and but it&#39;s also subtle</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.650" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">and hard to fairly hard to pinpoint um</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:55.310" style="s2">so like for example I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:59.030" style="s2">the witness consciousness is not the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.310" end="00:22:01.100" style="s2">only is not the only experience that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.030" end="00:22:04.510" style="s2">lumping in the category of transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.100" end="00:22:08.180" style="s2">experiences right now there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.510" end="00:22:10.430" style="s2">so we should proceed on that place yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.180" end="00:22:12.860" style="s2">we said the Wilbur that&#39;s one way they</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.430" end="00:22:15.020" style="s2">use the word transcendent is this actual</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.860" end="00:22:17.120" style="s2">experience of the recursively reflective</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.020" end="00:22:20.060" style="s2">self but I mean even within the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.120" end="00:22:22.070" style="s2">spiritual domain different types of all</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.060" end="00:22:25.490" style="s2">right so let&#39;s flavors of transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.070" end="00:22:29.660" style="s2">experiences okay so we have the witness</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.490" end="00:22:32.870" style="s2">we have the the way the actual</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.660" end="00:22:36.440" style="s2">scholastics contextualize it we just so</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.870" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">what other well the three the three big</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.440" end="00:22:43.300" style="s2">ones that I&#39;m thinking of off the top of</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:45.590" style="s2">my head right now are an experience of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.300" end="00:22:48.340" style="s2">and then they might just be different</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.590" end="00:22:53.540" style="s2">metaphors but an experience of awareness</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.340" end="00:22:57.400" style="s2">which yeah as an experience of awareness</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.540" end="00:22:59.750" style="s2">which is aware of all things and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.400" end="00:23:01.700" style="s2">then there&#39;s sort of an experience of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.750" end="00:23:04.610" style="s2">nothingness and all of these can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.700" end="00:23:07.190" style="s2">stable things an experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.610" end="00:23:09.830" style="s2">nothingness which isn&#39;t ever really an</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.190" end="00:23:12.170" style="s2">experience but it&#39;s intuited in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.830" end="00:23:17.059" style="s2">process of realizing that even awareness</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.170" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">or knowing of anything is is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.059" end="00:23:22.190" style="s2">superseded or a very subtle very very</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:24.470" style="s2">subtle experience that&#39;s always in</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.190" end="00:23:26.540" style="s2">relationship to that which it&#39;s noticing</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.470" end="00:23:32.330" style="s2">so somehow there isn&#39;t really an</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.540" end="00:23:33.950" style="s2">experience of nothingness but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.330" end="00:23:39.740" style="s2">sort of like paints a shadow on</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.950" end="00:23:42.350" style="s2">everything else once it&#39;s intuited which</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.740" end="00:23:43.520" style="s2">I actually think another direction we</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.350" end="00:23:45.320" style="s2">might go here is whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.520" end="00:23:48.200" style="s2">different than unconsciousness I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.320" end="00:23:49.790" style="s2">it might their experience subjective</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.200" end="00:23:51.770" style="s2">reasons why it might be different on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.790" end="00:23:53.630" style="s2">way getting into their getting out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.770" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">there and and what its results are that</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.630" end="00:23:58.730" style="s2">might be neurological differences but in</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:01.309" style="s2">terms of just what unconsciousness means</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.730" end="00:24:06.290" style="s2">I think it&#39;s the same it&#39;s just non</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.309" end="00:24:10.640" style="s2">experience of any kind and then a third</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.290" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">is more is neither of those but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:17.179" style="s2">sense of there&#39;s another broader</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:20.980" style="s2">category of context being emphasized</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.179" end="00:24:27.710" style="s2">over content and that could be</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.980" end="00:24:31.669" style="s2">temporally or or sort of spatio</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.710" end="00:24:33.710" style="s2">somatically and which both of which can</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.669" end="00:24:36.380" style="s2">have relationships to the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.710" end="00:24:37.910" style="s2">identity and who one is so space show</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.380" end="00:24:40.610" style="s2">somatically is what I said before the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.910" end="00:24:42.440" style="s2">sense of like even when you move you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.610" end="00:24:45.590" style="s2">not really moving it&#39;s just that things</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.440" end="00:24:47.929" style="s2">are moving yeah in you and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.590" end="00:24:52.280" style="s2">temporarily it would be like things</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.929" end="00:24:55.820" style="s2">start and it&#39;s like you don&#39;t start and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.280" end="00:24:58.790" style="s2">end you can&#39;t die for example yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.820" end="00:25:01.669" style="s2">are just things that start and end but</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.790" end="00:25:03.590" style="s2">like within you I get account so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.669" end="00:25:06.679" style="s2">related and not drawing these</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.590" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">distinctions perfectly clearly but um so</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.679" end="00:25:09.590" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:11.990" style="s2">and I&#39;m lumping all of those together</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.590" end="00:25:15.770" style="s2">yeah yeah no that&#39;s good all right so</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.990" end="00:25:17.870" style="s2">can we stop here cuz yeah this is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.770" end="00:25:21.770" style="s2">lot already yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.870" end="00:25:23.180" style="s2">so first I want to say that that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.770" end="00:25:25.940" style="s2">know and I&#39;m not accusing you this</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.180" end="00:25:29.900" style="s2">because I think this is this is not the</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.940" end="00:25:33.260" style="s2">case with you but but but when you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.900" end="00:25:35.990" style="s2">these experiences of nothingness or</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.260" end="00:25:38.240" style="s2">these these dis products experience of</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.990" end="00:25:42.190" style="s2">awareness that is not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.240" end="00:25:49.970" style="s2">conditioned let&#39;s say our content list</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.190" end="00:25:51.920" style="s2">that they&#39;re emphasized by by the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.970" end="00:25:55.460" style="s2">importance of these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.920" end="00:26:00.770" style="s2">emphasized by like the very cycle active</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.460" end="00:26:02.720" style="s2">type experiences right so when we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.770" end="00:26:05.390" style="s2">we&#39;re going to sound like we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.720" end="00:26:09.130" style="s2">about theory but we wanna i want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.390" end="00:26:14.360" style="s2">point that that these experiences have</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.130" end="00:26:18.860" style="s2">um the quality that comes with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.360" end="00:26:21.080" style="s2">experience is extraordinary right so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.860" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">not talking about theory no no I know</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.080" end="00:26:26.120" style="s2">but I just for those who are listening I</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">just want to say that we&#39;re only talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.120" end="00:26:32.090" style="s2">about certain types of experience that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:34.160" style="s2">that would sound like we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.090" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">about it were but we&#39;re trying to point</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.160" end="00:26:39.559" style="s2">to it something that&#39;s been experienced</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:42.170" style="s2">so right and also quality that comes</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.559" end="00:26:46.400" style="s2">with it is a sense of truth like it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.170" end="00:26:48.460" style="s2">true that is adding more true then or</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.400" end="00:26:52.309" style="s2">through that right it comes as a great</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.460" end="00:26:56.059" style="s2">insight yeah right like oh my god I</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.309" end="00:26:58.940" style="s2">can&#39;t die exactly obvious it&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.059" end="00:27:01.640" style="s2">up rights just earrings shows that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.940" end="00:27:04.130" style="s2">proof it&#39;s just is exactly that I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.640" end="00:27:07.190" style="s2">it was Ramana Maharshi that said like</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.130" end="00:27:08.750" style="s2">there&#39;s three stages at one stage you</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.190" end="00:27:11.150" style="s2">know you don&#39;t even know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.750" end="00:27:12.740" style="s2">diamond and at the second stage it might</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.150" end="00:27:15.290" style="s2">have been Alamos might I said that who</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.740" end="00:27:17.870" style="s2">knows i read too much yeah somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.290" end="00:27:21.100" style="s2">then the second stage you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.870" end="00:27:24.710" style="s2">diamonds in your coat pocket right and</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.100" end="00:27:27.110" style="s2">then the third stage is you can feel the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.710" end="00:27:29.330" style="s2">diamond in your coat pocket what you</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.110" end="00:27:31.210" style="s2">still haven&#39;t seen it and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.330" end="00:27:34.740" style="s2">see it it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.210" end="00:27:39.429" style="s2">obvious right so those are stages of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.740" end="00:27:42.220" style="s2">inference right like like more and more</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.429" end="00:27:43.450" style="s2">and more clarity and in the end people</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.220" end="00:27:46.570" style="s2">will say well how do you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.450" end="00:27:48.070" style="s2">like the witness well once you know it</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.570" end="00:27:49.059" style="s2">it&#39;s like a it&#39;s like somebody saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.070" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">well how do you know it&#39;s raining</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.059" end="00:27:53.950" style="s2">outside it&#39;s just it&#39;s not it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:57.760" style="s2">given the experience comes to as just</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.950" end="00:28:00.340" style="s2">more true than all this kind of complex</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.760" end="00:28:04.029" style="s2">confusion that or that you&#39;ve had before</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.340" end="00:28:06.789" style="s2">so all right so that&#39;s just a side point</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.029" end="00:28:08.919" style="s2">I think what you&#39;re talking about in</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.789" end="00:28:11.350" style="s2">terms of the the way we know these</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.919" end="00:28:13.890" style="s2">things now now that we&#39;ve said that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.350" end="00:28:16.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a psychoactive component that</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.890" end="00:28:20.770" style="s2">that there&#39;s a process of infer</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.450" end="00:28:23.080" style="s2">inference right like so if i can see</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.770" end="00:28:26.289" style="s2">that tree over there and see that a tree</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.080" end="00:28:29.649" style="s2">over there and measure between them then</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.289" end="00:28:32.679" style="s2">i must be i can infer from the trees</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.649" end="00:28:36.279" style="s2">though like the stars when you&#39;re when</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.679" end="00:28:38.020" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re navigating if i can let</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.279" end="00:28:40.059" style="s2">stars over there and that stars over</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.020" end="00:28:43.059" style="s2">there i can triangulate my position</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.059" end="00:28:48.840" style="s2">right I can&#39;t directly know where I am</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.059" end="00:28:52.149" style="s2">but I can infer it right and so this</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.840" end="00:28:54.929" style="s2">process of knowing that nothingness or</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.149" end="00:28:58.600" style="s2">knowing the awareness is a process of</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.929" end="00:29:03.850" style="s2">inferring from what is not nothing or</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.600" end="00:29:09.789" style="s2">from what is not awareness and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.850" end="00:29:16.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a long history of teaching with</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.789" end="00:29:19.929" style="s2">that capacity of inference you know that</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.750" end="00:29:23.409" style="s2">we know things that didn&#39;t come by</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.929" end="00:29:26.039" style="s2">reasoning we can infer that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.409" end="00:29:28.840" style="s2">comes through just embodied existence</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.039" end="00:29:31.750" style="s2">right because I know I didn&#39;t make it up</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.840" end="00:29:36.840" style="s2">but I know it for sure so these are</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.750" end="00:29:36.840" style="s2">processes of inference and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.410" end="00:29:50.740" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole nother topic of the rich</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.390" end="00:29:53.290" style="s2">capacity of inference and yeah and in</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.740" end="00:29:55.240" style="s2">fact that&#39;s what the witness how you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.290" end="00:29:57.460" style="s2">rid of the witness because the witness</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.240" end="00:30:00.670" style="s2">realizes that even the witness is an</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.460" end="00:30:05.110" style="s2">object in the consciousness of some</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.670" end="00:30:07.900" style="s2">thing else and if that&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.110" end="00:30:12.280" style="s2">a more recursive witness then you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.900" end="00:30:14.890" style="s2">only infer what that is is nothing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.280" end="00:30:17.320" style="s2">arises as an object in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.890" end="00:30:20.020" style="s2">consciousness including the witness and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.320" end="00:30:26.190" style="s2">that&#39;s when the witness dissolves right</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.020" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">so the inference cuts through this</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.190" end="00:30:38.770" style="s2">capacity to create these but complete</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:40.690" style="s2">recurrence you know right so does that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.770" end="00:30:43.450" style="s2">make sense I mean it doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.690" end="00:30:45.640" style="s2">but yeah and just confirming I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.450" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">make a subtle question but I would put a</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.640" end="00:30:52.180" style="s2">subtle question around the the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:53.740" style="s2">recognition we don&#39;t need to go down</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.180" end="00:30:57.450" style="s2">this but the recognition that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.740" end="00:30:59.740" style="s2">witness is not the nothingness because</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.450" end="00:31:03.220" style="s2">uranus the witnesses subtle experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.740" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">the come from the prepared the perpetual</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.220" end="00:31:10.270" style="s2">come from is nothingness or something</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:11.590" style="s2">like that right but the it doesn&#39;t maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.270" end="00:31:14.200" style="s2">it does for different people i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.590" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">sure but that&#39;s sort of that collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.200" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">the witness always is it simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:22.900" style="s2">for me that a brightening of experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:29.770" style="s2">itself so that content and everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.900" end="00:31:32.770" style="s2">are just very simultaneous a knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.770" end="00:31:35.080" style="s2">and the known are simultaneous and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.770" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">and so that there isn&#39;t really a</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.080" end="00:31:38.350" style="s2">separation between the nothingness and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:41.620" style="s2">everything else too because they have</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.350" end="00:31:44.040" style="s2">the quality of being yeah nothing the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.620" end="00:31:47.260" style="s2">same time so it&#39;s like it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.040" end="00:31:49.090" style="s2">witness dissolves and then nothingness</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.260" end="00:31:52.179" style="s2">can be highlighted but it feels like it</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.090" end="00:31:56.830" style="s2">becomes very like</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.179" end="00:31:58.990" style="s2">non dual simultaneously but even there</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.830" end="00:32:01.860" style="s2">even there the nothing this can be</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.990" end="00:32:04.090" style="s2">highlighted in the way that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.860" end="00:32:05.499" style="s2">hmm what do I really want to say anyway</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.090" end="00:32:06.999" style="s2">going back to what I&#39;ve already said so</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.499" end="00:32:09.850" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to go down there no no</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.999" end="00:32:12.490" style="s2">you&#39;re moving it along because your debt</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.850" end="00:32:14.980" style="s2">so that I&#39;m just the first thing we</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.490" end="00:32:19.240" style="s2">talked about inference I&#39;m confirming</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.980" end="00:32:21.730" style="s2">that you&#39;ve moving into this long Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.240" end="00:32:25.149" style="s2">Scholastica rate so this is this now</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.730" end="00:32:26.679" style="s2">we&#39;re moving again and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.149" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">things you&#39;re talking about now and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.679" end="00:32:35.169" style="s2">we&#39;ll move again but I&#39;m going slow for</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:38.110" style="s2">our viewing audience and then when we</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.169" end="00:32:40.240" style="s2">get so we don&#39;t need of us knows what</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.110" end="00:32:48.220" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about then that&#39;ll be no</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:50.279" style="s2">right yeah all right so you&#39;re right so</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.220" end="00:32:54.100" style="s2">now there&#39;s something unsatisfactory</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.279" end="00:32:57.730" style="s2">about inferring the opposite side of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.100" end="00:33:00.809" style="s2">dualistic equation right this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.730" end="00:33:03.970" style="s2">hear you saying so now I infer that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.809" end="00:33:07.210" style="s2">everything is object so what&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.970" end="00:33:10.200" style="s2">inferring to is the other thing that can</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.210" end="00:33:13.899" style="s2">never be seen now it can&#39;t be a subject</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.200" end="00:33:16.269" style="s2">because the subject is also an object in</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.899" end="00:33:19.090" style="s2">the awareness of this inferred thing so</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.269" end="00:33:21.970" style="s2">now I have really screwed up right I</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.090" end="00:33:25.869" style="s2">know to put sack I don&#39;t have to put on</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.970" end="00:33:31.809" style="s2">the other side of the debt horizon where</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.869" end="00:33:33.879" style="s2">I&#39;m can only infer right now and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.809" end="00:33:37.299" style="s2">going to make I have to make two moves</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.879" end="00:33:40.649" style="s2">here so okay okay one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.299" end="00:33:43.629" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to do in my work is create</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.649" end="00:33:48.129" style="s2">words that are placeholders for this</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.629" end="00:33:51.369" style="s2">effect okay and the words I use is in</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.129" end="00:33:54.490" style="s2">that line everything on one side of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.369" end="00:33:57.909" style="s2">line is a perspective and then but</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.490" end="00:34:00.549" style="s2">behind that line is a view right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.909" end="00:34:05.320" style="s2">but those two things should not be seen</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.549" end="00:34:07.779" style="s2">as they&#39;re not opposites like that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.320" end="00:34:11.010" style="s2">say subjects over here and objects over</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.779" end="00:34:16.149" style="s2">there over there because that makes this</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.010" end="00:34:17.679" style="s2">improper relationship right so now</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.149" end="00:34:21.220" style="s2">you&#39;re going to ask me well how are they</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.679" end="00:34:23.409" style="s2">related and we need to create a new</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.220" end="00:34:25.960" style="s2">language to really understand how</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.409" end="00:34:29.859" style="s2">they&#39;re related so so that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.960" end="00:34:35.649" style="s2">the other thing is this is what a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.859" end="00:34:37.119" style="s2">bit around the same thing is if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.649" end="00:34:40.569" style="s2">think of all the things you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.119" end="00:34:43.929" style="s2">about now instead of in dualistic pairs</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.569" end="00:34:46.000" style="s2">as if everything comes as a figure</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.929" end="00:34:48.819" style="s2">aground you were talking about context</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.000" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">so the ground is the context and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.819" end="00:34:55.109" style="s2">figure is that which is in context so</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:35:00.280" style="s2">now we&#39;re not even seeing them as</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.109" end="00:35:04.720" style="s2">simplistic dualistic pairs right but you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.280" end="00:35:07.030" style="s2">are aware that they&#39;re relativized their</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.720" end="00:35:11.859" style="s2">relationship our relative eyes by this</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.030" end="00:35:15.339" style="s2">figure ground quality right so now we</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.859" end="00:35:17.950" style="s2">can say well can we would it now when I</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.339" end="00:35:21.609" style="s2">look at what is figure grounding you</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.950" end="00:35:29.470" style="s2">know then if you my experiences is if</p>

<p begin="00:35:31.990" end="00:35:47.530" style="s2">mean it is not an effortless activity it</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.780" end="00:35:50.410" style="s2">is what the fundamental activity like</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.530" end="00:35:52.900" style="s2">your eyes seeing seems effortless but</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.410" end="00:35:54.849" style="s2">it&#39;s not actually effortless like if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.900" end="00:35:58.810" style="s2">had absolutely no energy in your body</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.849" end="00:36:02.440" style="s2">would not see and yet your eyes can only</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.810" end="00:36:06.490" style="s2">see in a certain way they only see</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.440" end="00:36:12.510" style="s2">certain colors and then ok so the figure</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.490" end="00:36:19.000" style="s2">ground move is the first effort of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.510" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">kind of mind we have now ok so so</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.000" end="00:36:27.700" style="s2">um I had this long taco Suzanne cooker</p>

<p begin="00:37:14.830" end="00:37:19.390" style="s2">beautiful shape that you actually pretty</p>

<p begin="00:37:27.190" end="00:37:35.620" style="s2">she says I have the heart the figure</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.490" end="00:37:39.700" style="s2">rate and then I have its antithesis that</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.620" end="00:37:42.600" style="s2">that no heart that inform emptiness but</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.700" end="00:37:48.100" style="s2">I also have the ground the context right</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.600" end="00:37:55.000" style="s2">okay so this is to her everything that</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.100" end="00:37:57.370" style="s2">is able to happen in so I say but what</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.000" end="00:38:00.910" style="s2">if that&#39;s just a temporary evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.370" end="00:38:03.190" style="s2">aspect of mind she&#39;s and it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.910" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">to be like that so she says she&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.190" end="00:38:07.360" style="s2">cool she says she throws the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:11.050" style="s2">construction paper at me she says will</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.360" end="00:38:15.640" style="s2">show me then I so I say what if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.050" end="00:38:17.700" style="s2">more like this and and I really wished I</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.640" end="00:38:21.670" style="s2">could have done a really neat origami</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.700" end="00:38:24.700" style="s2">but that things get folded I love it</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.670" end="00:38:28.930" style="s2">double combat so so that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.700" end="00:38:32.380" style="s2">certain experience right we&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.930" end="00:38:39.490" style="s2">experience the object world seems to</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.380" end="00:38:42.640" style="s2">be in front of and held by the witness</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.490" end="00:38:44.829" style="s2">or something right or are the subject is</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.640" end="00:38:48.039" style="s2">conventional ordinary experience but you</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.829" end="00:38:50.289" style="s2">see nothing&#39;s broken and then I have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.039" end="00:38:52.630" style="s2">non-ordinary experience the thing tends</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.289" end="00:38:56.349" style="s2">to flip around at all all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.630" end="00:39:00.130" style="s2">like happened to Alfred star heart his</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.349" end="00:39:02.380" style="s2">his feeling Center was out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.130" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">so though you have a nature mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.380" end="00:39:07.059" style="s2">the world is all the effect it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:10.440" style="s2">seem like it&#39;s inside of you anymore</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.059" end="00:39:13.839" style="s2">it&#39;s out there and so that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.440" end="00:39:19.299" style="s2">reconfiguration yeah nothing gets broken</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.839" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">and so this is what I say is the form of</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.299" end="00:39:26.109" style="s2">you know the next version of mind and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:28.660" style="s2">when I hear you talking that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.109" end="00:39:33.490" style="s2">hear you saying like you&#39;re not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.660" end="00:39:36.220" style="s2">trying to say well we have this this</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.490" end="00:39:39.220" style="s2">result but things aren&#39;t really broken</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.220" end="00:39:41.980" style="s2">and they&#39;re not really do list &#39;ok and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.220" end="00:39:45.519" style="s2">hear you softly seeing something more</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.980" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">like this and then I can change it in in</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.519" end="00:39:51.190" style="s2">the in the web is never broken but it</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:40:00.849" style="s2">keeps getting reconfigured and reshaped</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.190" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">and and and so for me the homeless is</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.849" end="00:40:11.009" style="s2">never it&#39;s more complex but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:11.009" style="s2">like simpler like the wholeness is never</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.670" end="00:40:19.539" style="s2">lost but it&#39;s never fixed in any way</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.589" end="00:40:23.230" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no there&#39;s no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.539" end="00:40:26.559" style="s2">no paradigm or meta view or finality</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.230" end="00:40:29.460" style="s2">anywhere yeah there&#39;s a med of you that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.559" end="00:40:34.210" style="s2">can arise as a particular configuration</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.460" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">of the whole and then it can move and do</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.210" end="00:40:39.660" style="s2">something else and it can move and do</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:45.760" style="s2">something else and you know we it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.660" end="00:40:47.710" style="s2">it&#39;s a way to understand so in life</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.760" end="00:40:50.470" style="s2">still you know there&#39;s no place for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.710" end="00:40:53.020" style="s2">witness if the witness appears then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.470" end="00:40:55.240" style="s2">a configuration of the whole right and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.020" end="00:40:57.580" style="s2">if the witness it&#39;s not theirs emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.240" end="00:41:01.870" style="s2">over here and then there&#39;s the whole if</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.580" end="00:41:04.150" style="s2">emptiness appears it&#39;s a it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.870" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">configuration of body mind spirit and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.150" end="00:41:09.430" style="s2">experience and that appears like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:10.930" style="s2">I&#39;ve inferred emptiness so so this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.430" end="00:41:16.990" style="s2">actually very helpful for me because</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.930" end="00:41:18.610" style="s2">part part of the doubt has been well is</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.990" end="00:41:22.510" style="s2">this really different or is this the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.610" end="00:41:24.460" style="s2">same thing that the you know Suzanne</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.510" end="00:41:27.490" style="s2">kakoi der will take her as an example is</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.460" end="00:41:29.860" style="s2">saying you know like she includes all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.490" end="00:41:33.010" style="s2">reality figure ground and context you</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.860" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">know for using those metaphors and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.010" end="00:41:38.290" style="s2">I&#39;m and is my real is the whole that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:41.350" style="s2">talking about really different or more</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.290" end="00:41:44.260" style="s2">whole than hers and so you&#39;re having the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.350" end="00:41:52.930" style="s2">same insight which is supportive at</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.260" end="00:41:55.210" style="s2">least so it yeah I think that that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.930" end="00:41:58.450" style="s2">you know language does not help us out</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.210" end="00:42:01.330" style="s2">because for 2,000 years no it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.450" end="00:42:04.570" style="s2">help us out because at this mind right</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.330" end="00:42:06.040" style="s2">well it&#39;s actually really big big part</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.570" end="00:42:11.620" style="s2">of what I&#39;m talking about here because</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.040" end="00:42:13.840" style="s2">it really is this is a its am I only get</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.620" end="00:42:19.510" style="s2">it through feeling i only get it through</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.840" end="00:42:21.790" style="s2">feeling what I&#39;m hearing and what people</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.510" end="00:42:24.160" style="s2">are where people are coming from what</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.790" end="00:42:27.790" style="s2">they&#39;re living and what they mean by it</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.160" end="00:42:29.530" style="s2">and there there there and the season</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.790" end="00:42:35.230" style="s2">also the values that go along with their</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.530" end="00:42:37.780" style="s2">emphasis so it&#39;s mmm sometimes I have</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.230" end="00:42:40.210" style="s2">clear thoughts about it sometimes I do</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.780" end="00:42:41.890" style="s2">not and I you know the clearest thought</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.210" end="00:42:45.130" style="s2">they have about it or come when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.890" end="00:42:47.920" style="s2">alone which is simpler yeah let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.130" end="00:42:49.750" style="s2">have me in my mind to deal with bow then</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.920" end="00:42:54.130" style="s2">when I&#39;m in relationship like in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.750" end="00:42:55.330" style="s2">moment with you it&#39;s like oh we I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.130" end="00:42:57.160" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know if what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.330" end="00:42:59.079" style="s2">is what I&#39;m saying and I just have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.160" end="00:43:01.989" style="s2">like ule forward they say</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.079" end="00:43:05.140" style="s2">uh well that&#39;s why you have to go slow</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.989" end="00:43:07.989" style="s2">because because we can&#39;t get distracted</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.140" end="00:43:09.789" style="s2">by language like if you took a</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.989" end="00:43:13.180" style="s2">transcript of this it would just seem</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.789" end="00:43:16.390" style="s2">like you know something that that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.180" end="00:43:18.910" style="s2">Dada role or sometimes got a data is</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.390" end="00:43:22.989" style="s2">amor something so you want to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.910" end="00:43:25.779" style="s2">that that we&#39;re trying to feel into next</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.989" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">the experience or the awareness of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.779" end="00:43:33.430" style="s2">different way you know we could back up</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:38.680" style="s2">because because I and this might be</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.430" end="00:43:42.219" style="s2">helpful or not but you know before this</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.680" end="00:43:44.049" style="s2">mind was born we only had this mind and</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.219" end="00:43:46.900" style="s2">it was the mythic mine and everything</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.049" end="00:43:48.549" style="s2">was all good so pretty yeah we just went</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.900" end="00:43:50.499" style="s2">around and around and around everything</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.549" end="00:43:52.569" style="s2">eternal recurrence you know spring</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.499" end="00:43:54.940" style="s2">became summer and summer became spring</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.569" end="00:43:59.890" style="s2">and winter and it just went her in in</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.940" end="00:44:03.910" style="s2">and then somehow right around Plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.890" end="00:44:06.009" style="s2">time he the mine started to work</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.910" end="00:44:10.539" style="s2">differently it was very subtle then and</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.009" end="00:44:14.229" style="s2">he called it diuresis you can take and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.539" end="00:44:19.359" style="s2">diuresis main separation and he sought</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.229" end="00:44:21.699" style="s2">thought of it as the thought of the gods</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.359" end="00:44:24.670" style="s2">and he said no we can take this out this</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.699" end="00:44:29.019" style="s2">eternal returns and we can see it as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.670" end="00:44:31.719" style="s2">myth relative to something else he made</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.019" end="00:44:34.779" style="s2">he made it not everything he made it an</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.719" end="00:44:37.299" style="s2">object that was separated called that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.779" end="00:44:41.289" style="s2">where the dialectic comes from the term</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.299" end="00:44:44.619" style="s2">diuresis and so I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.289" end="00:44:48.670" style="s2">talking about is the same thing we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.619" end="00:44:51.940" style="s2">yet have the language and the community</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.670" end="00:44:54.579" style="s2">but what is happening the ability to see</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.940" end="00:44:56.799" style="s2">in these new ways is coming through us</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.579" end="00:44:59.829" style="s2">not because we can talk ourselves into</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.799" end="00:45:02.699" style="s2">it we actually have to work at creating</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.829" end="00:45:05.859" style="s2">language that it expresses what just</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.699" end="00:45:11.190" style="s2">seems to be happening and happening to</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.859" end="00:45:11.190" style="s2">more and more people and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.100" end="00:45:22.760" style="s2">yeah so that to me is seems to be what</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.210" end="00:45:25.700" style="s2">this process is are we you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.760" end="00:45:29.140" style="s2">take courses from someone who of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.700" end="00:45:34.670" style="s2">certain lineage are we smarter than them</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.140" end="00:45:37.910" style="s2">you know it just seems to be we see</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.670" end="00:45:41.030" style="s2">their teaching in a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.910" end="00:45:45.640" style="s2">carried forward or something that hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.030" end="00:45:45.640" style="s2">that that hasn&#39;t been possible before</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.270" end="00:45:52.820" style="s2">which i think is cool and and and so are</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.230" end="00:45:56.090" style="s2">we going to try to tie this back into</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.820" end="00:45:58.310" style="s2">transcendence or well I feel like we</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.090" end="00:46:01.670" style="s2">have in a sense okay I didn&#39;t didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.310" end="00:46:04.520" style="s2">because well there&#39;s a couple ways of</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.670" end="00:46:07.300" style="s2">saying it like the folded origami the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.520" end="00:46:12.970" style="s2">last one you made that at in which</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.300" end="00:46:19.430" style="s2">there&#39;s no cuts there&#39;s no there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.970" end="00:46:23.000" style="s2">configurations we could say that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.430" end="00:46:27.350" style="s2">a we might say that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.000" end="00:46:31.270" style="s2">transcendence of the preceding version</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.350" end="00:46:34.430" style="s2">of understanding cellphone world because</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.270" end="00:46:36.590" style="s2">you can have experiences it can it can</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.430" end="00:46:40.359" style="s2">it can configure itself to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.590" end="00:46:43.340" style="s2">experiences which confirm the previous</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.359" end="00:46:46.730" style="s2">world view the previous view an</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.340" end="00:46:48.530" style="s2">experience of just sitting is is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.730" end="00:46:52.580" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t move in a stable way for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.530" end="00:46:55.340" style="s2">while I&#39;m not being true and then but</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.580" end="00:46:56.840" style="s2">then so but then it can fault and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.340" end="00:46:58.430" style="s2">but then you can fall out of it but not</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.840" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">with the sense of losing it or falling</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.430" end="00:47:01.640" style="s2">out of it but of just reconfiguring I</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:05.330" style="s2">think that&#39;s the difference that</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.640" end="00:47:07.880" style="s2">nothing&#39;s lost its just reconfigured so</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.330" end="00:47:10.340" style="s2">in a way it&#39;s a transcendence but if we</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.880" end="00:47:13.730" style="s2">look but there&#39;s another way of putting</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.340" end="00:47:16.609" style="s2">it which i think is more it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.730" end="00:47:19.130" style="s2">the newer that that that newer mind I</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.609" end="00:47:21.020" style="s2">guess we&#39;ll call it the origami mind the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.130" end="00:47:23.090" style="s2">origami mind origami mind I like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.020" end="00:47:25.310" style="s2">yeah okay let&#39;s use that the origami</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.090" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">mind which for me I</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.310" end="00:47:28.910" style="s2">think emphasizes relationship because</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:31.550" style="s2">even the aura gump or even though</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.910" end="00:47:35.480" style="s2">origami mind only makes any sense at all</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.550" end="00:47:38.150" style="s2">in relationship to what came before so</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.480" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">the origami mind doesn&#39;t hold itself as</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.150" end="00:47:45.350" style="s2">the viene the view of any of you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:47.840" style="s2">the it&#39;s it&#39;s in constant flux even you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.350" end="00:47:52.460" style="s2">understand myself is in constant flux so</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.840" end="00:47:56.440" style="s2">and that actually soaks for me my</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.460" end="00:47:59.990" style="s2">experiences that actually soaks into all</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.440" end="00:48:01.730" style="s2">experiences is the emphasis and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.990" end="00:48:04.730" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s actually something here</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.730" end="00:48:07.910" style="s2">around its primacy in the heart area is</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.730" end="00:48:10.310" style="s2">that the end feeling I like and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.910" end="00:48:14.080" style="s2">is that the emphasis becomes on</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.310" end="00:48:18.700" style="s2">relationship relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.080" end="00:48:23.390" style="s2">anything any view any experience any</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.700" end="00:48:28.070" style="s2">person it&#39;s like relationship actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.390" end="00:48:30.800" style="s2">seems primary and essential to every</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.070" end="00:48:34.520" style="s2">moment and the unfolding rather than</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.800" end="00:48:36.440" style="s2">anything and that&#39;s in relation yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.520" end="00:48:40.550" style="s2">they call it unfolding which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.440" end="00:48:44.510" style="s2">interesting um and now the whole concept</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.550" end="00:48:50.050" style="s2">of relationship is really become</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.510" end="00:48:54.260" style="s2">enriching and it&#39;s become origami so</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.050" end="00:48:56.390" style="s2">because in the fragmented world how</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.260" end="00:49:01.250" style="s2">things can be separate but in</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.390" end="00:49:04.070" style="s2">relationship needed a third term so how</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.250" end="00:49:06.830" style="s2">could my mind and your mind be separate</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.070" end="00:49:11.330" style="s2">but related we&#39;d have to have you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.830" end="00:49:14.180" style="s2">over mind or ground consciousness or</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.330" end="00:49:17.480" style="s2">there was always this need for a third</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.180" end="00:49:20.560" style="s2">term which would transcend the</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.480" end="00:49:24.850" style="s2">individuality and then would make a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.560" end="00:49:30.790" style="s2">transcendent imminent one mini problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.850" end="00:49:35.270" style="s2">with the origami model relationships are</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.790" end="00:49:38.960" style="s2">folds to the interface of folds of in</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.270" end="00:49:39.770" style="s2">all reality what reality is is not a</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:43.930" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.770" end="00:49:47.600" style="s2">you but the capacity to create views by</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.930" end="00:49:50.360" style="s2">folds or interface so now because we all</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.600" end="00:49:53.060" style="s2">have a separation we don&#39;t have to fill</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.360" end="00:49:56.080" style="s2">it with something that makes two things</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.060" end="00:50:01.610" style="s2">touch we have to worry about that right</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.080" end="00:50:05.410" style="s2">so so this is part of getting into this</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.610" end="00:50:07.940" style="s2">whole new mindset is to understand</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.410" end="00:50:11.300" style="s2">that&#39;s what I like about insights that</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.940" end="00:50:14.810" style="s2">seem valuable is that they solve a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.300" end="00:50:19.100" style="s2">of these other problems and so then we</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.810" end="00:50:21.740" style="s2">can start to look at well what is a fold</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.100" end="00:50:23.570" style="s2">what is a fold you know and so for me</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.740" end="00:50:28.520" style="s2">that thing between view and perspective</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.570" end="00:50:31.040" style="s2">is a fold right and not a duality or</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.520" end="00:50:34.580" style="s2">figure ground or anything it&#39;s a fold</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.040" end="00:50:36.580" style="s2">and and this becomes very process rule</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.580" end="00:50:39.940" style="s2">because all realities that</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.580" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">transformation of folds and unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.940" end="00:50:46.430" style="s2">and there&#39;s not one major trajectory of</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:51.680" style="s2">folding or one major trajectory of</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.430" end="00:51:02.240" style="s2">unfolding that&#39;s also a Content context</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.680" end="00:51:04.390" style="s2">move so yeah I mean it&#39;s a nice it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.240" end="00:51:11.320" style="s2">nice metaphor to play with this other</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.390" end="00:51:14.480" style="s2">view to make distinctions on what seems</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.320" end="00:51:17.690" style="s2">unsatisfactory about the transcendent or</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.480" end="00:51:20.570" style="s2">absolute argument although it can point</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.690" end="00:51:22.880" style="s2">to experiences that are psychoactive</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.570" end="00:51:29.720" style="s2">well and the other tricky part is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.880" end="00:51:34.160" style="s2">people who embody that deeply are often</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.720" end="00:51:40.210" style="s2">have special insight or capability which</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.160" end="00:51:40.210" style="s2">makes it seem very true or useful or</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.970" end="00:51:48.010" style="s2">worth worth listening to and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.940" end="00:51:49.660" style="s2">they&#39;re that they have that they are</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.010" end="00:51:55.630" style="s2">worth listening to in a very profound</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.660" end="00:51:59.490" style="s2">way yeah I think I think that part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.630" end="00:52:02.349" style="s2">that comes from in my experience is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.490" end="00:52:05.349" style="s2">the conventional view so now we&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.349" end="00:52:08.680" style="s2">talking to their language right the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.349" end="00:52:10.630" style="s2">conventional view is a limiting view and</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.680" end="00:52:13.990" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the organism</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.630" end="00:52:17.890" style="s2">that knows that and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.990" end="00:52:20.109" style="s2">organisms always trying to get more</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.890" end="00:52:22.210" style="s2">freedom so if you go and you receive a</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.109" end="00:52:25.990" style="s2">transmission and you get your view</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.210" end="00:52:27.490" style="s2">switched around right not that all your</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.990" end="00:52:30.250" style="s2">life you&#39;re worried that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.490" end="00:52:32.770" style="s2">die and then you actually see the truth</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.250" end="00:52:37.450" style="s2">in the opposite that you&#39;re never going</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.770" end="00:52:40.900" style="s2">to die then because you&#39;ve your view has</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.450" end="00:52:44.140" style="s2">become so much increased like view for</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.900" end="00:52:49.240" style="s2">me is degrees of freedom that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.140" end="00:52:51.520" style="s2">releases a lot of energy and become</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.240" end="00:52:54.119" style="s2">psychoactive because for your whole life</p>

<p begin="00:52:54.119" end="00:53:02.320" style="s2">thicknesses is the lack of freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.640" end="00:53:07.750" style="s2">so it&#39;s my understanding or my guess</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.320" end="00:53:09.730" style="s2">that it&#39;s the non ordinariness it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.750" end="00:53:13.180" style="s2">fact that we happen to be in one pattern</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.730" end="00:53:16.170" style="s2">and it gets unlocked but if it were vice</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.180" end="00:53:19.510" style="s2">versa you know I tell the story of</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.170" end="00:53:22.240" style="s2">beings who&#39;ve only are subtle energy</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.510" end="00:53:25.089" style="s2">beings in bliss and then someone goes to</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.240" end="00:53:27.339" style="s2">a guru who says oh you know if you eat</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.089" end="00:53:29.890" style="s2">food and you have sex you have this</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.339" end="00:53:33.790" style="s2">completely embodied experience and</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.890" end="00:53:35.619" style="s2">people are like no that&#39;s just a myth</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.790" end="00:53:37.810" style="s2">and stuff and then people start like</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.619" end="00:53:40.690" style="s2">actually doing the practice and having</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.810" end="00:53:42.670" style="s2">these experiences well they would think</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.690" end="00:53:44.950" style="s2">that those were transcending because</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.670" end="00:53:47.010" style="s2">what it would transcend is ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.950" end="00:53:51.310" style="s2">experience and it would be equally</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.010" end="00:53:54.840" style="s2">psychoactive because it&#39;s not what view</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.310" end="00:53:58.850" style="s2">you&#39;ve moved to its that your view</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.840" end="00:54:01.680" style="s2">increased degrees of freedom and to me</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.850" end="00:54:13.230" style="s2">whether you come from one to the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.680" end="00:54:14.310" style="s2">is is not the point so uh yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.230" end="00:54:18.620" style="s2">route that&#39;s a really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.310" end="00:54:18.620" style="s2">thought experiment that&#39;s remain jurist</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.190" end="00:54:27.060" style="s2">um you see you see for example Christian</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.360" end="00:54:29.970" style="s2">mystics having great success tin in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.060" end="00:54:32.210" style="s2">East for the same reason because all</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.970" end="00:54:37.230" style="s2">their lives they&#39;ve been taught this</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.210" end="00:54:40.500" style="s2">very organic somewhat naturalized</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.230" end="00:54:42.600" style="s2">concept of spirituality and now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.500" end="00:54:45.230" style="s2">getting you know God in the second</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.600" end="00:54:50.370" style="s2">person or God in the first person and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.230" end="00:54:52.490" style="s2">because that has opened their view that</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.370" end="00:54:58.100" style="s2">it&#39;s very psychoactive and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.490" end="00:54:58.100" style="s2">this cost cultural convert you know like</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:15.210" style="s2">so um though that&#39;s that would be my</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.820" end="00:55:18.030" style="s2">guess yeah yeah I&#39;m trying not to fill</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.210" end="00:55:21.150" style="s2">in the space we&#39;ve run mostly to the end</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.030" end="00:55:24.950" style="s2">of what I would know to talk about yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.150" end="00:55:31.770" style="s2">we did a good I think we did a good i</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.950" end="00:55:34.670" style="s2">like how these things have yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.770" end="00:55:39.350" style="s2">like script themselves in a way you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.670" end="00:55:39.350" style="s2">what do you mean um</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.770" end="00:55:49.080" style="s2">like you know when they&#39;re starting and</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.240" end="00:55:55.140" style="s2">then they kind of know when they&#39;re come</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.080" end="00:55:56.940" style="s2">around to some kind of I&#39;m going like</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.140" end="00:56:02.760" style="s2">this cuz it makes me think of making</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.940" end="00:56:05.640" style="s2">pizza dough oh I know is not very</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.760" end="00:56:07.500" style="s2">sophisticated metaphor but you go like</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.640" end="00:56:09.630" style="s2">that and then you&#39;re making pizza dough</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.500" end="00:56:12.060" style="s2">and then you go around and around and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.630" end="00:56:22.710" style="s2">then it&#39;s somebody you just know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.060" end="00:56:24.630" style="s2">it&#39;s ready to proof so yeah I actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.710" end="00:56:27.990" style="s2">think that it comes down to an ethical</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.630" end="00:56:33.470" style="s2">question like which understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.990" end="00:56:36.510" style="s2">reality is most makes the most space and</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.470" end="00:56:39.150" style="s2">deeply honors in a feeling way you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.510" end="00:56:43.970" style="s2">and also in a hot in a humble way a</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.150" end="00:56:43.970" style="s2">humble way yeah what you don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.360" end="00:56:58.200" style="s2">um and how people show up even when they</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.020" end="00:57:01.680" style="s2">don&#39;t show up as impressive and and even</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.200" end="00:57:03.870" style="s2">when you show up interiorly as having</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.680" end="00:57:05.550" style="s2">great confidence because I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.870" end="00:57:08.940" style="s2">another experience to have I actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.550" end="00:57:12.360" style="s2">recently I&#39;ve been noticing how great</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.940" end="00:57:14.940" style="s2">confidence great confidence is an</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.360" end="00:57:18.270" style="s2">energetic that can be embodied and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.940" end="00:57:20.040" style="s2">actually I think it&#39;s another ethic that</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.270" end="00:57:22.200" style="s2">it should be related we should we should</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.040" end="00:57:24.960" style="s2">make the time we should justify our</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.200" end="00:57:27.210" style="s2">great confidence by continually testing</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.960" end="00:57:30.060" style="s2">what we know but it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.210" end="00:57:31.950" style="s2">require that I can sit in great</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.060" end="00:57:37.290" style="s2">confidence I can sit in the energetic of</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.950" end="00:57:42.630" style="s2">great confidence and speak and not doubt</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.290" end="00:57:44.580" style="s2">myself whether it has anything and</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.630" end="00:57:46.830" style="s2">without it having anything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.580" end="00:57:50.340" style="s2">what i actually think or what I might</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.830" end="00:57:54.440" style="s2">actually say which I actually think has</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.340" end="00:57:58.700" style="s2">a quality that comes from and deeply</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.440" end="00:58:02.760" style="s2">deep stabilization of transcendent type</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.700" end="00:58:06.630" style="s2">or can come you know you speak the truth</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.760" end="00:58:13.260" style="s2">you speak what reality is but I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.630" end="00:58:16.559" style="s2">that&#39;s a I think that&#39;s a safe place and</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.260" end="00:58:20.880" style="s2">I think it&#39;s actually harder to see in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.559" end="00:58:24.359" style="s2">humbler place this origami mind it like</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.880" end="00:58:26.700" style="s2">not not recognized yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.359" end="00:58:28.049" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the confidence that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.700" end="00:58:31.170" style="s2">conditioned you know it&#39;s a great</p>

<p begin="00:58:31.170" end="00:58:39.119" style="s2">just it&#39;s if that&#39;s where the humility</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.299" end="00:58:44.369" style="s2">comes into its yeah the great confidence</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.119" end="00:58:47.220" style="s2">of the happy dog there&#39;s no gap there</p>

<p begin="01:00:37.289" end="01:00:44.099" style="s2">I just feel like I&#39;m in the heart of</p>

<p begin="01:00:53.670" end="01:00:58.410" style="s2">like I&#39;m looking out from reality but it</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.740" end="01:01:00.799" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily come with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.410" end="01:01:05.849" style="s2">clarity and confidence of the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.799" end="01:01:11.190" style="s2">stance station because it&#39;s all mixed in</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.849" end="01:01:15.900" style="s2">there the my experiences the permission</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.190" end="01:01:18.599" style="s2">is given to the to the to the confusions</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.900" end="01:01:22.460" style="s2">and the folds and the perspectives of</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.599" end="01:01:26.789" style="s2">the relative views to such a degree that</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.460" end="01:01:28.980" style="s2">is freedom there&#39;s that that that they</p>

<p begin="01:01:35.970" end="01:01:40.950" style="s2">certainly not the it&#39;s not necessarily</p>

<p begin="01:01:40.950" end="01:01:54.010" style="s2">yeah I think one of the mysteries that</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.050" end="01:01:58.690" style="s2">I&#39;m fascinated with and is that how we</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.010" end="01:02:02.940" style="s2">can come to the new understanding in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.690" end="01:02:06.700" style="s2">language of in the framework of what</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.940" end="01:02:09.040" style="s2">we&#39;re leaving behind you know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.700" end="01:02:13.780" style="s2">what you said you know we&#39;re using we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.040" end="01:02:16.750" style="s2">using words from Buddha scholastics</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.780" end="01:02:19.059" style="s2">we&#39;re using references to conventional</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.750" end="01:02:21.700" style="s2">experience and yet we&#39;re pointed</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.059" end="01:02:28.569" style="s2">something that we&#39;re saying is radically</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.700" end="01:02:36.510" style="s2">not that and so you know it this happens</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.569" end="01:02:36.510" style="s2">with all at all levels you know so so</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.900" end="01:02:42.670" style="s2">when Einstein was doing his work he was</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.300" end="01:02:44.680" style="s2">doing it in the math and language of</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.670" end="01:02:52.980" style="s2">Newtonian physics you know how could you</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.680" end="01:02:52.980" style="s2">be inside a framework and within that</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.250" end="01:02:58.030" style="s2">build getting the outside you know and</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.020" end="01:03:00.549" style="s2">other a lot of people talk about this</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.030" end="01:03:09.150" style="s2">but so you have to respect the framework</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.549" end="01:03:16.809" style="s2">that is is the launching pad for its own</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.150" end="01:03:22.329" style="s2">self transformation but I think part of</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.809" end="01:03:24.880" style="s2">that is that we are a living expression</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.329" end="01:03:27.790" style="s2">of the carrying forward of things we</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.880" end="01:03:30.280" style="s2">don&#39;t make it up it makes us up somehow</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.790" end="01:03:37.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I think the humility</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.280" end="01:03:39.040" style="s2">comes in um or else you know like how do</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.660" end="01:03:44.120" style="s2">you know these things how does anybody</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.040" end="01:03:48.290" style="s2">know these things I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.120" end="01:03:50.030" style="s2">I don&#39;t know either but one thing I have</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.290" end="01:03:52.670" style="s2">been thinking is that you we just get</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.030" end="01:03:54.380" style="s2">used to there&#39;s just enough people that</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.670" end="01:03:57.350" style="s2">start talking this way that we get used</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.380" end="01:04:05.720" style="s2">to thinking that it&#39;s true yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.350" end="01:04:08.390" style="s2">a there there is a um everyone you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.720" end="01:04:10.280" style="s2">more and more people move along in two</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.390" end="01:04:14.360" style="s2">different ways of knowing and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.280" end="01:04:17.600" style="s2">faster now because we all share the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.360" end="01:04:20.240" style="s2">framework that it&#39;s the more people can</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.600" end="01:04:22.550" style="s2">share the same framework now so more</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.240" end="01:04:27.860" style="s2">people can find each other moving</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.550" end="01:04:38.290" style="s2">through it I guess you know I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.860" end="01:04:40.700" style="s2">a mystery oh we should ask your horses</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.290" end="01:04:42.410" style="s2">now that you know something think that</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.700" end="01:04:45.860" style="s2">the whole figure-ground thing I did</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.410" end="01:04:49.100" style="s2">learn from my horses because horses</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.860" end="01:04:52.640" style="s2">apparently from working for my working</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.100" end="01:04:55.250" style="s2">with them they because they they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.640" end="01:04:58.180" style="s2">evolved to pay more attention to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.250" end="01:05:02.240" style="s2">environment and not to the figure</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.180" end="01:05:05.240" style="s2">because they&#39;re because of prey animals</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.240" end="01:05:07.430" style="s2">yeah and so once i figured figured that</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.240" end="01:05:09.080" style="s2">out then the way i worked with them was</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.430" end="01:05:11.540" style="s2">different oh this is what they&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.080" end="01:05:14.570" style="s2">this is what they&#39;re feeling and sensing</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.540" end="01:05:17.540" style="s2">these patterns not that I&#39;m over here</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.570" end="01:05:20.630" style="s2">talking to them over there and I started</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.540" end="01:05:24.080" style="s2">to understand that there were different</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.630" end="01:05:26.810" style="s2">ways of interpreting space and time and</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.080" end="01:05:31.300" style="s2">movement and that was a figure ground</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.810" end="01:05:35.560" style="s2">thing and then that was part of my</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.300" end="01:05:39.050" style="s2">looking at that mm-hmm mm-hmm cool</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.560" end="01:05:42.890" style="s2">that&#39;s cool it&#39;s it&#39;s nice to get</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.050" end="01:05:45.260" style="s2">external confirmation of new insights</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.890" end="01:05:47.090" style="s2">like oh this is true because it works</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.260" end="01:05:49.970" style="s2">better with my horses I&#39;m actually more</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.090" end="01:05:51.920" style="s2">successful with them relate to them on</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.970" end="01:05:54.440" style="s2">the basis of this site in sight yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.920" end="01:05:56.300" style="s2">know we&#39;re always as a culture we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.440" end="01:05:57.799" style="s2">always waiting for the aliens to come</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.300" end="01:05:59.509" style="s2">and tell us</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.799" end="01:06:01.969" style="s2">like completely different ways of</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.509" end="01:06:05.439" style="s2">looking at things but if we if we and</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.969" end="01:06:07.969" style="s2">then when we we interface with animals</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.439" end="01:06:10.339" style="s2">we&#39;re fascinating with trying to get to</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.969" end="01:06:13.910" style="s2">the animals to do sign language or the</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.339" end="01:06:17.150" style="s2">animals to say our words and you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.910" end="01:06:19.459" style="s2">and then we say oh they&#39;re not so smart</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.150" end="01:06:22.189" style="s2">they don&#39;t learn so well but we never</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.459" end="01:06:24.380" style="s2">take on trying to learn their language</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.189" end="01:06:28.549" style="s2">and their view because you know what</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.380" end="01:06:31.900" style="s2">it&#39;s really really hard and so like</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.549" end="01:06:34.390" style="s2">animals come really close especially</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.900" end="01:06:39.380" style="s2">domesticated animals to our world and</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.390" end="01:06:42.259" style="s2">the average person has almost 0 capacity</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.380" end="01:06:46.579" style="s2">to move into the animals world and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.259" end="01:06:50.660" style="s2">who really is you know except shamans</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.579" end="01:06:54.439" style="s2">you know that&#39;s what they did so who</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.660" end="01:06:58.880" style="s2">knows how many types of views in terms</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.439" end="01:07:02.269" style="s2">of configuration of being we could we</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.880" end="01:07:05.209" style="s2">could play with if we were curious about</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.269" end="01:07:09.469" style="s2">trying to understand animals you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.209" end="01:07:20.479" style="s2">who knows what&#39;s what that&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.469" end="01:07:23.239" style="s2">know mmm wells ha did you want to get</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.479" end="01:07:26.499" style="s2">back to non-ordinary experiences no I</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.239" end="01:07:30.979" style="s2">think we&#39;re good we&#39;re good for now ok</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.499" end="01:07:35.660" style="s2">great I want I just want to say I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.979" end="01:07:39.859" style="s2">having it is an interesting experiment</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.660" end="01:07:41.809" style="s2">for me to see how my intention again for</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.859" end="01:07:45.949" style="s2">this call was to have our conversation</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.809" end="01:07:48.289" style="s2">in the context of neutral discovery and</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.949" end="01:07:50.569" style="s2">Endicott and the kind of insight coming</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.289" end="01:07:53.479" style="s2">from between us yeah and it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.569" end="01:07:56.239" style="s2">for me to and maybe there are degrees or</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.479" end="01:08:01.549" style="s2">something maybe it&#39;s just but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.239" end="01:08:05.179" style="s2">difficult for me to to rest there</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.549" end="01:08:08.539" style="s2">there&#39;s so much that I have to say or or</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.179" end="01:08:11.530" style="s2">want to know that I often feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.539" end="01:08:13.670" style="s2">sort of chunking ideas out here</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.530" end="01:08:16.160" style="s2">bonding with your chunks and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.670" end="01:08:18.049" style="s2">chunking I just back at you rather than</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.160" end="01:08:19.880" style="s2">the mystery between us coming up with</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.049" end="01:08:21.650" style="s2">new ideas not knowing where we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.880" end="01:08:25.009" style="s2">to go before we get there I mean even</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.650" end="01:08:33.680" style="s2">now that&#39;s doing it you know well i</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.009" end="01:08:36.560" style="s2">think that there&#39;s there&#39;s I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.680" end="01:08:40.069" style="s2">building that capacity you know I I</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.560" end="01:08:42.230" style="s2">think that and I think it&#39;s pretty fast</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.069" end="01:08:44.140" style="s2">like a lot of times i would have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.230" end="01:08:46.730" style="s2">conversation like this with someone and</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.140" end="01:08:48.440" style="s2">we would have been horribly stuck</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.730" end="01:08:52.390" style="s2">arguing about the relative in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.440" end="01:08:56.870" style="s2">absolute realms because it would become</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.390" end="01:09:00.500" style="s2">clear that we didn&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.870" end="01:09:03.859" style="s2">understanding or fluidity with those</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.500" end="01:09:08.270" style="s2">terms and so my experience of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.859" end="01:09:13.989" style="s2">doing is we&#39;re moving until we get to</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.270" end="01:09:16.810" style="s2">that point right where there&#39;s a fold</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.989" end="01:09:19.100" style="s2">right right so that that&#39;s a to keep</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.810" end="01:09:21.440" style="s2">actually finished finishing yeah until</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.100" end="01:09:24.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a fold that&#39;s the the new term</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.440" end="01:09:28.069" style="s2">we made up so now we have a new word</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.130" end="01:09:29.870" style="s2">that when we get you like but yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.069" end="01:09:32.120" style="s2">good because we&#39;re gonna say oh I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.870" end="01:09:36.259" style="s2">this is a fold whereas before if we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.120" end="01:09:38.330" style="s2">say oh I think this is a relative or net</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.259" end="01:09:41.450" style="s2">you know we&#39;d be stuck in this thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.330" end="01:09:43.640" style="s2">that didn&#39;t serve us very well so and</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.450" end="01:09:47.180" style="s2">maybe one distinction a new distinction</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.640" end="01:09:49.400" style="s2">to make then is that ok i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.180" end="01:09:55.190" style="s2">like the idea of spectrum that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.400" end="01:09:57.080" style="s2">types degrees spaces of inciting</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.190" end="01:10:00.800" style="s2">collective inciting or something because</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.080" end="01:10:03.380" style="s2">it&#39;s not hold there&#39;s not a whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.800" end="01:10:05.480" style="s2">separation between our conversation but</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.380" end="01:10:07.460" style="s2">there is a sense on my side that like I</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.480" end="01:10:10.280" style="s2">had this intuition of a fold that I</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.460" end="01:10:12.530" style="s2">wanted us to go to huh and we bent there</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.280" end="01:10:14.330" style="s2">so it wasn&#39;t a total surprise it really</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.530" end="01:10:20.390" style="s2">wasn&#39;t answered two questions that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.330" end="01:10:22.820" style="s2">had um right which would be different</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.390" end="01:10:25.260" style="s2">than like hold on I think there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.820" end="01:10:35.040" style="s2">eagle on my lawn</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.260" end="01:10:37.080" style="s2">huh oh no just a goose it came down</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.040" end="01:10:41.310" style="s2">funny on the grass so it looked like it</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.080" end="01:10:45.930" style="s2">was attacking something and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.310" end="01:10:47.250" style="s2">yeah yeah sorry sorry ya know that this</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.930" end="01:10:52.290" style="s2">was the other point that was the other</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.250" end="01:10:54.210" style="s2">point that was like um because right</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.290" end="01:10:55.980" style="s2">this is the other point that&#39;s like went</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.210" end="01:10:59.640" style="s2">to a fold sort of knew where we were</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.980" end="01:11:01.440" style="s2">going I wanted to get there but when we</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.640" end="01:11:03.210" style="s2">were in the beginning with all the</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.440" end="01:11:05.520" style="s2">language I knew that those are like</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.210" end="01:11:08.790" style="s2">language traps all over the place there</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.520" end="01:11:10.320" style="s2">and it didn&#39;t matter to me so much there</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.790" end="01:11:12.030" style="s2">was degree to which it didn&#39;t matter to</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.320" end="01:11:14.520" style="s2">me so much that we were getting our</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.030" end="01:11:15.840" style="s2">language perfect or that I knew with</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.520" end="01:11:17.430" style="s2">confidence that you were saying exactly</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.840" end="01:11:20.070" style="s2">the same thing that I was with all those</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.430" end="01:11:21.990" style="s2">terms around her like that absolute but</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.070" end="01:11:25.320" style="s2">that there was a feeling between us of</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.990" end="01:11:28.740" style="s2">going somewhere of the feeling of</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.320" end="01:11:30.090" style="s2">movement more important to me just</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.740" end="01:11:31.950" style="s2">because the conversation was better</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.090" end="01:11:33.660" style="s2">because the resonance feels better but</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.950" end="01:11:36.390" style="s2">also because it feels to me like in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.660" end="01:11:40.110" style="s2">movement the questions get answered or</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.390" end="01:11:43.790" style="s2">yeah or addressed at least rather than</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.110" end="01:11:47.400" style="s2">getting stuck in that in the intensely</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.790" end="01:11:49.560" style="s2">conceptual like right we weren&#39;t trying</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.400" end="01:11:52.140" style="s2">to be conceptual we&#39;re trying to make</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.560" end="01:11:56.550" style="s2">sure that our language could help us</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.140" end="01:12:02.280" style="s2">rather than get us stuck and and like</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.550" end="01:12:06.200" style="s2">that&#39;s why i said on what I knew we were</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.280" end="01:12:09.180" style="s2">both and I pointed out we were both</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.200" end="01:12:11.460" style="s2">trying to let the feeling of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.180" end="01:12:15.360" style="s2">experience being be pointed to by</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.460" end="01:12:18.360" style="s2">language and not just playing a language</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.360" end="01:12:22.200" style="s2">game because that can that can have</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.360" end="01:12:24.150" style="s2">outfield we did that but I yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.200" end="01:12:27.810" style="s2">that but this is a good foundation</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.150" end="01:12:30.650" style="s2">because now we have this word fold it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.810" end="01:12:35.850" style="s2">all sony how language works because that</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.650" end="01:12:37.920" style="s2">word now is packed with meaning and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.850" end="01:12:39.119" style="s2">not a fancy word but it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.920" end="01:12:41.669" style="s2">sophisticated</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.119" end="01:12:44.789" style="s2">right now you know because it means none</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.669" end="01:12:46.590" style="s2">of that relativism and absolutism and</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.789" end="01:12:48.959" style="s2">transcendence and none of that dualistic</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.590" end="01:12:51.689" style="s2">but doesn&#39;t mean the non-dual because we</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.959" end="01:12:55.469" style="s2">know the non-dual is also the flip side</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.689" end="01:13:01.379" style="s2">and all of that now we can talk about</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.469" end="01:13:03.449" style="s2">from the origami mind I mean calling it</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.379" end="01:13:05.729" style="s2">an origami mind maybe a problem with</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.449" end="01:13:07.949" style="s2">this it&#39;s kind of sounds nice and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.729" end="01:13:09.840" style="s2">like what was really convenient for me</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.949" end="01:13:12.059" style="s2">is at one point I had to say now going</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.840" end="01:13:14.550" style="s2">back into conventional Buddhism you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.059" end="01:13:16.169" style="s2">somebody talking we&#39;re not making the</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.550" end="01:13:18.659" style="s2">distinctions of their ground in mind</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.169" end="01:13:22.260" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about this sector here and</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.659" end="01:13:27.780" style="s2">then we know when we can ask each other</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.260" end="01:13:31.919" style="s2">to drop in the conversation from this</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.780" end="01:13:36.649" style="s2">more what call more sophisticated view</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.919" end="01:13:40.439" style="s2">that we&#39;re just really feeling into its</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.649" end="01:13:44.699" style="s2">implications the insights that can come</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.439" end="01:13:52.260" style="s2">from that now and and i think the ease</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.699" end="01:13:54.959" style="s2">in which it happened makes a false sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.260" end="01:13:58.019" style="s2">of how you know the ease in which happen</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.959" end="01:14:06.239" style="s2">between us i think is not indicative of</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.019" end="01:14:08.249" style="s2">how much territory has been covered is</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.239" end="01:14:09.989" style="s2">not indicative another meaning we move</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.249" end="01:14:13.649" style="s2">we went through a lot of territory</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.989" end="01:14:33.119" style="s2">easily yeah i would say so in my</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.649" end="01:14:34.649" style="s2">experience with yeah true see this is</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.119" end="01:14:36.929" style="s2">the problem with this work because you</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.649" end="01:14:40.320" style="s2">use a word in it and then all the</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.929" end="01:14:43.079" style="s2">problems with the stupid word right jump</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.320" end="01:14:47.269" style="s2">out at you but we can trust each other</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.079" end="01:14:51.730" style="s2">that we put yeah nadia problems aside</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.269" end="01:14:54.040" style="s2">right right um I</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.730" end="01:14:57.400" style="s2">so one direction I was inspired to go</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.040" end="01:15:00.520" style="s2">from what you just said was origami mind</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.400" end="01:15:02.470" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve been talking for so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.520" end="01:15:06.510" style="s2">this is just be a seed I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.470" end="01:15:12.120" style="s2">yeah how far will get exactly but a</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.510" end="01:15:12.120" style="s2">friend of mine oh it was it was Mark</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.290" end="01:15:20.560" style="s2">Jerusalem he sent me the paper where you</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.590" end="01:15:22.420" style="s2">outline view it wasn&#39;t your 2,000</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.560" end="01:15:25.030" style="s2">pick-six paper it was like a shorter</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.420" end="01:15:33.640" style="s2">paper yeah I tried to make a popular</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.030" end="01:15:34.810" style="s2">version right good job well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.640" end="01:15:36.670" style="s2">interesting that you tried to make a</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.810" end="01:15:39.760" style="s2">popular version and now you&#39;re using the</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.670" end="01:15:42.700" style="s2">word origami mind because he was he was</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.760" end="01:15:45.220" style="s2">saying that your expression of view or a</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.700" end="01:15:47.860" style="s2">different structure or something came</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.220" end="01:15:51.250" style="s2">across as a little bit state II like</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.860" end="01:15:53.470" style="s2">state yeah oh yeah I want to make the</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.250" end="01:15:56.310" style="s2">distinction that that or at least raised</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.470" end="01:16:02.920" style="s2">the question that when I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.310" end="01:16:06.100" style="s2">this new way there is a mind that can</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.920" end="01:16:10.660" style="s2">understand it but okay ooh this is good</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.100" end="01:16:12.190" style="s2">so I&#39;m not talking cognitive I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.660" end="01:16:14.020" style="s2">primarily talking about cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.190" end="01:16:19.440" style="s2">structure I&#39;m actually talking about a</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.020" end="01:16:22.750" style="s2">contemplative realization a stable</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.440" end="01:16:24.760" style="s2">embodied contemplative realization that</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.750" end="01:16:26.500" style="s2">has all the qualities that has all the</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.760" end="01:16:30.280" style="s2">qualities that defined other</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.500" end="01:16:35.020" style="s2">contemporary realizations and it has a</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.280" end="01:16:38.070" style="s2">cognitive component it has a it has it</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.020" end="01:16:41.380" style="s2">has a cognitive component or aspect</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.070" end="01:16:45.430" style="s2">which can understand itself this</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.380" end="01:16:47.440" style="s2">realization from this from this viewer</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.430" end="01:16:50.770" style="s2">perspective or this origami mind that</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.440" end="01:16:52.270" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about and but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.770" end="01:16:56.950" style="s2">primarily cognitive it&#39;s just that it</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.270" end="01:17:01.480" style="s2">has a cognitive flower petal and that</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.950" end="01:17:05.560" style="s2">cognitive flower or pedal is what I</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.480" end="01:17:09.580" style="s2">think when you talk about post</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.560" end="01:17:12.760" style="s2">dialectics post dialectical mind so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.580" end="01:17:18.720" style="s2">if there&#39;s this curious relationship</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.760" end="01:17:21.490" style="s2">between the realization and mine and</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.720" end="01:17:26.110" style="s2">weather and the cognitive capabilities</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.490" end="01:17:27.880" style="s2">and cognitive patterns and and whether</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.110" end="01:17:31.090" style="s2">that&#39;s opposed dialectic or not and all</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.880" end="01:17:33.400" style="s2">that kind of thing so and it does feel</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.090" end="01:17:35.110" style="s2">like the lines between the cognition and</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.400" end="01:17:36.940" style="s2">the contemplative realization are sort</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.110" end="01:17:40.660" style="s2">of blurred because I&#39;m not just defining</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.940" end="01:17:42.790" style="s2">mind as the thoughts and images and</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.660" end="01:17:44.860" style="s2">words that occur in awareness I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.790" end="01:17:47.050" style="s2">talking about the process of</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.860" end="01:17:48.880" style="s2">understanding and relating to and</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.050" end="01:17:52.690" style="s2">resonating with and interfacing with</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.880" end="01:17:57.910" style="s2">everything so even what cognition is is</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.690" end="01:17:59.620" style="s2">a much deeper process it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.910" end="01:18:01.480" style="s2">about thoughts and words and images it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.620" end="01:18:04.420" style="s2">also about feelings it&#39;s also about</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.480" end="01:18:07.240" style="s2">intuitions it&#39;s also just about this</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.420" end="01:18:09.250" style="s2">very subtle sense of relationship each</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.240" end="01:18:13.230" style="s2">those things all give rise to new</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.250" end="01:18:16.210" style="s2">understandings and new ways and new</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.230" end="01:18:19.930" style="s2">insights and so all of that is cognition</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.210" end="01:18:22.180" style="s2">it&#39;s not in its and it&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.930" end="01:18:26.110" style="s2">this whole place this always whole place</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.180" end="01:18:27.940" style="s2">anyway moving and in a way a sense in a</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.110" end="01:18:29.560" style="s2">sense then everything becomes cognition</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.940" end="01:18:31.540" style="s2">in the sense of giving rise to new</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.560" end="01:18:34.030" style="s2">understanding because as the origami</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.540" end="01:18:36.220" style="s2">folds into new configurations new</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.030" end="01:18:39.010" style="s2">learning occurs automatically so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.220" end="01:18:42.430" style="s2">it&#39;s like the world process itself has</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.010" end="01:18:44.320" style="s2">lived through here is cognition it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.430" end="01:18:48.130" style="s2">learning it&#39;s learning all the time so</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.320" end="01:18:52.000" style="s2">even the boundaries between cognition</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.130" end="01:18:55.720" style="s2">affect or cognition and and realization</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.000" end="01:18:59.650" style="s2">they&#39;re starting to break down or blur</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.720" end="01:19:01.840" style="s2">something like that yeah I mean we could</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.650" end="01:19:04.930" style="s2">talk about this maybe we can just leave</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.840" end="01:19:08.260" style="s2">this in and think of talking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.930" end="01:19:12.280" style="s2">origami mind from the start next time</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.260" end="01:19:15.330" style="s2">you know like get some feelings into</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.280" end="01:19:18.760" style="s2">what what that is now that we</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.330" end="01:19:21.340" style="s2">hypothesized this new thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.760" end="01:19:24.789" style="s2">and we hold it lightly we know that that</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.340" end="01:19:27.309" style="s2">we&#39;re building a perspectival world out</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.789" end="01:19:30.489" style="s2">of an implicit view that is arisen and</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.309" end="01:19:33.460" style="s2">is unfolding into the first spectacle</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.489" end="01:19:35.679" style="s2">world we can drive ourselves crazy and</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.460" end="01:19:37.989" style="s2">say well we&#39;re actually not origami mine</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.679" end="01:19:39.820" style="s2">because if we can see origami mind we</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.989" end="01:19:42.219" style="s2">absolutely must be something else but</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.820" end="01:19:45.849" style="s2">right now we&#39;re just gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.219" end="01:19:47.800" style="s2">origami mind and infer the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.849" end="01:19:50.949" style="s2">you see this is to me why their self</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.800" end="01:19:56.079" style="s2">system is generative because it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.949" end="01:19:57.340" style="s2">moving more stuff into the explicit</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.079" end="01:20:01.469" style="s2">world that we can talk about and share</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.340" end="01:20:05.440" style="s2">and the implicit world which is shared</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.469" end="01:20:12.400" style="s2">right but not share a bowl so so you and</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.440" end="01:20:15.579" style="s2">I share a common root at the source but</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.400" end="01:20:19.110" style="s2">then as individuals we can&#39;t exchange it</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.579" end="01:20:27.610" style="s2">because it&#39;s shared there but then</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.110" end="01:20:29.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole nother thing but so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.610" end="01:20:33.309" style="s2">we can just talk about that in its</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.800" end="01:20:37.289" style="s2">relationship to you know there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.309" end="01:20:39.250" style="s2">distinctions to be made in terms of mind</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.289" end="01:20:41.530" style="s2">vs comfortable did you call a</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.250" end="01:20:46.480" style="s2">contemplative realization of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.530" end="01:20:50.019" style="s2">realization yeah and states you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.480" end="01:20:52.239" style="s2">States I what I talk about view at the</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.019" end="01:20:55.210" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard for me to say what I</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.239" end="01:20:58.869" style="s2">think view is but the most accurate</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.210" end="01:21:02.519" style="s2">thing I can say is it&#39;s a verb not a</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.869" end="01:21:05.519" style="s2">noun and it&#39;s degrees of freedom right</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.519" end="01:21:05.519" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.430" end="01:21:19.600" style="s2">yeah and so that&#39;s that we can maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.210" end="01:21:22.270" style="s2">could just stop there and look at maybe</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.600" end="01:21:27.190" style="s2">those two terms next times origami mind</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.270" end="01:21:29.260" style="s2">and in view and see where that goes or</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.190" end="01:21:34.080" style="s2">not we might have a clean by have</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.260" end="01:21:34.080" style="s2">something else that might be so passe</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.070" end="01:21:42.630" style="s2">yeah well you know it&#39;s into that den</p>
