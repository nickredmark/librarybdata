<p begin="00:00:30.929" end="00:00:36.690" style="s2">a I just got introduced to you by a</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.290" end="00:00:39.329" style="s2">colleague of mine Blake masters Peter</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.690" end="00:00:41.969" style="s2">teals co-author and I&#39;ve been addicted</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.329" end="00:00:43.649" style="s2">to your podcast not quite understanding</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.969" end="00:00:45.210" style="s2">why it&#39;s one of the strangest things</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.649" end="00:00:47.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever found can you say more about</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.210" end="00:00:50.730" style="s2">what induced you to do it and why you</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.940" end="00:00:52.199" style="s2">think it might be working I have no clue</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.730" end="00:00:56.370" style="s2">why it&#39;s working I know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.199" end="00:00:59.850" style="s2">probably due to some sort of alchemical</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.370" end="00:01:02.940" style="s2">in articulable thing that&#39;s totally out</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.850" end="00:01:05.189" style="s2">of my control that has something to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.940" end="00:01:10.020" style="s2">with my chemistry with my co-host who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.189" end="00:01:13.350" style="s2">an actress called Donna crossover but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.020" end="00:01:15.570" style="s2">think maybe it struck a chord I know</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.350" end="00:01:17.939" style="s2">that it consistently infuriates all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.570" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">wrong people which was never my</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.939" end="00:01:23.490" style="s2">intention so innocent yeah and that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">beautiful but it&#39;s also not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.490" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">believable because it does seem like</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re crowding out</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">a certain kind of pious Ness</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">and we had an epic lunch the other day</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:38.460" style="s2">yeah we did we had what they call a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:41.009" style="s2">Power Lunch is that a Power Lunch yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.460" end="00:01:42.750" style="s2">yeah okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.009" end="00:01:44.939" style="s2">I just learned at the last minute that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.750" end="00:01:47.729" style="s2">this podcast is being filmed because I</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.939" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">was telling Eric here the the way that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.729" end="00:01:52.020" style="s2">we&#39;re on ours is like a bunch of wires</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:53.180" style="s2">and crap strewn on the floor like</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.020" end="00:01:55.500" style="s2">chain-smoking</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.180" end="00:01:57.930" style="s2">doll just literally sits on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.500" end="00:02:01.860" style="s2">objecting objectifying herself at every</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.930" end="00:02:04.979" style="s2">turn and I sit on my disgusting stained</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.860" end="00:02:07.829" style="s2">and cigarette burned couch but this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:10.289" style="s2">my bad side and I wish I was more of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.829" end="00:02:13.380" style="s2">diva like Mariah Carey and could demand</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.289" end="00:02:14.970" style="s2">that we switched seats we</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.380" end="00:02:16.980" style="s2">yeah I know I&#39;m kidding and being</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.970" end="00:02:21.150" style="s2">hyperbolic well and we always pick up</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.980" end="00:02:22.140" style="s2">the syringes before the game yeah anyway</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.150" end="00:02:26.610" style="s2">what was the question</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.140" end="00:02:30.150" style="s2">well the question surrounds what I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.610" end="00:02:31.620" style="s2">going to get at is that we had this bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.150" end="00:02:34.220" style="s2">of a riff where I&#39;ve said that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.620" end="00:02:36.570" style="s2">trying to be long good and short nice</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.220" end="00:02:38.070" style="s2">that nice doesn&#39;t really have a future</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.570" end="00:02:40.230" style="s2">because nice is really this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.070" end="00:02:42.030" style="s2">performative version that crowds out</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.230" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">good mm-hmm and you seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.030" end="00:02:49.110" style="s2">mastered this form formula where I</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:52.410" style="s2">detect a deeply buried good and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.110" end="00:02:56.900" style="s2">an attack on nice at all times yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.410" end="00:03:00.600" style="s2">mean I think the nice on some level is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.900" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">futile position I mean even you look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.600" end="00:03:06.090" style="s2">like female social politics right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:08.370" style="s2">there&#39;s always kind of a repentant</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.090" end="00:03:09.930" style="s2">bitches masquerading as nice girls and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.370" end="00:03:13.410" style="s2">then there&#39;s nice girls masquerading as</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.930" end="00:03:15.110" style="s2">a repentant bitches and I think I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.410" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">like to think that I&#39;m the latter</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.110" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">remains to be seen yeah I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">that I have any sort of earnest or let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:22.860" style="s2">say let&#39;s put it this way I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">that I have kind of a sustained</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.860" end="00:03:27.870" style="s2">political vision that I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:29.310" style="s2">enact it&#39;s kind of out of my control as</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.870" end="00:03:31.020" style="s2">you know my father who&#39;s used to Sager</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.310" end="00:03:36.330" style="s2">but a crumb floating on the face of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.020" end="00:03:40.230" style="s2">earth but to build your confident it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.330" end="00:03:43.020" style="s2">like Russian self esteem but at the end</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.230" end="00:03:46.530" style="s2">of the day I have kind of a very earnest</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.020" end="00:03:50.340" style="s2">ethical agenda that I&#39;m hoping to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.530" end="00:03:52.200" style="s2">populate the minds of my young girl and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">gay listeners with I would have said in</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.200" end="00:03:58.620" style="s2">effect but okay populate yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:04:01.290" style="s2">in fact is another good one wonderful so</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.620" end="00:04:03.420" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s just do a little bit of your</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.290" end="00:04:05.400" style="s2">background as you&#39;re mining it yeah for</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.420" end="00:04:08.240" style="s2">the kind of motif that even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.400" end="00:04:11.490" style="s2">an intrinsically American show it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.240" end="00:04:16.440" style="s2">informed by this sort of broad Slavic</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.490" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">soul and you were born in in Moscow in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.440" end="00:04:24.600" style="s2">Moscow yeah in 1985 the internet and my</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:26.700" style="s2">spanish wikipedia says that it&#39;s 1986 i</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.600" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">every year i&#39;m aging backwards on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.700" end="00:04:32.310" style="s2">next year I&#39;ll be 32 yeah that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:35.100" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m like the Benjamin buttons of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.310" end="00:04:39.990" style="s2">neoliberal critique and but I was born</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.100" end="00:04:41.580" style="s2">in 1985 at the tail end you know right</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.990" end="00:04:46.200" style="s2">before the collapse of the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.580" end="00:04:51.150" style="s2">and there&#39;s no way that that experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.200" end="00:04:53.250" style="s2">along with the kind of inevitable trauma</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.150" end="00:04:57.720" style="s2">of immigration doesn&#39;t inform your</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.250" end="00:05:02.550" style="s2">worldview so if I understand correctly</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.720" end="00:05:07.020" style="s2">not only are you coming with this sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.550" end="00:05:10.370" style="s2">of tail end Soviet influence but it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.020" end="00:05:13.770" style="s2">also the case that you&#39;ve got access to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.370" end="00:05:16.860" style="s2">to the the twin genocides of Jews and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.770" end="00:05:18.510" style="s2">Armenians that&#39;s true yeah I always say</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.860" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">on Twitter it&#39;s very depressing that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.510" end="00:05:24.890" style="s2">know my ancestors survived the Armenian</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.690" end="00:05:28.850" style="s2">Genocide and then the Holocaust so their</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.890" end="00:05:31.830" style="s2">descendant could become a podcaster in</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.850" end="00:05:34.620" style="s2">Brooklyn now Manhattan and no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.830" end="00:05:36.420" style="s2">because you&#39;re white of hue you are</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.620" end="00:05:38.520" style="s2">going to be labeled as privileged</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.420" end="00:05:40.740" style="s2">because you come from these two ethnic</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.520" end="00:05:43.080" style="s2">groups which for some priests we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.740" end="00:05:44.280" style="s2">actually locate in human history or what</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.080" end="00:05:47.100" style="s2">these groups have been through which I</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.280" end="00:05:48.600" style="s2">find also really amusing this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.100" end="00:05:50.460" style="s2">I mean this isn&#39;t a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.600" end="00:05:52.110" style="s2">point I don&#39;t know if we want it I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.460" end="00:05:56.460" style="s2">drunk yet so maybe we should get into</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.110" end="00:06:01.860" style="s2">the intellect oh yeah let&#39;s write a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.460" end="00:06:04.650" style="s2">surprise yeah you I don&#39;t so I&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.860" end="00:06:06.690" style="s2">into all the kind of like heavy-handed</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.650" end="00:06:09.180" style="s2">intellectual stuff in the first half</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.690" end="00:06:11.970" style="s2">let&#39;s say but this is one of I think my</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.180" end="00:06:15.930" style="s2">central projects or critiques that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.970" end="00:06:19.860" style="s2">interested in I don&#39;t obviously I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.930" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">dispute the completely gross horrific</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.860" end="00:06:25.830" style="s2">legacy of American slavery right it</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:29.900" style="s2">existed it plunged an entire population</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.830" end="00:06:33.830" style="s2">into poverty into social fragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.900" end="00:06:36.600" style="s2">the legacy is still alive and well today</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.830" end="00:06:40.200" style="s2">what I object to I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.600" end="00:06:44.610" style="s2">wholesale export of the American</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.200" end="00:06:47.610" style="s2">view of race relations to elsewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.610" end="00:06:52.050" style="s2">the world to people who don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.610" end="00:06:53.910" style="s2">similar experience well I guess from my</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.050" end="00:06:57.000" style="s2">perspective what I find very odd about</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.910" end="00:06:58.890" style="s2">all of this is that having been close to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.000" end="00:07:01.800" style="s2">people in the Armenian and Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.890" end="00:07:04.170" style="s2">communities there&#39;s a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.800" end="00:07:06.420" style="s2">of intergenerational trauma yes because</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.170" end="00:07:08.730" style="s2">there has to be yeah but my sister and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.420" end="00:07:10.260" style="s2">call it hand-me-down trauma yeah it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:06.570" style="s2">family secrets but um the I think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.670" end="00:08:11.100" style="s2">basic correct principle the basic</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.570" end="00:08:12.930" style="s2">critique of certain I guess leftist</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.100" end="00:08:15.390" style="s2">intellectuals in the United States is</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.930" end="00:08:19.610" style="s2">this idea that okay well somebody like</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.390" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">me is not only why not only would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.610" end="00:08:23.640" style="s2">associated as white or would consider</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.080" end="00:08:25.800" style="s2">herself white but is essentially white</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.640" end="00:08:27.690" style="s2">passing so therefore even if I was not</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.800" end="00:08:29.970" style="s2">hypothetically white I could rake in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.690" end="00:08:33.240" style="s2">certain white privilege that for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.970" end="00:08:34.950" style="s2">or a black or Latino person couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.240" end="00:08:37.590" style="s2">this is what I&#39;ve called the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.950" end="00:08:40.620" style="s2">intersectional shakedown yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.590" end="00:08:43.740" style="s2">the populations that are maximally</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.620" end="00:08:46.470" style="s2">irritating to the an intersectional</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.740" end="00:08:49.230" style="s2">shakedown artists are the populations</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.470" end="00:08:51.450" style="s2">with recent claims to oppression that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.230" end="00:08:53.230" style="s2">are nevertheless making it economically</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.450" end="00:08:55.480" style="s2">because really what it is isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.230" end="00:08:58.450" style="s2">tempt to take a real history of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.480" end="00:09:00.610" style="s2">oppression and to turn into cash yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.450" end="00:09:04.420" style="s2">well I tweeted literally today moments</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.610" end="00:09:06.910" style="s2">before I came here that the kind of idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.420" end="00:09:11.700" style="s2">of cultural appropriation that debate</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.910" end="00:09:15.300" style="s2">makes perfect sense in a culture where</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.700" end="00:09:18.220" style="s2">identity is viewed as a form of capital</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.300" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">because it becomes in a zero-sum game if</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.220" end="00:09:23.470" style="s2">somebody like Rachel Dolezal right</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:25.870" style="s2">perpetuates this myth that she&#39;s a black</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.470" end="00:09:27.910" style="s2">woman she is basically taking food out</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.870" end="00:09:32.230" style="s2">of the mouths power out of the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.910" end="00:09:34.510" style="s2">an actually black woman right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.230" end="00:09:36.010" style="s2">that absurdity but then we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.510" end="00:09:37.930" style="s2">to contend with the weird aspect for</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.010" end="00:09:41.170" style="s2">example if you look at the exploitation</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.930" end="00:09:43.350" style="s2">of black musicians who very often you</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.170" end="00:09:47.800" style="s2">know at some point you had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.350" end="00:09:49.030" style="s2">illiterate genius musicians in the Delta</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.800" end="00:09:51.310" style="s2">who were brilliant enough to produce</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.030" end="00:09:52.810" style="s2">great music but weren&#39;t capable of</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.310" end="00:09:55.330" style="s2">defending themselves in a legal</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.810" end="00:09:57.790" style="s2">structure right and so you actually had</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.330" end="00:09:59.620" style="s2">cultural exploitation of one group by</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.790" end="00:10:01.870" style="s2">another through appropriation so you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.620" end="00:10:04.060" style="s2">get you know I think at some point I saw</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.870" end="00:10:06.040" style="s2">Otis Blackwell performing in New York</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.060" end="00:10:08.410" style="s2">City and you know he had to say look I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.040" end="00:10:10.480" style="s2">the guy behind Elvis Presley right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.410" end="00:10:12.400" style="s2">the idea is that when Elvis sang it it</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.480" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">was acceptable to a market that he</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.400" end="00:10:19.060" style="s2">couldn&#39;t sell into so there is a real</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:21.940" style="s2">aspect to cultural appropriation and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.060" end="00:10:24.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a totally fake aspect yes which</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.940" end="00:10:26.830" style="s2">is this sort of and they&#39;re coexisting</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.340" end="00:10:29.590" style="s2">and so is very tempting for people like</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.830" end="00:10:31.930" style="s2">us just to point at the bullshit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.590" end="00:10:34.180" style="s2">but there actually is this unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.930" end="00:10:36.150" style="s2">reality that&#39;s braided with it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.180" end="00:10:40.060" style="s2">absolutely no pun intended</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.150" end="00:10:42.430" style="s2">sorry elaborate it the box braids um no</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.060" end="00:10:43.900" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely true I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.430" end="00:10:45.610" style="s2">can give the example of like hash and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.900" end="00:10:48.850" style="s2">The Sopranos right we talked about The</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.610" end="00:10:50.680" style="s2">Sopranos at our Power Lunch who&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.850" end="00:10:53.110" style="s2">guy who&#39;s kind of this like kindly</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.680" end="00:10:55.720" style="s2">sensible Jewish grandfather you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.110" end="00:10:58.750" style="s2">Mafia con within a mafia context as</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.720" end="00:11:00.430" style="s2">warrant so warm and loving and steadily</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.750" end="00:11:02.710" style="s2">and this is a guy who has historically</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.430" end="00:11:03.730" style="s2">stiffed black musicians for royalties</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.710" end="00:11:06.490" style="s2">right and there&#39;s that famous</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.730" end="00:11:07.089" style="s2">reparations episode with I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.490" end="00:11:10.180" style="s2">Boheme</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.089" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">buying playing the the rapper mini gark</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.180" end="00:11:14.170" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about whether he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:15.699" style="s2">going to visit violence upon him but it</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.170" end="00:11:17.050" style="s2">turns out he&#39;s gonna visit a lawsuit yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.699" end="00:11:20.290" style="s2">yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.050" end="00:11:23.170" style="s2">but then you have like these cultural</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.290" end="00:11:28.779" style="s2">examples of like you know like Katy</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.170" end="00:11:32.410" style="s2">Perry or Miley Cyrus wearing cornrows</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.779" end="00:11:35.920" style="s2">like Kim Kardashian wearing cornrows in</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.410" end="00:11:37.870" style="s2">a Kardashian like Beauty photoshoot</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.920" end="00:11:41.529" style="s2">which I find completely preposterous no</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.850" end="00:11:52.749" style="s2">okay I don&#39;t see it that way and so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:54.639" style="s2">that&#39;s a discourse that I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.749" end="00:11:56.110" style="s2">you&#39;re right exists is like a proxy</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.639" end="00:11:58.509" style="s2">discourse because people are afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.110" end="00:12:00.430" style="s2">confront the deeper more complex issues</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.509" end="00:12:02.470" style="s2">well I think that in you have one set of</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.430" end="00:12:06.999" style="s2">legitimate issues acting as the stalking</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.470" end="00:12:09.059" style="s2">horse for this infernal shake tenem my</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.999" end="00:12:12.220" style="s2">hatred of this comes from the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.059" end="00:12:15.009" style="s2">if American Jews who have made it</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.220" end="00:12:17.079" style="s2">financially in one generation are</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.009" end="00:12:19.089" style="s2">somehow safe and secure and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.079" end="00:12:21.610" style="s2">privileged hmm something is entirely</p>

<p begin="00:12:29.050" end="00:12:32.499" style="s2">privileged yes and should be worried</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.730" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">about their privilege it&#39;s just this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.499" end="00:12:36.069" style="s2">stupid</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.040" end="00:12:38.620" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a silly argument and I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.069" end="00:12:41.319" style="s2">you know I get into spats about listen</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.620" end="00:12:43.660" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m frequently accused of like being</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.799" end="00:13:21.070" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying is that as a person who</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.070" end="00:13:25.450" style="s2">culture I can view the legacy of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.470" end="00:13:27.520" style="s2">American slavery at a critical distance</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.450" end="00:13:31.810" style="s2">in a way that American people may not be</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.520" end="00:13:34.600" style="s2">able to write because in Russia you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.810" end="00:13:37.110" style="s2">a parallel system called serfdom right</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.600" end="00:13:39.250" style="s2">these the slaves and the serfs were</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.050" end="00:18:16.440" style="s2">like let&#39;s say an insurance policy</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.200" end="00:18:17.880" style="s2">mm-hmm all right so for example if</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.150" end="00:18:42.420" style="s2">of socializes some of the risk and at</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.990" end="00:18:47.700" style="s2">the same time you might buy some kind of</p>

<p begin="00:18:59.850" end="00:19:03.270" style="s2">of these older structures when people</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.320" end="00:19:05.700" style="s2">talk about American families are weak</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.270" end="00:19:07.500" style="s2">what they usually mean is is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.700" end="00:19:09.870" style="s2">American markets have been regular and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.500" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">strong enough that people have leaned</p>

<p begin="00:19:19.980" end="00:19:25.740" style="s2">various needs like instead of having you</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.040" end="00:19:27.900" style="s2">know a mother come and be with a child</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.740" end="00:19:30.900" style="s2">with a new babies do your laundry well</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.900" end="00:19:33.480" style="s2">yeah that you hire somebody to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.900" end="00:19:36.510" style="s2">the idea is if the market is working in</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.480" end="00:19:39.350" style="s2">some sense the family starts to fall</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.510" end="00:19:42.510" style="s2">apart because you don&#39;t need it right</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.350" end="00:19:44.250" style="s2">exactly yeah and you know people are</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.510" end="00:19:46.200" style="s2">smart they know that like seven eight</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.250" end="00:19:48.210" style="s2">years of psychoanalysis is a very tall</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.190" end="00:20:05.060" style="s2">think that the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.300" end="00:20:07.760" style="s2">part of the kind of psycho let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.060" end="00:20:09.620" style="s2">like the psychological anima of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.760" end="00:20:12.620" style="s2">market is that it provides people yet</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.620" end="00:20:14.540" style="s2">with a scaffolding and infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.620" end="00:20:22.970" style="s2">through which to relieve themselves of</p>

<p begin="00:20:22.970" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">the things that&#39;s interesting to me is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.260" end="00:20:30.590" style="s2">is that you&#39;re coming from a background</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:34.270" style="s2">which is very familiar to me where you</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.590" end="00:20:37.330" style="s2">have a Jewish Armenian parentage and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.270" end="00:20:40.010" style="s2">your father is a famous mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.330" end="00:20:43.900" style="s2">working in linear programming sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.010" end="00:20:47.930" style="s2">optimization science and came up with</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.900" end="00:20:49.400" style="s2">this amazing algorithm that changed our</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.350" end="00:21:22.790" style="s2">if I described her like this because you</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.570" end="00:21:25.910" style="s2">know she&#39;s gonna listen to this she is</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.790" end="00:21:28.700" style="s2">an artist but I who became a housewife</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.910" end="00:21:30.500" style="s2">basically okay and I think that she is</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.700" end="00:21:33.800" style="s2">the great genius of the family she&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.500" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">great kind of organizing and destructive</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.800" end="00:21:40.010" style="s2">force in my family lets it just seem</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:41.330" style="s2">very often in so I have to say that when</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.010" end="00:21:43.040" style="s2">we had this lunch which you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:51.680" style="s2">to drink</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.760" end="00:21:54.410" style="s2">I don&#39;t really know okay my first Power</p>

<p begin="00:21:56.930" end="00:22:01.700" style="s2">I have I have to drink okay well very</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:03.380" style="s2">good milk at all lunches I didn&#39;t smoke</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.700" end="00:22:05.660" style="s2">you didn&#39;t smoke but I&#39;m such a neurotic</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.380" end="00:22:07.040" style="s2">I&#39;m so shy I was telling you that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.660" end="00:22:10.070" style="s2">can&#39;t you know I have to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.040" end="00:22:12.110" style="s2">occupy is that because you&#39;re reveling</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.070" end="00:22:13.700" style="s2">in your neuroticism no no no I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.110" end="00:22:15.650" style="s2">like a Woody Allen person I don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.700" end="00:22:19.700" style="s2">off on it oh you sure something that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.650" end="00:22:22.310" style="s2">hope to shed with a okay the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.700" end="00:22:23.000" style="s2">accumulation of experience like a vision</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.310" end="00:22:24.620" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.000" end="00:22:26.450" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not something I think you</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.620" end="00:22:31.070" style="s2">should look up to and yourself I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.450" end="00:22:33.950" style="s2">know but yeah I think that my mom is</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.070" end="00:22:39.170" style="s2">kind of like a bizarre freewheeling</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.950" end="00:22:41.510" style="s2">artistic genius a true eccentric and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.170" end="00:22:44.030" style="s2">think that I derive a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.510" end="00:22:47.030" style="s2">personality and my tendency toward</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.030" end="00:22:49.370" style="s2">critique from her I mean she&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.030" end="00:22:50.930" style="s2">spinning paranoid polemics about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.370" end="00:22:53.180" style="s2">world it&#39;s really quite impressive and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.930" end="00:22:55.490" style="s2">she&#39;s right most of the time I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.180" end="00:22:57.110" style="s2">it&#39;s very strange that I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.490" end="00:23:00.920" style="s2">really actually echoes your earlier</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.110" end="00:23:03.820" style="s2">point that we tend to see accomplishment</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.920" end="00:23:06.650" style="s2">only if it shows up in the workplace and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.820" end="00:23:08.450" style="s2">for a lot of us coming from kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.650" end="00:23:12.140" style="s2">ethnic families for lack of a better</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.450" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">word very often people who were inside</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.140" end="00:23:16.460" style="s2">the home were well known to be the local</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:17.630" style="s2">genius the eccentric of the life for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.460" end="00:23:20.930" style="s2">whatever mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.630" end="00:23:23.000" style="s2">it was not clear in any way that if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.930" end="00:23:24.740" style="s2">were the shimano salesman that that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.000" end="00:23:27.590" style="s2">really the higher expression of the two</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.740" end="00:23:28.820" style="s2">people in a marriage hmm and it happens</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.590" end="00:23:31.550" style="s2">that your father did something very</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.820" end="00:23:31.850" style="s2">creative yes in a very analytic context</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.550" end="00:23:34.040" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.850" end="00:23:36.290" style="s2">hardly surprising like there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.040" end="00:23:38.720" style="s2">at all surprising to me that your mom</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.290" end="00:23:41.450" style="s2">might mostly be at home with the family</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:43.430" style="s2">and be the major force of the family</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.450" end="00:23:49.100" style="s2">yeah and I think like you know my dad</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.430" end="00:23:51.680" style="s2">probably gets all the credit for being</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.100" end="00:23:53.480" style="s2">kind of the genius um my haters like to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.680" end="00:23:56.510" style="s2">point out that I&#39;m coasting off of my</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.480" end="00:23:58.160" style="s2">father&#39;s accomplishments which is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.510" end="00:24:00.590" style="s2">true because I&#39;m actually way more</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.160" end="00:24:04.910" style="s2">famous than him on reddit so they&#39;re do</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.590" end="00:24:08.570" style="s2">yeah there you go he would be so I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.910" end="00:24:12.290" style="s2">here to disgrace my family name but</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.570" end="00:24:14.750" style="s2">basically I think that it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.290" end="00:24:16.910" style="s2">interesting this this kind of old</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.750" end="00:24:19.190" style="s2">breakdown of my parents marriage is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.910" end="00:24:22.970" style="s2">very instructive example of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.190" end="00:24:24.470" style="s2">women wield unofficial power through the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.970" end="00:24:27.360" style="s2">domestic sphere again it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.470" end="00:24:31.380" style="s2">unofficially the language is even wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.360" end="00:24:35.400" style="s2">to me it&#39;s like in what world do we not</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.380" end="00:24:37.080" style="s2">I guess the idea is that it&#39;s official</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.400" end="00:24:39.240" style="s2">if it shows up in Wikipedia and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.080" end="00:24:40.680" style="s2">unofficial if it only shows up in family</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.240" end="00:24:42.900" style="s2">well I think it&#39;s official if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.680" end="00:24:44.610" style="s2">getting officially compensated for it</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.900" end="00:24:46.680" style="s2">right well this is the issue of kin work</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.610" end="00:24:49.530" style="s2">that I bring up which is that I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.680" end="00:24:51.780" style="s2">that a lot of the wage gap work is</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.530" end="00:24:54.360" style="s2">extremely weak and manipulative but I</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.780" end="00:24:56.670" style="s2">think it&#39;s also the case that the real</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.360" end="00:25:00.360" style="s2">wage gap is that you have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.670" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">how to compensate for kin work you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.360" end="00:25:06.120" style="s2">taking care of elders relatives or young</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:07.830" style="s2">children and that you can arguably say</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.120" end="00:25:10.500" style="s2">that women should be paid more on</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.830" end="00:25:12.510" style="s2">average because that is uncompensated</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.500" end="00:25:13.650" style="s2">work and it has to show up somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.510" end="00:25:17.610" style="s2">sometimes it would show up and like</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.650" end="00:25:19.590" style="s2">prestige the matriarch of a large family</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.610" end="00:25:22.350" style="s2">is kind of a pretty impressive position</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.590" end="00:25:24.300" style="s2">to hold and that with smaller families</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.350" end="00:25:27.030" style="s2">it&#39;s no longer so cool to be grandma</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.300" end="00:25:29.610" style="s2">yeah sure and I think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.030" end="00:25:32.430" style="s2">general disrespect for the institution</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.610" end="00:25:34.200" style="s2">of motherhood let&#39;s talk about that what</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.430" end="00:25:37.710" style="s2">I tell is that in the culture at large</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.200" end="00:25:39.690" style="s2">particularly on the left so that this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.710" end="00:25:42.390" style="s2">something which I totally resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.690" end="00:25:43.770" style="s2">like when did the left go and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.390" end="00:25:45.480" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna claim oh we&#39;re not anti</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.770" end="00:25:48.360" style="s2">family but there is some weird anti</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.480" end="00:25:51.170" style="s2">family thing um I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.360" end="00:25:53.160" style="s2">absolutely a kind of collective defense</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.170" end="00:25:55.280" style="s2">mechanism because we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.160" end="00:25:58.730" style="s2">people much like myself who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.280" end="00:26:01.500" style="s2">Millennials in their late 20s early 30s</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.730" end="00:26:04.500" style="s2">you know my father&#39;s always used to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.500" end="00:26:06.840" style="s2">like well Ana you can&#39;t really ascend in</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.500" end="00:26:08.130" style="s2">class you know contrary to the myth of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.840" end="00:26:10.470" style="s2">the American Dream but you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.130" end="00:26:12.300" style="s2">fall in class either and now we&#39;re faced</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.470" end="00:26:14.250" style="s2">as a generation that&#39;s quite a bit like</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.300" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">the Lost Generation and in Russia my</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.250" end="00:26:18.240" style="s2">father&#39;s generation all of whom who</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:22.860" style="s2">drank themselves to death by the age of</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.240" end="00:26:24.840" style="s2">you know 52 which is this millennial</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.860" end="00:26:26.670" style="s2">generation of people like myself your</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.840" end="00:26:28.170" style="s2">dad was two years younger than I am now</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.670" end="00:26:31.680" style="s2">when he died of a heart</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.170" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">yes yeah and you know he died in in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.680" end="00:26:35.940" style="s2">United States but I think that he is</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.120" end="00:26:40.830" style="s2">part of the same generational trend what</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.940" end="00:26:43.830" style="s2">year was the in 2005 but</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.830" end="00:26:45.420" style="s2">there are a lot of people my age who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.830" end="00:26:46.860" style="s2">confront male and female who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.420" end="00:26:51.390" style="s2">confronting for the first time the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.860" end="00:26:54.180" style="s2">reality that they will actually fall in</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.390" end="00:26:54.900" style="s2">class and especially relative to their</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.180" end="00:26:57.930" style="s2">parents</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.900" end="00:27:00.810" style="s2">they&#39;ve never owned property they will</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.930" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">never pay off their student debt they</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.810" end="00:27:07.470" style="s2">will never have a safe and dependable</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:10.080" style="s2">health care situation they will never be</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.470" end="00:27:13.140" style="s2">able to afford children and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.080" end="00:27:15.180" style="s2">kind of broadly anti-natal list trend on</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.140" end="00:27:17.820" style="s2">the left is a psychological defense</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.180" end="00:27:19.830" style="s2">mechanism because you have to reframe I</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.820" end="00:27:21.930" style="s2">think in the neoliberal framework you</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.830" end="00:27:25.170" style="s2">have to reframe all adversity as</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.930" end="00:27:27.780" style="s2">opportunity and what they&#39;re saying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.170" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">themselves don&#39;t be burdened by babies</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.780" end="00:27:32.580" style="s2">yeah my breasts will be undeformed by</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:34.800" style="s2">breastfeed yes I&#39;m a girl boss I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.580" end="00:27:39.450" style="s2">need a man I&#39;m an independent strong</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.800" end="00:27:41.460" style="s2">independent right so they&#39;ve had to kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.450" end="00:27:43.890" style="s2">of rather this will work out for a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.460" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">minority of the people who claim this to</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.890" end="00:27:51.150" style="s2">be true that&#39;s not BS which yes is how</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:53.550" style="s2">broadly this plan is likely yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.150" end="00:27:54.930" style="s2">applicable it is across I mean I started</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.550" end="00:27:56.550" style="s2">noticing I actually got a lot of flack</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.930" end="00:28:00.270" style="s2">for this and I still don&#39;t know why I</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.550" end="00:28:03.270" style="s2">started noticing in the pop lyrics of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.270" end="00:28:06.750" style="s2">the last two decades are so kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.270" end="00:28:09.330" style="s2">minut shift you can go back as far as</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.750" end="00:28:11.310" style="s2">actually the 1960s I remember this</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.330" end="00:28:13.590" style="s2">interview with Amy Winehouse where she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.310" end="00:28:18.860" style="s2">like you know I much I much more prefer</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.590" end="00:28:22.470" style="s2">I gravitate toward the music of the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.860" end="00:28:26.400" style="s2">in the 50s 60s whatever as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.470" end="00:28:29.220" style="s2">the music of the 2000s because in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.400" end="00:28:32.460" style="s2">kind of female vocalists of the 60s they</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.220" end="00:28:35.880" style="s2">expressed kind of a longing a yearning</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.460" end="00:28:38.430" style="s2">for companionship and love a desire to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.880" end="00:28:41.100" style="s2">subordinate themselves to the will of</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.430" end="00:28:42.510" style="s2">others or something greater than</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.100" end="00:28:44.070" style="s2">themselves let&#39;s put it that way that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.510" end="00:28:46.110" style="s2">feminists have interpreted as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.070" end="00:28:50.940" style="s2">fundamentally kind of misogynistic or</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.110" end="00:28:53.340" style="s2">sexist outlook whereas now you know with</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.940" end="00:28:54.780" style="s2">the coming of somebody like Beyonce you</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.340" end="00:28:57.870" style="s2">have these lyrics that literally</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.780" end="00:28:59.340" style="s2">like I don&#39;t need you I don&#39;t need a man</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.870" end="00:29:02.310" style="s2">all men are trash I&#39;m gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.340" end="00:29:08.090" style="s2">stacking my bills and it&#39;s it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.310" end="00:29:10.920" style="s2">form of feminism the I find to be very</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.090" end="00:29:12.900" style="s2">callous and creepiness and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.920" end="00:29:14.820" style="s2">counterproductive actually I mean let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.900" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">take what you just said it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.820" end="00:29:24.230" style="s2">weirdly on both sides of the gender</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:28.920" style="s2">aisle for example let&#39;s say John Denver</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.230" end="00:29:31.380" style="s2">when he sings about you know as I kiss</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.920" end="00:29:35.220" style="s2">me and smile for me to me that you way</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.380" end="00:29:37.350" style="s2">he talks about um when I come back I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.220" end="00:29:39.330" style="s2">bring your wedding ring mm-hmm like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.350" end="00:29:41.880" style="s2">excited about the fact that he&#39;s screwed</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.330" end="00:29:46.260" style="s2">up in this relationship he says I played</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.880" end="00:29:47.820" style="s2">around and then he says but I realize</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.260" end="00:29:50.360" style="s2">how important this is and I&#39;m gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.820" end="00:29:53.310" style="s2">it right and I&#39;m excited about becoming</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.360" end="00:29:56.370" style="s2">betrothed to you right I&#39;m gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.310" end="00:29:58.110" style="s2">amends well not only make amends I you</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.370" end="00:30:00.690" style="s2">know like when Beyonce I mean just to</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.110" end="00:30:01.860" style="s2">connect these two data points she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.690" end="00:30:03.660" style="s2">saying if you like it you should put a</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.860" end="00:30:06.900" style="s2">ring on it like she that&#39;s really what</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.660" end="00:30:08.940" style="s2">she wanted mm-hmm but like you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.900" end="00:30:10.620" style="s2">you didn&#39;t exercise your option is very</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.940" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">transactional mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.620" end="00:30:14.640" style="s2">so now I&#39;m up I&#39;m up in the club getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:17.910" style="s2">jiggy with this other guy you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.640" end="00:30:19.950" style="s2">be upset yeah yeah sure it&#39;s it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.910" end="00:30:23.190" style="s2">a very kind of transactional ethos that</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.950" end="00:30:25.530" style="s2">permeates all like there is this like</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.190" end="00:30:27.840" style="s2">kind of stupid trend on Twitter were</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.530" end="00:30:29.910" style="s2">people or that people were mocking</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:32.550" style="s2">because other people were tweeting out</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.910" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">kind of empathy templates so you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.550" end="00:30:35.490" style="s2">somebody texts you and they&#39;re like hey</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:37.650" style="s2">I&#39;m like really going through a hard</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.490" end="00:30:38.730" style="s2">time you know I&#39;m having it getting a</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.650" end="00:30:41.340" style="s2">divorce my mom is dying of cancer</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.730" end="00:30:42.930" style="s2">whatever you fire back with like hey I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.340" end="00:30:45.420" style="s2">currently at capacity do you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.930" end="00:30:47.250" style="s2">somebody else who slash I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.420" end="00:30:49.920" style="s2">through some personal problems to slash</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.250" end="00:30:52.710" style="s2">and it&#39;s like a kind of prefabricated</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.920" end="00:30:58.790" style="s2">template for how you should respond to a</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.710" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">person in need Wow yeah the lucky you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.790" end="00:31:03.360" style="s2">you&#39;re so lucky that all this stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:06.270" style="s2">way over your head I have to live with</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:09.030" style="s2">this every day and it shrinks my will</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.270" end="00:31:12.110" style="s2">and libido to live but it</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.030" end="00:31:14.460" style="s2">like this kind of thing that is hyper</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.110" end="00:31:16.830" style="s2">transactional all relations have become</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.460" end="00:31:18.570" style="s2">so transactional all relationship I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.830" end="00:31:22.200" style="s2">look my take on this is that all</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.570" end="00:31:24.360" style="s2">relationships have an aspect of exchange</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.200" end="00:31:27.450" style="s2">great but that what distinguishes the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.360" end="00:31:29.450" style="s2">transactional from the rich relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.450" end="00:31:33.780" style="s2">is how many layers of indirection</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.450" end="00:31:34.950" style="s2">separate the people involved from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.780" end="00:31:37.080" style="s2">exchange yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.950" end="00:31:39.390" style="s2">so dinner in a movie is a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.080" end="00:31:42.300" style="s2">abstract than turning a trick on a</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.390" end="00:31:44.220" style="s2">street corner yeah and then you go</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.300" end="00:31:48.060" style="s2">further you know with courtship it</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.220" end="00:31:50.280" style="s2">becomes incredibly distant in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.060" end="00:31:52.560" style="s2">the number of layers and what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.280" end="00:31:55.100" style="s2">recognize is that those layers of</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.560" end="00:31:58.170" style="s2">indirection are essential to a rich life</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.100" end="00:32:01.320" style="s2">yeah a new rich emotional life and what</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.170" end="00:32:04.650" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with now are people who if</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.320" end="00:32:07.740" style="s2">they are not economically impoverished</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.650" end="00:32:13.170" style="s2">or spiritually impoverished because they</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.740" end="00:32:17.430" style="s2">have no institutions or values on which</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.170" end="00:32:20.040" style="s2">to depend okay so this gets me back to</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.430" end="00:32:22.950" style="s2">like you&#39;re crazy podcast yeah and your</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.040" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">persona so first of all I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.950" end="00:32:28.140" style="s2">playing with all sorts of associations</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.200" end="00:32:30.840" style="s2">and breaking them in ways that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.140" end="00:32:32.910" style="s2">indicia and the underlying like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.840" end="00:32:35.370" style="s2">proximate and ultimate are separated so</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.910" end="00:32:37.830" style="s2">I normally associate vocal fry&#39; and up</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.370" end="00:32:40.110" style="s2">talking with stupidity right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.830" end="00:32:41.970" style="s2">associate it with your level of insight</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.110" end="00:32:44.970" style="s2">and commentary right you guys sound</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.970" end="00:32:47.670" style="s2">stoned out of your mind and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.970" end="00:32:49.970" style="s2">tremendous amount of vocal fry&#39; but what</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.670" end="00:32:52.110" style="s2">it speaks to is this like crazy</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.970" end="00:32:54.990" style="s2">metacognitive distance that you and your</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.110" end="00:32:59.250" style="s2">co-host have from the topics that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.990" end="00:33:02.220" style="s2">discussing and you&#39;re sort of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.250" end="00:33:03.900" style="s2">constantly be mused by this sort of very</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.220" end="00:33:08.580" style="s2">weird period of the human condition is</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.900" end="00:33:11.160" style="s2">that wrong um I think I&#39;ve been used as</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.580" end="00:33:14.250" style="s2">a nice way of putting it I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.160" end="00:33:14.610" style="s2">really we&#39;re very frustrated what do you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.250" end="00:33:18.450" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.610" end="00:33:20.070" style="s2">I I don&#39;t know we&#39;re what like all women</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.450" end="00:33:22.050" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what we want no I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.070" end="00:33:23.310" style="s2">think I want you do know what you want I</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.050" end="00:33:26.070" style="s2">think I want I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.310" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">on it on a kind of broad social level I</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.070" end="00:33:30.170" style="s2">think that we have to take kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:34.860" style="s2">old Nietzschean adage God is dead right</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.170" end="00:33:36.030" style="s2">people always interpret that as you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.860" end="00:33:37.680" style="s2">I think people have a tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.030" end="00:33:40.200" style="s2">interpret it as God is dead and</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.680" end="00:33:42.990" style="s2">therefore we can get like weird septum</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.200" end="00:33:45.330" style="s2">piercings and tattoos sleeves and go</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.990" end="00:33:47.670" style="s2">fucking and sucking and polyamorous</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.330" end="00:33:49.260" style="s2">arrangements and that&#39;s not at all what</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.670" end="00:33:53.730" style="s2">he meant he meant God is dead and no it</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.260" end="00:33:56.310" style="s2">is up to secular humanity to replace the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.730" end="00:33:59.210" style="s2">value system that was evacuated with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.310" end="00:34:02.370" style="s2">death of God with an equally viable one</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.210" end="00:34:05.370" style="s2">do you think that&#39;s possible no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.370" end="00:34:07.230" style="s2">know but I you know what else can we do</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.370" end="00:34:10.110" style="s2">you know Josh always says to me like you</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.230" end="00:34:13.250" style="s2">have to stay cheerful in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.110" end="00:34:17.640" style="s2">adversity like the Greeks yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.250" end="00:34:18.750" style="s2">well all right so I mean in part and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.640" end="00:34:19.679" style="s2">don&#39;t know how long the show is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.750" end="00:34:25.130" style="s2">get away with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.679" end="00:34:27.780" style="s2">yeah but ultimately it&#39;s about for me</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.130" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">recognizing what the religious impulse</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.780" end="00:34:34.050" style="s2">was it was a load-bearing structure of</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:37.140" style="s2">our civilization because it caused you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.050" end="00:34:39.450" style="s2">to think in intergenerational terms like</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.140" end="00:34:41.880" style="s2">in our the shared part of our tradition</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.450" end="00:34:43.950" style="s2">the Jewish tradition the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.880" end="00:34:46.169" style="s2">generation to generation goes under the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.950" end="00:34:48.210" style="s2">name the door of a door mm-hmm from</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.169" end="00:34:50.880" style="s2">generation to generation and that thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.210" end="00:34:54.270" style="s2">about you have to be seeing yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.880" end="00:34:56.850" style="s2">have to subordinate and submit and like</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.609" end="00:36:23.089" style="s2">magic of giving your power to somebody</p>

<p begin="00:36:36.249" end="00:36:41.749" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in motherhood like for</p>

<p begin="00:36:41.749" end="00:36:45.680" style="s2">general yeah I mean I think this is the</p>

<p begin="00:36:45.680" end="00:36:52.029" style="s2">on the planet and it really matters I</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.489" end="00:36:54.949" style="s2">mean this is one of the things that a</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.949" end="00:37:00.859" style="s2">a sigh at some point and said you want</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.519" end="00:37:02.660" style="s2">to know something magical look at your</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.859" end="00:37:04.849" style="s2">children that&#39;s what happens when a PhD</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.849" end="00:37:08.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s just like are you getting a</p>

<p begin="00:37:14.359" end="00:37:18.829" style="s2">my wife is out of the workforce for like</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.249" end="00:37:21.199" style="s2">ten years or something and you know she</p>

<p begin="00:37:21.199" end="00:37:29.299" style="s2">mentally guns blazing yeah but I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.759" end="00:37:30.979" style="s2">that this hatred of motherhood has to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.299" end="00:37:32.630" style="s2">acknowledged first of all it&#39;s denied</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.979" end="00:37:34.339" style="s2">but we don&#39;t hate mother we just think</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.630" end="00:37:35.749" style="s2">it&#39;s about choice but you look at it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.339" end="00:37:36.109" style="s2">the mommies who work in the mommies who</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.749" end="00:37:41.569" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.109" end="00:37:47.089" style="s2">hmm one gender is built to reproduce our</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.569" end="00:37:50.240" style="s2">species and I just I can&#39;t stand what</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.089" end="00:37:53.120" style="s2">we&#39;ve done to it yeah and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.240" end="00:37:55.880" style="s2">kind of no honoring also among men or</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.120" end="00:37:59.270" style="s2">women of the gender difference which</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.880" end="00:38:07.340" style="s2">exists it&#39;s very real and palpable and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.270" end="00:38:09.320" style="s2">think feminists I have this idea that if</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.340" end="00:38:11.030" style="s2">we acknowledge that we&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.320" end="00:38:13.580" style="s2">we&#39;re acknowledging that we&#39;re unequal</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.030" end="00:38:15.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s not at all the case we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.580" end="00:38:17.600" style="s2">differently equal we&#39;re it differently</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.080" end="00:38:19.970" style="s2">abled well this is the weird thing if</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.600" end="00:38:22.000" style="s2">you try to make this argument at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.970" end="00:38:24.410" style="s2">level of like racial groups or</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.000" end="00:38:27.470" style="s2">geographically separated groups there</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.410" end="00:38:29.210" style="s2">really isn&#39;t a great way of saying that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.470" end="00:38:31.190" style="s2">there should be equality because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.210" end="00:38:33.950" style="s2">no reason that separated groups should</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.190" end="00:38:37.310" style="s2">have variables having common means</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.950" end="00:38:40.420" style="s2">within a group there actually is this</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.310" end="00:38:43.540" style="s2">weird principle of a Fisher the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.420" end="00:38:47.330" style="s2">biological theorist hmm which says that</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.540" end="00:38:49.340" style="s2">it is as good to be female as male from</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.330" end="00:38:53.960" style="s2">the perspective of the fitness of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.340" end="00:38:55.910" style="s2">two genders of strategy right and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.960" end="00:38:58.780" style="s2">problem with it is that you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.910" end="00:39:01.850" style="s2">have what fails is what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.780" end="00:39:03.770" style="s2">the Ginger Rogers principle so the old</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.850" end="00:39:05.210" style="s2">as the joke goes Ginger Rogers could do</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.770" end="00:39:06.530" style="s2">everything Fred Astaire could do but</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.210" end="00:39:09.320" style="s2">backwards and in heels</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.530" end="00:39:10.940" style="s2">and the feminist version of this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.320" end="00:39:12.410" style="s2">women are as good or better at</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.940" end="00:39:15.860" style="s2">everything men can do except peeing</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.410" end="00:39:20.000" style="s2">standing up and that can&#39;t possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.860" end="00:39:22.250" style="s2">the case if Fisher&#39;s theory is to hold</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:24.590" style="s2">because then women would simply be</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.250" end="00:39:26.390" style="s2">better yes unless peeing standing up was</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.590" end="00:39:30.800" style="s2">like the be-all and end-all which I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.390" end="00:39:32.840" style="s2">it&#39;s good but it&#39;s not that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.800" end="00:39:35.420" style="s2">the problem which is if you if you claim</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.840" end="00:39:36.650" style="s2">that you&#39;re better at something biology</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.420" end="00:39:38.120" style="s2">tells you you have to be worse at</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.650" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">something else all right so that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.120" end="00:39:43.220" style="s2">a kind of an implicit trade-off right or</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:45.800" style="s2">balance let&#39;s say well then it gets to</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.220" end="00:39:47.120" style="s2">this really like here&#39;s here let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.800" end="00:39:50.300" style="s2">into trouble with psychologists and</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.120" end="00:39:52.400" style="s2">psychiatrists okay the whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.300" end="00:39:53.800" style="s2">codependence concept yes there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.400" end="00:39:56.660" style="s2">something which is really dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.800" end="00:39:59.300" style="s2">but a lot of interdependence is labeled</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.660" end="00:40:00.710" style="s2">as codependent hmm and the modern notion</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.300" end="00:40:02.270" style="s2">that you should be a completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.710" end="00:40:03.920" style="s2">functional person who can do everything</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.270" end="00:40:05.990" style="s2">and able to walk out on a</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.920" end="00:40:09.170" style="s2">elements notice mm-hmm that completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.990" end="00:40:12.020" style="s2">destroys the concept of coupling yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.170" end="00:40:15.500" style="s2">mean I think this all goes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.020" end="00:40:18.829" style="s2">atomizing logic of the market and all my</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.500" end="00:40:22.309" style="s2">big issue I think my big critique kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.829" end="00:40:24.920" style="s2">of the central organizing theme of my my</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.309" end="00:40:27.980" style="s2">work right is this idea that a</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.920" end="00:40:30.470" style="s2">progressive activism is now effectively</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.980" end="00:40:33.559" style="s2">marching in lockstep with the very</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.470" end="00:40:36.020" style="s2">market imperatives that they are opposed</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.559" end="00:40:37.549" style="s2">to on the face of things it&#39;s Madden in</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.020" end="00:40:39.400" style="s2">its sowing it&#39;s so intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.549" end="00:40:42.859" style="s2">incoherent it&#39;s kind of amazing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.400" end="00:40:46.099" style="s2">it&#39;s still hanging together as a pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.859" end="00:40:49.089" style="s2">philosophy yeah all right so now like I</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.099" end="00:40:51.829" style="s2">feel like you&#39;re revealed you&#39;re somehow</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.089" end="00:40:55.809" style="s2">reveling on your podcast and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.829" end="00:41:00.319" style="s2">like really dangerous kind of memes</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.809" end="00:41:05.030" style="s2">which suggests you know royalty plunged</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.319" end="00:41:07.760" style="s2">into boredom and cocaine and and want</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.030" end="00:41:09.589" style="s2">and sexuality but in fact underneath it</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.760" end="00:41:13.280" style="s2">you&#39;re coming from an academic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.589" end="00:41:15.290" style="s2">and you know embracing very traditional</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.280" end="00:41:18.109" style="s2">values there&#39;s no reason to leave</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.290" end="00:41:19.520" style="s2">left-of-center thinking because</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.109" end="00:41:21.380" style="s2">traditionally what it what is the left</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.520" end="00:41:23.839" style="s2">bin it&#39;s been about empowering working</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.380" end="00:41:25.220" style="s2">families right and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.839" end="00:41:26.690" style="s2">interested in it&#39;s funny that has so</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.220" end="00:41:28.280" style="s2">many of my critics and I if you really</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.690" end="00:41:30.230" style="s2">look at us it&#39;s like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.280" end="00:41:31.970" style="s2">narcissism the narcissism of small</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.230" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">differences like we are completely</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.970" end="00:41:38.750" style="s2">indistinguishable to like an Afghani fig</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:41.630" style="s2">farmer yeah you know 99% of our politics</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.750" end="00:41:44.619" style="s2">are equivalent are they I&#39;m sure I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.630" end="00:41:47.960" style="s2">like who are you pissing off you know I</p>

<p begin="00:50:45.840" end="00:50:49.320" style="s2">because but this is this thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.340" end="00:50:52.410" style="s2">called the gated institutional narrative</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.320" end="00:50:54.450" style="s2">it was protected against reality I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.410" end="00:50:56.220" style="s2">I know whether because of their you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.450" end="00:50:59.580" style="s2">to publish like a coffee table book of</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.220" end="00:51:02.930" style="s2">you&#39;re like coinages and neologisms</p>

<p begin="00:51:02.930" end="00:51:08.430" style="s2">that could actually be fun yeah one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.390" end="00:51:10.860" style="s2">the things that is again this is this</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.430" end="00:51:11.160" style="s2">shows you how twisted my soul is but as</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.860" end="00:51:12.900" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.160" end="00:51:16.050" style="s2">last time I sometimes watch the last</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.900" end="00:51:19.290" style="s2">days of the Cheska&#39;s and Romania huh</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.050" end="00:51:25.160" style="s2">because like right up until the end</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.290" end="00:51:30.600" style="s2">pornhub and Google yeah execution right</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.160" end="00:51:34.710" style="s2">your Slavic milk yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.600" end="00:51:37.370" style="s2">much like there&#39;s a rally and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.710" end="00:51:39.810" style="s2">the rally goes out of control mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.370" end="00:51:42.090" style="s2">order has to be restored and the cameras</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.810" end="00:51:45.060" style="s2">have to break the filming of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.090" end="00:51:47.550" style="s2">going on and so right at the end they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.060" end="00:51:49.830" style="s2">got their shrinking group of loyalists</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.550" end="00:51:52.230" style="s2">we&#39;re still terrified that these people</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.830" end="00:51:53.580" style="s2">are going to you know regain power</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.230" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">because that&#39;s the way it&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.580" end="00:52:01.230" style="s2">but everywhere the spell is broken</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:52:04.260" style="s2">mm-hmm and I guess that&#39;s sort of what I</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.230" end="00:52:10.080" style="s2">saw is that this thing was just it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.260" end="00:52:12.060" style="s2">an American version of propaganda that</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.080" end="00:52:15.510" style="s2">had been so believed that when it</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.060" end="00:52:19.040" style="s2">started not to be true the organs just</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.510" end="00:52:20.940" style="s2">kept pumping out all of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.040" end="00:52:22.410" style="s2">encouragement that you know think</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.940" end="00:52:24.900" style="s2">Hillary is going to win there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.410" end="00:52:26.520" style="s2">question she&#39;s inevitable I mean even</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.900" end="00:52:28.170" style="s2">now they&#39;re running you know Kamal is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.520" end="00:52:31.140" style="s2">out so they&#39;re really going whole hog</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.170" end="00:52:33.990" style="s2">with boo to judge but it&#39;s yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.140" end="00:52:37.980" style="s2">a certain there&#39;s a certain lag between</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.990" end="00:52:41.190" style="s2">the progressive and trumpian and between</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.980" end="00:52:42.930" style="s2">kind of like traditional Democrats and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.190" end="00:52:47.570" style="s2">conservatives and the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.930" end="00:52:52.290" style="s2">administration and I think like Trump</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.570" end="00:52:53.520" style="s2">uniquely among world leaders possibly in</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.290" end="00:52:55.050" style="s2">the history of the world has been able</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.520" end="00:52:58.110" style="s2">to do this thing I mean I wrote a whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.050" end="00:53:02.040" style="s2">essay about it he was he was able to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.110" end="00:53:04.440" style="s2">what the Russian avant-garde and this</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.040" end="00:53:08.210" style="s2">the the socialist realists had been</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.440" end="00:53:12.840" style="s2">trying to do these two kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.210" end="00:53:14.310" style="s2">sequential propaganda like arms of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.840" end="00:53:17.880" style="s2">culture industry in the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.310" end="00:53:20.730" style="s2">which was maintained it which is achieve</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.880" end="00:53:23.460" style="s2">a total synthesis of the material and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.730" end="00:53:24.450" style="s2">the imaginable or the imaginative what</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.460" end="00:53:26.220" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.450" end="00:53:28.320" style="s2">sounds really good slow down and give it</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.220" end="00:53:30.390" style="s2">to me I mean what you know it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.320" end="00:53:32.460" style="s2">like the typical like Soviet avant-garde</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.390" end="00:53:34.770" style="s2">idea that we were creating a total</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.460" end="00:53:38.490" style="s2">synthesis of art in life like a single</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.770" end="00:53:40.470" style="s2">kind of art political project and Trump</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.490" end="00:53:45.000" style="s2">alone has been able to do this though</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.470" end="00:53:49.640" style="s2">crucially under a very capitalist not</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.000" end="00:53:53.550" style="s2">communist regime he&#39;s been able to marry</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.640" end="00:53:58.790" style="s2">what we it can I met like what we</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.550" end="00:54:01.980" style="s2">imagine and what is materially possible</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.790" end="00:54:07.619" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s been very ineffective in</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.980" end="00:54:11.040" style="s2">bringing in an entire like there is no</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.619" end="00:54:12.960" style="s2">theory of Trump yeah because almost no</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.040" end="00:54:15.660" style="s2">one either on his side or in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.960" end="00:54:18.510" style="s2">opposition side actually understands how</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.660" end="00:54:20.880" style="s2">much method he brings and it&#39;s cryptic</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.510" end="00:54:22.500" style="s2">so it looks you know it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.880" end="00:54:24.780" style="s2">indirection he understands and ER he</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.500" end="00:54:28.310" style="s2">does but he&#39;s got these formulas that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.780" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">can&#39;t tell you how bizarre it is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.310" end="00:54:32.640" style="s2">you probably know my friend Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.200" end="00:54:33.420" style="s2">it was sitting here and we were having</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.640" end="00:54:35.819" style="s2">this argument</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.420" end="00:54:39.030" style="s2">mm-hm friendly but an argument in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.819" end="00:54:42.000" style="s2">less rub the seat for good luck well</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.030" end="00:54:44.099" style="s2">rich stuff is that been in that chair as</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.000" end="00:54:45.750" style="s2">joe rogan ever sat in the seat not yet I</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.099" end="00:54:48.569" style="s2">have a crush on Joe Rogan I know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.750" end="00:54:50.400" style="s2">married but I think everyone yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.569" end="00:54:52.980" style="s2">think that he really could be the guy</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.400" end="00:54:54.780" style="s2">who could run and win against Trump he</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.980" end="00:54:59.790" style="s2">does not want me to talk about this okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.780" end="00:55:03.359" style="s2">okay you bring no because he&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.790" end="00:55:05.609" style="s2">he&#39;s got a great life yeah and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.359" end="00:55:07.170" style="s2">that everybody loves him causes people</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.609" end="00:55:08.400" style="s2">to sort of do weird things in his</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.170" end="00:55:10.680" style="s2">present he just wants to be a regular</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.400" end="00:55:13.890" style="s2">guy he&#39;s also you know and I don&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.680" end="00:55:16.079" style="s2">saying this behind Joe yeah yeah that he</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.890" end="00:55:19.380" style="s2">is not oh yeah yeah I mean he&#39;s running</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.079" end="00:55:23.190" style="s2">an incredible operation but whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.380" end="00:55:24.540" style="s2">is there&#39;s a lot of method there because</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.190" end="00:55:26.609" style="s2">if you think about how difficult it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.540" end="00:55:29.069" style="s2">to turn these shows out and to keep them</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.609" end="00:55:30.930" style="s2">fresh it&#39;s almost impossible so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.069" end="00:55:33.630" style="s2">a ton of genius going on in Joe&#39;s front</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.930" end="00:55:35.850" style="s2">he has not come yet but he we agreed to</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.630" end="00:55:39.330" style="s2">do each other&#39;s podcast</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.850" end="00:55:41.670" style="s2">what Sam did was to say that he Sam</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.330" end="00:55:43.680" style="s2">thought that Trump was the evil Chauncey</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.670" end="00:55:46.950" style="s2">Gardiner that that was his theory of</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.680" end="00:55:49.740" style="s2">mine and I thought that is insane I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.950" end="00:55:51.450" style="s2">it&#39;s not that Sam and I tried to have it</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.740" end="00:55:53.880" style="s2">out we can&#39;t see each other&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.450" end="00:55:56.810" style="s2">mm-hmm I&#39;m not saying that Sam is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.880" end="00:56:00.030" style="s2">but I see so much method to trumps</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.810" end="00:56:01.590" style="s2">trolling and he doesn&#39;t he thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.030" end="00:56:04.410" style="s2">this is all kind of like well I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.590" end="00:56:06.720" style="s2">what he does you know another thing I</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.410" end="00:56:08.609" style="s2">say is is that Sam is more focused on</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.720" end="00:56:11.280" style="s2">honesty and I&#39;m more focused on meta</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.609" end="00:56:13.470" style="s2">honesty Trump is not an honest person</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.280" end="00:56:15.930" style="s2">but in a weird way he is meta honest</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.470" end="00:56:18.540" style="s2">right so he&#39;s right when he says he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.930" end="00:56:24.380" style="s2">artist on a personal level he is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.540" end="00:56:28.050" style="s2">yeah so but what we care about is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.380" end="00:56:31.890" style="s2">like for example Trump knows the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.050" end="00:56:35.100" style="s2">liberal mind is automated and as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.890" end="00:56:37.500" style="s2">you break through one of its shibboleths</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.100" end="00:56:40.590" style="s2">it has an automated non-thinking</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.500" end="00:56:42.450" style="s2">reflexive reaction and he can map that</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.590" end="00:56:44.310" style="s2">and then you can say okay I&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.450" end="00:56:46.440" style="s2">something that will cause the reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.310" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">reaction but I will put something in</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.440" end="00:56:50.250" style="s2">place which is totally different so that</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.960" end="00:56:53.010" style="s2">when you have that reflexive reaction</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.250" end="00:56:55.440" style="s2">you will be shown to be not an npc</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.010" end="00:56:56.820" style="s2">mm-hmm well what&#39;s it am I am I allowed</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.440" end="00:56:59.070" style="s2">to look at my phone there is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.820" end="00:57:00.600" style="s2">hilarious tweet I will stall for you no</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.070" end="00:57:01.980" style="s2">that&#39;s okay I don&#39;t even have to but the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.600" end="00:57:04.440" style="s2">I have to look at my phone every ten</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.980" end="00:57:06.060" style="s2">minutes or else I die there is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.440" end="00:57:07.500" style="s2">tweet that he had today about Greta Thun</p>

<p begin="00:57:11.940" end="00:57:15.390" style="s2">mean the man has like the Midas touch</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.890" end="00:57:16.770" style="s2">when it comes to Twitter but I didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:57:16.770" end="00:57:23.369" style="s2">tweet you know so Greta is this</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.160" end="00:57:25.500" style="s2">self-described</p>

<p begin="00:57:29.609" end="00:57:36.570" style="s2">authenticity to her there&#39;s an entirely</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.130" end="00:57:38.850" style="s2">inauthentic complex that has settled her</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.570" end="00:57:41.190" style="s2">on her wants to use her the way the</p>

<p begin="00:57:43.530" end="00:57:48.700" style="s2">so in some sense Greta the actual human</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.680" end="00:57:52.089" style="s2">is also the charismatic megaphone</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.700" end="00:57:54.790" style="s2">of a propaganda campaign which is lying</p>

<p begin="00:57:54.790" end="00:57:58.839" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this real climate emergency</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.500" end="00:58:00.700" style="s2">yes you should be able to do a truthful</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.839" end="00:58:02.589" style="s2">campaign but that can&#39;t work so you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.700" end="00:58:05.050" style="s2">to do a lying campaign and you use an</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.589" end="00:58:07.570" style="s2">actual human being as your mascot so</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.050" end="00:58:09.849" style="s2">it&#39;s like layers and layers of confusion</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.570" end="00:58:11.640" style="s2">right and the idea of course is that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.849" end="00:58:15.760" style="s2">can&#39;t attack an autistic child</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.640" end="00:58:18.609" style="s2">particularly female 1 yeah and because</p>

<p begin="01:07:47.010" end="01:07:53.250" style="s2">blessing and burden of being a</p>

<p begin="01:08:32.920" end="01:08:40.060" style="s2">elite form of writing well Brett you</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.800" end="01:08:43.150" style="s2">know so Brett sat in your chair and we</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.060" end="01:08:45.370" style="s2">talked about this issue that I had</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.150" end="01:08:47.140" style="s2">accused him of privatizing our mutual</p>

<p begin="01:08:47.140" end="01:08:54.580" style="s2">milieu okay and he talked about the</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.580" end="01:08:56.230" style="s2">importance of the narrator his clay in</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.580" end="01:08:59.080" style="s2">less than zero</p>

<p begin="01:09:04.239" end="01:09:10.359" style="s2">accident but he&#39;s also just clinically</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.620" end="01:09:10.960" style="s2">kind of detailing well this is what</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.359" end="01:09:18.160" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.960" end="01:09:22.150" style="s2">hmm and you know somehow I brought up</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.160" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">Joan Didion mm-hmm in that session and</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.150" end="01:09:26.830" style="s2">he confessed that this was his favorite</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:29.680" style="s2">author and I think about her detachment</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.830" end="01:09:31.750" style="s2">where she was watching the sort of 60s</p>

<p begin="01:12:50.910" end="01:12:57.330" style="s2">I think most people don&#39;t sense that</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.660" end="01:13:00.120" style="s2">television got so weirdly good and it</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.330" end="01:13:01.380" style="s2">nobody was expecting that right but TV</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.120" end="01:13:04.920" style="s2">came out of nowhere</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.380" end="01:13:07.980" style="s2">modern TV has longer narrative arcs than</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.920" end="01:13:11.490" style="s2">any movie yes because the movie industry</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.980" end="01:13:13.380" style="s2">was completely eroded right because The</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.490" end="01:13:14.910" style="s2">Sopranos and Mad Men and all that</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.380" end="01:13:17.340" style="s2">figured out something we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.910" end="01:13:19.620" style="s2">understand yeah but I think TV is also</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.340" end="01:13:22.230" style="s2">like watching is meaningfully different</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.620" end="01:13:22.920" style="s2">from reading well I guess what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.230" end="01:13:26.340" style="s2">trying to say is</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.920" end="01:13:28.860" style="s2">that if you think about this from an</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.340" end="01:13:31.679" style="s2">evolutionary perspective there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.860" end="01:13:35.280" style="s2">an adaptive landscape for various forms</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.679" end="01:13:39.060" style="s2">of memetic dissemination of story</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.280" end="01:13:41.580" style="s2">narrative information and some of them</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.060" end="01:13:44.070" style="s2">have gotten terrible but like if you if</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.580" end="01:13:46.770" style="s2">you looked at 1970s television mm-hmm I</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.070" end="01:13:47.400" style="s2">went back to look at The Love Boat from</p>

<p begin="01:13:47.400" end="01:13:52.440" style="s2">it&#39;s unwatchable right and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.370" end="01:13:54.500" style="s2">imagine what Game of Thrones is weirdly</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.440" end="01:13:57.989" style="s2">strangely compelling yes it is yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.500" end="01:14:00.929" style="s2">the way in which movies like there was</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.989" end="01:14:04.739" style="s2">just this transfer of wealth from cinema</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.929" end="01:14:06.690" style="s2">into the idiot box and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.739" end="01:14:11.150" style="s2">fascinating because everything else</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.690" end="01:14:14.969" style="s2">tells us our long-form podcasting is a</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.150" end="01:14:17.250" style="s2">very strange parallel structure where</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.969" end="01:14:18.810" style="s2">our attention spans getting really long</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.250" end="01:14:20.640" style="s2">they are getting long somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.810" end="01:14:22.739" style="s2">somewhere yeah it&#39;s being transferred I</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.640" end="01:14:25.890" style="s2">mean you know I had this thought earlier</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.739" end="01:14:28.710" style="s2">today in my hungover state where it</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.890" end="01:14:30.540" style="s2">dawned on me I had a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.710" end="01:14:31.830" style="s2">kind of like a feminine imposter</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.540" end="01:14:33.390" style="s2">syndrome moment and I was like this is</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.830" end="01:14:35.489" style="s2">ridiculous that I&#39;m like going on this</p>

<p begin="01:14:43.980" end="01:14:47.550" style="s2">completely by the way to all the</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.960" end="01:14:52.469" style="s2">advertisers who just left the program</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.550" end="01:14:56.550" style="s2">it&#39;s been a great run yeah but then I</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.469" end="01:15:00.230" style="s2">think about it and I see that with</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.550" end="01:15:03.030" style="s2">podcasting there is the possibility of a</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.230" end="01:15:05.310" style="s2">revival of the era of the public</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.030" end="01:15:08.340" style="s2">intellectual which is something that</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.310" end="01:15:10.590" style="s2">people crave also like the new class</p>

<p begin="01:15:13.920" end="01:15:20.699" style="s2">will possibly be able to revive</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.440" end="01:15:24.540" style="s2">something like that image or social role</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.699" end="01:15:26.610" style="s2">which is important I think what I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.540" end="01:15:30.750" style="s2">you could also look at this a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.610" end="01:15:33.179" style="s2">like William Tell or you know Philip</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.750" end="01:15:35.850" style="s2">petit walking the tightrope between the</p>

<p begin="01:15:36.840" end="01:15:42.420" style="s2">citing is the idea that we could screw</p>

<p begin="01:15:42.420" end="01:15:47.370" style="s2">and reputations and I think that that</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.540" end="01:15:49.800" style="s2">should I do it for you know I can we</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.370" end="01:15:53.730" style="s2">started I&#39;m yeah I&#39;m a little wind-up</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.800" end="01:15:57.120" style="s2">now is that right yeah yeah that will be</p>

<p begin="01:16:15.000" end="01:16:19.740" style="s2">I originally started talking about it</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.580" end="01:16:22.260" style="s2">because it came out of a theory for me</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.740" end="01:16:23.940" style="s2">of contract bridge where you have to say</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.260" end="01:16:25.680" style="s2">what it is you&#39;re going to do and then</p>

<p begin="01:16:35.820" end="01:16:42.030" style="s2">did not ask for and then the key</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.610" end="01:16:44.760" style="s2">question is do you keep it clean or does</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.030" end="01:16:46.890" style="s2">it become soiled right okay well my</p>

<p begin="01:20:41.360" end="01:20:44.990" style="s2">problem which is that well I mean this</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.370" end="01:20:47.900" style="s2">is a difference between us yeah which is</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.990" end="01:20:51.170" style="s2">the way I view it mmm is is that you</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.900" end="01:20:53.690" style="s2">have accepted the game but you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.170" end="01:20:55.130" style="s2">behave really badly within it right I</p>

<p begin="01:20:59.960" end="01:21:05.240" style="s2">the motivations for how this woke stuff</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.880" end="01:21:08.750" style="s2">got started huh and I&#39;m sympathetic with</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.240" end="01:21:10.480" style="s2">them to a point and I&#39;m completely</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.750" end="01:21:12.230" style="s2">unsympathetic with how non</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.480" end="01:21:14.420" style="s2">self-reflective and shallow and</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.230" end="01:21:17.780" style="s2">mean-spirited it is well pretending that</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.420" end="01:21:19.490" style="s2">it cares and I&#39;m gonna carry that</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.780" end="01:21:22.040" style="s2">tension so you and I are in slightly</p>

<p begin="01:21:24.980" end="01:21:29.510" style="s2">being earnest like my answer my answer</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.410" end="01:21:33.680" style="s2">to your Nietzsche point okay is around</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.510" end="01:21:36.230" style="s2">you so for example you know this is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.680" end="01:21:39.620" style="s2">three dimensional projection of a four</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.230" end="01:21:41.780" style="s2">dimensional convex polytope okay and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.620" end="01:21:44.540" style="s2">find it transcendent uh-huh so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.780" end="01:21:46.940" style="s2">holding up and what is this 120 cell</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.540" end="01:21:48.140" style="s2">which is the name of the convex polytope</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.940" end="01:21:50.060" style="s2">which is a generalization of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.140" end="01:21:51.290" style="s2">dodecahedron to four-dimensional space</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.060" end="01:21:54.350" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.290" end="01:21:57.260" style="s2">and you have one over there that yes the</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.350" end="01:21:58.610" style="s2">24 sites Dan which is a unique one that</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.260" end="01:22:00.890" style="s2">doesn&#39;t correspond to one of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.610" end="01:22:03.650" style="s2">Platonic solids right I look at that one</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.890" end="01:22:04.880" style="s2">by you mm-hmm and I just marvel at it</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.650" end="01:22:08.870" style="s2">and I think about it the way people</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.880" end="01:22:10.610" style="s2">think about like Seraphim yeah it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.870" end="01:22:12.620" style="s2">I don&#39;t have religion in my life at the</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.610" end="01:22:14.740" style="s2">same level that my ancestors did</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.620" end="01:22:16.430" style="s2">right but you have some but I have I</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.740" end="01:22:18.340" style="s2">have the the one</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.430" end="01:22:21.500" style="s2">mathematics and physics and biology</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.340" end="01:22:24.440" style="s2">mm-hmm that that plugs the same religion</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.500" end="01:22:25.820" style="s2">shaped hole in my soul yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.440" end="01:22:28.070" style="s2">how I&#39;ve solved the Nietzsche problem</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.820" end="01:22:30.440" style="s2">that&#39;s why I remain earnest much to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.070" end="01:22:31.910" style="s2">chagrin of some of my listeners I know</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.440" end="01:22:33.620" style="s2">but I think I actually think that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.910" end="01:22:35.270" style="s2">fundamentally at the end of the day on</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.620" end="01:22:37.190" style="s2">the same page about that I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.270" end="01:22:38.870" style="s2">very close to being and I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.190" end="01:22:43.430" style="s2">one of the reasons why I covertly</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.870" end="01:22:47.300" style="s2">brought up your father because this III</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.430" end="01:22:50.210" style="s2">think that the Jewish and the Soviet and</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.300" end="01:22:55.010" style="s2">the Armenian you know all of these</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.210" end="01:22:57.950" style="s2">things these are very old tradition that</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.010" end="01:23:00.650" style="s2">feel very deeply and they were naked</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.950" end="01:23:02.510" style="s2">about caring right and I guess we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.650" end="01:23:05.900" style="s2">actually we&#39;re back to where we started</p>

<p begin="01:23:05.900" end="01:23:11.510" style="s2">this idea I think the kind of in America</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.530" end="01:23:13.640" style="s2">there&#39;s this very reductive idea of like</p>

<p begin="01:23:13.640" end="01:23:18.620" style="s2">there are all these different non-white</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.070" end="01:23:21.920" style="s2">ethnicities and cultures but white</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.620" end="01:23:24.020" style="s2">people are a singular block through the</p>

<p begin="01:23:27.290" end="01:23:34.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve always felt for example very</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.700" end="01:23:38.180" style="s2">alienated from a Nordic non-jewish</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.910" end="01:23:40.970" style="s2">whites right or just to give you an</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.180" end="01:23:42.710" style="s2">example right I don&#39;t you know have any</p>

<p begin="01:23:53.450" end="01:23:57.650" style="s2">that makes sense because they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.190" end="01:24:00.350" style="s2">also actually very earnest people and</p>

<p begin="01:24:02.750" end="01:24:08.090" style="s2">as in fact yes got it out by the left</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.440" end="01:24:11.570" style="s2">abused against them so that they are now</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.090" end="01:24:13.220" style="s2">starting to feel like WTF mmm-hmm why</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.570" end="01:24:14.720" style="s2">can&#39;t we talk about some of the tensions</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.220" end="01:24:16.760" style="s2">that were experiencing there is</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.720" end="01:24:21.080" style="s2">something that it means to be Swedish or</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.760" end="01:24:22.910" style="s2">Norwegian or Icelandic right and to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.080" end="01:24:26.590" style="s2">told well this your identity is just</p>

<p begin="01:25:06.560" end="01:25:11.179" style="s2">much about the hardware I care a great</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.780" end="01:25:14.000" style="s2">deal about the software mm-hmm and the</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.179" end="01:25:15.920" style="s2">idea that everybody of European descent</p>

<p begin="01:25:19.460" end="01:25:24.380" style="s2">none of this I mean there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.429" end="01:25:25.940" style="s2">music and science and architecture and</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.380" end="01:25:28.640" style="s2">you know that all the terrible things</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.940" end="01:25:30.380" style="s2">that happen to I will not have that</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.640" end="01:25:31.760" style="s2">watered down that&#39;s an authentic</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.380" end="01:25:34.969" style="s2">experience of the thing that bothers me</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.760" end="01:25:38.239" style="s2">about it is and then this is another one</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.969" end="01:25:40.790" style="s2">of my riffs you have this problem with</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.239" end="01:25:45.560" style="s2">vanilla where vanilla has two meanings</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.790" end="01:25:48.320" style="s2">mmm one is boring flavorless okay bland</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.560" end="01:25:50.750" style="s2">and the other is like the most flavorful</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.320" end="01:25:53.659" style="s2">of spices okay and flavorings and</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.750" end="01:25:56.150" style="s2">tannins and somehow they&#39;re both vanilla</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.659" end="01:25:59.150" style="s2">well white is the same thing White is</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.150" end="01:26:01.360" style="s2">the most bland boring it&#39;s like a canvas</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.150" end="01:26:03.560" style="s2">that has been gesso but not painted upon</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.360" end="01:26:05.030" style="s2">on the other hand if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.560" end="01:26:07.370" style="s2">European culture is there anything</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.030" end="01:26:10.520" style="s2">richer and spicier and more intricate in</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.370" end="01:26:13.790" style="s2">interest and somehow our minds are just</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.520" end="01:26:17.650" style="s2">bananas over these two you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.790" end="01:26:20.870" style="s2">it&#39;s but it&#39;s so it&#39;s very offensively</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.650" end="01:26:23.480" style="s2">reductive on a way that personally</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.870" end="01:26:27.800" style="s2">strikes me because it&#39;s kind of the only</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.480" end="01:26:31.429" style="s2">thing keeping me from being becoming</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.800" end="01:26:33.230" style="s2">like a typical Welbeck Ian protagonist</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.429" end="01:26:35.390" style="s2">or one of these like horrible millennial</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.230" end="01:26:40.630" style="s2">girl bosses who&#39;s fundamentally empty</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.390" end="01:26:43.580" style="s2">inside is the great deal of kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.630" end="01:26:51.240" style="s2">honor and respect</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.580" end="01:26:53.880" style="s2">that I feel for my ancestors and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.240" end="01:26:55.890" style="s2">cultural kind of the amniotic fluid that</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.880" end="01:26:57.960" style="s2">we all came at well but it&#39;s worse I</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.890" end="01:27:01.230" style="s2">mean you&#39;re in a very funny position you</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.960" end="01:27:06.990" style="s2">are culturally like your podcast is</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.230" end="01:27:11.130" style="s2">called Redskin yeah and you are</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.990" end="01:27:14.700" style="s2">culturally very Russian Soviet Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.130" end="01:27:18.470" style="s2">Armenian but if you really look at it</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.700" end="01:27:20.910" style="s2">you can see that it&#39;s fading yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.470" end="01:27:23.100" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to have grandchildren</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.910" end="01:27:25.140" style="s2">that relate to you yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.100" end="01:27:26.490" style="s2">that&#39;s really a terrifying thing and</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.140" end="01:27:29.040" style="s2">it&#39;s actually terrifying thing on two</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.490" end="01:27:31.260" style="s2">levels because right hey you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.040" end="01:27:34.380" style="s2">gonna have grandchildren who relate to</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.260" end="01:27:35.820" style="s2">you on like a practicable level but B to</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.380" end="01:27:40.440" style="s2">even acknowledge that you want</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.820" end="01:27:42.950" style="s2">grandchildren to relate to you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.440" end="01:27:48.930" style="s2">flies in the face of this very leftist</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.950" end="01:27:50.700" style="s2">doxy the culture is relevant and it</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.930" end="01:27:53.910" style="s2">makes me think of like you know the idea</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.700" end="01:27:58.050" style="s2">of narcissism that somebody like lash</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.910" end="01:28:01.380" style="s2">was so kind of brilliant identifying</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.050" end="01:28:07.140" style="s2">diagnosing and at the time he was</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.380" end="01:28:09.060" style="s2">writing in the 60s and 70s he billed it</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.140" end="01:28:12.500" style="s2">as kind of the generational pathology of</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.060" end="01:28:15.810" style="s2">our time the kind of liberated persona</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.500" end="01:28:18.690" style="s2">but even at that time narcissism was</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.810" end="01:28:21.780" style="s2">still at the very least a system of</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.690" end="01:28:25.050" style="s2">positive affinities so you identified</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.780" end="01:28:28.110" style="s2">through affinity right originally maybe</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.050" end="01:28:30.990" style="s2">you identified with your ethnicity or</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.110" end="01:28:33.870" style="s2">your religion and then later you came to</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.990" end="01:28:38.570" style="s2">identify with your lifestyle markers you</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.870" end="01:28:41.880" style="s2">know you did yoga or composting or</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.570" end="01:28:43.440" style="s2">recycling or whatever and gradually over</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.880" end="01:28:45.470" style="s2">time that&#39;s yielded to kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.440" end="01:28:47.760" style="s2">negative narcissism were people at large</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.470" end="01:28:51.120" style="s2">identify with their oppression in their</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.760" end="01:28:52.860" style="s2">adversity but Russians identify with</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.120" end="01:28:54.630" style="s2">their oppression and their adversity in</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.860" end="01:28:56.280" style="s2">a very strong way that doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.630" end="01:28:57.969" style="s2">anything like what we&#39;re doing in the US</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.280" end="01:29:01.000" style="s2">okay see I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.969" end="01:29:04.239" style="s2">this one before you oh really</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.000" end="01:29:06.790" style="s2">yeah I just thought we were kind of</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.239" end="01:29:08.559" style="s2">miserable melancholic people I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.790" end="01:29:10.239" style="s2">there&#39;s a general kind of you know on</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.559" end="01:29:12.429" style="s2">the pavlova the great Russian ballerina</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.239" end="01:29:16.500" style="s2">said that the Russian soul was marked by</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.429" end="01:29:22.239" style="s2">melancholy yeah yeah I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.500" end="01:29:25.869" style="s2">well you know the it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.239" end="01:29:27.010" style="s2">I when I had Garry Kasparov on the</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.869" end="01:29:31.239" style="s2">program mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.010" end="01:29:34.750" style="s2">he there was some very odd moments mhm</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.239" end="01:29:38.920" style="s2">so I tried to do a an intro in Russian</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.750" end="01:29:40.690" style="s2">where I said that he was unclear that he</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.920" end="01:29:42.250" style="s2">was if he was Garry Kasparov or Garry</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.690" end="01:29:44.739" style="s2">Weinstein because that was a very first</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.250" end="01:29:46.449" style="s2">name and he immediately just didn&#39;t buy</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.739" end="01:29:47.980" style="s2">it on yeah I&#39;m jealous that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.449" end="01:29:50.440" style="s2">do the Russian language intro for me</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.980" end="01:29:50.800" style="s2">really my chopped liver just kidding no</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.440" end="01:29:54.969" style="s2">go on</p>

<p begin="01:29:54.969" end="01:29:59.199" style="s2">mean actually didn&#39;t even talk about</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.679" end="01:30:02.290" style="s2">almost no one reacted to yeah I am one</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.199" end="01:30:04.119" style="s2">of my hopes was for the program was to</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.290" end="01:30:06.369" style="s2">start personalizing it to all of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.119" end="01:30:09.489" style="s2">cultures that I cared the most about and</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.369" end="01:30:11.679" style="s2">so I did this thing about us photos in</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.489" end="01:30:14.260" style="s2">the video I&#39;ve divided to you because in</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.679" end="01:30:16.270" style="s2">the Moscow Subway&#39;s in the subways of</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.260" end="01:30:19.239" style="s2">other cities there&#39;s this thing which</p>

<p begin="01:30:23.920" end="01:30:28.920" style="s2">thing I always thought it&#39;d be cool that</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.230" end="01:30:32.199" style="s2">the portal was like the Moscow doors huh</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.920" end="01:30:34.719" style="s2">opening and closing and he just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.199" end="01:30:36.010" style="s2">react at all to it the one weird thing</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.719" end="01:30:40.719" style="s2">where there was like a shiver of</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.010" end="01:30:43.619" style="s2">recognition was I talked about the</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.719" end="01:30:48.790" style="s2">Russian satirical magazine crocodile and</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.619" end="01:30:52.389" style="s2">how descent and irreverence existed</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.790" end="01:30:54.820" style="s2">within the Soviet Union but in this very</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.389" end="01:30:57.730" style="s2">specified way so that there was a valve</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.820" end="01:31:00.099" style="s2">to let things to let off steam and it</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.730" end="01:31:01.510" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the American picture where nobody</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.099" end="01:31:03.790" style="s2">could say anything at any time because</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.510" end="01:31:05.650" style="s2">that would never work mmm the Russian</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.790" end="01:31:07.449" style="s2">system was much more sophisticated right</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.650" end="01:31:08.860" style="s2">and that was the one moment at which he</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.449" end="01:31:10.250" style="s2">sort of gave me a little bit of a nod</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.860" end="01:31:13.790" style="s2">like wow you really know your stuff</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.250" end="01:31:17.060" style="s2">and the thing is is very hard for an</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.790" end="01:31:20.840" style="s2">American to connect to the broad Slavic</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.060" end="01:31:24.560" style="s2">soul yeah and for us to connect to the</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.840" end="01:31:27.820" style="s2">broad American soul I think I said this</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.560" end="01:31:30.320" style="s2">to you you know the kind of idea that</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.820" end="01:31:32.570" style="s2">Russians are basically optimists</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.320" end="01:31:34.970" style="s2">masquerading as cynics and Americans or</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.570" end="01:31:36.620" style="s2">cynics masquerading as optimists I mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.970" end="01:31:40.310" style="s2">that&#39;s like broadly on some level like</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.620" end="01:31:42.250" style="s2">stereotypically true and I also remember</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.310" end="01:31:44.390" style="s2">saying that</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.250" end="01:31:45.770" style="s2">Russians unlike Americans you know if</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.390" end="01:31:48.230" style="s2">you have a classroom of American kids</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.770" end="01:31:51.500" style="s2">and you ask them like who&#39;s done X or</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.230" end="01:31:53.990" style="s2">who is y the hand shoot up because in</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.500" end="01:31:55.760" style="s2">America it&#39;s much much less dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.990" end="01:31:57.320" style="s2">historically to identify yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.760" end="01:31:59.710" style="s2">Russians are in the business of</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.320" end="01:32:02.420" style="s2">indirection mid fashioned non</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.710" end="01:32:04.840" style="s2">identification because it was at some</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.420" end="01:32:08.330" style="s2">point a political problem that had a</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.840" end="01:32:10.760" style="s2">material real-world consequences but has</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.330" end="01:32:13.700" style="s2">been handed down to successive</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.760" end="01:32:15.620" style="s2">generations as a behavioural quirk</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.700" end="01:32:17.120" style="s2">that&#39;s actually really problematic if</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.620" end="01:32:18.650" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to have like a you know a</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.120" end="01:32:22.430" style="s2">romantic relationship with like an</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.650" end="01:32:25.760" style="s2">American man for example but yeah work</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.430" end="01:32:27.260" style="s2">very weird damaged people I mean I said</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.760" end="01:32:29.090" style="s2">this I tweeted about this that</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.260" end="01:32:30.620" style="s2">conversation with Kasparov was really</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.090" end="01:32:33.440" style="s2">weird because it was like an insight</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.620" end="01:32:35.800" style="s2">into all of my communication impasses</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.440" end="01:32:38.990" style="s2">with American people say more about that</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.800" end="01:32:41.570" style="s2">well in to the degree that I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.990" end="01:32:43.550" style="s2">to disclose or identify myself right I</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.570" end="01:32:44.750" style="s2">like to misdirect by saying a great deal</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.550" end="01:32:46.520" style="s2">of stuff that seems kind of</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.750" end="01:32:47.990" style="s2">superficially very confessional and</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.520" end="01:32:50.630" style="s2">personal but actually nobody knows</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.990" end="01:32:53.060" style="s2">anything about me people know a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.630" end="01:32:56.530" style="s2">about you than you think they know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.060" end="01:33:02.450" style="s2">but only through kind of a nonverbal or</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.530" end="01:33:04.940" style="s2">subconscious means I think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.450" end="01:33:07.580" style="s2">yeah not through anything that exists on</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.940" end="01:33:09.500" style="s2">the verbal registers well the you know I</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.580" end="01:33:13.970" style="s2">don&#39;t know how many podcasts you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.500" end="01:33:17.300" style="s2">like this too probably none probably</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.970" end="01:33:20.800" style="s2">yeah and I do think that you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.300" end="01:33:20.800" style="s2">find that your mystique</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.950" end="01:33:25.610" style="s2">coexists with your revelation they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.780" end="01:33:28.370" style="s2">not as rival risks as you might imagine</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.610" end="01:33:31.340" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s possibly a good point</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.370" end="01:33:33.170" style="s2">but I think like but what did you hear</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.340" end="01:33:37.250" style="s2">and then cast like so you see listened</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.170" end="01:33:39.500" style="s2">to that podcast yeah well we famously</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.250" end="01:33:41.960" style="s2">tried to talk over each other he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.500" end="01:33:43.880" style="s2">forceful right I would like to think</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.960" end="01:33:47.600" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been far less forceful with</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.880" end="01:33:49.630" style="s2">you than I was with him yeah but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.600" end="01:33:52.130" style="s2">also easier to get along with</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.630" end="01:33:53.870" style="s2">why have you is potentially more</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.130" end="01:33:56.090" style="s2">dangerous yeah but that&#39;s only because</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.870" end="01:33:58.820" style="s2">I&#39;m a woman it cuz Favre and I have the</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.090" end="01:34:01.940" style="s2">same ethnic breakdown basically which in</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.820" end="01:34:04.940" style="s2">Russia is called grim muchos miss you</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.940" end="01:34:07.400" style="s2">much isthmus explosive mixture so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.940" end="01:34:08.210" style="s2">like a binary weapon that one it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.400" end="01:34:11.060" style="s2">dynamite</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.210" end="01:34:13.460" style="s2">yeah it&#39;d be kind of like when Armenians</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.060" end="01:34:16.910" style="s2">and Jews join forces right in a single</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.460" end="01:34:21.200" style="s2">person it&#39;s basically an incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.910" end="01:34:22.940" style="s2">difficult combative categorical</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.200" end="01:34:25.400" style="s2">personality and I think that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.940" end="01:34:27.170" style="s2">what he he is I mean I don&#39;t know a ton</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.400" end="01:34:28.880" style="s2">about him but I&#39;m kind of obviously</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.170" end="01:34:31.940" style="s2">interested because you cheated of his</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.880" end="01:34:35.290" style="s2">meaning because there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.940" end="01:34:38.030" style="s2">the fact that Putin to him is this</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.290" end="01:34:42.140" style="s2">unrecognized master Menace and that</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.030" end="01:34:44.180" style="s2">we&#39;re running a clown show well the fate</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.140" end="01:34:46.220" style="s2">of the world spins out of control he is</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.180" end="01:34:50.360" style="s2">very much of a cult I mean I have much</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.220" end="01:34:52.340" style="s2">more of a Cold War overlay in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.360" end="01:34:55.580" style="s2">than most of my contemporaries and</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.340" end="01:34:57.380" style="s2">certainly my millennial audience I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.580" end="01:35:00.200" style="s2">believe that we have nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.380" end="01:35:02.480" style="s2">that they haven&#39;t been used in a long</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.200" end="01:35:04.310" style="s2">time and that we imagine that this will</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.480" end="01:35:06.650" style="s2">go on forever and the third laying kind</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.310" end="01:35:08.450" style="s2">of dormant for now I mean but this</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.650" end="01:35:10.790" style="s2">brings me back to the whole concept of</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.450" end="01:35:12.680" style="s2">stove which dovetails very nicely with</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.790" end="01:35:15.920" style="s2">the idea of hyper and normalization</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.680" end="01:35:17.660" style="s2">right which the documentarian Adam</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.920" end="01:35:20.000" style="s2">Curtis took the title for his famous</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.660" end="01:35:22.060" style="s2">documentary from this term which was</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.000" end="01:35:25.940" style="s2">coined by this guy Alexei you&#39;re Chuck</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.060" end="01:35:28.790" style="s2">you&#39;re Chuck who&#39;s a anthropology</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.940" end="01:35:32.630" style="s2">professor who did a lot of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.790" end="01:35:33.620" style="s2">research on Straub with this guy Dominic</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.630" end="01:35:36.380" style="s2">Boyer</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.620" end="01:35:38.270" style="s2">fellow anthropologist and I guess the</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.380" end="01:35:40.490" style="s2">basic principle of hyper normalization</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.270" end="01:35:42.800" style="s2">as I understand it in my feeble female</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.490" end="01:35:46.070" style="s2">brain is that you know there was kind of</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.800" end="01:35:51.290" style="s2">an elite guild of experts technologists</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.070" end="01:35:57.470" style="s2">financed ears politicians who kind of if</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.290" end="01:36:01.820" style="s2">not conspired and agreed to invent kind</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.470" end="01:36:05.060" style="s2">of a fake world atop the real world that</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.820" end="01:36:07.730" style="s2">we inhabit because the real world had</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.060" end="01:36:10.010" style="s2">grown so complicated that it was that</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.730" end="01:36:11.810" style="s2">they had to model it into you know in</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.010" end="01:36:13.940" style="s2">simplified terms it&#39;s almost like fast</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.810" end="01:36:16.100" style="s2">benders were old on a wire we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.940" end="01:36:20.180" style="s2">in like a success of a nesting doll of</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.100" end="01:36:24.410" style="s2">like successive simulation lost you yeah</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.180" end="01:36:26.980" style="s2">matryoshka and I forgot what we were</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.410" end="01:36:30.830" style="s2">going where we were going with this but</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.980" end="01:36:36.950" style="s2">we we now live in this like kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.830" end="01:36:38.990" style="s2">a hypertrophied hyper real reality where</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.950" end="01:36:41.570" style="s2">you know you said to me it&#39;s like very</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.990" end="01:36:43.190" style="s2">few people can see that they&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.570" end="01:36:46.220" style="s2">the simulation I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.190" end="01:36:48.770" style="s2">actually agree with that because I like</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.220" end="01:36:52.700" style="s2">to think that people are a lot smarter</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.770" end="01:36:53.810" style="s2">than we give them credit for it well see</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.700" end="01:36:55.640" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it comes in too smart a</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.810" end="01:36:57.560" style="s2">thing it comes down to our self blinding</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.640" end="01:36:58.880" style="s2">yeah and so one of the reasons I was</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.560" end="01:37:06.440" style="s2">asking you what you had heard in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.880" end="01:37:09.260" style="s2">Garry Kasparov podcast was I wasn&#39;t sure</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.440" end="01:37:10.730" style="s2">what happened during it I think that he</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.260" end="01:37:12.560" style="s2">I mean I don&#39;t know if you want me to</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.730" end="01:37:15.950" style="s2">psychoanalyze this is like a very meta</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.560" end="01:37:17.480" style="s2">podcasting we&#39;ve got pretty mad yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.950" end="01:37:21.230" style="s2">think that he was deflecting your</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.480" end="01:37:23.090" style="s2">earnest attempts a mutual identification</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.230" end="01:37:25.910" style="s2">which is like the basis of all kind of</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.090" end="01:37:29.600" style="s2">bonds right I&#39;m so excited right when I</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.910" end="01:37:31.730" style="s2">meet um kind of a fellow travel in any</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.600" end="01:37:32.780" style="s2">capacity itself with me and I told you</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.730" end="01:37:34.430" style="s2">this during our lunch I was like oh my</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.780" end="01:37:37.100" style="s2">god were like you know relatives right</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.430" end="01:37:39.560" style="s2">there&#39;s something very familiar no never</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.100" end="01:37:41.210" style="s2">met you twice yeah and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.560" end="01:37:42.680" style="s2">very familiar in meeting other people</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.210" end="01:37:45.140" style="s2">from a kind of a similar cultural</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.680" end="01:37:45.850" style="s2">background and I tend to collect them</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.140" end="01:37:48.610" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.850" end="01:37:52.990" style="s2">you know if that&#39;s racist let me know</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.610" end="01:37:56.340" style="s2">that&#39;s very but so I think the Russian</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.990" end="01:37:59.290" style="s2">tendency which I tried to for example</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.340" end="01:38:02.740" style="s2">minimize mitigate and myself to adapt</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.290" end="01:38:09.640" style="s2">better to American society is to deflect</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.740" end="01:38:12.400" style="s2">any such attempts and to kind of not to</p>

<p begin="01:43:08.650" end="01:43:16.120" style="s2">excellent other example to discuss in</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.140" end="01:43:17.320" style="s2">that case and I&#39;m very partial to giving</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.120" end="01:43:19.360" style="s2">this example there were multiple</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.320" end="01:43:21.760" style="s2">innovations there was the wire work</p>

<p begin="01:43:27.070" end="01:43:32.920" style="s2">CGI and so the mind was never sure what</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.400" end="01:43:36.100" style="s2">it was seeing right and so you you</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.920" end="01:43:38.410" style="s2">devote extra cognitive resources to the</p>

<p begin="01:44:29.630" end="01:44:35.030" style="s2">I think the cynical not so flattering</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.810" end="01:44:37.430" style="s2">version is all floating a responsibility</p>

<p begin="01:55:32.469" end="01:55:37.260" style="s2">I did it primarily to appease my</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.840" end="01:55:41.979" style="s2">boyfriend but that&#39;s another story and</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.260" end="01:55:43.840" style="s2">it occurred to me it dawned on me during</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.979" end="01:55:47.619" style="s2">the process of seeing this shrink it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.840" end="01:55:49.119" style="s2">like you know go you know the old that</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.619" end="01:55:51.210" style="s2">kind of psychoanalytic concept of</p>

<p begin="01:56:09.780" end="01:56:14.590" style="s2">semantically it&#39;s a slightly different</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.679" end="01:56:16.659" style="s2">configuration but it comes down to the</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.590" end="01:56:18.429" style="s2">same thing and it&#39;s like that John</p>

<p begin="01:56:33.099" end="01:56:40.269" style="s2">old traditional basis of female or male</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.420" end="01:56:42.130" style="s2">versus female sexual arousal right as</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.269" end="01:56:43.570" style="s2">you said this to me which I thought was</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.130" end="01:56:47.260" style="s2">very astute I&#39;ve never heard anybody</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.570" end="01:56:48.940" style="s2">else put it this way yeah we both come</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.260" end="01:56:52.210" style="s2">to some version of this independent the</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.940" end="01:56:55.090" style="s2">same thing yeah it&#39;s men are aroused by</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.210" end="01:56:59.440" style="s2">the woman the presence of the woman</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.090" end="01:57:02.949" style="s2">women are aroused by the kind of picture</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.440" end="01:57:05.139" style="s2">of themselves arousing the man or that</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.949" end="01:57:07.749" style="s2">the man some in some ways metaphorically</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.139" end="01:57:09.760" style="s2">acts as a mirror and the better the man</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.749" end="01:57:11.889" style="s2">the better the quality and the watering</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.760" end="01:57:14.050" style="s2">the quality of the reflection right and</p>

<p begin="01:57:14.050" end="01:57:19.960" style="s2">completely indifferent to male looks and</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.780" end="01:57:22.719" style="s2">the like but that to an enormous extent</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.960" end="01:57:25.659" style="s2">we&#39;ve demonized narcissism when in fact</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.719" end="01:57:29.139" style="s2">we find narcissism to be an extremely</p>

<p begin="01:57:33.039" end="01:57:36.340" style="s2">point too because I&#39;m very much a critic</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.809" end="01:57:43.820" style="s2">of like kind of narcissism as a</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.340" end="01:57:46.750" style="s2">generational pathology but that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.820" end="01:57:49.610" style="s2">I&#39;m critical specifically of kind of the</p>

<p begin="01:58:21.349" end="01:58:25.639" style="s2">really remarkable and I always have to</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.210" end="01:58:30.139" style="s2">ask myself the question like hey like</p>

<p begin="02:00:13.069" end="02:00:19.300" style="s2">watched your description of the wasted</p>

<p begin="02:00:32.269" end="02:00:37.669" style="s2">horrible mm-hmm and so this sort of the</p>

<p begin="02:02:00.889" end="02:02:06.739" style="s2">coming from an American context which is</p>

<p begin="02:02:16.840" end="02:02:23.390" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone too far in American culture</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.430" end="02:02:25.250" style="s2">by giving away power that is you know</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.390" end="02:02:27.410" style="s2">entirely functional so we you and I both</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.250" end="02:02:29.450" style="s2">discussed having economics and</p>

<p begin="02:02:35.990" end="02:02:40.970" style="s2">get fact that okay yeah but and then we</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.320" end="02:02:43.190" style="s2">talked about Rebecca Goldstein&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="02:03:02.140" end="02:03:11.390" style="s2">that kind of there&#39;s a question about</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.780" end="02:03:13.790" style="s2">when women stopped wanting that role in</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.390" end="02:03:16.670" style="s2">the United States context no one took</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.790" end="02:03:19.870" style="s2">the role over mm-hm and so it was like a</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.670" end="02:03:22.420" style="s2">load bearing role that was now vacant</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.870" end="02:03:25.310" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.420" end="02:03:26.990" style="s2">there are ways in which I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.310" end="02:03:28.670" style="s2">terrible that nobody&#39;s fulfilling that</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.990" end="02:03:30.380" style="s2">role and there&#39;s a ways in which I think</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.670" end="02:03:34.010" style="s2">it&#39;s terrible that women were expected</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.380" end="02:03:37.430" style="s2">to fulfill that role having now seen</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.010" end="02:03:40.760" style="s2">fantastic contributions in mathematics</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.430" end="02:03:42.440" style="s2">you know if people like Karen Dolan Beck</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.760" end="02:03:46.490" style="s2">or at least Jeffries that any one of a</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.440" end="02:03:48.830" style="s2">number of female mathematicians who have</p>

<p begin="02:03:48.830" end="02:03:54.530" style="s2">I can&#39;t live without and so I think that</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.640" end="02:03:57.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a really interesting and rich</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.530" end="02:04:00.440" style="s2">conversation about how much power from</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.770" end="02:04:03.290" style="s2">the old ways should be retained mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.440" end="02:04:05.960" style="s2">and how much of it should be seated so</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.290" end="02:04:10.460" style="s2">that more standard professional</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.960" end="02:04:12.080" style="s2">accomplishment can occur and because</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.460" end="02:04:13.850" style="s2">we&#39;re having this very simplistic</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.080" end="02:04:17.030" style="s2">conversation we&#39;re not getting to the</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.850" end="02:04:20.180" style="s2">really rich conversation which is what</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.030" end="02:04:23.210" style="s2">should be the renegotiation of male and</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.180" end="02:04:25.219" style="s2">female roles around it shouldn&#39;t be that</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.210" end="02:04:28.160" style="s2">trying to be a substitute copy of men</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.219" end="02:04:32.360" style="s2">right on the other hand it can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.160" end="02:04:33.739" style="s2">go back to women hold power in pregnant</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.360" end="02:04:36.770" style="s2">well I wouldn&#39;t say that no it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.739" end="02:04:38.750" style="s2">the terrifying matriarch that the hell</p>

<p begin="02:04:40.610" end="02:04:45.080" style="s2">it&#39;s a very the key issue and I think</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.850" end="02:04:48.950" style="s2">this comes through with everything you</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.080" end="02:04:52.520" style="s2">talk about the war that we have to wage</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.950" end="02:04:54.920" style="s2">is the war on simplistic easy answers as</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.520" end="02:04:56.690" style="s2">opposed to nuanced richness yeah and</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.920" end="02:04:58.640" style="s2">well and this goes back to this question</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.690" end="02:05:01.219" style="s2">of hyper normalization where we are</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.640" end="02:05:02.450" style="s2">grafting we are effect I mean Angela</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.219" end="02:05:04.850" style="s2">Nagel talks about this who I think</p>

<p begin="02:05:04.850" end="02:05:11.000" style="s2">she&#39;s also think that was brilliant</p>
