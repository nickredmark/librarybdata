<p begin="00:00:26.849" end="00:00:33.270" style="s2">the the basics of mindfulness meditation</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.230" end="00:00:35.880" style="s2">especially from the past no tradition</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.270" end="00:00:38.670" style="s2">and the core of mindfulness meditation</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.880" end="00:00:40.649" style="s2">is finding your Center and that&#39;s a sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.670" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">of which become a cliche thing to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.649" end="00:00:44.430" style="s2">and what I want to do is make that a</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:46.230" style="s2">little bit more precise and powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.430" end="00:00:48.270" style="s2">useful for you by talking about three</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.230" end="00:00:49.739" style="s2">centers you&#39;re going to find the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.270" end="00:00:51.570" style="s2">Center you&#39;re going to find is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.739" end="00:00:52.829" style="s2">relationship between mind and body so</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.570" end="00:00:55.170" style="s2">this is the Buddhist the central</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.829" end="00:00:56.489" style="s2">Buddhist metaphor that in mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.170" end="00:00:58.020" style="s2">practice we&#39;re learning to befriend</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.489" end="00:01:00.660" style="s2">ourselves we&#39;re trying to take the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.020" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">relationship towards a friend right but</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.660" end="00:01:04.170" style="s2">take that relationship towards ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:06.299" style="s2">and one of the way we do that is we try</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.170" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">to get the body in mind working together</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.299" end="00:01:10.200" style="s2">using the mind to train the body and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:13.049" style="s2">body to train the mind and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.200" end="00:01:15.180" style="s2">ways we can do that is by adopting some</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.049" end="00:01:18.960" style="s2">basic principles of posture so what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.180" end="00:01:20.700" style="s2">want to do right in my posture is I want</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:22.350" style="s2">to find my Center I don&#39;t want to sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.700" end="00:01:24.090" style="s2">of just calculate because I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.350" end="00:01:26.130" style="s2">to hold myself rigid because if I hold</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.090" end="00:01:28.530" style="s2">myself rigid that makes me tense and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">that triggers the wrong kinds of mental</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.530" end="00:01:34.140" style="s2">states if I but if I let myself go limp</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:35.909" style="s2">then I&#39;m cutting off a lot of my oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.140" end="00:01:38.280" style="s2">I&#39;m not breathing properly i got this</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.909" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">sort of shallow chest breathing and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.280" end="00:01:42.810" style="s2">also is associated with anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:44.520" style="s2">restlessness of mind so what I want is I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.810" end="00:01:46.290" style="s2">want to move off the back of my chair</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.520" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">and what I&#39;m going to do is take you</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.290" end="00:01:48.930" style="s2">through this exercise you do so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:51.180" style="s2">close your eyes and you&#39;re going to pay</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.930" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">attention to your sensations of balance</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.180" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">you&#39;re going to move forward and feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:01:58.860" style="s2">off balance move backwards and feel off</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:01.610" style="s2">balance and then slowly changing each</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.860" end="00:02:04.890" style="s2">one home in to where you feel right</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.610" end="00:02:05.909" style="s2">centered on this axis front to back then</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.890" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">you&#39;re going to repeat it you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.909" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">to go side to side again paying</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:12.870" style="s2">attention to the sensations of being off</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">balance slowly homing in to where you</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.870" end="00:02:15.720" style="s2">feel centered</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">way then it&#39;s important to do the head</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.720" end="00:02:19.950" style="s2">independently because one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">common mistakes and novice meditators is</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.950" end="00:02:24.060" style="s2">they let their head roll forward when</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:27.090" style="s2">they&#39;re meditating and this is bad for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.060" end="00:02:28.920" style="s2">few reasons first it upsets your center</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:30.750" style="s2">of balance and it will put a strain on</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.920" end="00:02:33.420" style="s2">your neck which will tend to cause</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.750" end="00:02:35.129" style="s2">headaches secondly it tends to restrict</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.420" end="00:02:38.159" style="s2">your air again so you&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.129" end="00:02:40.439" style="s2">shallow breathing again which tends to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.159" end="00:02:42.209" style="s2">trigger restlessness and finally your</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.439" end="00:02:43.769" style="s2">sort of signal inning to your brain that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.209" end="00:02:45.720" style="s2">you&#39;re falling asleep which is not what</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.769" end="00:02:47.010" style="s2">we want in meditation in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.720" end="00:02:50.010" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get in between a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.010" end="00:02:52.019" style="s2">restless mind a mind running around but</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.010" end="00:02:54.329" style="s2">on mine that&#39;s going foggy and falling</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.019" end="00:02:56.370" style="s2">asleep we want to calm but very clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.329" end="00:03:00.290" style="s2">mind so we want to do the exercise also</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.370" end="00:03:02.970" style="s2">with the head back to front side to side</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.290" end="00:03:05.310" style="s2">once you&#39;ve found your Center once</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.970" end="00:03:07.739" style="s2">you&#39;ve sent your Center sink into it</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.310" end="00:03:09.989" style="s2">relax your structure as much as you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.739" end="00:03:11.790" style="s2">open your stomach muscles open your</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.989" end="00:03:13.260" style="s2">chest place your hands where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.790" end="00:03:15.450" style="s2">conducive to adding to the stability</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.260" end="00:03:17.129" style="s2">right but what you want to do is you</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.450" end="00:03:19.470" style="s2">want to trust your structure as much as</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.129" end="00:03:22.079" style="s2">you can so you want to sink into your</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.470" end="00:03:23.639" style="s2">Center and then once you&#39;re sinking into</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.079" end="00:03:25.709" style="s2">your Center you want to save her your</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.639" end="00:03:27.989" style="s2">Center what does it feel like in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.709" end="00:03:29.310" style="s2">mind and body to be centered you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.989" end="00:03:31.019" style="s2">trying to create a felt memory so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.310" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">can get back to this place again and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.019" end="00:03:34.859" style="s2">again more and more readily so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:37.290" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do first is you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.859" end="00:03:38.669" style="s2">to sit you&#39;re going to find your Center</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.290" end="00:03:40.409" style="s2">you&#39;re going to sense your Center you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.669" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">going to sink into your Center then</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.409" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">you&#39;re going to savor your Center then</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:45.569" style="s2">the next thing you&#39;re going to do is</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:47.340" style="s2">you&#39;re going to send your attention many</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.569" end="00:03:50.129" style="s2">of you know that meditation involves</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.340" end="00:03:52.919" style="s2">sort of focusing your attention but</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.129" end="00:03:55.260" style="s2">there&#39;s more to that right in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.919" end="00:03:56.819" style="s2">we&#39;re not just focusing our attention so</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.260" end="00:03:59.970" style="s2">what we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.819" end="00:04:01.500" style="s2">learn to step back and look at our mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.970" end="00:04:02.940" style="s2">rather than looking through it in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.500" end="00:04:05.430" style="s2">day-to-day lives we don&#39;t pay much</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.940" end="00:04:08.209" style="s2">attention to our minds we pay a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.430" end="00:04:10.530" style="s2">attention through our minds to the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.209" end="00:04:13.019" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to use an analogy for that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.530" end="00:04:15.000" style="s2">most of the time i&#39;m looking through my</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.019" end="00:04:17.159" style="s2">glasses i&#39;m not i&#39;m not actually looking</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.000" end="00:04:19.380" style="s2">at them but periodically especially if</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.159" end="00:04:21.719" style="s2">there&#39;s something distorting my vision I</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.380" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">need to step back and look at my glasses</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.719" end="00:04:26.039" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I want to practice doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">and mindfulness I want to practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.039" end="00:04:29.190" style="s2">stepping back and looking</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:31.410" style="s2">the mind rather than automatically</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.190" end="00:04:33.180" style="s2">looking through it the way we do this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.410" end="00:04:34.710" style="s2">to look at what we have we normally</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.180" end="00:04:37.259" style="s2">reach out to the world with our mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.710" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">through our sensations normally we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.259" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">pay attention to our sensations we pay</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:43.169" style="s2">attention through them so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:44.789" style="s2">going to do is focus this area is called</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.169" end="00:04:46.590" style="s2">aired on TN and we&#39;re going to focus to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.789" end="00:04:49.470" style="s2">the sensations that are being created by</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.590" end="00:04:51.060" style="s2">our breathing now be careful don&#39;t force</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.470" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">your breathing just let let your be</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.060" end="00:04:54.629" style="s2">anything remain natural so what you want</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:56.370" style="s2">to do is as you&#39;re breathing in you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.629" end="00:04:58.620" style="s2">going to pay attention to the sensations</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.370" end="00:05:01.169" style="s2">of your abdomen expanding and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.620" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">going to silently say to yourself in and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.169" end="00:05:05.250" style="s2">feel all the sensations here that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:06.810" style="s2">being generated and then and then as</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.250" end="00:05:08.039" style="s2">you&#39;re naturally breathing out you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.810" end="00:05:10.740" style="s2">going to silently be saying to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.039" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">out and be pay attention to all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.740" end="00:05:15.780" style="s2">sensations that are being generated now</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:17.729" style="s2">what will happen is that automatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.780" end="00:05:20.699" style="s2">tendency that your mind has to start</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.729" end="00:05:22.409" style="s2">looking at the world will take over and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.699" end="00:05:24.300" style="s2">you&#39;ll be distracted you&#39;ll start</p>
