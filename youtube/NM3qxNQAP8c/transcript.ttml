<p begin="00:00:00.380" end="00:00:04.890" style="s2">silly is the power of the people&#39;s vote</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.700" end="00:00:15.690" style="s2">and I think the people should use it to</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.890" end="00:00:17.250" style="s2">vote for hi there in this last none of</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.690" end="00:00:18.869" style="s2">the above video I want to try to tie</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.250" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">together everything that I&#39;ve said in</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.869" end="00:00:24.570" style="s2">the previous videos and in doing so make</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:26.849" style="s2">the case one final time for why I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.570" end="00:00:28.470" style="s2">that voting none of the above in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.849" end="00:00:32.790" style="s2">next election will be the best possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.470" end="00:00:34.980" style="s2">use of your vote and so the basic</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.790" end="00:00:37.140" style="s2">underlying premise is that we as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.980" end="00:00:39.390" style="s2">culture as a civilization society</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.140" end="00:00:41.390" style="s2">whatever are in deep trouble and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.390" end="00:00:44.040" style="s2">wherever you look there are crises</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.390" end="00:00:47.309" style="s2">already in full bloom or brewing away</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.040" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">and just to list a few I mean most</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.309" end="00:00:50.969" style="s2">obviously front and center at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.989" end="00:00:52.500" style="s2">is the environmental crisis which you</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.969" end="00:00:54.180" style="s2">know there&#39;s an existential threat to us</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.500" end="00:00:57.030" style="s2">all debasing the very substrate on which</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.180" end="00:00:59.640" style="s2">we all depend and but there are plenty</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.030" end="00:01:01.530" style="s2">of others that are the line up alongside</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.640" end="00:01:02.449" style="s2">that this financial those financial</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.530" end="00:01:05.700" style="s2">crises</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.449" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">there&#39;s the increase in extreme</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.700" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">political parties and polarization and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:11.510" style="s2">society at large</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:14.010" style="s2">there&#39;s the continued rise in inequality</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.510" end="00:01:16.439" style="s2">which then leads to things like</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.010" end="00:01:18.740" style="s2">depression and suicide and drug</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:21.630" style="s2">addiction and homelessness and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.740" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">loneliness you know all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.630" end="00:01:26.820" style="s2">are symptoms of a very deep blaze that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:29.490" style="s2">lies at the very heart of our culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.820" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">and so in response to that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.490" end="00:01:31.770" style="s2">find completely different ways of doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:33.930" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.770" end="00:01:36.540" style="s2">and there are plenty of people out there</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.930" end="00:01:40.970" style="s2">coming up with innovative imaginative</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.540" end="00:01:43.320" style="s2">creative solutions in light of new</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.970" end="00:01:45.420" style="s2">understandings about things and so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.320" end="00:01:47.159" style="s2">know solutions to problems like food and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.420" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">energy production in sustainable ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.159" end="00:01:52.140" style="s2">there are solutions out there already</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">and to regenerate the soil around the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.140" end="00:01:55.259" style="s2">globe there are solutions out there</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">already you know therefore many of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.259" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">problems biodegradable plastics and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">there are plenty of solutions out there</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:05.219" style="s2">which are ready for trial you know ready</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:07.469" style="s2">to be experimented with Bart&#39;s everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.219" end="00:02:09.690" style="s2">finds themselves kind of stuck because</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.469" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">the way we do things at the moment is</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.690" end="00:02:13.069" style="s2">through our centralized political</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:14.870" style="s2">systems and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.069" end="00:02:17.299" style="s2">to me that a very important first step</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.870" end="00:02:19.430" style="s2">in getting unstuck is to disavow</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.299" end="00:02:21.579" style="s2">ourselves of the notion that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.430" end="00:02:24.200" style="s2">best way of doing things</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.579" end="00:02:28.180" style="s2">reclaiming sovereignty in the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.200" end="00:02:30.709" style="s2">individual and collective voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.180" end="00:02:33.319" style="s2">responsibility that&#39;s really what none</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.709" end="00:02:35.569" style="s2">of the above is about two main strands</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.319" end="00:02:38.079" style="s2">that this number one recognizing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.569" end="00:02:40.909" style="s2">fact that our current political and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.079" end="00:02:44.450" style="s2">choice-making systems are incapable</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.909" end="00:02:47.139" style="s2">fundamentally incapable of sorting out</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.450" end="00:02:50.299" style="s2">the mess that lies in front of us and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.139" end="00:02:54.590" style="s2">secondly that none of the above could be</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.299" end="00:02:56.599" style="s2">a umbrella under which many many many</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.590" end="00:02:58.069" style="s2">different people can stand and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.599" end="00:03:00.500" style="s2">I&#39;ve unpacked both of these things in</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.069" end="00:03:02.840" style="s2">detail in preceding videos but I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.500" end="00:03:05.030" style="s2">gonna briefly go over each of these two</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.840" end="00:03:06.439" style="s2">things one more time in this one and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.030" end="00:03:09.849" style="s2">first of all it&#39;s important to take</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.439" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">responsibility for understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.849" end="00:03:13.669" style="s2">governmental systems are incapable of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:16.819" style="s2">sorting out this mess and this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.669" end="00:03:18.439" style="s2">basically because of the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.819" end="00:03:22.359" style="s2">complex and the complicated that I went</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.439" end="00:03:25.099" style="s2">into in video 3 I think it was in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.359" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">our systems of organization and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.099" end="00:03:30.949" style="s2">governments our governance are</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:33.680" style="s2">complicated but the natural world with</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.949" end="00:03:35.299" style="s2">which they deal with which they interact</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:37.669" style="s2">are complex and these two things are</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.299" end="00:03:40.069" style="s2">fundamentally incompatible and so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.669" end="00:03:43.250" style="s2">know how complicated systems have buried</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.069" end="00:03:46.220" style="s2">us under a pile of rules and regulations</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.250" end="00:03:49.699" style="s2">and lead tables and spreadsheets and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.220" end="00:03:51.739" style="s2">laws and bla bla bla bla bla that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.699" end="00:03:57.109" style="s2">can possibly hold in their head and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.739" end="00:03:59.530" style="s2">understand and the spirit of finding</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.109" end="00:04:01.849" style="s2">ways in which we can peacefully and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.530" end="00:04:03.829" style="s2">sensibly collaborate with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.849" end="00:04:05.689" style="s2">along on a large scale has been buried</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.829" end="00:04:07.939" style="s2">under a massive pile of complicatedness</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.689" end="00:04:10.039" style="s2">and the other problem is as well a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.939" end="00:04:11.389" style="s2">complicated is easily hacked and is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.039" end="00:04:13.939" style="s2">therefore susceptible to corruption</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.389" end="00:04:15.739" style="s2">which is why we have a situation now</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.939" end="00:04:17.419" style="s2">where our policies is entirely driven by</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.739" end="00:04:19.039" style="s2">money candidates are selected by money</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.419" end="00:04:21.409" style="s2">elections are decided by money</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.039" end="00:04:25.300" style="s2">particularly in America but I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.409" end="00:04:26.600" style="s2">the same everywhere and this forces</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.300" end="00:04:28.430" style="s2">politicians in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.600" end="00:04:30.800" style="s2">to a position where they are forced to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.430" end="00:04:32.420" style="s2">be duplicitous and lie I mean they lie</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.800" end="00:04:33.740" style="s2">about their expenses they lie about</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.420" end="00:04:35.390" style="s2">their affairs they lie about their</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.740" end="00:04:38.330" style="s2">business interests they lie to cover up</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.390" end="00:04:40.820" style="s2">their failures they lie to take us to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.330" end="00:04:45.830" style="s2">war you know they simply can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.820" end="00:04:48.020" style="s2">trusted and even good people who get</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.830" end="00:04:50.600" style="s2">into the senior levels of politics are</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.020" end="00:04:52.580" style="s2">so beholden to the various interests</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.600" end="00:04:54.650" style="s2">that put them there that they can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.580" end="00:04:56.930" style="s2">themselves I made this point regarding</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.650" end="00:04:59.480" style="s2">Teresa May and that you know the only</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.930" end="00:05:00.920" style="s2">time she was actually a human being was</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.480" end="00:05:02.450" style="s2">at the very beginning at the very end of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.920" end="00:05:04.850" style="s2">her Premiership all the time in between</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.450" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">she was complete automaton a complete</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.850" end="00:05:10.130" style="s2">robot and it&#39;s also worth remembering</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:12.140" style="s2">that even if their intentions were good</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.130" end="00:05:13.940" style="s2">and honorable and they genuinely wish to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.140" end="00:05:15.200" style="s2">change things for the better you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.940" end="00:05:16.790" style="s2">most of these people are simply not</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.200" end="00:05:18.740" style="s2">qualified or experienced to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.790" end="00:05:20.510" style="s2">do so as I pointed out in a previous</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.740" end="00:05:21.740" style="s2">video when was the last time a farmer</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.510" end="00:05:23.330" style="s2">was the head of the Agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.740" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">Department or a teacher the head of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.330" end="00:05:26.390" style="s2">Education Department and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">these people are all lawyers and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.390" end="00:05:31.880" style="s2">economists and accountants and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:33.140" style="s2">even if they wanted to they simply don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.880" end="00:05:35.810" style="s2">have the know-how the vision the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.140" end="00:05:38.270" style="s2">experience the expertise to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.810" end="00:05:40.670" style="s2">manage these things and the final point</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.270" end="00:05:43.220" style="s2">I want to make on this in this section</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.670" end="00:05:45.290" style="s2">is the adversarial modality of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.220" end="00:05:48.230" style="s2">decision-making process and so under our</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.290" end="00:05:49.850" style="s2">current political paradigm the party in</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.230" end="00:05:50.470" style="s2">power or the group in power whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.850" end="00:05:52.820" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.470" end="00:05:54.950" style="s2">formulates a policy there may be some</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.820" end="00:05:56.540" style="s2">argument and hashing out and refining of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.950" end="00:05:58.100" style="s2">that policy and then it gets voted on</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.540" end="00:06:01.090" style="s2">right rather than you know so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.100" end="00:06:04.690" style="s2">very very top-down driven and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.090" end="00:06:06.650" style="s2">decision-making process as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.690" end="00:06:08.630" style="s2">getting a group of people together</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.650" end="00:06:11.690" style="s2">deciding on right what do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.630" end="00:06:13.340" style="s2">want to achieve what does each group of</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.690" end="00:06:15.710" style="s2">people what are their particular</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.340" end="00:06:17.780" style="s2">interests in this what fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.710" end="00:06:20.750" style="s2">principles and axioms can we all agree</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.780" end="00:06:23.570" style="s2">on as a starting point and then build a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.750" end="00:06:25.910" style="s2">policy upwards from there this is a much</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.570" end="00:06:27.470" style="s2">more sensible way of going about things</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.910" end="00:06:29.480" style="s2">but the adversarial nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.470" end="00:06:30.830" style="s2">political process makes such a</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.480" end="00:06:34.669" style="s2">decision-making process</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.830" end="00:06:37.390" style="s2">impossible for all of these reasons but</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.669" end="00:06:39.410" style="s2">primarily the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.390" end="00:06:40.310" style="s2">incompatibility of the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.410" end="00:06:44.750" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.310" end="00:06:48.970" style="s2">means that this paradigm this whole idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.750" end="00:06:51.500" style="s2">of how to do things simply cannot work</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.970" end="00:06:54.860" style="s2">and so the first part of this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.500" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">understanding that the second part is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.860" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">the idea of unifying large numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:01.400" style="s2">people under a single umbrella and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.840" end="00:07:04.040" style="s2">think none of the above has the has the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.400" end="00:07:05.870" style="s2">simplicity and the breadth to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.040" end="00:07:07.760" style="s2">do that and again I&#39;ll just briefly list</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.870" end="00:07:09.170" style="s2">some of the groups of people I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.760" end="00:07:10.790" style="s2">about so first of all the activists I</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.170" end="00:07:12.500" style="s2">mean this is the community that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.790" end="00:07:14.000" style="s2">personally coming from this is what my</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.500" end="00:07:15.290" style="s2">perspective is all about I&#39;ve been part</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:17.570" style="s2">of the zeitgeist movement on a free</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.290" end="00:07:21.470" style="s2">party The Venus Project and more</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.570" end="00:07:23.480" style="s2">recently the game BC Gnaeus and all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.470" end="00:07:25.970" style="s2">these or all of these projects have real</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.480" end="00:07:30.110" style="s2">contributions to make to a positive</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.970" end="00:07:31.490" style="s2">vision of the future but they you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.110" end="00:07:34.010" style="s2">has slightly different takes on an</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.490" end="00:07:35.750" style="s2">intent and you know they tend not to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.010" end="00:07:37.100" style="s2">collaborate but under the umbrella of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.750" end="00:07:39.320" style="s2">Nunnelly but they can all agree that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.100" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t work right and this needs</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.320" end="00:07:43.310" style="s2">to be got out of the way so that a</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:45.170" style="s2">serious discussion can be had about what</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.310" end="00:07:46.790" style="s2">might work better and how to go about</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.170" end="00:07:48.320" style="s2">experimenting with ideas and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.790" end="00:07:51.200" style="s2">rolling them out when they&#39;re when</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.320" end="00:07:53.150" style="s2">they&#39;re known to work another group are</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.200" end="00:07:56.600" style="s2">all the non-voters i pointed out that in</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.150" end="00:07:58.130" style="s2">the UK some 35 percent of people do not</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.600" end="00:07:59.750" style="s2">vote at all now I think it&#39;s reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.130" end="00:08:02.300" style="s2">to assume that they are simply not</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.750" end="00:08:03.470" style="s2">motivated to do so and so that&#39;s 35</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.300" end="00:08:05.000" style="s2">percent for none of the above right</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.470" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">there potentially if they could be</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.000" end="00:08:08.900" style="s2">motivated to get out and actually do and</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:11.390" style="s2">none of the above</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.900" end="00:08:14.630" style="s2">lion and tick on their on their voting</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.390" end="00:08:16.970" style="s2">card and another very large group of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.630" end="00:08:18.200" style="s2">people my mother is a perfect example of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.970" end="00:08:19.730" style="s2">this she votes every single election</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.200" end="00:08:22.790" style="s2">because she believes it with her civic</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.730" end="00:08:24.650" style="s2">duty to do so right but she doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.790" end="00:08:26.120" style="s2">but she doesn&#39;t like any of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.650" end="00:08:27.590" style="s2">candidates she&#39;s not excited about any</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.120" end="00:08:29.630" style="s2">of them and so there&#39;s a very lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.590" end="00:08:32.150" style="s2">another there&#39;s another very large group</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.630" end="00:08:33.860" style="s2">of voters here potentially who if they</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.150" end="00:08:36.980" style="s2">felt that none of the above was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.860" end="00:08:40.870" style="s2">meaningful cast of their vote could</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.980" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">easily be persuade to do so I think and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.870" end="00:08:47.180" style="s2">so you know I think there&#39;s potentially</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:49.580" style="s2">70-odd maybe even 80% of the electorate</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.180" end="00:08:51.950" style="s2">right there who could be relatively</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.580" end="00:08:52.900" style="s2">easily persuaded get on board none of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.950" end="00:08:55.230" style="s2">the above</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.900" end="00:08:57.370" style="s2">so final summing up if you believe that</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.230" end="00:08:59.050" style="s2">it&#39;s just a question of waiting around</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.370" end="00:09:01.540" style="s2">for the right if you get this power to</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.050" end="00:09:03.730" style="s2">you know make things right then you go</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.540" end="00:09:05.950" style="s2">ahead and continue voting if you believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.730" end="00:09:08.170" style="s2">as I do that it&#39;s much much deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.950" end="00:09:10.120" style="s2">that none of the above really is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.170" end="00:09:11.650" style="s2">only way to go and remember this is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.120" end="00:09:13.480" style="s2">just a protest vote I mean it is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.650" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">protest but it&#39;s much more than that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.480" end="00:09:17.290" style="s2">I mean not only does it take away the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:19.480" style="s2">mandate of the government it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.290" end="00:09:21.850" style="s2">clear articulation of the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.480" end="00:09:23.920" style="s2">understand that this cannot work that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.850" end="00:09:25.510" style="s2">is in the way that we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.920" end="00:09:27.220" style="s2">something different we need to do things</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.510" end="00:09:29.290" style="s2">differently maybe don&#39;t even have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.220" end="00:09:31.180" style="s2">clear idea now but in order to figure</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.290" end="00:09:33.910" style="s2">out how we need to get this out of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.180" end="00:09:36.040" style="s2">way and have a proper conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.910" end="00:09:37.420" style="s2">having of that conversation difficult</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.040" end="00:09:39.550" style="s2">though it will be some might argue</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.420" end="00:09:43.210" style="s2">impossible but nevertheless worth</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.550" end="00:09:45.550" style="s2">attempting is also the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.210" end="00:09:47.530" style="s2">path to healing as a society coming</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.550" end="00:09:50.050" style="s2">together healing the rifts and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.530" end="00:09:52.120" style="s2">divisions that have emerged largely as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.050" end="00:09:55.450" style="s2">consequence of our adversarial political</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.120" end="00:09:56.740" style="s2">process and so what is required I am NOT</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.450" end="00:09:58.210" style="s2">this person unfortunately what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.740" end="00:10:00.100" style="s2">required is for someone to see this</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.210" end="00:10:01.810" style="s2">video think wow that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.100" end="00:10:05.560" style="s2">idea that that could really work and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.810" end="00:10:07.210" style="s2">start organizing something around it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.560" end="00:10:08.980" style="s2">like I said I am NOT that person I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.210" end="00:10:11.350" style="s2">have either the inclination the know-how</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.980" end="00:10:14.830" style="s2">all the social media presence to be able</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.350" end="00:10:17.230" style="s2">to do such a thing but that is my hope I</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.830" end="00:10:18.970" style="s2">think this idea has got real legs and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.230" end="00:10:21.220" style="s2">real traction and for those of you that</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.970" end="00:10:23.800" style="s2">have watched this series thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.220" end="00:10:26.290" style="s2">much for doing so and as I say hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.800" end="00:10:29.160" style="s2">one of you will be up and run with it</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.290" end="00:10:29.160" style="s2">thanks</p>
