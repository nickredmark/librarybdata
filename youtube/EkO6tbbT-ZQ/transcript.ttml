<p begin="00:00:00.380" end="00:00:04.380" style="s2">actually is the power of the people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.550" end="00:00:14.820" style="s2">vote and I think the people should use</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.380" end="00:00:16.109" style="s2">it to vote for so in this video I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.820" end="00:00:18.990" style="s2">to pick up on a point that I made in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.109" end="00:00:20.939" style="s2">previous video namely that our systems</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.990" end="00:00:22.380" style="s2">are going to be incapable of solving</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.939" end="00:00:24.750" style="s2">problems which they themselves have</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.380" end="00:00:27.210" style="s2">created and so things like environmental</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.750" end="00:00:28.859" style="s2">destruction and war and corruption and</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.210" end="00:00:31.650" style="s2">inequality these things have always been</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.859" end="00:00:33.420" style="s2">problems but technology has now reached</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.650" end="00:00:35.430" style="s2">the point where we do these things so</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.420" end="00:00:38.280" style="s2">well so efficiently that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.430" end="00:00:40.170" style="s2">actually become existential threats and</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.280" end="00:00:43.320" style="s2">so the time has absolutely come to</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.170" end="00:00:46.020" style="s2">re-examine the top-down rule driven</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.320" end="00:00:48.870" style="s2">systems that we employ to organize</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.020" end="00:00:51.180" style="s2">ourselves and so the top-down rule</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.870" end="00:00:53.789" style="s2">driven procedural systems that we use</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.180" end="00:00:56.550" style="s2">are complicated but the systems that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.789" end="00:00:58.949" style="s2">they seek to manage and control are</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.550" end="00:01:00.840" style="s2">complex and so what I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.949" end="00:01:02.850" style="s2">today rests on the incompatibility</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.840" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">between our systems which are</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.850" end="00:01:08.070" style="s2">complicated and the natural systems the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.939" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">people the societies the cultures the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.070" end="00:01:11.820" style="s2">natural environment with which they</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:14.000" style="s2">interact and it is this fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.820" end="00:01:16.680" style="s2">incompatible incompatibility which</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.000" end="00:01:19.950" style="s2">creates these problems as forms of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.680" end="00:01:21.869" style="s2">pollution as externalities to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:25.259" style="s2">imperfections of the system before I go</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.869" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">any further I would like to credit the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.259" end="00:01:29.729" style="s2">ideas in this are not at all mine Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">Hall and daniel trachtenberg I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.729" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">listening to a lot of their stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:37.229" style="s2">they talked a great deal about this and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">so as Jordan would say insofar as you</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.229" end="00:01:41.430" style="s2">find this interesting and enlightening</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:43.290" style="s2">that&#39;s entirely down to them and to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.430" end="00:01:47.159" style="s2">extent you which you to which you find</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.290" end="00:01:48.299" style="s2">this confusing and pointless that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.159" end="00:01:51.329" style="s2">fault</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.299" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">and so I need to begin with an</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.329" end="00:01:55.560" style="s2">explanation of the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:57.570" style="s2">the complex and the complicated for</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.560" end="00:02:00.060" style="s2">those of you not versed in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.570" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">thing so both complex and complicated</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.060" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">systems can have lots and lots and lots</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:06.540" style="s2">of independent parts the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">difference between them is that in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">complicated system relationship of each</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:12.540" style="s2">part of the system to the other parts</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">with with you interacts are very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.540" end="00:02:15.900" style="s2">defined</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:17.640" style="s2">whereas in a complex system the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.900" end="00:02:20.010" style="s2">relationship between each individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.640" end="00:02:21.510" style="s2">part of the system is not at all clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.010" end="00:02:22.890" style="s2">defined because one thing influences</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.510" end="00:02:24.689" style="s2">another influences another everything is</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.890" end="00:02:26.220" style="s2">connected to everything else whereas in</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.689" end="00:02:28.439" style="s2">a complicated system that is not the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.220" end="00:02:30.299" style="s2">case and so complicated things are</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.439" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">things like cars and aeroplanes and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.299" end="00:02:38.760" style="s2">timetables where you can follow through</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">from beginning to end and see very</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:41.579" style="s2">clearly once that leads to no leads to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:44.700" style="s2">another leads to another leads to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.579" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">another in a complex system you</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.700" end="00:02:48.780" style="s2">absolutely cannot do that you feed</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:50.730" style="s2">something in and essentially anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.780" end="00:02:52.950" style="s2">can come out I mean is it not quite like</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.730" end="00:02:56.579" style="s2">that they have tendencies and they have</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.950" end="00:02:58.650" style="s2">ranges but basically a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.579" end="00:03:00.989" style="s2">creates a great deal of randomness and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.650" end="00:03:03.389" style="s2">novelty and unpredictability whereas a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.989" end="00:03:06.329" style="s2">complicated system if you understand it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.389" end="00:03:07.319" style="s2">well is entirely predictable so that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.329" end="00:03:09.989" style="s2">a nutshell is the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.319" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">complex and complicated and so it is my</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.989" end="00:03:15.989" style="s2">contention in this video that top-down</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:18.810" style="s2">rule driven procedural algorithmic</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.989" end="00:03:21.690" style="s2">systems are incapable of effectively</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.810" end="00:03:23.370" style="s2">interfacing with natural systems which</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.690" end="00:03:25.290" style="s2">are complex and I mean this occurs at</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.370" end="00:03:28.079" style="s2">every level every organism is complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.290" end="00:03:29.849" style="s2">within its own right each ecosystem is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.079" end="00:03:32.639" style="s2">complex ecosystems linked together in</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.849" end="00:03:37.199" style="s2">complex ways the complexity is across</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.639" end="00:03:39.180" style="s2">all scales and so I&#39;d like to try and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.199" end="00:03:41.909" style="s2">illustrate the process if you will by</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.180" end="00:03:44.579" style="s2">use of an example and the example I</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.909" end="00:03:46.109" style="s2">picked is the tax code now the tax code</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.579" end="00:03:48.540" style="s2">is a very important thing right if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.109" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">the purpose of the tax code is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.540" end="00:03:53.340" style="s2">solution to the problem of how can very</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">large numbers of people who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.340" end="00:03:56.010" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:04:00.180" style="s2">collaborate on things which are going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.010" end="00:04:01.889" style="s2">be good for everyone and collaboratively</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.180" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">provide the resources to undertake these</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.889" end="00:04:07.859" style="s2">projects and so that&#39;s essentially what</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:10.169" style="s2">the tax system is seeking to do to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.859" end="00:04:13.379" style="s2">equitably get everybody can to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.169" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">contribute a fair amount for their</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.379" end="00:04:18.090" style="s2">circumstances so that there is enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:19.769" style="s2">from the society as a whole to do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.090" end="00:04:21.449" style="s2">which will benefit the society as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.769" end="00:04:23.639" style="s2">whole that&#39;s that&#39;s the idea of the tax</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.449" end="00:04:25.260" style="s2">code that&#39;s the spirit of it tax code</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.639" end="00:04:27.090" style="s2">would have started out reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.260" end="00:04:30.270" style="s2">straightforward right</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.090" end="00:04:31.980" style="s2">but then as societies become more varied</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.270" end="00:04:33.570" style="s2">and more diverse in their activities and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.980" end="00:04:36.180" style="s2">there are more members of the society</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.570" end="00:04:38.790" style="s2">there are more situations and so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.180" end="00:04:41.070" style="s2">rules of the tax code need to get more</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.790" end="00:04:42.419" style="s2">complicated to take into account all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.070" end="00:04:44.610" style="s2">the new circumstances which you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.419" end="00:04:46.290" style="s2">cropped up but of course complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.610" end="00:04:47.910" style="s2">have a virtually limitless capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.290" end="00:04:51.050" style="s2">throw up novel situations and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.910" end="00:04:53.790" style="s2">always going to get situations where</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.050" end="00:04:55.919" style="s2">somebody doesn&#39;t fit into one category</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.790" end="00:04:57.240" style="s2">or another that is that this system is</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.919" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">created and so you start getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.240" end="00:05:01.020" style="s2">arguments and this is one of the forms</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:03.000" style="s2">of pollution that I&#39;m talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.020" end="00:05:05.669" style="s2">now have disputes you have resentment</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.000" end="00:05:07.200" style="s2">you have bad feeling between the payer</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.669" end="00:05:09.090" style="s2">of the tax and the collector of the tax</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.200" end="00:05:11.940" style="s2">and if you remember that the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.090" end="00:05:14.580" style="s2">the tax code is to collectively do</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.940" end="00:05:16.380" style="s2">things that things which are benefit to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.580" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">all of us that should not be the case</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.380" end="00:05:20.280" style="s2">right paying taxes noam chomsky makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:21.330" style="s2">this point that the annual day of paying</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.280" end="00:05:23.460" style="s2">taxes should be a day of celebration</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.330" end="00:05:24.930" style="s2">when we get to implement the programs</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.460" end="00:05:27.900" style="s2">which we have collectively agreed upon</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.930" end="00:05:29.669" style="s2">but of course that is not the case right</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.900" end="00:05:31.350" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of exactly what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.669" end="00:05:33.450" style="s2">talking about so anyway following on</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.350" end="00:05:35.550" style="s2">from where I was the complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.450" end="00:05:37.500" style="s2">ability to create novel situations puts</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.550" end="00:05:39.570" style="s2">a demand on the complicated system to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.500" end="00:05:43.200" style="s2">create ever more and more rules and sub</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.570" end="00:05:45.300" style="s2">rules and caveats and exceptions and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.200" end="00:05:47.160" style="s2">on and this makes the tax code so</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.300" end="00:05:49.350" style="s2">complicated that nobody can navigate it</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.160" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">anymore it becomes too cumbersome for</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.350" end="00:05:53.010" style="s2">anybody to really understand which means</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:54.840" style="s2">it can now be exploited clever</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.010" end="00:05:57.539" style="s2">accountants clever lawyers can find</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.840" end="00:06:00.240" style="s2">loopholes in the tax code so that people</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.539" end="00:06:04.530" style="s2">can start to legally avoid paying their</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.240" end="00:06:06.210" style="s2">taxes and these kinds of tactics are</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.530" end="00:06:08.460" style="s2">only available to the rich and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.210" end="00:06:10.350" style="s2">and so you now start getting inequity</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.460" end="00:06:12.030" style="s2">built into the system because the rich</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.350" end="00:06:13.950" style="s2">people who can afford the clever</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.030" end="00:06:15.810" style="s2">accountants are not paying anywhere near</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.950" end="00:06:16.590" style="s2">as much tax as they should do whereas</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.810" end="00:06:18.630" style="s2">the poor schlubs</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.590" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">who are working every day get tax taken</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.630" end="00:06:21.630" style="s2">before they even get it in their hands</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:23.580" style="s2">you know they don&#39;t have to pay it over</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.630" end="00:06:25.560" style="s2">they get it they deducted at source and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.580" end="00:06:28.380" style="s2">so this is another form of pollution</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.560" end="00:06:30.330" style="s2">inequality is exacerbated by this tax so</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.380" end="00:06:32.190" style="s2">code because the rich are paying as much</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.330" end="00:06:34.410" style="s2">as they should in the poor repay that an</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.190" end="00:06:36.840" style="s2">unreasonable burden now goes on to poor</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.410" end="00:06:38.099" style="s2">people so that&#39;s the basic idea but then</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.840" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">of course there&#39;s more to it than that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.099" end="00:06:42.470" style="s2">right as tax revenues increase</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.880" end="00:06:43.940" style="s2">because the society gets more prosperous</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.470" end="00:06:45.560" style="s2">there are more members of the society so</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.940" end="00:06:46.910" style="s2">tax revenues increased government has</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.560" end="00:06:49.550" style="s2">more money to spend government gets</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.910" end="00:06:50.920" style="s2">larger they have more they find more</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.550" end="00:06:53.990" style="s2">things to spend money on military</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.920" end="00:06:56.230" style="s2">spending goes up major infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.990" end="00:07:00.200" style="s2">projects go up and vanity projects go up</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.230" end="00:07:03.080" style="s2">and so the demand of the states attacks</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.200" end="00:07:05.450" style="s2">its citizens goes up as well and so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.080" end="00:07:07.610" style="s2">spirit of the thing at some point gets</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.450" end="00:07:09.620" style="s2">lost instead of it being a collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.610" end="00:07:11.030" style="s2">thing for the benefit of all it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.620" end="00:07:14.330" style="s2">the government against its citizens</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.030" end="00:07:15.890" style="s2">trying to extract as much as it can from</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.330" end="00:07:17.240" style="s2">them and then of course you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.890" end="00:07:20.270" style="s2">stage where right now where rich people</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.240" end="00:07:22.610" style="s2">Lobby the government in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.270" end="00:07:24.740" style="s2">changes to the cat tax code so that they</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.610" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">can benefit from it and so this is this</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.740" end="00:07:28.520" style="s2">is the sort of final demise if you like</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:30.410" style="s2">it makes a nonsense of the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.520" end="00:07:31.610" style="s2">where those that make the rules can</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.410" end="00:07:33.380" style="s2">simply change the rules to their</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.610" end="00:07:35.330" style="s2">advantage as everybody else&#39;s expense it</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.380" end="00:07:37.660" style="s2">it creates resentment it creates</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.330" end="00:07:40.940" style="s2">increasing inequality and it creates and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.660" end="00:07:43.340" style="s2">this is the overall point creates too</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.940" end="00:07:45.290" style="s2">much tension between the complex and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.340" end="00:07:47.570" style="s2">complicated and when the tension between</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.290" end="00:07:49.040" style="s2">these two things gets too great it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.570" end="00:07:50.540" style="s2">the complex which is going to break down</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.040" end="00:07:51.710" style="s2">is been around for billions of years and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.540" end="00:07:53.480" style="s2">that&#39;s not the complex than break down</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.710" end="00:07:55.460" style="s2">as the complicated which is going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.480" end="00:07:57.140" style="s2">break down and this idea of unbearable</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.460" end="00:07:58.640" style="s2">tension between the complex and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.140" end="00:08:00.110" style="s2">complicated can be seen all over the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.640" end="00:08:02.180" style="s2">place when we&#39;ve got crises wherever we</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.110" end="00:08:04.820" style="s2">look we have a cultural crisis as</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.180" end="00:08:06.530" style="s2">evidenced by the dramatic increases in</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.820" end="00:08:09.200" style="s2">depression and suicide and drug</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.530" end="00:08:10.820" style="s2">addiction rates we have a political</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.200" end="00:08:12.860" style="s2">crisis as evidenced by the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.820" end="00:08:14.000" style="s2">there are far-right parties gaining</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.860" end="00:08:15.950" style="s2">strength everywhere we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.000" end="00:08:18.140" style="s2">authoritarianism both sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.950" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">Atlantic now we all know we&#39;re enduring</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.140" end="00:08:21.260" style="s2">an environmental crisis where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:24.170" style="s2">wiping out habitats and species at an</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.260" end="00:08:26.540" style="s2">unbelievable rate polluting air sea</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.170" end="00:08:28.730" style="s2">river and land as fast as we possibly</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.540" end="00:08:30.830" style="s2">can and all of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.730" end="00:08:32.780" style="s2">basically exactly the story that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.830" end="00:08:34.729" style="s2">already described you the tension</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.780" end="00:08:36.410" style="s2">between the complicated systems we use</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.729" end="00:08:38.930" style="s2">to harness and interact with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.410" end="00:08:40.580" style="s2">complicated become more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.930" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">more messy the tension between them gets</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.580" end="00:08:43.969" style="s2">more and more unbearable the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.599" end="00:08:46.310" style="s2">externalities ejected by the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.969" end="00:08:49.010" style="s2">into the complex become greater and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.310" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">greater and greater until the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.010" end="00:08:52.370" style="s2">complicated breaks down and it is my</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:54.649" style="s2">belief that we&#39;re at the stage now where</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.370" end="00:08:56.180" style="s2">our complicated institutions are going</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.649" end="00:08:58.369" style="s2">to start breaking down left right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.180" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">center and so my hope for none of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.369" end="00:09:04.759" style="s2">above is that we can make a choice</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:06.860" style="s2">Charles Eisenstein talks about a terrain</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.759" end="00:09:09.019" style="s2">of peaks and valleys of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.860" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">and at our current civilization has led</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.019" end="00:09:13.899" style="s2">us to the top of the existing Peak ride</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:17.269" style="s2">words as has taken us as high as it can</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.899" end="00:09:19.399" style="s2">but in order to ascend a higher peak we</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.269" end="00:09:20.779" style="s2">first need to descend this one and go</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.399" end="00:09:22.249" style="s2">down into the valley down into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.779" end="00:09:22.699" style="s2">unknown now that can happen in one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.249" end="00:09:24.619" style="s2">two ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.699" end="00:09:26.149" style="s2">either we can wait for all of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.619" end="00:09:30.439" style="s2">systems to collapse around our ears and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.149" end="00:09:32.660" style="s2">send a spiraling into chaos or we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.439" end="00:09:35.240" style="s2">vote none of the above push this out of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.660" end="00:09:36.980" style="s2">the way clear the table so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.240" end="00:09:39.230" style="s2">start having a proper conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.980" end="00:09:41.470" style="s2">systems that can be created that can</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.230" end="00:09:45.079" style="s2">interface effectively with the complex</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.470" end="00:09:46.369" style="s2">and by choosing to vote none of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.079" end="00:09:48.050" style="s2">above we can make that decision to</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.369" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">descend into the valley consciously</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.050" end="00:09:54.170" style="s2">deliberately together with a goal in</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:56.119" style="s2">mind rather than collapsing into it okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.170" end="00:09:57.470" style="s2">that&#39;s I think basically all I want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.119" end="00:10:01.220" style="s2">say for this video thank you very much</p>
