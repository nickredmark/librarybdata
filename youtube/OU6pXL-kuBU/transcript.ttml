<p begin="00:47:48.080" end="00:47:55.670" style="s2">to a small business and you&#39;ll know that</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.490" end="00:47:58.100" style="s2">the risk to you of that loan failing</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.670" end="00:48:00.500" style="s2">defaulting is actually quite high</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.100" end="00:48:02.170" style="s2">because that small business the owners</p>

<p begin="00:48:02.170" end="00:48:07.100" style="s2">which means if the business goes bust</p>
