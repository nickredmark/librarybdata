<p begin="00:00:02.040" end="00:00:13.429" style="s2">hi my name is ed Mulder and I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.220" end="00:00:16.109" style="s2">an actual project but I have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.429" end="00:00:20.609" style="s2">which is actually what this is about</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.109" end="00:00:21.150" style="s2">on brainstorming brainstorming so right</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.609" end="00:00:24.480" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.150" end="00:00:29.029" style="s2">project raising is becoming a place</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.480" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">where people who have projects under way</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.029" end="00:00:37.290" style="s2">aim B and are thus into what I call the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:41.550" style="s2">B sphere I got that off at Twitter a few</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.290" end="00:00:44.309" style="s2">days ago have a place to you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:46.590" style="s2">present their projects and then then we</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.309" end="00:00:49.079" style="s2">have a collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.590" end="00:00:52.199" style="s2">you know emerging here that can review</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.079" end="00:00:54.180" style="s2">those projects and get feedback and you</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.199" end="00:00:57.300" style="s2">know hopefully down the line can</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.180" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">actually do the raising part you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.300" end="00:01:04.650" style="s2">and then we have projects that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">emerging directly from game B who that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.650" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">are actual projects but what I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">we don&#39;t have is something for people</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:20.369" style="s2">who have maybe an idea or you know they</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:21.630" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that idea is viable they</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.369" end="00:01:26.990" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it makes sense and they</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.630" end="00:01:33.210" style="s2">can be context or affiliated context and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.990" end="00:01:36.659" style="s2">they don&#39;t know how to proceed so my my</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">suggestion is that either project</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.659" end="00:01:42.689" style="s2">raising expands to encompass that type</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:44.759" style="s2">of functionality or it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.689" end="00:01:49.860" style="s2">separate project affiliated with project</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.759" end="00:01:53.100" style="s2">raising so actually the way I would like</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.860" end="00:01:57.180" style="s2">to proceed today is to actually go into</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.100" end="00:02:03.719" style="s2">that mode that I&#39;m describing and apply</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.180" end="00:02:06.509" style="s2">it to this idea itself so I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.719" end="00:02:11.260" style="s2">to hear what anybody else here has to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.509" end="00:02:13.209" style="s2">say right now about that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.260" end="00:02:16.209" style="s2">I think that&#39;s great idea Sora will</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.209" end="00:02:18.220" style="s2">liked the idea brainstorming and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.209" end="00:02:21.489" style="s2">brainstorming and and and I like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.220" end="00:02:27.970" style="s2">idea of including brainstorming as part</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.489" end="00:02:29.620" style="s2">of this and even even I wonderful if it</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.970" end="00:02:31.510" style="s2">would be wise to even take a further</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.620" end="00:02:34.209" style="s2">step back in the process and say someone</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.510" end="00:02:36.549" style="s2">can come to us with a problem like and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.209" end="00:02:38.849" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s what you mean also like</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.549" end="00:02:41.829" style="s2">they say oh I want to solve world hunger</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.849" end="00:02:43.930" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s raise that up in brainstorm</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.829" end="00:02:45.730" style="s2">over that problem is that kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.930" end="00:02:47.530" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.730" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">actually actually that adds to what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.530" end="00:02:52.030" style="s2">they gain so it&#39;s not just an idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:54.579" style="s2">you know there&#39;s problems and you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.030" end="00:02:57.099" style="s2">what kind of ideas and projects could we</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.579" end="00:03:01.930" style="s2">you know form in that problem solution</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.099" end="00:03:06.819" style="s2">space yeah I I think that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.930" end="00:03:09.489" style="s2">good well and I&#39;m reminded of some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.819" end="00:03:12.730" style="s2">the stuff that I&#39;ve watched from Bonita</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.489" end="00:03:15.870" style="s2">Roy and it may be listen come from her</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.730" end="00:03:15.870" style="s2">specifically but the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.379" end="00:03:21.190" style="s2">ultimately what you want to when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.549" end="00:03:23.530" style="s2">bring a group together for collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.190" end="00:03:26.829" style="s2">intelligence what you&#39;re gonna come away</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.530" end="00:03:28.720" style="s2">with is an idea that doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.829" end="00:03:31.620" style="s2">anything like any of the ideas that any</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:33.970" style="s2">one individual person came in with and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.620" end="00:03:37.419" style="s2">you know I love that people are coming</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.970" end="00:03:38.949" style="s2">in with their set with it with these</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.419" end="00:03:42.730" style="s2">really grand visions and these amazing</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.949" end="00:03:45.250" style="s2">ideas and I&#39;ve also seen it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.730" end="00:03:47.769" style="s2">I have that you know how attached are we</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.250" end="00:03:51.910" style="s2">to this vision and to how it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.769" end="00:03:54.340" style="s2">look and coming in and going okay I know</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.910" end="00:03:58.599" style="s2">I want to be part of this process I know</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.340" end="00:04:01.569" style="s2">I want to help but I don&#39;t have a I</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.599" end="00:04:05.199" style="s2">don&#39;t have a sense of how my skills can</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.569" end="00:04:07.540" style="s2">fit into this overall picture and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.199" end="00:04:11.709" style="s2">figuring out kind of like okay how can I</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.540" end="00:04:16.030" style="s2">contribute my skills to this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.709" end="00:04:18.430" style="s2">I want to see developed right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.030" end="00:04:21.010" style="s2">like that too because in the game a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.430" end="00:04:23.169" style="s2">world and I don&#39;t know if this will</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.010" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">always be exclusive to game a I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.169" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">will apply to game B</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">but like you go into a job and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:37.380" style="s2">looking for certain skills and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:39.750" style="s2">you try to determine whether you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.380" end="00:04:43.860" style="s2">those skills but what about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.750" end="00:04:46.680" style="s2">situation where the project itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.860" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">doesn&#39;t isn&#39;t quite aware of what skills</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.680" end="00:04:53.130" style="s2">will be needed you know so there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.919" end="00:04:59.570" style="s2">this this already determined criteria</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.130" end="00:05:02.250" style="s2">for who can participate you can&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.570" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">think just that like being able to come</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.250" end="00:05:07.259" style="s2">to a space and brainstorm with people</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:09.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t need your skill set set out</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.259" end="00:05:11.400" style="s2">it&#39;s super powerful to have it set out</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.000" end="00:05:13.110" style="s2">so is in the future you can like it</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.400" end="00:05:14.460" style="s2">could be something you Grady right like</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.110" end="00:05:16.169" style="s2">I need to figure out my skill set is so</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.460" end="00:05:18.539" style="s2">I know where I&#39;m I&#39;m going or you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.169" end="00:05:20.699" style="s2">just show up to conversations and apply</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.539" end="00:05:22.530" style="s2">who you are and what you know which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.699" end="00:05:25.410" style="s2">your skill set and then through that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.530" end="00:05:28.979" style="s2">find out oh you&#39;re really great at this</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.410" end="00:05:30.930" style="s2">at this process and yeah just having a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.979" end="00:05:35.639" style="s2">space to have these conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.930" end="00:05:37.620" style="s2">and then the tools to empower them well</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.639" end="00:05:40.620" style="s2">and I just want to Jubilee I really</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.620" end="00:05:43.620" style="s2">appreciated that and I want to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.620" end="00:05:46.770" style="s2">like as I was sharing what I just shared</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.620" end="00:05:48.930" style="s2">I was noticing like wait this voice in</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.770" end="00:05:50.430" style="s2">my head saying well you can&#39;t say come</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.930" end="00:05:51.479" style="s2">in there not knowing what your skill set</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.430" end="00:05:54.750" style="s2">is you&#39;re supposed to know what your</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.479" end="00:05:56.669" style="s2">skill set is and like and and seeing how</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.750" end="00:05:59.009" style="s2">that influenced what I was saying as I</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.669" end="00:06:01.590" style="s2">was saying it because I had this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.009" end="00:06:04.889" style="s2">what I thought I needed to be in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.590" end="00:06:07.740" style="s2">moment and so like especially in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.889" end="00:06:09.720" style="s2">place of brainstorming brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.740" end="00:06:11.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s a vulnerable place to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.720" end="00:06:18.060" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s coming in and saying I</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.940" end="00:06:19.830" style="s2">don&#39;t know and that&#39;s a we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.060" end="00:06:22.050" style="s2">supposed to be in that like in game a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.830" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">you&#39;re not supposed to say I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.050" end="00:06:25.380" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to have the answers</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:29.240" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to you know like be the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.380" end="00:06:33.139" style="s2">expert and coming in and going yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.240" end="00:06:33.139" style="s2">here I want to participate</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.889" end="00:06:39.469" style="s2">I I would also like to add to that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.060" end="00:06:45.740" style="s2">often times we have skills and skill</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.310" end="00:06:48.270" style="s2">sets that we&#39;re not even aware of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.740" end="00:06:51.030" style="s2">because you know we all have life</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.270" end="00:06:52.620" style="s2">experienced over a broad range of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.030" end="00:06:55.560" style="s2">different types of events and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.620" end="00:06:58.259" style="s2">experiences and everything and if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.560" end="00:07:00.330" style="s2">put those together sometimes you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.259" end="00:07:02.460" style="s2">from the most unlikely places what</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.330" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">you&#39;ll discover is that hey I have</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.460" end="00:07:08.250" style="s2">skills that I didn&#39;t even know I had and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:10.110" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t have figured that out but</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.250" end="00:07:12.840" style="s2">suddenly I&#39;m hearing something about</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.110" end="00:07:15.539" style="s2">this project that you know ignites</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.840" end="00:07:17.669" style="s2">something in my head and boom puts them</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.539" end="00:07:19.710" style="s2">together suddenly I realized that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.669" end="00:07:25.080" style="s2">actually have a skill set I wasn&#39;t aware</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.710" end="00:07:27.539" style="s2">of and also just add to that also</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.080" end="00:07:28.969" style="s2">sometimes just having I&#39;m sure people</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.539" end="00:07:31.050" style="s2">have a willingness to learn new skills</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.969" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">needed by the project cause if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.050" end="00:07:35.219" style="s2">passionate about that I do software</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:37.710" style="s2">development but I&#39;ve been learning a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.219" end="00:07:42.029" style="s2">about marketing so that people will use</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.710" end="00:07:45.120" style="s2">my stuff so very similar thing I think I</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.029" end="00:07:54.990" style="s2">think I think if people are open to that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:56.250" style="s2">then that would be great like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.990" end="00:07:57.629" style="s2">know what your skill set is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.250" end="00:07:59.990" style="s2">times because it&#39;s almost like you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.629" end="00:08:02.219" style="s2">to compare yourself to other people and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.990" end="00:08:04.409" style="s2">because you have to know everything in</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.219" end="00:08:06.210" style="s2">game a there&#39;s this like certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.409" end="00:08:09.150" style="s2">of facade you have to put on that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.210" end="00:08:12.120" style="s2">know everything and even in even with</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.150" end="00:08:14.550" style="s2">yourself and so you assume everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.120" end="00:08:15.750" style="s2">you&#39;re good at everyone&#39;s good at and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.550" end="00:08:17.460" style="s2">you don&#39;t see the beauty and what you</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.750" end="00:08:19.349" style="s2">have to offer and the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.460" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">hard for you you&#39;re hiding right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.349" end="00:08:23.569" style="s2">late so you can&#39;t have someone else</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:26.310" style="s2">offer that to you and you can&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.569" end="00:08:28.919" style="s2">beauty in that combination in like you</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.310" end="00:08:30.750" style="s2">are exactly your skill set is you like</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.919" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">that you bring what is easy for you and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.750" end="00:08:33.750" style="s2">when it&#39;s hard and what you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:36.060" style="s2">to take on like that lay set right like</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.750" end="00:08:37.560" style="s2">if something your marketing and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.060" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to marketing you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.560" end="00:08:40.860" style="s2">best one at the table or you&#39;re the one</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:42.599" style="s2">willing to take it on at the table then</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.860" end="00:08:44.219" style="s2">you&#39;re more empowered to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.599" end="00:08:46.230" style="s2">then that process like that feels</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.219" end="00:08:47.399" style="s2">vulnerable but if you&#39;re matched with</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.230" end="00:08:48.380" style="s2">someone who has more marketing</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.399" end="00:08:50.180" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.380" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">and they&#39;re able to walk you through</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.180" end="00:08:53.480" style="s2">that process even if they&#39;re not on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:54.980" style="s2">project itself right or not in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.480" end="00:08:58.070" style="s2">brainstorming is basic there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.980" end="00:09:01.790" style="s2">that can happen when you show up and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.070" end="00:09:04.210" style="s2">admit what you know know and allow it to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.790" end="00:09:04.210" style="s2">emerge</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.850" end="00:09:19.730" style="s2">I think Jamie will and Steven Kotler</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.610" end="00:09:22.220" style="s2">wrote the book stealing fire and and in</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.730" end="00:09:25.550" style="s2">there they talk about how Navy SEAL</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.220" end="00:09:27.200" style="s2">Teams operate and it&#39;s kind of similar</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.550" end="00:09:29.900" style="s2">to what you were saying you know who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.200" end="00:09:32.570" style="s2">who&#39;s ever I&#39;m not sure how to word this</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.900" end="00:09:35.840" style="s2">but who&#39;s ever in the right place at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.570" end="00:09:37.820" style="s2">moment with the you know with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.840" end="00:09:39.890" style="s2">knowledge of what needs to be done or</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.820" end="00:09:42.260" style="s2">skill it needs to be done that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.890" end="00:09:51.470" style="s2">person who steps in and takes leadership</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.260" end="00:09:55.250" style="s2">at that point yeah that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.470" end="00:09:56.150" style="s2">I wonder if we&#39;d want to start putting a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.250" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">little structure around this</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.150" end="00:10:02.210" style="s2">conversation but let me know if it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:07.490" style="s2">early for that I just was wondering how</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.210" end="00:10:13.700" style="s2">do we invite this concept into this</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.490" end="00:10:15.320" style="s2">space is it as simple as I mean do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.700" end="00:10:17.240" style="s2">need to do something as big as changing</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.320" end="00:10:19.940" style="s2">the name or does project raising still</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.240" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">kind of fit which is that our name for</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.940" end="00:10:28.400" style="s2">the student layout if so many names</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:31.100" style="s2">flying yes yes project crazy is which I</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.400" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">think still kind of fits that but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.100" end="00:10:36.230" style="s2">a little if we could workshop a blurb</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:37.940" style="s2">then that jubblies been putting out the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.230" end="00:10:39.290" style="s2">announcements but she&#39;s not tagged with</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.940" end="00:10:43.160" style="s2">having to do that all in the future but</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.290" end="00:10:45.290" style="s2">some kind of language that would</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.160" end="00:10:47.150" style="s2">communicate the openness that the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.290" end="00:10:48.650" style="s2">the projects that we&#39;re raising don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.150" end="00:10:50.600" style="s2">have to be fully formed and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.650" end="00:10:52.940" style="s2">even have to be a solution yet it could</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.600" end="00:10:55.570" style="s2">just be a problem does anyone have any</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.940" end="00:10:55.570" style="s2">thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.339" end="00:11:04.680" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a great idea I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.189" end="00:11:08.069" style="s2">maybe what what I was thinking was maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.680" end="00:11:12.449" style="s2">you know most most of these Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.069" end="00:11:14.639" style="s2">night or Saturday morning sessions here</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.449" end="00:11:16.649" style="s2">are around projects because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.639" end="00:11:20.220" style="s2">lot of projects but maybe you know every</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.649" end="00:11:24.149" style="s2">few weeks set aside one for a problem or</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.220" end="00:11:26.220" style="s2">I actually the more I think about right</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.149" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">now the more I like the idea of coming</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.220" end="00:11:35.790" style="s2">at this for problems you know because</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:37.970" style="s2">people might have an idea but - if they</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.790" end="00:11:40.559" style="s2">could associate that was a specific</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.970" end="00:11:45.300" style="s2">problem or problem set that would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.559" end="00:11:47.670" style="s2">really good yeah and kind of maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.300" end="00:11:49.470" style="s2">term like an open-mike although that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.670" end="00:11:50.970" style="s2">might imply that they could also bring</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.470" end="00:11:53.610" style="s2">their projects which it wouldn&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.970" end="00:11:55.709" style="s2">bit appropriate time for that if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.610" end="00:11:56.850" style="s2">not related to the other discussions and</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.709" end="00:11:58.319" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if we want to start off</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.850" end="00:12:01.470" style="s2">with the problem or just have it be</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.319" end="00:12:03.360" style="s2">completely open mic and people can bring</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.470" end="00:12:05.879" style="s2">up problems with it brainstorm however</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.360" end="00:12:10.949" style="s2">many there are and and just go with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.879" end="00:12:12.689" style="s2">flow what could submit problems ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.949" end="00:12:14.759" style="s2">time and we could vote on them to see</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.689" end="00:12:16.199" style="s2">which one generates like that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.759" end="00:12:20.550" style="s2">want that&#39;s what I have and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.199" end="00:12:22.860" style="s2">talk about right and so therefore you</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.550" end="00:12:24.209" style="s2">know not necessarily like this is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.860" end="00:12:26.069" style="s2">space where I like the idea of not</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.209" end="00:12:27.509" style="s2">having the problem ahead of time is you</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.069" end="00:12:28.709" style="s2">feel like you need to be an expert in</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.509" end="00:12:29.250" style="s2">that problem to show up and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.709" end="00:12:31.470" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.250" end="00:12:33.899" style="s2">when you don&#39;t you just need to be it to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.470" end="00:12:36.180" style="s2">be an intriguing problem to you right</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.899" end="00:12:38.430" style="s2">that that you want to be able to offer</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.180" end="00:12:40.079" style="s2">your opinion on it as opposed to like</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.430" end="00:12:40.829" style="s2">food scarcity let&#39;s talk about food</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.079" end="00:12:42.990" style="s2">scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.829" end="00:12:44.459" style="s2">do you eat you know like that is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.990" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">level of what you where you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.459" end="00:12:49.949" style="s2">to contribute not you need to be a you</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:51.839" style="s2">know farmer or a you know have an</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.949" end="00:12:54.569" style="s2">agricultural background like you need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.839" end="00:12:59.870" style="s2">just show up are you interested do you</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.569" end="00:13:03.050" style="s2">want to talk about food scarcity right</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.870" end="00:13:07.319" style="s2">yeah I think I think to what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.050" end="00:13:14.019" style="s2">envisioning is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.319" end="00:13:15.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a way via software or some kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.019" end="00:13:21.660" style="s2">of platform where we can you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.639" end="00:13:26.410" style="s2">surface basically you know people skills</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.660" end="00:13:29.230" style="s2">resources so that say you know we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.410" end="00:13:32.110" style="s2">start realizing where all these things</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.230" end="00:13:34.029" style="s2">connect you know even even within</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.110" end="00:13:36.579" style="s2">projects or might be projects that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.029" end="00:13:38.199" style="s2">there&#39;s this project solving this</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.579" end="00:13:43.480" style="s2">problem and this project solving this</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.199" end="00:13:46.749" style="s2">problem but there&#39;s certain certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.480" end="00:13:48.939" style="s2">solutions or methods or something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.749" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">this project is discovered that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.939" end="00:13:55.660" style="s2">applicable to this project so you know a</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:58.180" style="s2">kind of cross-pollination but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.660" end="00:14:02.100" style="s2">ability to get resources and people</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.180" end="00:14:02.100" style="s2">where they&#39;re needed when they&#39;re needed</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.740" end="00:14:11.050" style="s2">one of the what came to mind it was it</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.279" end="00:14:14.230" style="s2">for me as we were talking about that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.050" end="00:14:16.149" style="s2">you know tying back to what Jubilee said</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.230" end="00:14:22.300" style="s2">about maybe not even knowing what your</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.149" end="00:14:25.929" style="s2">skill set is and there again that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.300" end="00:14:27.639" style="s2">the game a mentality of what I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.929" end="00:14:29.829" style="s2">to present as though I know something</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.639" end="00:14:33.129" style="s2">even though I you know I&#39;m gonna present</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.829" end="00:14:40.600" style="s2">it as an expert and I&#39;m gonna hide the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.129" end="00:14:46.779" style="s2">things that I don&#39;t know how to how do</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.600" end="00:14:51.149" style="s2">you create more of a feedback loop with</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.779" end="00:14:53.499" style="s2">those things you know it&#39;s there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.149" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">have a few people that I&#39;m that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.499" end="00:14:57.370" style="s2">comfortable with that know me really</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:15:01.059" style="s2">well and they know some of my skills but</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.370" end="00:15:02.679" style="s2">they they also have a set image of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.059" end="00:15:05.499" style="s2">know an idea in their head of Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.679" end="00:15:07.420" style="s2">and so other new people who I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.499" end="00:15:09.550" style="s2">very well they might see something in me</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.420" end="00:15:11.860" style="s2">that the people that I you know that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.550" end="00:15:13.059" style="s2">love me like they know that when you</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.860" end="00:15:17.639" style="s2">when you&#39;re really close to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.059" end="00:15:20.860" style="s2">they know you really well but it is this</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.639" end="00:15:23.110" style="s2">but that&#39;s a vulnerable thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.860" end="00:15:24.010" style="s2">is to open yourself up to wait this</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.110" end="00:15:27.010" style="s2">person is going to give them feedback</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.010" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s uncomfortable I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.010" end="00:15:35.710" style="s2">want to necessarily let them see and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:40.360" style="s2">so Edward to tie that in like how you</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.710" end="00:15:44.440" style="s2">know like how could we create you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.360" end="00:15:50.290" style="s2">that a feedback loop of that information</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.440" end="00:15:52.690" style="s2">and in order to like get a sense of oh</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.290" end="00:15:53.860" style="s2">yeah this has this set of skills and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.690" end="00:15:56.740" style="s2">know there are some people who are</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.860" end="00:15:59.350" style="s2">really good at connecting that tends to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.740" end="00:16:01.720" style="s2">be something that I like to do is like I</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.350" end="00:16:03.910" style="s2">will fight I will like okay I know you</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.720" end="00:16:05.230" style="s2">and I know what you&#39;re interested in and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.910" end="00:16:06.580" style="s2">I want to connect you with this other</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.230" end="00:16:08.370" style="s2">person because I think that you guys</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.580" end="00:16:12.310" style="s2">would you know there there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.370" end="00:16:16.660" style="s2">you guys have in common or an interest</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.310" end="00:16:19.990" style="s2">but how to make that more of an explicit</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.660" end="00:16:23.740" style="s2">thing something that people are that</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.990" end="00:16:27.610" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do even more consciously</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.740" end="00:16:29.860" style="s2">I think it might help to put I got</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.610" end="00:16:32.080" style="s2">framework around maybe a certain in</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.860" end="00:16:35.230" style="s2">session so keep it open like a storming</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.080" end="00:16:37.300" style="s2">about a storming but put one session in</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.230" end="00:16:38.890" style="s2">a frame of like we&#39;ll be talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.300" end="00:16:41.050" style="s2">variety or ideas but in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.890" end="00:16:43.360" style="s2">marketing in the game be space and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.050" end="00:16:45.280" style="s2">ideally find at least one person who we</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:48.000" style="s2">know is fairly qualified and you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.280" end="00:16:50.380" style="s2">knows about that topic to attend and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.000" end="00:16:51.850" style="s2">then the goal is that other people speak</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.380" end="00:16:53.500" style="s2">up if you think that you might enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.850" end="00:16:56.080" style="s2">that if you you know are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.500" end="00:16:57.760" style="s2">EE in marketing you show up the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.080" end="00:16:58.990" style="s2">that the expert talks as little as</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.760" end="00:17:00.820" style="s2">possible helps frame the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.990" end="00:17:04.390" style="s2">and sort of helps you know avoid any</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.820" end="00:17:05.680" style="s2">pitfalls and in the end if you felt like</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.390" end="00:17:07.450" style="s2">oh I actually participated in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.680" end="00:17:14.620" style="s2">conversation my decent to be welcome</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.450" end="00:17:15.790" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m okay at marketing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.620" end="00:17:17.290" style="s2">something else that came to mind like</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.790" end="00:17:20.410" style="s2">that idea of having like an expert there</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.290" end="00:17:23.740" style="s2">to guide it was to like every project</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.410" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">kind of needs there&#39;s a certain core</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.740" end="00:17:26.590" style="s2">group of people it needs right like it</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:28.270" style="s2">needs the marketer it needs it needs</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.590" end="00:17:31.030" style="s2">certain pieces the finance person maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.270" end="00:17:32.890" style="s2">and if someone&#39;s willing to take on that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.030" end="00:17:33.900" style="s2">role for that project even if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.890" end="00:17:36.540" style="s2">going to have far</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.900" end="00:17:38.730" style="s2">how forward is it gonna go right like</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.540" end="00:17:40.440" style="s2">clearly that&#39;s not in the idea phase but</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.730" end="00:17:42.930" style="s2">like I said they&#39;re matched with like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.440" end="00:17:46.140" style="s2">person who knows who knows marketing but</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.930" end="00:17:47.910" style="s2">also like a group of people who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.140" end="00:17:48.900" style="s2">learning it right like a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.910" end="00:17:50.280" style="s2">who are like hey we&#39;re taking on</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.900" end="00:17:52.710" style="s2">marketing for our own individual</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.280" end="00:17:54.120" style="s2">projects and we&#39;re median marketing</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.710" end="00:17:56.730" style="s2">circles so that we can further our</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.120" end="00:18:00.090" style="s2">marketing skills if that&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.730" end="00:18:02.130" style="s2">want to take on right so like sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.090" end="00:18:04.380" style="s2">break off sessions for the people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.130" end="00:18:08.490" style="s2">are in the interested sphere to like</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.380" end="00:18:11.010" style="s2">talk about it more than once a week yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.490" end="00:18:12.660" style="s2">like like I mean are we brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.010" end="00:18:14.460" style="s2">right now what this space looks like for</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.660" end="00:18:17.100" style="s2">for project because yeah that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.460" end="00:18:18.900" style="s2">little outside of this scope but if</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.100" end="00:18:22.920" style="s2">there was technology underlining it</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.900" end="00:18:24.540" style="s2">right then we&#39;d like you know you just</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.920" end="00:18:26.040" style="s2">need to schedule the marketing session</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.540" end="00:18:27.540" style="s2">and so there could be several throughout</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.040" end="00:18:29.400" style="s2">the week or one throughout the week that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.540" end="00:18:35.670" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of the schedule eight to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.400" end="00:18:37.380" style="s2">whatever I guess in my view that&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.670" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">about this particular session we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.380" end="00:18:40.940" style="s2">figure out how it fits in and it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:43.530" style="s2">just about what does it look like</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.940" end="00:18:45.510" style="s2">getting people to explore and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.530" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">understand that oh I&#39;m actually good at</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.510" end="00:18:48.840" style="s2">this I you know participated in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:51.180" style="s2">conversation maybe it was around like</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.840" end="00:18:53.700" style="s2">development and I really wasn&#39;t good so</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.180" end="00:18:55.310" style="s2">I&#39;ll steer away from that or maybe watch</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.700" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">a few more and see if I missed something</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.310" end="00:19:01.410" style="s2">I think in the end I ideally you&#39;ll end</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:02.970" style="s2">up with a bunch of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.410" end="00:19:06.270" style="s2">exploring new interests and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.970" end="00:19:08.910" style="s2">definitely want a decent like so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.270" end="00:19:10.560" style="s2">know selection of choices for them to go</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.910" end="00:19:12.870" style="s2">out and actively participate in these</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.560" end="00:19:14.790" style="s2">other sessions knowing that like</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.870" end="00:19:15.900" style="s2">something a lot like marketing I will</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.790" end="00:19:18.540" style="s2">end up being interesting to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.900" end="00:19:20.880" style="s2">people especially it like with the kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.540" end="00:19:23.790" style="s2">of up audience that were the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.880" end="00:19:25.860" style="s2">people in this session right now</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.790" end="00:19:26.850" style="s2">and you&#39;d want them to actually be able</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.860" end="00:19:28.350" style="s2">to go out and have a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.850" end="00:19:30.180" style="s2">conversations that ends up being twenty</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.350" end="00:19:34.680" style="s2">people who think grow out that maybe I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.680" end="00:19:38.940" style="s2">in gaeme when like you choose to be the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.810" end="00:19:40.950" style="s2">orc or the you know rogue or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.940" end="00:19:42.840" style="s2">and and then when you&#39;re putting your</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.950" end="00:19:43.950" style="s2">team together you also need a certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.840" end="00:19:47.780" style="s2">number of people you can&#39;t be all</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.950" end="00:19:50.300" style="s2">patrols you can&#39;t be all and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.780" end="00:19:51.890" style="s2">is like I know which piece is on</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.300" end="00:19:53.330" style="s2">absolutely horrible at I know which</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.890" end="00:19:54.920" style="s2">piece is I&#39;m learning at I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.330" end="00:19:57.620" style="s2">and like to be able to put a team</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.920" end="00:19:58.700" style="s2">together not the team right this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.620" end="00:20:01.250" style="s2">necessarily bringing it through but like</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.700" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">I want to brainstorm this idea and at</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.250" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">this point I need this panel of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.440" end="00:20:07.850" style="s2">and then it like draws them draws them</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:10.220" style="s2">in right kind of way too techie and like</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.850" end="00:20:13.700" style="s2">algorithm and stuff but like that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.220" end="00:20:15.350" style="s2">cool something I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.700" end="00:20:17.420" style="s2">asking in the game be space but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.350" end="00:20:20.330" style="s2">sure even had a really structured the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.420" end="00:20:22.790" style="s2">question to have it be participate about</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.330" end="00:20:24.350" style="s2">is just what does everyone feel like</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.790" end="00:20:25.820" style="s2">their skill sets are so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.350" end="00:20:26.840" style="s2">start to see like oh that person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.820" end="00:20:29.020" style="s2">actually says that they&#39;re good at</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.840" end="00:20:31.790" style="s2">finance okay prepare for a lot of emails</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.020" end="00:20:33.080" style="s2">and whereas if somebody thinks that</p>

<p begin="00:20:33.080" end="00:20:36.710" style="s2">imagine that&#39;s gonna be most of the</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.710" end="00:20:40.670" style="s2">is they&#39;re coming at it from sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.660" end="00:20:42.440" style="s2">product view and then there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.670" end="00:20:44.000" style="s2">at least one of their skilled bolted on</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.440" end="00:20:46.850" style="s2">whether it&#39;s being a developer or a</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.000" end="00:20:49.100" style="s2">marketer or that kind of thing but to</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.440" end="00:21:10.280" style="s2">concept of a product owner they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:11.810" style="s2">the part you know they don&#39;t necessarily</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.170" end="00:21:23.030" style="s2">trying to move forward so it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.140" end="00:21:27.290" style="s2">something says something is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.030" end="00:21:34.780" style="s2">installed so let&#39;s you know kind of pull</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.290" end="00:21:37.820" style="s2">people together and there&#39;s the and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.780" end="00:21:39.920" style="s2">you know but again they don&#39;t they might</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.820" end="00:21:42.980" style="s2">not have you know their expertise might</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.920" end="00:21:46.990" style="s2">simply be in corralling people that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.980" end="00:21:52.070" style="s2">needed to move a project forward and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.990" end="00:21:56.540" style="s2">there&#39;s because within that there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.070" end="00:21:59.630" style="s2">know that one of the one of the skills</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.540" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">that I&#39;m that I know I&#39;m good at is like</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.630" end="00:22:03.070" style="s2">I&#39;m really good at</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:04.660" style="s2">in space for somebody who&#39;s struggling</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.070" end="00:22:06.580" style="s2">with stuff like that&#39;s something I know</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.660" end="00:22:08.740" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know where that you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.580" end="00:22:15.010" style="s2">fits in in the context of everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.740" end="00:22:17.740" style="s2">that&#39;s happening and yet and so like and</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.010" end="00:22:19.210" style="s2">what I hear a lot of within within this</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.740" end="00:22:21.460" style="s2">conversation is like a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.210" end="00:22:22.870" style="s2">technical stuff but there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.460" end="00:22:25.090" style="s2">people skit you know there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.870" end="00:22:29.740" style="s2">people aspect of it and how that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.090" end="00:22:33.850" style="s2">includes included within the within that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.740" end="00:22:37.830" style="s2">space and there&#39;s and I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.850" end="00:22:43.600" style="s2">again there&#39;s less how do you you know I</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.830" end="00:22:47.350" style="s2">tend to be somebody who I sort of relish</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.600" end="00:22:48.940" style="s2">going in in and being like vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.350" end="00:22:52.059" style="s2">I&#39;m okay with that I&#39;m okay with</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.940" end="00:22:55.299" style="s2">exposing myself in that way but not</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.059" end="00:22:57.960" style="s2">everybody is in fact most people are not</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.299" end="00:23:03.220" style="s2">comfortable with that and so how to</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.960" end="00:23:04.840" style="s2">create a space where like it&#39;s okay if</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.220" end="00:23:06.580" style="s2">you come in and you don&#39;t have any idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.840" end="00:23:08.890" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about and you say</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.580" end="00:23:11.350" style="s2">something that&#39;s not even you know that</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.890" end="00:23:13.780" style="s2">and and you can raise your hand</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.350" end="00:23:17.220" style="s2">tentatively and go well I thought maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.780" end="00:23:22.090" style="s2">about this like how to encourage that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.220" end="00:23:25.720" style="s2">space with vulnerability that because</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.090" end="00:23:28.679" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s yeah it&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.720" end="00:23:32.440" style="s2">space it&#39;s where it&#39;s safe to fail um</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.679" end="00:23:35.380" style="s2">where you you know think I&#39;m gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.440" end="00:23:38.799" style="s2">this and it&#39;s a safe place you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.380" end="00:23:40.900" style="s2">not going to impact the overall goals of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.799" end="00:23:43.870" style="s2">the project in a negative way like we</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.900" end="00:23:45.760" style="s2">learn to think with game a um you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.870" end="00:23:49.530" style="s2">you you don&#39;t hire people and see if</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.760" end="00:23:52.600" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have the skills or whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.530" end="00:23:55.540" style="s2">but instead to be able to create a space</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.600" end="00:23:58.390" style="s2">where people feel comfortable going into</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.540" end="00:24:00.250" style="s2">that space and and trying it out you</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.390" end="00:24:01.620" style="s2">know and if it&#39;s not for them then</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.250" end="00:24:04.600" style="s2">that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.620" end="00:24:06.250" style="s2">but in order to create that space you</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.600" end="00:24:10.090" style="s2">need the people skills that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.250" end="00:24:12.370" style="s2">talking about again I&#39;m right you know I</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.090" end="00:24:15.190" style="s2">come from a tech background and again</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.370" end="00:24:17.980" style="s2">I&#39;m reminded of like a sandbox</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.190" end="00:24:21.190" style="s2">in all that we&#39;re goin and you can you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.980" end="00:24:24.180" style="s2">know you can you screw things up break</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.190" end="00:24:27.760" style="s2">things try you know try things out and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.180" end="00:24:30.190" style="s2">often you know my husband he he&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.760" end="00:24:32.410" style="s2">into an organization and he&#39;ll that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.190" end="00:24:33.700" style="s2">they&#39;ll be like okay here here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.410" end="00:24:35.320" style="s2">sandbox and people are like wait a</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.700" end="00:24:38.650" style="s2">minute like I didn&#39;t know what to do it</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.320" end="00:24:44.500" style="s2">like a place to play to try things out</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.650" end="00:24:45.910" style="s2">you to I love I am I love the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.500" end="00:24:50.440" style="s2">there is no failure only feedback</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.910" end="00:24:51.970" style="s2">because so much of game a is you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.440" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve been conditioned that if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.970" end="00:24:57.790" style="s2">failed you you know we failed whereas</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:58.870" style="s2">it&#39;s let&#39;s try something let&#39;s serve</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.790" end="00:25:03.820" style="s2">something at the wall and see what</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.870" end="00:25:07.090" style="s2">sticks and encourage that sense of play</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.820" end="00:25:09.220" style="s2">and you know the and I&#39;m reminded of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.090" end="00:25:13.260" style="s2">John for Vicki one of the things he said</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.220" end="00:25:16.510" style="s2">is play is sacred and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.260" end="00:25:19.180" style="s2">encourage that play with ideas and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.510" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">is like that is something that it took</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.180" end="00:25:24.730" style="s2">me like falling flat on my face and life</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:26.410" style="s2">to go oh wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.730" end="00:25:28.600" style="s2">I can actually try things and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.410" end="00:25:30.400" style="s2">have to know the answers like I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.600" end="00:25:32.310" style="s2">terrified to try anything until I fell</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.400" end="00:25:34.630" style="s2">flat on my face and it&#39;s like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.310" end="00:25:36.400" style="s2">that didn&#39;t work so let&#39;s pick ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.630" end="00:25:42.100" style="s2">up and try again</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.400" end="00:25:44.380" style="s2">oh but it&#39;s but for people who have not</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.100" end="00:25:48.690" style="s2">fallen flat on their face and had life</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.380" end="00:25:51.100" style="s2">you know kind of hand them you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.690" end="00:25:54.190" style="s2">skipping ideas there&#39;s a meme going</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.100" end="00:25:55.630" style="s2">around that says if you&#39;re part of if</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.190" end="00:25:57.310" style="s2">you&#39;re part of game being you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.630" end="00:26:00.160" style="s2">had an existential crisis then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.310" end="00:26:02.290" style="s2">then you&#39;re having a problem that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.160" end="00:26:04.270" style="s2">of like to get in this place you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.290" end="00:26:05.080" style="s2">have experienced that existence of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.270" end="00:26:08.440" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.080" end="00:26:10.070" style="s2">that&#39;s like alright well let&#39;s just try</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.440" end="00:26:14.470" style="s2"> see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.070" end="00:26:17.510" style="s2">and I think part of the solution is</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.470" end="00:26:20.810" style="s2">finding the people that aren&#39;t there yet</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.510" end="00:26:23.390" style="s2">and asking what they need right like</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.810" end="00:26:24.920" style="s2">what because I&#39;m the same mostly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.390" end="00:26:26.750" style="s2">areas I&#39;m not comfortable falling on my</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.920" end="00:26:27.950" style="s2">face and in other areas or I&#39;m like you</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.750" end="00:26:29.420" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what life is handed me</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.950" end="00:26:33.770" style="s2">you know got anything to hand me that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.420" end="00:26:35.270" style="s2">can&#39;t handle yes but to and the irony of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.770" end="00:26:36.830" style="s2">like the more you go through the less</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.270" end="00:26:38.690" style="s2">competent you look and the more</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.830" end="00:26:41.450" style="s2">competent you are like it&#39;s this like</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.690" end="00:26:44.270" style="s2">but you have to get there first and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.450" end="00:26:46.520" style="s2">what do people need to be able to show</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.270" end="00:26:49.040" style="s2">up and be in that sandbox when life</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.520" end="00:26:50.420" style="s2">hasn&#39;t when we are a very big shame</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.040" end="00:26:52.940" style="s2">culture and you have to know everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.420" end="00:26:54.770" style="s2">partly it&#39;s us showing up and showcasing</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.940" end="00:26:56.300" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna mess it up we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.770" end="00:26:58.490" style="s2">it wrong you&#39;re gonna get it right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.300" end="00:27:01.370" style="s2">gonna we&#39;re gonna showcase that there is</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.490" end="00:27:03.940" style="s2">no failure there&#39;s only feedback and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.370" end="00:27:08.060" style="s2">get to keep showing up you know like and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.940" end="00:27:12.650" style="s2">we keep showing up well and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.060" end="00:27:16.250" style="s2">you know part of that is like continue</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.650" end="00:27:20.600" style="s2">continuing to show up on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.250" end="00:27:23.680" style="s2">like a a group of people who are willing</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.600" end="00:27:26.270" style="s2">to go through this process publicly and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.680" end="00:27:28.100" style="s2">because now Jubilee you and I have met</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.270" end="00:27:30.050" style="s2">several times and I&#39;m sure that there</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.100" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">will come you know I am NOT somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.050" end="00:27:36.080" style="s2">is comfortable pushing back and so like</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.440" end="00:27:38.240" style="s2">but there but the more safe I feel with</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.080" end="00:27:40.220" style="s2">other people then it&#39;s I reach that pay</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.240" end="00:27:43.250" style="s2">that place of oh wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.220" end="00:27:45.260" style="s2">I disagree with you and you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.250" end="00:27:47.900" style="s2">maybe it&#39;ll you know and as you get more</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.260" end="00:27:49.610" style="s2">comfortable you get more it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.900" end="00:27:52.340" style="s2">feel a little bit more safe to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.610" end="00:27:54.110" style="s2">disagreements and to like right now it</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.340" end="00:27:55.370" style="s2">seems like there&#39;s still a lot of you</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.110" end="00:27:56.930" style="s2">know some people are cut more</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.370" end="00:27:59.630" style="s2">comfortable with with that disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.930" end="00:28:01.250" style="s2">but there still seems it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.630" end="00:28:05.390" style="s2">we&#39;re still in that we&#39;re still in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.250" end="00:28:07.130" style="s2">polite face and getting you know and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.390" end="00:28:08.720" style="s2">know so continuing to do it in a play in</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.130" end="00:28:11.570" style="s2">a way that is like okay let&#39;s get to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.720" end="00:28:15.230" style="s2">that place where we don&#39;t we where</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.570" end="00:28:17.300" style="s2">there&#39;s where conflict can come to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.230" end="00:28:19.670" style="s2">surface and we can see that conflict</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.300" end="00:28:23.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t a bad thing so I think so much of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.670" end="00:28:26.450" style="s2">game a like it&#39;s interesting there&#39;s war</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.960" end="00:28:31.370" style="s2">and then there&#39;s we avoid conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.450" end="00:28:36.290" style="s2">like how to have conflict and it not be</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.370" end="00:28:38.150" style="s2">then that&#39;s catastrophic yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.290" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">would you bring conflict together with</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.150" end="00:28:45.560" style="s2">like rule Omega and respect you know um</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.840" end="00:28:48.670" style="s2">that the conflict is not actual conflict</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.560" end="00:28:51.530" style="s2">it&#39;s it becomes as feedback process I</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.670" end="00:28:55.430" style="s2">think the word I&#39;m to say more than</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.530" end="00:28:57.290" style="s2">conflict was tension tension yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.430" end="00:28:59.050" style="s2">just gonna put humans comments up here</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.290" end="00:29:01.160" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s it&#39;s pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.050" end="00:29:02.930" style="s2">yahoos trauma has to be acknowledged and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.160" end="00:29:07.250" style="s2">accepted as a stuff Ian and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.930" end="00:29:08.690" style="s2">is we&#39;re going to have conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.250" end="00:29:11.330" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna show up sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.690" end="00:29:13.280" style="s2">traumatized and allowing for that to</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.330" end="00:29:16.040" style="s2">happen and then also allowing for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.280" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">repair and growth right like what do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.040" end="00:29:19.160" style="s2">do when you&#39;ve done something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:20.780" style="s2">right like when you get overheated and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.160" end="00:29:24.220" style="s2">yell at someone or like that&#39;s a stupid</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.780" end="00:29:27.260" style="s2">idea like oh that&#39;s there&#39;s some trauma</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.220" end="00:29:30.770" style="s2">right you know like how to make the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.260" end="00:29:36.350" style="s2">mistakes have the conflict and still</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.770" end="00:29:37.610" style="s2">grow still keep showing up on how to you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.350" end="00:29:41.050" style="s2">know one of the skills that I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.610" end="00:29:44.510" style="s2">trying to work on is like okay somebody</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.050" end="00:29:46.940" style="s2">it has a trauma trauma trigger and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.510" end="00:29:50.210" style="s2">come and and they have that response and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.940" end="00:29:52.160" style="s2">how do you then encourage someone to</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.210" end="00:29:54.140" style="s2">come back because they&#39;re you know so</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.160" end="00:29:56.870" style="s2">often we do have that shame culture and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.140" end="00:29:59.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know my tendency is okay I</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.870" end="00:30:03.350" style="s2">did something wrong I&#39;m out I&#39;m gone I</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.480" end="00:30:05.150" style="s2">can&#39;t I can&#39;t even face that and so you</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.350" end="00:30:08.870" style="s2">know and I know I&#39;m not the only one who</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.150" end="00:30:11.870" style="s2">has that it&#39;s like okay things didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.870" end="00:30:13.930" style="s2">right I&#39;m gonna leave that one and try</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.870" end="00:30:19.340" style="s2">again somewhere else and that&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.930" end="00:30:22.190" style="s2">and so how to like both make the space</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.340" end="00:30:25.190" style="s2">for myself to come back in and and like</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.190" end="00:30:28.220" style="s2">be in that incredibly vulnerable place</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.190" end="00:30:32.300" style="s2">of I screwed up and I want to and I want</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.220" end="00:30:35.240" style="s2">to you know make it right or like making</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.300" end="00:30:37.770" style="s2">the space for you know it&#39;s okay you</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.240" end="00:30:39.990" style="s2">know we we understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.770" end="00:30:43.560" style="s2">things happen because of you know that</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.990" end="00:30:46.260" style="s2">exact thing of trauma happens and we</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.560" end="00:30:49.860" style="s2">want that too you know and that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.260" end="00:30:51.090" style="s2">that&#39;s part of this process sounds a bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.860" end="00:30:52.530" style="s2">like that&#39;s just a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.090" end="00:30:54.120" style="s2">mistake like if we&#39;re talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.530" end="00:30:56.340" style="s2">know making a technical or a marketing</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.120" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">mistake there&#39;s also a woops I exploded</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.340" end="00:31:00.180" style="s2">whoops I don&#39;t know how to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:01.740" style="s2">this yeah another skill set yes you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.180" end="00:31:03.660" style="s2">in your your marketers your tech people</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.740" end="00:31:06.750" style="s2">and you also have your I don&#39;t know your</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.660" end="00:31:07.980" style="s2">peacekeeper your your organizer whatever</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.750" end="00:31:09.210" style="s2">you&#39;d want to call it in his face where</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.980" end="00:31:10.590" style="s2">it&#39;s somebody that says okay that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.210" end="00:31:11.910" style="s2">very constructive let&#39;s bring it back</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.590" end="00:31:12.330" style="s2">together and figure out where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.910" end="00:31:15.510" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.330" end="00:31:18.990" style="s2">yeah when when Kara was talking earlier</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.510" end="00:31:20.190" style="s2">about how you provide a space for other</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.990" end="00:31:22.500" style="s2">people that are going through trouble</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.190" end="00:31:25.320" style="s2">stuff I always thought like just to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.500" end="00:31:27.810" style="s2">bring up Star Trek once again the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.320" end="00:31:29.190" style="s2">ship counselor that they had and wanted</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.810" end="00:31:35.520" style="s2">to be interesting to have a project</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.190" end="00:31:37.950" style="s2">counselor who&#39;s who helps keep that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.520" end="00:31:40.920" style="s2">know just coach people and also just</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.950" end="00:31:45.420" style="s2">build that safe space so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.920" end="00:31:46.560" style="s2">concept doing any project whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.420" end="00:31:48.180" style="s2">you&#39;re starting your own business</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.560" end="00:31:50.340" style="s2">whether you&#39;re going to school it always</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.180" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">brings up all of your trauma and all of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.340" end="00:31:54.060" style="s2">your stuff and you don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:31:56.460" style="s2">that until you&#39;ve been there and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.060" end="00:31:58.410" style="s2">acknowledging that and having that space</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.460" end="00:31:59.580" style="s2">like and that&#39;s also a space where I</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.410" end="00:32:01.590" style="s2">feel like people don&#39;t know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.580" end="00:32:03.180" style="s2">amazing at it and it&#39;s not necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.590" end="00:32:05.190" style="s2">skill set they know they have it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.180" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">if you&#39;re a peacekeeper if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.190" end="00:32:08.550" style="s2">someone with high emotional and tell</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.550" end="00:32:12.660" style="s2">they know they&#39;re those people like they</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.470" end="00:32:14.850" style="s2">do but like not to the degree rum like</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.660" end="00:32:17.700" style="s2">come work on a tech project that is so</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.850" end="00:32:18.840" style="s2">important right like they don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.700" end="00:32:20.670" style="s2">they&#39;re like I&#39;m not a coder or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.840" end="00:32:22.590" style="s2">know how to illustrate I don&#39;t so like</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.670" end="00:32:24.710" style="s2">that&#39;s not the space I&#39;m working in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.590" end="00:32:29.610" style="s2">like hum be the counselor</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.710" end="00:32:34.590" style="s2">the people person well and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.610" end="00:32:36.720" style="s2">you know there&#39;s the the person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.590" end="00:32:39.720" style="s2">kind of like bringing it back to you</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.720" end="00:32:42.690" style="s2">okay yeah trauma is going to happen like</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.720" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">in-game a space there&#39;s no there there</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.690" end="00:32:48.150" style="s2">really isn&#39;t a space for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:50.590" style="s2">acknowledgment of trauma to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.150" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">when things blow up it</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.590" end="00:32:54.729" style="s2">you know you you just kind of like go</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:57.299" style="s2">into work and you know deal with your</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.729" end="00:33:00.669" style="s2">stuff when in reality there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.299" end="00:33:03.009" style="s2">the healing happens in relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.669" end="00:33:08.830" style="s2">like if things go wrong in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.009" end="00:33:11.049" style="s2">reconciliation you know that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.830" end="00:33:12.519" style="s2">beauty and the gold happens but you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.049" end="00:33:13.899" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have those skills and if</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.519" end="00:33:16.659" style="s2">you don&#39;t have somebody who&#39;s helping</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.899" end="00:33:19.749" style="s2">you move through that then it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.659" end="00:33:21.820" style="s2">just ends up blowing up and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.749" end="00:33:23.889" style="s2">image that&#39;s popping into my head right</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.820" end="00:33:27.429" style="s2">now is there there&#39;s a mean that goes</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.889" end="00:33:30.820" style="s2">around sometimes that in and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.429" end="00:33:33.429" style="s2">say it&#39;s Japan they repair broken bowls</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.820" end="00:33:35.289" style="s2">and dishes and stuff with gold so it has</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.429" end="00:33:37.419" style="s2">something breaks it becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.289" end="00:33:38.979" style="s2">valuable or with the human bone as the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.419" end="00:33:42.879" style="s2">human bone when the human bone breaks</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.979" end="00:33:44.529" style="s2">it&#39;s actually stronger afterwards and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.879" end="00:33:46.889" style="s2">it&#39;s the breaking that things actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.529" end="00:33:50.950" style="s2">become stronger but we don&#39;t have that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.889" end="00:33:53.799" style="s2">not something that I think is is brought</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.950" end="00:33:56.679" style="s2">to the surface largely in game a</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.799" end="00:33:59.409" style="s2">projects right</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.679" end="00:34:01.539" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s related to this concept I</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.409" end="00:34:04.139" style="s2">think I originally got from John rabe or</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.539" end="00:34:08.169" style="s2">somebody but it was basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.139" end="00:34:13.990" style="s2">operational improvement so you know just</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.169" end="00:34:17.799" style="s2">just a very act of of a product or I</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.990" end="00:34:20.829" style="s2">think of a child so a child grows and a</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.799" end="00:34:24.609" style="s2">child is stressed in certain ways</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.829" end="00:34:29.169" style="s2">physically they play they&#39;re challenged</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.609" end="00:34:32.770" style="s2">and as as they grow they become stronger</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.169" end="00:34:36.669" style="s2">they become you know more wise there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.770" end="00:34:39.429" style="s2">this there&#39;s this process of as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.669" end="00:34:42.389" style="s2">actually functioning you&#39;re becoming</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.429" end="00:34:45.339" style="s2">more resilient you&#39;re becoming stronger</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.389" end="00:34:48.099" style="s2">you know most human constructions at</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.339" end="00:34:50.470" style="s2">this point don&#39;t have that whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.099" end="00:34:53.349" style="s2">our technology or whether it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.470" end="00:34:56.670" style="s2">our our social structures I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.349" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">not really much capacity for improvement</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.670" end="00:35:03.370" style="s2">operational improvement I think those</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:05.500" style="s2">things are very tied together you</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.370" end="00:35:08.080" style="s2">in order to create a space where you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.500" end="00:35:10.660" style="s2">make mistakes transparency has to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.080" end="00:35:12.460" style="s2">encouraged but then you have to back it</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.660" end="00:35:15.310" style="s2">up right with like when people are</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.460" end="00:35:17.200" style="s2">transparent and when they show show up</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.310" end="00:35:19.150" style="s2">and make mistakes that you don&#39;t lump on</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.200" end="00:35:22.260" style="s2">shame and you don&#39;t don&#39;t create I liked</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.150" end="00:35:24.010" style="s2">um I&#39;ve got to find it I think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.260" end="00:35:26.070" style="s2">everything should become the surface</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.010" end="00:35:30.610" style="s2">appreciation to feel part of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.070" end="00:35:32.710" style="s2">that like we can&#39;t because we can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.610" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">our skills and strengths have unipaas up</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.710" end="00:35:38.740" style="s2">way to like reflect back to people what</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:42.730" style="s2">they did offer what they do offer in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.740" end="00:35:44.080" style="s2">space I was part of this school and one</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.730" end="00:35:45.490" style="s2">of the things I did which was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.080" end="00:35:47.740" style="s2">from a little places I made this thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.490" end="00:35:49.750" style="s2">called I remember it was called but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.740" end="00:35:51.130" style="s2">made like it had those sweets all over</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.750" end="00:35:52.570" style="s2">and I put everyone&#39;s name on it the idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.130" end="00:35:55.210" style="s2">was we put like a sweet little note in</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.570" end="00:35:56.890" style="s2">it for people if they to encourage that</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.210" end="00:35:58.750" style="s2">right to say hey there&#39;s something you</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.890" end="00:36:01.390" style="s2">can sit sometimes vulnerable to give</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.750" end="00:36:03.160" style="s2">that feedback as well and so to be able</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.390" end="00:36:04.570" style="s2">to say hey I thought you should have</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.160" end="00:36:06.100" style="s2">really well I really liked that idea I</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.570" end="00:36:08.590" style="s2">mean I think you&#39;d do it in person a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.100" end="00:36:10.270" style="s2">like meaning oh I really love that idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.590" end="00:36:11.980" style="s2">Kiera right like that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.270" end="00:36:13.870" style="s2">and then like also if something comes to</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.980" end="00:36:16.390" style="s2">mind after to be like well I really</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.870" end="00:36:19.300" style="s2">appreciate when you show up and show</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.390" end="00:36:22.060" style="s2">your vulnerability and make mistakes and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.300" end="00:36:25.930" style="s2">give us all permission to do that right</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.060" end="00:36:28.690" style="s2">that is huge and it does help a lot too</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.930" end="00:36:36.550" style="s2">to know what other people see you as</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.690" end="00:36:40.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the positive one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.550" end="00:36:43.020" style="s2">that like I don&#39;t know that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.720" end="00:36:45.400" style="s2">things I keep I try to try and do</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.020" end="00:36:47.620" style="s2">sometimes in conversation is like okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.400" end="00:36:50.830" style="s2">this feels really vulnerable because</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.620" end="00:36:53.290" style="s2">when I do that it gives people the space</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.830" end="00:36:54.760" style="s2">you know it lets people know I&#39;m coming</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.290" end="00:36:58.360" style="s2">at this and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.760" end="00:37:03.660" style="s2">I don&#39;t but I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.360" end="00:37:06.010" style="s2">here and there&#39;s because there is this</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.660" end="00:37:07.960" style="s2">you know bring back to what Edward said</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.010" end="00:37:11.500" style="s2">there&#39;s this there&#39;s this assumption</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.960" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2">because we have adult meat suits on that</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.500" end="00:37:16.090" style="s2">we&#39;re adults and I just don&#39;t like you</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:17.080" style="s2">know we all have the wounded little</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.090" end="00:37:19.360" style="s2">parts in us</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.080" end="00:37:21.820" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s one of my teachers</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.360" end="00:37:23.410" style="s2">he&#39;s like you know going to work is you</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.820" end="00:37:24.880" style="s2">know going to school with a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.410" end="00:37:27.550" style="s2">kindergarteners who were dressed up and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.880" end="00:37:31.180" style="s2">you know suits and dressed up in suits</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.550" end="00:37:36.100" style="s2">and looking like adults and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.180" end="00:37:38.200" style="s2">it&#39;s this you know willingness to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.100" end="00:37:40.120" style="s2">say that things are vulnerable I just</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.200" end="00:37:41.290" style="s2">want to pause for a second Jonas all</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.120" end="00:37:43.470" style="s2">right we haven&#39;t heard anything from you</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.290" end="00:37:48.040" style="s2">I was just curious if you had anything</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.470" end="00:37:51.130" style="s2">to add yeah I was wondering whether I</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.040" end="00:37:57.420" style="s2">should take myself as a case study here</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.130" end="00:38:02.470" style="s2">for for this kind of conversation and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.420" end="00:38:05.530" style="s2">from my perspective I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.470" end="00:38:08.020" style="s2">how can I actually move this</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.530" end="00:38:11.560" style="s2">conversation forward because I I have</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.020" end="00:38:17.290" style="s2">not not much input to all this</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.560" end="00:38:22.750" style="s2">vulnerability space but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.290" end="00:38:25.960" style="s2">I do clearly feel a little bit like if I</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.750" end="00:38:27.520" style="s2">now try to interject something and put</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.960" end="00:38:31.420" style="s2">me forward but people want to linger on</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.520" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">this one then it is kind of making me in</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.420" end="00:38:44.800" style="s2">the way will Naropa that is where just</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:46.900" style="s2">my thoughts I say just go ahead with</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.800" end="00:38:49.360" style="s2">anything because it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.900" end="00:38:54.390" style="s2">metabolize into this greater hole that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.360" end="00:38:56.740" style="s2">we&#39;re doing today so I yeah go for it</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.390" end="00:38:58.030" style="s2">and if we give you any flack just be</p>

<p begin="00:39:52.560" end="00:39:57.300" style="s2">kind of I don&#39;t feel easily hurt or</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.310" end="00:40:00.690" style="s2">anything</p>

<p begin="00:40:15.240" end="00:40:23.130" style="s2">particular to contribute to this area of</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.100" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">it having said all all of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.130" end="00:40:34.740" style="s2">I do feel personally for me I I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:37.110" style="s2">want to move on to UM two different</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.740" end="00:40:41.550" style="s2">things although it&#39;s not totally clear</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.110" end="00:40:45.350" style="s2">what that one would be um I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.550" end="00:40:49.230" style="s2">any other burning questions in my head I</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.350" end="00:40:51.060" style="s2">I would just add that the the safe space</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.230" end="00:40:55.590" style="s2">stuff we&#39;re talking about just one</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.060" end="00:40:57.660" style="s2">aspect of zoom out again and maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.590" end="00:41:00.510" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.660" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">to think about here the the platform</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.510" end="00:41:07.110" style="s2">aspects I mean yeah one thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:08.940" style="s2">sort of occurring to me as we were</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.110" end="00:41:10.980" style="s2">talking about this is if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.940" end="00:41:12.510" style="s2">about you know how do we structure the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.980" end="00:41:14.280" style="s2">conversation around a project overall</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.510" end="00:41:15.990" style="s2">part of that is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.280" end="00:41:17.340" style="s2">vulnerability to being able to to to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.990" end="00:41:19.980" style="s2">make mistakes and figuring out your</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.340" end="00:41:23.460" style="s2">skill set one of the things that came</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.980" end="00:41:25.110" style="s2">out of the first project raising session</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.460" end="00:41:27.270" style="s2">I did was I started doing my own</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.110" end="00:41:28.350" style="s2">livestream and so now I mean it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.270" end="00:41:30.510" style="s2">been all that exciting there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.350" end="00:41:32.130" style="s2">viewers and it&#39;s been just me but one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.510" end="00:41:34.470" style="s2">the reasons why I was you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.130" end="00:41:36.450" style="s2">thinking about how to talk to the game</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.470" end="00:41:38.310" style="s2">be space about what everyone&#39;s skill</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.450" end="00:41:39.960" style="s2">sets are or to find people that might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.310" end="00:41:42.450" style="s2">interested in sort of doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.960" end="00:41:45.540" style="s2">that split off on my project having a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.450" end="00:41:48.000" style="s2">separate one and kind of forming one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.540" end="00:41:50.400" style="s2">these groups - for a specific purpose</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.000" end="00:41:53.040" style="s2">not it&#39;s sort of the the meta purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.400" end="00:41:56.369" style="s2">a project about projects but actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.040" end="00:41:58.950" style="s2">say hey there&#39;s a specific project where</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.369" end="00:42:02.130" style="s2">the goal is to meet weekly who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.950" end="00:42:04.380" style="s2">to join in on that where the idea is you</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.130" end="00:42:06.420" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be an expert if you you</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.380" end="00:42:07.710" style="s2">know like marketing and you do some</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.420" end="00:42:09.690" style="s2">reading on it and you&#39;re sort of in that</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.710" end="00:42:11.520" style="s2">space it would be interesting to hear</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.690" end="00:42:14.580" style="s2">and then actually give people those</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.520" end="00:42:16.650" style="s2">spots to work on those skills and then a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.580" end="00:42:20.040" style="s2">session like this to sort of keep moving</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.650" end="00:42:24.770" style="s2">the plan or that framework forward does</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.040" end="00:42:24.770" style="s2">that make sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.359" end="00:42:40.349" style="s2">could we post a link to that at the end</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.070" end="00:42:43.050" style="s2">here - it&#39;s our - your live stream yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.349" end="00:42:45.330" style="s2">I guess I&#39;ll be posting it in the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.050" end="00:42:47.940" style="s2">game be space worker</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.330" end="00:42:55.650" style="s2">I should have have done that earlier but</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.940" end="00:42:59.160" style="s2">I didn&#39;t okay I&#39;m sorry so the the core</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.650" end="00:43:01.680" style="s2">notion there was like does that make</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.160" end="00:43:03.690" style="s2">sense as one of the thing because I</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.680" end="00:43:05.730" style="s2">think the session last week also sounded</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.690" end="00:43:07.740" style="s2">like he might have wanted to start doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.730" end="00:43:09.589" style="s2">his own live stream as well it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.740" end="00:43:12.060" style="s2">like that&#39;s gonna be a pretty common</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.589" end="00:43:13.980" style="s2">outcome of these types of projects</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.060" end="00:43:15.420" style="s2">raising sessions is once you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.980" end="00:43:17.640" style="s2">this and you&#39;ve had that sort of meet up</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.420" end="00:43:19.589" style="s2">with a group of people to want to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.640" end="00:43:22.500" style="s2">that regularly just for a specific</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.589" end="00:43:24.450" style="s2">purpose on one particular project as</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.500" end="00:43:26.910" style="s2">opposed to this session where it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.450" end="00:43:30.300" style="s2">about kind of trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.910" end="00:43:33.900" style="s2">is it like what system what framework</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.300" end="00:43:36.740" style="s2">what processes are in place to move any</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.900" end="00:43:43.290" style="s2">project forward whereas project agnostic</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.740" end="00:43:45.170" style="s2">right so you know we have the big big</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.290" end="00:43:47.280" style="s2">space here and then we had I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.170" end="00:43:48.869" style="s2">individual projects I guess could be</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:51.270" style="s2">looked at as kind of like break out</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.869" end="00:43:52.980" style="s2">rooms and then with the nose projects</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.270" end="00:43:56.609" style="s2">would be other breakout rooms</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.980" end="00:43:59.910" style="s2">right and and it&#39;d be great to somehow</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.609" end="00:44:03.690" style="s2">be able to link these and keep them like</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.910" end="00:44:05.520" style="s2">that exactly and even like Oh possibly</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.690" end="00:44:06.990" style="s2">even create like a sign-up list if we</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.520" end="00:44:08.940" style="s2">get to the point or say hey here&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.990" end="00:44:11.160" style="s2">the projects that we talked about and</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.940" end="00:44:14.010" style="s2">sort of started that did that discussion</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.160" end="00:44:15.510" style="s2">here&#39;s the roles that they need here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.010" end="00:44:17.250" style="s2">you know who&#39;s pulling each role and</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.510" end="00:44:20.100" style="s2">here&#39;s the gaps here&#39;s what these</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.250" end="00:44:23.880" style="s2">projects still need right right</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.100" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">yes and then you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.880" end="00:44:26.970" style="s2">interested in dabbling in marketing</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:29.400" style="s2">great they&#39;ll look at the sheet here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.970" end="00:44:30.780" style="s2">our here&#39;s our sessions that where you</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.400" end="00:44:32.640" style="s2">can meet with somebody who&#39;s a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.780" end="00:44:33.930" style="s2">skilled in marketing to figure out if</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.640" end="00:44:36.300" style="s2">that&#39;s something you&#39;re interested or</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.930" end="00:44:37.410" style="s2">skilled at and then if that ends up</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.300" end="00:44:39.000" style="s2">being something you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.410" end="00:44:44.220" style="s2">skill that you can start to look for</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.000" end="00:44:47.460" style="s2">actual projects to join those sessions</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.220" end="00:44:52.050" style="s2">or do the sort of project project here</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.460" end="00:44:55.830" style="s2">right I feel like any of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.050" end="00:44:58.650" style="s2">we are talking about are a little bit in</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.830" end="00:45:04.140" style="s2">the space where everything is already</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.650" end="00:45:05.910" style="s2">bigger I&#39;m wondering how to get there</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.140" end="00:45:09.330" style="s2">like in the very early space like for</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.910" end="00:45:13.310" style="s2">example you mentioned that you created a</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.330" end="00:45:16.350" style="s2">live stream and no one was there and</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.310" end="00:45:20.010" style="s2">Bentley and Jubilee were doing it for</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.350" end="00:45:24.570" style="s2">for awhile with only two people how do</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.010" end="00:45:27.660" style="s2">we deal with those situations where you</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.570" end="00:45:29.940" style="s2">know no one is showing up or only very</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.660" end="00:45:32.280" style="s2">few people are showing up and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.940" end="00:45:36.990" style="s2">in this situation we don&#39;t have this the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.280" end="00:45:38.940" style="s2">luxury of having a peacekeeper or all</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.990" end="00:45:41.420" style="s2">kind of different people in different</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.940" end="00:45:41.420" style="s2">roles</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.109" end="00:45:54.489" style="s2">Oh okay I&#39;ll start I think that is one</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.869" end="00:45:56.859" style="s2">of the things we&#39;re hoping that this</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.489" end="00:45:59.049" style="s2">this video session will do is get people</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.859" end="00:46:01.269" style="s2">to come that&#39;s one person work on our</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.049" end="00:46:02.709" style="s2">project and see if there&#39;s anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.269" end="00:46:04.509" style="s2">like-minded or at least give them some</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.709" end="00:46:07.690" style="s2">promotions I think we&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.509" end="00:46:12.569" style="s2">solution to that but we could probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.690" end="00:46:16.420" style="s2">brainstorm on other other facilitators</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.569" end="00:46:18.219" style="s2">like finding how we get people to</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.420" end="00:46:19.660" style="s2">projects supposed to work on it but also</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.219" end="00:46:20.950" style="s2">even just for the livestream how do you</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.660" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">get people who actually watch in</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.950" end="00:46:25.660" style="s2">comments you can contribute and someone</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:27.309" style="s2">it&#39;s the meta piece right or it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.660" end="00:46:29.410" style="s2">someone it is the meta piece it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.309" end="00:46:31.209" style="s2">finding a way they create that tool so</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.410" end="00:46:33.069" style="s2">we all can have people to come in right</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.209" end="00:46:35.769" style="s2">if there&#39;s a platform you can bring an</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.069" end="00:46:37.180" style="s2">idea to and it&#39;s the marketing piece is</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.769" end="00:46:39.279" style="s2">super easy cuz it goes out to the people</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.180" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">you know we&#39;re gonna be interested based</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.279" end="00:46:42.910" style="s2">on your timeline and you just it brings</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.200" end="00:46:45.279" style="s2">them right you have five other people to</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.910" end="00:46:47.319" style="s2">talk with on screen about the problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.279" end="00:46:49.420" style="s2">you&#39;re having how to move your project</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.319" end="00:46:51.549" style="s2">forward or an audience for yours live</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.420" end="00:46:53.650" style="s2">streaming and having people come and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.549" end="00:46:54.969" style="s2">participate in that without needing to</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.650" end="00:46:56.709" style="s2">go through Facebook and YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.969" end="00:46:59.289" style="s2">hoping people stumble upon you or</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.709" end="00:47:01.900" style="s2">needing to pay marketing and to do to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.289" end="00:47:02.920" style="s2">all of the ways that we&#39;ve kind of both</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.900" end="00:47:05.170" style="s2">part if you don&#39;t know how to have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.920" end="00:47:07.630" style="s2">Facebook group and you know running</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.170" end="00:47:09.430" style="s2">YouTube channel and to be clear my</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.630" end="00:47:11.109" style="s2">initial concern wasn&#39;t so much that my</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.430" end="00:47:12.459" style="s2">last room didn&#39;t have any viewers more</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.109" end="00:47:14.529" style="s2">so that it didn&#39;t have any other it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.459" end="00:47:15.549" style="s2">like people like me like people like</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.529" end="00:47:17.469" style="s2">sort of hosting and having a</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.549" end="00:47:18.969" style="s2">conversation is the first one it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.469" end="00:47:22.839" style="s2">just me basically going through a</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.969" end="00:47:24.009" style="s2">PowerPoint and that&#39;s super boring at</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.839" end="00:47:25.690" style="s2">this point I&#39;m more concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.009" end="00:47:28.180" style="s2">building up my content and starting to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.690" end="00:47:29.769" style="s2">you know actually hash out ideas I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.180" end="00:47:31.329" style="s2">if you have an audience and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.769" end="00:47:33.039" style="s2">really compelling sort of story and some</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.329" end="00:47:35.949" style="s2">content I think that&#39;s what helps build</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.039" end="00:47:39.729" style="s2">actually having people watch so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.949" end="00:47:40.959" style="s2">more and I think that&#39;s very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.729" end="00:47:42.160" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about here is how do</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.959" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">we actually build up that group of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.160" end="00:47:45.819" style="s2">people for these projects how do we</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.839" end="00:47:48.099" style="s2">identify what skill sets are needed how</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.819" end="00:47:49.479" style="s2">do we actually sort of pair people and</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.099" end="00:47:53.289" style="s2">their skills with projects that need</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.479" end="00:47:55.539" style="s2">those skills and so on I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.289" end="00:47:56.890" style="s2">go ahead Kara it&#39;s funny as we were</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.539" end="00:47:59.229" style="s2">talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.890" end="00:48:00.849" style="s2">sometimes my unconscious my unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.229" end="00:48:05.229" style="s2">had the tendency to talk to me in movies</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.849" end="00:48:07.089" style="s2">I don&#39;t know why and last yesterday last</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.229" end="00:48:08.680" style="s2">night in the last couple days the movie</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.089" end="00:48:10.630" style="s2">Field of Dreams has been coming into my</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.680" end="00:48:11.019" style="s2">head and the line if you build it they</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.630" end="00:48:13.900" style="s2">will come</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.019" end="00:48:16.569" style="s2">it has you know and it&#39;s like okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.900" end="00:48:18.969" style="s2">let&#39;s you know start putting this</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.569" end="00:48:22.239" style="s2">structure together and trust that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.969" end="00:48:25.029" style="s2">know things won&#39;t you know that what we</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.239" end="00:48:29.529" style="s2">need will come well yeah I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.029" end="00:48:30.819" style="s2">share that that my mind a lot not exact</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.529" end="00:48:32.079" style="s2">when you build that they will come and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.819" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">I&#39;m like I want them to come so we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.079" end="00:48:38.619" style="s2">build it it&#39;s like Franklin well and a</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:41.410" style="s2">big part of that movie was the faith</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.619" end="00:48:44.380" style="s2">like you know and having everyone you</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.410" end="00:48:48.670" style="s2">know everyone who knew him going what</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.380" end="00:48:50.319" style="s2">are you doing like you&#39;re crazy and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.670" end="00:48:53.170" style="s2">know there there&#39;s a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.319" end="00:48:54.509" style="s2">faith and like okay let&#39;s just you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.170" end="00:48:57.489" style="s2">if you build it they will come</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.509" end="00:48:59.469" style="s2">you know that stuff I was just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.489" end="00:49:00.880" style="s2">about that and often that is in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.469" end="00:49:03.190" style="s2">startup circles that&#39;s thrown out as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.880" end="00:49:06.160" style="s2">fallacy but I was just thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.190" end="00:49:10.630" style="s2">the movie itself he built it and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.160" end="00:49:12.039" style="s2">the players kind of show up slowly they</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.630" end="00:49:14.499" style="s2">didn&#39;t they didn&#39;t like all up here at</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.039" end="00:49:16.719" style="s2">once so it was it was not just in faith</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.499" end="00:49:19.989" style="s2">in building it but faith and and staying</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.719" end="00:49:25.479" style="s2">with it and and honestly that that won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.989" end="00:49:27.160" style="s2">always work but it&#39;s I it&#39;s not a I</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.479" end="00:49:29.829" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s a fallacy like they say</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.160" end="00:49:31.719" style="s2">in the in some communities I think that</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.829" end="00:49:33.940" style="s2">yeah I think that that&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.719" end="00:49:35.829" style="s2">keep in mind that at least to step out</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.940" end="00:49:37.449" style="s2">and give it a try and what will probably</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.829" end="00:49:39.670" style="s2">happen is what I think&#39;s happened to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.449" end="00:49:41.319" style="s2">and Jubilee and Polly Adria also is you</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.670" end="00:49:44.319" style="s2">know you step out with a project it</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.319" end="00:49:45.819" style="s2">fails but you learn and the next one is</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:48.940" style="s2">a little better and a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.819" end="00:49:50.289" style="s2">folk or you know it fulfills the need</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.940" end="00:49:52.390" style="s2">that the people were interested in and</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.289" end="00:49:55.749" style="s2">stuff like that so yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.390" end="00:49:59.170" style="s2">faith is a very important piece that may</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.749" end="00:50:01.059" style="s2">get lost in game a I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.170" end="00:50:03.219" style="s2">fallacy to your point Bentley the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.059" end="00:50:06.099" style="s2">fallacy is that you know or maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.219" end="00:50:07.569" style="s2">misnomer is they you&#39;re gonna build that</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.099" end="00:50:09.200" style="s2">what do you build the first time is</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.569" end="00:50:11.720" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.200" end="00:50:13.099" style="s2">right that&#39;s good plaque yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.720" end="00:50:14.420" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna build something and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.099" end="00:50:17.030" style="s2">gonna get some feedback and you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.420" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">get you know and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.030" end="00:50:23.119" style="s2">eventually eventually because you</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:26.740" style="s2">iterate on it each time yeah or if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.119" end="00:50:26.740" style="s2">just build it and never tell anybody</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.619" end="00:50:37.670" style="s2">yeah but yeah you know you&#39;re right that</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.569" end="00:50:39.950" style="s2">that is the problem people tend to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.670" end="00:50:42.319" style="s2">the grand vision which I think both</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.950" end="00:50:44.839" style="s2">Jubilee and I did recently and you you</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.319" end="00:50:49.240" style="s2">go and you build out everything before</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.839" end="00:50:49.240" style="s2">you get that initial feedback right I</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.660" end="00:50:56.109" style="s2">think it&#39;s important to that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.099" end="00:50:58.940" style="s2">somehow you know when we fail you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.109" end="00:51:03.109" style="s2">we can learn that lesson but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.940" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">in our heads but somehow to to be able</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.109" end="00:51:07.309" style="s2">to take all that information and all</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:11.000" style="s2">those lessons for failure and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.309" end="00:51:13.549" style="s2">you know put it out there for other</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.000" end="00:51:15.500" style="s2">people to learn from too so that if a</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.549" end="00:51:18.250" style="s2">project fails it&#39;s not just you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.500" end="00:51:21.440" style="s2">well the people involved in the project</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.250" end="00:51:23.450" style="s2">know how it failed but to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">share that information and to have it</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.450" end="00:51:30.109" style="s2">available to everybody yeah one one</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:31.760" style="s2">thing I participated with in the Dallas</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.109" end="00:51:34.520" style="s2">startup community several years ago is</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.760" end="00:51:37.490" style="s2">we had a reoccurring meeting called fail</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.520" end="00:51:39.619" style="s2">learn grow so it would be here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.490" end="00:51:41.480" style="s2">startup that we tried and and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.619" end="00:51:44.000" style="s2">what went wrong and why it failed it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.480" end="00:51:45.970" style="s2">really neat to see people opening up</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.000" end="00:51:48.109" style="s2">about that and so maybe that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.970" end="00:51:50.720" style="s2">something we could do and one of these</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.109" end="00:51:52.220" style="s2">is talk about past projects so we did I</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.720" end="00:51:54.890" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that would fit in this</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.220" end="00:51:58.220" style="s2">space exactly it or not but actually I</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.890" end="00:51:59.720" style="s2">love that have one yeah what what have</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.220" end="00:52:00.799" style="s2">you failed that like what failed and</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.720" end="00:52:03.079" style="s2">where did you learn and you can bring</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.799" end="00:52:04.460" style="s2">anything to it right a relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.079" end="00:52:06.049" style="s2">you don&#39;t happen to have a project but</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.460" end="00:52:08.150" style="s2">like the that is what we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.049" end="00:52:10.490" style="s2">do it&#39;s the other tech is do the process</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.150" end="00:52:12.140" style="s2">out in the open transparently so that if</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.490" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">and when we fail with every individual</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.140" end="00:52:16.400" style="s2">step other people can learn and offer</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:21.530" style="s2">and then we grow like all of it happens</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.400" end="00:52:23.069" style="s2">on camera actually reminds me of weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.530" end="00:52:24.719" style="s2">enough an ad I saw yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.069" end="00:52:26.249" style="s2">today where it was Friday it was a</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.719" end="00:52:28.529" style="s2">master class thing on</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.249" end="00:52:30.839" style="s2">I forget what topic but it was a he</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.529" end="00:52:32.759" style="s2">mention failing and he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.839" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">Steven Tyler with Aerosmith and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.759" end="00:52:36.779" style="s2">they have a weekly session with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:39.839" style="s2">ideas everybody comes with a stupid idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.779" end="00:52:41.759" style="s2">and they pitch their stupid idea and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.839" end="00:52:44.249" style="s2">nine out of ten times it&#39;s a stupid idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.759" end="00:52:45.869" style="s2">everyone agrees that they move on but</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.249" end="00:52:48.690" style="s2">one in ten times it&#39;s not actually a</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.869" end="00:52:52.650" style="s2">stupid idea but the idea is you start</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.690" end="00:52:54.029" style="s2">from try to fail and then you discuss it</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.650" end="00:53:01.069" style="s2">and work through it and sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.029" end="00:53:01.069" style="s2">fail it really I like that yeah Wow I</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.849" end="00:53:06.989" style="s2">think there&#39;s also maybe a way to</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.930" end="00:53:08.369" style="s2">present this or like something to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.989" end="00:53:11.249" style="s2">game be community that&#39;s not live on</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.369" end="00:53:12.719" style="s2">YouTube where it&#39;s it&#39;s like on a zoo</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.249" end="00:53:15.739" style="s2">meeting where you&#39;re put off into groups</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.719" end="00:53:19.859" style="s2">to discuss the failure right or to</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.739" end="00:53:21.390" style="s2">brainstorm what skill set you need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.859" end="00:53:24.359" style="s2">move your project forward right like</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.390" end="00:53:25.529" style="s2">what is the failure right now what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.359" end="00:53:26.759" style="s2">thing stopping you from getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.529" end="00:53:29.549" style="s2">next level without necessarily having</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.759" end="00:53:31.140" style="s2">people rainstorm your project like</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.549" end="00:53:33.660" style="s2">brainstorming the brainstorming behind</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.140" end="00:53:34.769" style="s2">it right like talking about that more I</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.660" end="00:53:37.469" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that&#39;s something they can</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.769" end="00:53:38.609" style="s2">be space a lot to talk about if they</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.469" end="00:53:40.289" style="s2">would I&#39;m pretty sure if it was</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.609" end="00:53:43.469" style="s2">presented in the right way but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.289" end="00:53:44.789" style="s2">figuring out how do the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.469" end="00:53:47.849" style="s2">things that&#39;s popping into my head right</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.789" end="00:53:51.329" style="s2">now is the framing of we&#39;re talking a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.849" end="00:53:53.400" style="s2">lot about failure but the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.329" end="00:53:56.099" style="s2">that is what&#39;s the wisdom we&#39;ve earned</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.400" end="00:53:57.569" style="s2">and there&#39;s with you know that what what</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.099" end="00:54:00.180" style="s2">is the what is the collective wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.569" end="00:54:01.769" style="s2">that&#39;s been been earned because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.180" end="00:54:03.719" style="s2">that&#39;s not something you gain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.769" end="00:54:06.359" style="s2">something that you earn through through</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.719" end="00:54:11.160" style="s2">failure absolutely and through through</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.359" end="00:54:14.729" style="s2">trying things and and so it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.160" end="00:54:16.999" style="s2">trying to figure out how do we coal s</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.729" end="00:54:21.839" style="s2">our wisdom into something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.999" end="00:54:23.999" style="s2">something that people can digest because</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.839" end="00:54:28.140" style="s2">okay maybe somebody can&#39;t come in and</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.999" end="00:54:31.829" style="s2">watch 150 hours worth of these these</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.140" end="00:54:33.599" style="s2">talks which you know you know not</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.829" end="00:54:35.400" style="s2">everybody has the time to invest in</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:37.319" style="s2">watching John robic ease you know 50</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.400" end="00:54:41.400" style="s2">hours worth of</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.319" end="00:54:52.650" style="s2">material and how do we you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.400" end="00:54:56.039" style="s2">we consolidate the wisdom it&#39;s and one</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.650" end="00:54:58.079" style="s2">other point there&#39;s I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.039" end="00:55:00.809" style="s2">anybody else has watched Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.079" end="00:55:02.970" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s psychology of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.809" end="00:55:05.730" style="s2">series the psychological significance of</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.970" end="00:55:09.509" style="s2">the Bible series but he talks about you</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.730" end="00:55:12.029" style="s2">know the whether it&#39;s accurate or not</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.509" end="00:55:15.299" style="s2">there is wisdom in very very short</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.029" end="00:55:17.249" style="s2">stories that can be unpacked in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.299" end="00:55:21.509" style="s2">Bible not necessarily sure all of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.249" end="00:55:24.150" style="s2">wisdom is helpful but how do we how do</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.509" end="00:55:28.579" style="s2">we create the story create the stories</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.150" end="00:55:33.319" style="s2">that passed out you know that that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.579" end="00:55:36.029" style="s2">trans transmit the wisdom in as</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.319" end="00:55:41.779" style="s2">consolidated a form as possible and one</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.029" end="00:55:41.779" style="s2">of those ways is your story and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.059" end="00:55:49.049" style="s2">sounds a bit like one of the projects is</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:51.989" style="s2">this is the building of project or</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.049" end="00:55:53.489" style="s2">projects and sort of like my plan for</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.989" end="00:55:55.710" style="s2">the livestreams wasn&#39;t to always have</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.489" end="00:55:57.180" style="s2">viewers it was more to create a trail of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.710" end="00:55:58.920" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna keep doing the same topics</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.180" end="00:56:01.109" style="s2">like maybe every month or every two</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.920" end="00:56:02.910" style="s2">months and then sort of keep updating</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.109" end="00:56:04.200" style="s2">and keep going over the same things so</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.910" end="00:56:07.079" style="s2">if you really wanted to you could watch</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.200" end="00:56:09.839" style="s2">every session on the topic of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.079" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">and see sort of the how things evolved</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.839" end="00:56:14.609" style="s2">but there&#39;s going to be sort of here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:16.049" style="s2">where things are at now if you just want</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.609" end="00:56:17.309" style="s2">to get the condensed where things are</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.049" end="00:56:20.940" style="s2">right now you you look at our current</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.309" end="00:56:23.489" style="s2">slide deck presentation summary whatever</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.940" end="00:56:25.410" style="s2">it is if you really want to geek out you</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.489" end="00:56:33.150" style="s2">can go and watch every recorded live</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.410" end="00:56:34.440" style="s2">stream and see how things evolved if</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.150" end="00:56:37.400" style="s2">that makes sense in context of what you</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.440" end="00:56:39.630" style="s2">were just say you know what guys it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.400" end="00:56:42.059" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting as you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.630" end="00:56:45.900" style="s2">that like there&#39;s also just sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.059" end="00:56:47.849" style="s2">maybe again I bring in the word faith</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.900" end="00:56:49.140" style="s2">like eventually there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.849" end="00:56:50.900" style="s2">artificial intelligence that&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.140" end="00:56:55.309" style="s2">able to go in and analyze all</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.900" end="00:56:57.419" style="s2">consolidated for us but you know that</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.309" end="00:56:59.640" style="s2">right so maybe we are building the</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.419" end="00:57:03.559" style="s2">framework that&#39;s used to sort of train</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.640" end="00:57:09.419" style="s2">and format the output of that AI right</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.559" end="00:57:12.779" style="s2">yeah just have to be careful okay yep</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.419" end="00:57:14.640" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s funny putting some trust in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.779" end="00:57:18.359" style="s2">on I like I&#39;ve never written a program</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.640" end="00:57:21.660" style="s2">that did what I want the first time do</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.359" end="00:57:23.069" style="s2">they I but anyway I&#39;ve also never</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.660" end="00:57:24.599" style="s2">written a program that didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.069" end="00:57:28.609" style="s2">somebody come in and use it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.599" end="00:57:31.919" style="s2">that I did not intend at all yes right</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.609" end="00:57:34.650" style="s2">but yeah but yeah I am hopeful at some</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.919" end="00:57:36.679" style="s2">point in having AI assistance that help</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.650" end="00:57:38.910" style="s2">us consolidate this information a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.679" end="00:57:42.719" style="s2">general had some something earlier about</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.910" end="00:57:44.819" style="s2">presents you in the game be space to</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.719" end="00:57:47.809" style="s2">find groups of people to kind of meet</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.819" end="00:57:50.489" style="s2">with weekly and I think that might be</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.809" end="00:57:53.249" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering whether people are more</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.489" end="00:57:54.569" style="s2">drawn to meeting with like you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.249" end="00:57:55.979" style="s2">same group of people so you&#39;re meeting</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.569" end="00:57:56.969" style="s2">with the same three people a week in and</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.979" end="00:57:59.369" style="s2">week out so you really get to know each</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.969" end="00:58:01.289" style="s2">other&#39;s projects or let&#39;s say there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.369" end="00:58:04.169" style="s2">slightly bigger group of 1215 and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.289" end="00:58:06.929" style="s2">randomly paired each week so that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.169" end="00:58:09.359" style="s2">can get to know other people right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.929" end="00:58:11.699" style="s2">have their their feedback and and get it</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.359" end="00:58:14.999" style="s2">a bigger one to emerge and hold that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.699" end="00:58:16.919" style="s2">unzoom for people to UM who don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.999" end="00:58:18.239" style="s2">comfortable being here but also still</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.919" end="00:58:19.979" style="s2">have a project they want to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.239" end="00:58:23.339" style="s2">right and then from there having this</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.979" end="00:58:25.140" style="s2">same conversation with 30 people in five</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.339" end="00:58:27.689" style="s2">different tables to see what is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.140" end="00:58:30.779" style="s2">generated from from that what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.689" end="00:58:34.739" style="s2">meta solutions we want to focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.779" end="00:58:36.749" style="s2">are easy that are like is that adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.739" end="00:58:38.339" style="s2">ly possible that are like I was just</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.749" end="00:58:39.569" style="s2">writing down what a solution is like</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.339" end="00:58:42.089" style="s2">there&#39;s these big overarching</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.569" end="00:58:44.009" style="s2">world-changing solutions but is it</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.089" end="00:58:46.049" style="s2">doable now and is it with an invitation</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.009" end="00:58:48.299" style="s2">and is it you know like everyone goes</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.049" end="00:58:50.789" style="s2">vegan good luck with that like what is</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.299" end="00:58:52.799" style="s2">the invitation what would help people do</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.789" end="00:58:57.109" style="s2">that right like what is the solution</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.799" end="00:59:00.869" style="s2">it&#39;s doable now and yet I move forward</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.109" end="00:59:02.759" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s possible to like</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.869" end="00:59:04.170" style="s2">you know it&#39;s really important to have</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.759" end="00:59:05.790" style="s2">core groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.170" end="00:59:07.380" style="s2">you get to know real well and of course</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.790" end="00:59:09.630" style="s2">if you&#39;re working on a project you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.380" end="00:59:12.869" style="s2">gonna have that core group of people but</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.630" end="00:59:15.450" style="s2">to to somehow scale that up so you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.869" end="00:59:18.210" style="s2">representatives from different projects</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.450" end="00:59:19.619" style="s2">meet at another level of a core group</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.210" end="00:59:21.599" style="s2">and you know kind of like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.619" end="00:59:25.500" style="s2">liquid democracy type of scale of</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.599" end="00:59:28.890" style="s2">thinking if if that makes any sense I</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.500" end="00:59:30.780" style="s2">think you&#39;d almost need to do that for</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.890" end="00:59:32.369" style="s2">this kind of meeting so if the people</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.780" end="00:59:35.220" style="s2">who are talking about the project for</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.369" end="00:59:36.210" style="s2">projects you might have some insight but</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.220" end="00:59:38.069" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have probably a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.210" end="00:59:39.480" style="s2">insight if you&#39;re actually on one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.069" end="00:59:40.829" style="s2">projects that&#39;s trying to use this</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.480" end="00:59:42.809" style="s2">system you&#39;re like actually that thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.829" end="00:59:43.980" style="s2">that we did discuss last week we tried</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.809" end="00:59:46.650" style="s2">it up in the system and had these</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.980" end="00:59:48.270" style="s2">problems or had those challenges okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.650" end="00:59:51.150" style="s2">how can we address that thing that came</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.270" end="00:59:54.480" style="s2">up in that session and I think you would</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.150" end="00:59:57.630" style="s2">also like jubblies comment previous to</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.480" end="01:00:00.150" style="s2">that is where or what I understood to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.630" end="01:00:02.339" style="s2">is is there more value in having a</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.150" end="01:00:04.049" style="s2">regular meeting with the same group of</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.339" end="01:00:05.250" style="s2">people who were familiar with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.049" end="01:00:07.470" style="s2">project and the problem is trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.250" end="01:00:09.900" style="s2">solve or do you want sort of new people</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.470" end="01:00:12.569" style="s2">that aren&#39;t as well-versed I think you</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.900" end="01:00:15.030" style="s2">need both the session that I the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.569" end="01:00:18.930" style="s2">objector is the project raising session</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.030" end="01:00:21.119" style="s2">that I did the initial value was trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.930" end="01:00:23.880" style="s2">to explain it from scratch and having</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.119" end="01:00:25.500" style="s2">people ask question and it&#39;s based on</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.880" end="01:00:27.329" style="s2">comes from a clean slate having never</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.500" end="01:00:29.400" style="s2">heard it before they hear a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.329" end="01:00:32.819" style="s2">things and then have all these questions</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.400" end="01:00:35.220" style="s2">that&#39;s immensely valuable from like kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.819" end="01:00:36.900" style="s2">of a a marketing standpoint if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.220" end="01:00:38.910" style="s2">trying to tell the story of this project</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.900" end="01:00:40.530" style="s2">how well am i doing what are the</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.910" end="01:00:43.109" style="s2">interesting things what questions come</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.530" end="01:00:45.450" style="s2">out of it but then on the flip side you</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.109" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">just keep doing that every week you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.450" end="01:00:49.319" style="s2">only going to sort of work on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:52.380" style="s2">circuit level how to pitch it and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.319" end="01:00:54.349" style="s2">the actual core on how to do it and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.380" end="01:00:57.599" style="s2">inner workings probably won&#39;t be as</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.349" end="01:01:01.710" style="s2">well.did developed so it sounds like you</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.599" end="01:01:03.540" style="s2">need both so we are at the hour mark</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.710" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">actually little bit over I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.540" end="01:01:07.680" style="s2">we have no one set up for next week I</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:09.510" style="s2">can go out and find more people because</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.680" end="01:01:11.849" style="s2">I&#39;m sure there will be people who are</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.510" end="01:01:15.950" style="s2">interested or we can kind of have a part</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.849" end="01:01:17.650" style="s2">be to this and discuss like actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.950" end="01:01:19.690" style="s2">creating a</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.650" end="01:01:22.779" style="s2">friends as something that&#39;s like people</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.690" end="01:01:24.999" style="s2">bring their projects to that is like</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.779" end="01:01:27.160" style="s2">whether you&#39;re you have a project or not</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.999" end="01:01:28.480" style="s2">likes you need people the point is to</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.160" end="01:01:30.849" style="s2">have a conversation have something</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.480" end="01:01:34.809" style="s2">generative for people as individuals and</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.849" end="01:01:36.039" style="s2">projects out of it I think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.809" end="01:01:39.160" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.039" end="01:01:43.150" style="s2">my suggestion would be if someone comes</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.160" end="01:01:46.150" style="s2">forward go with them but if not then we</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.150" end="01:01:49.869" style="s2">do the Part B but even if that happens</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.150" end="01:01:52.660" style="s2">to set this Part B aside and and do it</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.869" end="01:01:55.180" style="s2">some other time because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.660" end="01:01:56.829" style="s2">important you know we we&#39;ve all heard a</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.180" end="01:01:59.109" style="s2">lot of things today and to just adjust</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.829" end="01:02:02.109" style="s2">those things and tabah lies those things</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.109" end="01:02:05.289" style="s2">and then come back and see where we can</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.109" end="01:02:06.819" style="s2">go from here all right so it should be</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.289" end="01:02:09.039" style="s2">say goodbye to YouTube so I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.819" end="01:02:16.630" style="s2">any closing comments they would like to</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.039" end="01:02:19.799" style="s2">make that was mine good all right</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.630" end="01:02:19.799" style="s2">good bye YouTube</p>
