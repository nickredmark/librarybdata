<p begin="00:01:57.090" end="00:02:01.800" style="s2">corona and one of the reasons I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.190" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">to have you back on the show Jeffrey you</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.800" end="00:02:06.330" style="s2">know there&#39;s a million things we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">talk about but back more than a month</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.330" end="00:02:13.260" style="s2">ago now you sent out a memo to some</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:16.709" style="s2">close friends and associates that really</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.260" end="00:02:18.540" style="s2">outlined your vision of what may you</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.709" end="00:02:20.940" style="s2">know you&#39;re sort of aggregated vision</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.540" end="00:02:23.459" style="s2">from others and experts of what of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.940" end="00:02:27.000" style="s2">may be coming down the road as early as</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.459" end="00:02:28.409" style="s2">in February and I have to say looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.000" end="00:02:30.540" style="s2">back on it now you were one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.409" end="00:02:32.790" style="s2">people who were out there publicly and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.540" end="00:02:34.110" style="s2">privately sharing this information and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.790" end="00:02:36.750" style="s2">sort of getting ahead of the curve and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.110" end="00:02:39.090" style="s2">very interested to see how you came to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.750" end="00:02:40.170" style="s2">that so if you don&#39;t mind sharing a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.090" end="00:02:41.790" style="s2">little bit about that mem</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.170" end="00:02:44.130" style="s2">and then we can just sort of back up and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.790" end="00:02:45.620" style="s2">start from the story and how that came</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.130" end="00:02:48.870" style="s2">to be because in this time of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.620" end="00:02:52.170" style="s2">information overload of increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.870" end="00:02:54.569" style="s2">complexity of lack of clear direction</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.170" end="00:02:56.520" style="s2">especially from the top and from</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.569" end="00:02:58.319" style="s2">everywhere conflicting information from</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.520" end="00:03:01.530" style="s2">the world horse health World Health</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.319" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">Organization CDC trying to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.530" end="00:03:05.190" style="s2">the world today to not only endure but</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.720" end="00:03:07.650" style="s2">to thrive is a really crucial</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.190" end="00:03:09.090" style="s2">conversation we need to happen so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.650" end="00:03:10.920" style="s2">happy to have that with you Jeffrey so</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.090" end="00:03:13.380" style="s2">so tell me the story about this memo</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.920" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">that came out in February you know start</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.380" end="00:03:16.410" style="s2">from the beginning because this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:18.299" style="s2">important how we get to this point yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.410" end="00:03:20.750" style="s2">this email was based on a number of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.299" end="00:03:23.580" style="s2">things that kind of primed me to take</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.750" end="00:03:27.000" style="s2">covert 19 maybe a little more seriously</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.580" end="00:03:28.950" style="s2">than some folks did number one my then</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.000" end="00:03:30.870" style="s2">girlfriend now wife Diana Fleischman got</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.950" end="00:03:33.450" style="s2">me involved in this effective altruism</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.870" end="00:03:35.959" style="s2">movement and a big part of this ei</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.450" end="00:03:38.310" style="s2">movement is thinking about existential</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.959" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">risks to humanity</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.310" end="00:03:44.100" style="s2">I&#39;d actually taught twice a advanced</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:46.769" style="s2">undergrad seminar on the psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.100" end="00:03:49.950" style="s2">effective altruism we spent at least two</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.769" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">weeks in that class on existential risks</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.950" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">such as threats from artificial general</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:59.130" style="s2">intelligence nuclear war and pandemics</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:01.709" style="s2">so we read quite a bit about pandemics</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.130" end="00:04:06.120" style="s2">and the fact that the smart people in EA</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.709" end="00:04:07.859" style="s2">were taking pandemics both naturally</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.120" end="00:04:12.359" style="s2">occurring ones and also bioterrorism</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.859" end="00:04:14.340" style="s2">ones pretty seriously at least as global</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.359" end="00:04:15.750" style="s2">catastrophic risks that could kill tens</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:18.269" style="s2">of millions or hundreds and millions of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.750" end="00:04:19.859" style="s2">people you know they&#39;re not likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.269" end="00:04:23.880" style="s2">existential risks that kill all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.859" end="00:04:26.190" style="s2">humanity but the a lot of smart people I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.880" end="00:04:31.890" style="s2">knew were writing about pandemics as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:33.720" style="s2">big deal and an underestimated threat so</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.890" end="00:04:35.430" style="s2">I had a kind of background preparation</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.720" end="00:04:37.710" style="s2">for for taking this seriously</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.430" end="00:04:39.750" style="s2">um you could you give us just a quick</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.710" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">one on effective altruism I&#39;m not sure a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.750" end="00:04:44.270" style="s2">lot of people are familiar with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">yeah effective altruism is this global</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.270" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">sort of do-gooding movement that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:52.229" style="s2">launched about ten years ago by a couple</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:53.690" style="s2">of oxford moral psychologists Toby Ord</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.229" end="00:04:55.729" style="s2">and will make</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.690" end="00:04:59.449" style="s2">and they wanted to build a movement that</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.729" end="00:05:01.250" style="s2">was rational and evidence-based it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.449" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">about doing the most good that you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.250" end="00:05:06.530" style="s2">given limited resources and trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:10.120" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of the intersection of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.530" end="00:05:14.750" style="s2">policy wonks moral philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.120" end="00:05:17.060" style="s2">scientists rationalists it&#39;s full of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.750" end="00:05:19.639" style="s2">very smart slightly ask me people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.060" end="00:05:22.669" style="s2">read a lot of science fiction and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.639" end="00:05:24.860" style="s2">you know try to think seriously about</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.669" end="00:05:27.410" style="s2">how do you actually help the most people</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.860" end="00:05:29.150" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.410" end="00:05:31.729" style="s2">and traditionally effective altruism has</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.150" end="00:05:34.729" style="s2">focused on things like if you give to</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.729" end="00:05:36.229" style="s2">charity what are some some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.729" end="00:05:37.970" style="s2">effective charities that have the best</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.229" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">evidence that they actually do good</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.970" end="00:05:43.190" style="s2">instead of just doing virtue signaling</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:44.810" style="s2">and wasting money they also pay a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.190" end="00:05:47.360" style="s2">attention to global poverty and global</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.810" end="00:05:49.930" style="s2">public health to pay attention to animal</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:52.370" style="s2">welfare and reducing factory farming and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.930" end="00:05:55.490" style="s2">recently they&#39;ve especially paid a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.370" end="00:05:58.760" style="s2">of attention to existential risks so</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.490" end="00:05:59.930" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the EA context very</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.760" end="00:06:01.909" style="s2">interesting you should bring up this</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.930" end="00:06:03.349" style="s2">notion of trade-offs that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.909" end="00:06:06.320" style="s2">with where are you gonna go off on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.349" end="00:06:07.729" style="s2">tangent here Jeffery it&#39;s amazing this</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.320" end="00:06:10.550" style="s2">conversation of trade-offs that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.729" end="00:06:13.400" style="s2">happening right now from from what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.550" end="00:06:15.289" style="s2">seen you know there&#39;s two there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.400" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2">extreme camps right there&#39;s the like</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.289" end="00:06:21.110" style="s2">basically do-nothing camp right and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:23.080" style="s2">there&#39;s the on the other side sort of</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.580" end="00:06:31.759" style="s2">longer and in that analysis is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.849" end="00:06:34.310" style="s2">a series of trade-offs and it&#39;s not one</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.759" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">that I think people are excited about</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.310" end="00:06:38.599" style="s2">having this conversation right now</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:40.300" style="s2">there&#39;s some heavy issues in there so</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.599" end="00:06:44.330" style="s2">what are what are some of the trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.300" end="00:06:46.430" style="s2">they you&#39;re you can see from our policy</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.330" end="00:06:49.490" style="s2">approaches or the do-nothing approaches</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.430" end="00:06:54.229" style="s2">or the do-everything approaches GDP</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.490" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">values of wives etc etc yeah the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.229" end="00:06:59.030" style="s2">trade-offs are always there even if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:07:00.620" style="s2">refuse to recognize them and this is one</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.030" end="00:07:03.529" style="s2">of the core ideas from effective</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.620" end="00:07:05.659" style="s2">altruism that if you&#39;re doing serious</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.529" end="00:07:06.860" style="s2">public policy and I&#39;m trying to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.659" end="00:07:09.530" style="s2">and predict which</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.860" end="00:07:11.750" style="s2">policies are going to be best you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.530" end="00:07:12.199" style="s2">to try to quantify things as best you</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.750" end="00:07:15.919" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.199" end="00:07:17.930" style="s2">it&#39;s not helpful to say you know lives</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.919" end="00:07:19.580" style="s2">are infinitely valuable and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.930" end="00:07:22.069" style="s2">do everything we can to save every last</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.580" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">person that&#39;s delusional we never do</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.069" end="00:07:26.030" style="s2">that with regard to any policies you</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:29.030" style="s2">have to try to put a dollar value on</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.030" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">human life or else you know nobody would</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.030" end="00:07:34.219" style="s2">ever go to work in dangerous occupations</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:36.370" style="s2">like logging or you know being a lineman</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.219" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">or being a soldier</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.370" end="00:07:41.689" style="s2">nobody attaches infinite value to human</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:43.539" style="s2">life on the other hand you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.689" end="00:07:47.360" style="s2">economic costs of shutdowns</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.539" end="00:07:50.060" style="s2">seriously because jobs translate into</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:53.300" style="s2">lives and into human wellbeing and not</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.060" end="00:07:56.719" style="s2">are a lot to families so anybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.300" end="00:07:59.419" style="s2">saying the economy matters more than the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.719" end="00:08:01.819" style="s2">lives of old people you know if they</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.419" end="00:08:03.949" style="s2">can&#39;t quantify that it&#39;s hard to take</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.819" end="00:08:06.830" style="s2">that seriously but on the other hand if</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.949" end="00:08:09.430" style="s2">you&#39;re like it we should be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.830" end="00:08:11.839" style="s2">undergo a global recession to save a few</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.430" end="00:08:14.599" style="s2">hundred thousand old people that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.839" end="00:08:18.050" style="s2">really serious analysis either right</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.599" end="00:08:20.060" style="s2">well we&#39;ve got both Joe Biden last night</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.050" end="00:08:22.699" style="s2">saying basically human lives are</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.060" end="00:08:25.580" style="s2">infinite in value one of his tweets and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.699" end="00:08:28.060" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the governor of New York State</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.580" end="00:08:31.069" style="s2">saying effectively the same thing now</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.060" end="00:08:33.890" style="s2">how much of that is just pure total</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.069" end="00:08:36.349" style="s2">political BS and how much of that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.890" end="00:08:38.750" style="s2">them actually not understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.349" end="00:08:41.870" style="s2">public health policy it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.750" end="00:08:44.089" style="s2">I think it&#39;s half virtue signaling and a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.870" end="00:08:45.560" style="s2">half ignorant I mean I don&#39;t know these</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.089" end="00:08:47.209" style="s2">guys I don&#39;t know they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.560" end="00:08:50.899" style="s2">educational background I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.209" end="00:08:52.730" style="s2">their advisers but it&#39;s really not a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.899" end="00:08:54.949" style="s2">helpful message to the general public</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.730" end="00:08:58.790" style="s2">for politicians to have this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.949" end="00:09:03.380" style="s2">attitude that the public can&#39;t handle</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.790" end="00:09:05.480" style="s2">the truth if politicians think well we</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.380" end="00:09:07.250" style="s2">have our esoteric knowledge we have what</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.480" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">our advisors and policy wonks are</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.250" end="00:09:12.170" style="s2">telling us but we can&#39;t convey that to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">the general public because the public</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.170" end="00:09:14.100" style="s2">would panicked and the public couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:16.860" style="s2">handle it</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.100" end="00:09:19.830" style="s2">that&#39;s basically anti-democratic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.860" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">saying we the elites know better we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.830" end="00:09:25.320" style="s2">gonna make decisions behind closed doors</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:28.290" style="s2">for the good of the public maybe or for</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.320" end="00:09:31.170" style="s2">the good of our party but if it became</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.290" end="00:09:32.610" style="s2">generally known what we know then the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.170" end="00:09:35.520" style="s2">country couldn&#39;t handle it I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.610" end="00:09:37.650" style="s2">that&#39;s an incredibly patronizing elitist</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.520" end="00:09:38.850" style="s2">attitude and that&#39;s what got us into</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.650" end="00:09:42.090" style="s2">many of these problems in the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.850" end="00:09:45.660" style="s2">place well and it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a new</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.090" end="00:09:47.370" style="s2">position either I was talking with Sam</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.660" end="00:09:50.010" style="s2">Hammonds from the niskin and Center</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.370" end="00:09:52.530" style="s2">about globalization in China and such</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.010" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">and he kept referring me back to Paul</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.530" end="00:09:58.830" style="s2">Krugman going back in like the late 90s</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:10:00.990" style="s2">even saying we can&#39;t let the barbarians</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.830" end="00:10:03.090" style="s2">get a hold of the real data and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.990" end="00:10:05.850" style="s2">information on globalization because</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.090" end="00:10:07.890" style="s2">then ah they&#39;ll just be empowered and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.850" end="00:10:09.150" style="s2">have you know knowledge and we just</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.890" end="00:10:11.070" style="s2">can&#39;t let that happen because they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.150" end="00:10:13.460" style="s2">understand it and we need to rush</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.070" end="00:10:16.860" style="s2">headfirst into a completely globalized</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.460" end="00:10:19.170" style="s2">borderless frictionless economy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.860" end="00:10:22.110" style="s2">ironically not ironically totally</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.170" end="00:10:26.340" style="s2">predictably we&#39;ve ended up in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.110" end="00:10:28.020" style="s2">situation now where globalization has</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.340" end="00:10:30.810" style="s2">many merits obviously but some of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.020" end="00:10:32.400" style="s2">downsides are basically making people</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.810" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">that eat bat soup in China your</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.400" end="00:10:37.200" style="s2">next-door neighbor and so and and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:40.290" style="s2">them also making a medicine that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.200" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">need and and also supplying you with all</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.290" end="00:10:45.990" style="s2">the stuff that you want and need and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:47.730" style="s2">strategic national defense industries as</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.990" end="00:10:49.490" style="s2">well so here we are still with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.730" end="00:10:52.980" style="s2">elites trying to keep the information</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.490" end="00:10:56.010" style="s2">from the masses but times are different</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.980" end="00:10:58.980" style="s2">today times are very different today and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.010" end="00:11:01.200" style="s2">in fact the elites and a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.980" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">leadership they probably don&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.200" end="00:11:04.200" style="s2">the answers in fact we can probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">count on the fact that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.200" end="00:11:10.290" style="s2">comprehend these complex systems and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:11.880" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing in response now is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.290" end="00:11:14.010" style="s2">in conjunction with social meet social</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.880" end="00:11:16.260" style="s2">media technology is the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.010" end="00:11:19.620" style="s2">these new intelligence and information</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.260" end="00:11:22.680" style="s2">networks and user are at the hub of one</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.620" end="00:11:25.350" style="s2">yourself and that&#39;s partially how you</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.680" end="00:11:27.620" style="s2">came to have this these understandings</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.350" end="00:11:30.650" style="s2">before most people did</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.620" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">least publicly so continue to talk us</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.650" end="00:11:36.230" style="s2">through your experience in drafting up</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:37.580" style="s2">this memo and and as we go through it I</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.230" end="00:11:39.110" style="s2">definitely want to dig into the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.580" end="00:11:41.390" style="s2">trade-off so that we were discussing</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.110" end="00:11:43.100" style="s2">because this is the difficult dirty</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.390" end="00:11:46.640" style="s2">national conversation that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.100" end="00:11:48.290" style="s2">being had in a detailed level so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.640" end="00:11:49.940" style="s2">continue with the story I&#39;m will keep</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.290" end="00:11:50.300" style="s2">drilling down on things as we go through</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.940" end="00:11:53.060" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.300" end="00:11:53.450" style="s2">yeah so the the further backstory to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.060" end="00:11:55.970" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.450" end="00:11:58.370" style="s2">arguably pressing an email I did you</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.970" end="00:12:00.830" style="s2">know four or five weeks ago the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.370" end="00:12:03.050" style="s2">first background was I was already tuned</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.830" end="00:12:05.180" style="s2">in by the effective altruism movement to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.050" end="00:12:06.380" style="s2">the risk of pandemics as global</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.180" end="00:12:09.070" style="s2">catastrophic risks</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.380" end="00:12:12.440" style="s2">everybody in EA knew sooner or later</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.070" end="00:12:16.790" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a virus like corona</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.440" end="00:12:19.850" style="s2">virus that creates big problems the only</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.790" end="00:12:21.320" style="s2">the only issue is when and our</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.850" end="00:12:23.720" style="s2">government&#39;s going to take that risk</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.320" end="00:12:25.940" style="s2">seriously enough to prepare for ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.720" end="00:12:28.130" style="s2">time and it&#39;s now become clear the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.940" end="00:12:30.650" style="s2">Chinese government was preparing they</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.130" end="00:12:32.630" style="s2">did have contingency plans most other</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.650" end="00:12:35.690" style="s2">Western democratic governments did not</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.630" end="00:12:38.600" style="s2">take it seriously enough despite clear</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.690" end="00:12:41.110" style="s2">warnings from epidemiologists and Bill</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.600" end="00:12:43.640" style="s2">Gates and lots of other influencers I</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.110" end="00:12:47.660" style="s2">think what do you attribute that to him</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.640" end="00:12:49.459" style="s2">um the fact that America is run by</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.660" end="00:12:52.640" style="s2">lawyers and not by scientists or</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.459" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">engineers right we have a political</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.640" end="00:12:57.560" style="s2">elite that&#39;s used to ruling through</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:13:01.029" style="s2">argumentation propaganda and influence</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.560" end="00:13:04.279" style="s2">and not through actually coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.029" end="00:13:07.370" style="s2">evidence-based policies that solve</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.279" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">practical real-world problems you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.370" end="00:13:12.020" style="s2">like a virus where you you can&#39;t reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:14.660" style="s2">with it you can&#39;t propagandize it away</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.020" end="00:13:17.990" style="s2">it&#39;s just they&#39;re doing its thing right</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.660" end="00:13:19.610" style="s2">so I think the second big influence was</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.990" end="00:13:21.950" style="s2">the fact that you know I married Diana</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.610" end="00:13:24.440" style="s2">in late November we had a honeymoon for</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.950" end="00:13:27.380" style="s2">two or three weeks in China we visited</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.440" end="00:13:29.750" style="s2">Chengdu in Sichuan province we visited</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.380" end="00:13:31.520" style="s2">Shanghai and then a few weeks later I</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.750" end="00:13:35.180" style="s2">actually returned to give a talk in</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.520" end="00:13:37.160" style="s2">Shenzhen north of Hong Kong and during</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.180" end="00:13:40.250" style="s2">that whole period we interacted quite a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.160" end="00:13:41.390" style="s2">bit with local academics you know we did</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.250" end="00:13:44.570" style="s2">these old tourism</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.390" end="00:13:47.540" style="s2">but I was also avidly reading a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.570" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">books about China Chinese governance the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.540" end="00:13:52.940" style="s2">meritocracy how their whole Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.720" end="00:13:56.150" style="s2">Communist Party system operates in terms</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.940" end="00:13:58.780" style="s2">of identifying and promoting talented</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.150" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">smart people into positions of power</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.780" end="00:14:03.770" style="s2">well you sent China and meritocracy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:06.590" style="s2">they have an incredibly efficient</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.770" end="00:14:07.910" style="s2">meritocracy actually so could you dig</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.590" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">into that a little bit and make a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.910" end="00:14:11.990" style="s2">comparison to the United States because</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:14.900" style="s2">people I think first blush would say</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.990" end="00:14:16.640" style="s2">pick the merit meritocratic system China</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.900" end="00:14:18.980" style="s2">or the United States and I think most</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.640" end="00:14:22.130" style="s2">people in the u.s. would pick the United</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.980" end="00:14:23.660" style="s2">States but we also you and I know our</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.130" end="00:14:25.280" style="s2">listeners know that the meritocratic</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.660" end="00:14:26.900" style="s2">system in the United States has been</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.280" end="00:14:28.610" style="s2">completely destroyed for a number of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.900" end="00:14:29.050" style="s2">years decades even and it&#39;s only getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.610" end="00:14:31.400" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.050" end="00:14:32.390" style="s2">but please tell me about your experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.400" end="00:14:34.070" style="s2">in China because that sounds that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.390" end="00:14:36.920" style="s2">actually pretty fascinating concept</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.070" end="00:14:38.750" style="s2">there yeah so you know for history as</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.920" end="00:14:40.430" style="s2">China was actually the first major</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.750" end="00:14:42.500" style="s2">civilization to use widespread</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.430" end="00:14:44.750" style="s2">intelligence testing to allocate</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.500" end="00:14:47.200" style="s2">government positions to talented young</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.750" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">people that was the Imperial Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.200" end="00:14:52.490" style="s2">civil service exam which they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:55.550" style="s2">running for 800 to a thousand years and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.490" end="00:14:58.630" style="s2">it was a matter you know for all four</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.550" end="00:15:01.310" style="s2">centuries of identifying people who were</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.630" end="00:15:03.860" style="s2">literate and mastered the Confucian</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.310" end="00:15:06.230" style="s2">classics and could write insightful</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.860" end="00:15:09.140" style="s2">essays about that and they used this to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.230" end="00:15:10.970" style="s2">identify you know then these tests were</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.140" end="00:15:14.150" style="s2">administered to hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.970" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">of young men per year if you did well on</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.150" end="00:15:19.660" style="s2">the exam you would be appointed to some</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:22.100" style="s2">position of kind of low level government</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.660" end="00:15:25.280" style="s2">influence and power if you did very well</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.100" end="00:15:27.400" style="s2">you were sort of fast-tracked into like</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.280" end="00:15:32.360" style="s2">this guy might be a good candidate for</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.400" end="00:15:34.310" style="s2">mayor of a local town or city and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.360" end="00:15:36.770" style="s2">know the the Chinese imperial system had</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.310" end="00:15:38.270" style="s2">many flaws and many weaknesses and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.770" end="00:15:41.180" style="s2">was kind of not very good at promoting</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.270" end="00:15:44.870" style="s2">technological development but they did</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.180" end="00:15:47.450" style="s2">have this background of thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.870" end="00:15:49.450" style="s2">being IQ realists and taking</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.450" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">intelligence seriously as something that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.450" end="00:15:54.550" style="s2">deserves identification and cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:57.020" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.550" end="00:16:01.850" style="s2">then you know you get the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.020" end="00:16:05.270" style="s2">Revolution in the 1940s the meritocracy</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.850" end="00:16:08.089" style="s2">is disrupted by several decades by Mao</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.270" end="00:16:11.630" style="s2">and his policies but then it gets</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.089" end="00:16:14.620" style="s2">basically re instituted in the 1980s you</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.630" end="00:16:17.690" style="s2">get the Gaucho of the national</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.620" end="00:16:20.300" style="s2">university entrance exam which everybody</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.690" end="00:16:22.430" style="s2">who&#39;s aged eighteen takes it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.300" end="00:16:24.860" style="s2">challenging students study hard for it</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.430" end="00:16:26.600" style="s2">it determines are you going to get into</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.860" end="00:16:30.370" style="s2">the first second or third tier</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.600" end="00:16:34.580" style="s2">university or not university at all and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.370" end="00:16:38.930" style="s2">then even during an after university the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.580" end="00:16:42.860" style="s2">Chinese Communist Party has basically a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.930" end="00:16:45.260" style="s2">human resources department that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.860" end="00:16:48.589" style="s2">national track of everybody who is</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.260" end="00:16:50.959" style="s2">talented in the public sector but also</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.589" end="00:16:55.700" style="s2">in state-owned enterprises and private</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.959" end="00:16:58.940" style="s2">businesses and basically what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.700" end="00:17:02.600" style="s2">if you&#39;re a very talented young person</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.940" end="00:17:04.699" style="s2">this Bureau will assign you to different</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.600" end="00:17:08.120" style="s2">positions to kind of test out how good</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.699" end="00:17:10.850" style="s2">you are at running a business a</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.120" end="00:17:14.150" style="s2">state-owned enterprise or the local</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.850" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">government if you do well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.150" end="00:17:18.650" style="s2">promoted to positions of increasing</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:21.890" style="s2">political responsibility or business</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.650" end="00:17:25.100" style="s2">responsibility they deliberately rotate</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.890" end="00:17:26.870" style="s2">people between state-owned enterprises</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.100" end="00:17:29.870" style="s2">private businesses and political</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.870" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">positions so by the time you&#39;re a mayor</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.870" end="00:17:35.960" style="s2">of a big city you haven&#39;t just been</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:39.320" style="s2">elected as a political you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.960" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">apparatchik or somebody who&#39;s good on TV</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.320" end="00:17:44.059" style="s2">or good and debates you&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.360" end="00:17:49.460" style="s2">proven you can already run a small town</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.059" end="00:17:52.220" style="s2">you can already run a factory you are an</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.460" end="00:17:54.980" style="s2">effective manager so you got promoted</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.220" end="00:17:58.370" style="s2">based on these sorts of meritocratic</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.980" end="00:18:00.920" style="s2">criteria and by the time you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.370" end="00:18:03.770" style="s2">Standing Committee of the Politburo you</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.920" end="00:18:06.140" style="s2">know the top level government decision</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.770" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">makers and advisers you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.140" end="00:18:10.550" style="s2">proven you can run a major</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:12.230" style="s2">corporation you can run a province you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.550" end="00:18:15.080" style="s2">probably have at least a master&#39;s degree</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.230" end="00:18:17.030" style="s2">in engineering and I was just hugely</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.080" end="00:18:21.380" style="s2">impressed the more I learned about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.030" end="00:18:24.680" style="s2">that the meritocracy in China despite</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.380" end="00:18:28.400" style="s2">all the the corruption and ideology</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.680" end="00:18:30.920" style="s2">behind the scenes I think they have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:34.940" style="s2">government of very smart practical</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.920" end="00:18:39.080" style="s2">minded people who know that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.940" end="00:18:42.260" style="s2">their welfare is closely tied up with</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.080" end="00:18:44.690" style="s2">the economic well-being of the people</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.260" end="00:18:49.310" style="s2">who are looking after and and public</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.690" end="00:18:52.300" style="s2">health that is that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.310" end="00:18:55.940" style="s2">fascinating and totally contrary to what</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.300" end="00:18:57.560" style="s2">what I think they would have us think</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.940" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">here in the United States the powers</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.560" end="00:19:03.470" style="s2">that be or just common culture or</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:05.140" style="s2">whatever it seemed to me the year first</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.470" end="00:19:07.610" style="s2">my first thought would be that all</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.140" end="00:19:10.370" style="s2">political positions of power just filled</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.610" end="00:19:11.570" style="s2">with cronies and party party tools and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.370" end="00:19:14.540" style="s2">they&#39;re not really focused on</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.570" end="00:19:15.920" style="s2">efficiencies or doing things better than</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.540" end="00:19:17.770" style="s2">anybody else they&#39;re more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.920" end="00:19:20.300" style="s2">just power and control over the people</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.770" end="00:19:22.610" style="s2">but your first-hand experience your</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.300" end="00:19:25.100" style="s2">history or your understanding of their</p>

<p begin="00:19:28.610" end="00:19:32.690" style="s2">perspective was there a personal</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.590" end="00:19:34.190" style="s2">connection or conversation or an</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.690" end="00:19:35.780" style="s2">observance or something that you had</p>

<p begin="00:19:35.780" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">we had been reading or what you had</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.270" end="00:19:43.700" style="s2">suspected I think the thing that shocked</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:45.740" style="s2">me you know apart from all this</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.700" end="00:19:47.690" style="s2">background reading was just seeing with</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.740" end="00:19:49.640" style="s2">my own eyes that that China has</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.690" end="00:19:53.080" style="s2">leapfrogged in terms of technological</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.640" end="00:19:56.150" style="s2">and social development so fast I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.080" end="00:19:58.520" style="s2">every single subway that we rode in any</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.150" end="00:20:00.440" style="s2">major Chinese city was better faster</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.520" end="00:20:04.850" style="s2">more advanced cleaner than any subway</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.440" end="00:20:06.920" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever seen in the US or Europe the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.850" end="00:20:09.650" style="s2">rate of building I mean when I visited</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.920" end="00:20:11.210" style="s2">Shenzhen for example I gave a talk at</p>

<p begin="00:20:13.880" end="00:20:18.410" style="s2">last five years I was staying in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.070" end="00:20:20.540" style="s2">huge hotel there is a massive</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.410" end="00:20:21.380" style="s2">construction site outside the hotel I</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.540" end="00:20:23.780" style="s2">happen to ask</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.380" end="00:20:26.180" style="s2">my colleagues hey what&#39;s that they said</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.780" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">oh it&#39;s just we&#39;re building that what</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.180" end="00:20:31.010" style="s2">will be the tallest building in Asia two</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:36.170" style="s2">thousand feet it&#39;ll be done in four</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.010" end="00:20:39.860" style="s2">years and that&#39;s just something that</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.170" end="00:20:41.960" style="s2">happens so I was very impressed with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.860" end="00:20:44.060" style="s2">kind of rate of development a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.960" end="00:20:46.850" style="s2">Americans if they haven&#39;t been to China</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.060" end="00:20:48.890" style="s2">think of it as a backward place that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.850" end="00:20:51.950" style="s2">full of these weird wet markets and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.890" end="00:20:54.800" style="s2">people eating barbaric food and to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.950" end="00:20:57.140" style="s2">these sort of images of like rice</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.800" end="00:21:00.620" style="s2">paddies and Chinese communism as it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.140" end="00:21:02.900" style="s2">back in the 70s and they&#39;re not up to</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.620" end="00:21:06.260" style="s2">date with what&#39;s actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.900" end="00:21:08.330" style="s2">there so I go on this honeymoon I get</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.260" end="00:21:10.490" style="s2">back from China I hear about coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.330" end="00:21:14.360" style="s2">in China and how seriously they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.490" end="00:21:17.270" style="s2">taking it how what draconian decisive</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.360" end="00:21:20.360" style="s2">measures they&#39;re they&#39;re implementing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.270" end="00:21:23.900" style="s2">deal with this and and Wuhan and Hebei</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.360" end="00:21:26.560" style="s2">province and I think oh if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.900" end="00:21:30.920" style="s2">doing this they think this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.560" end="00:21:34.370" style="s2">really big deal and I compared it to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.920" end="00:21:37.910" style="s2">likely response of America and European</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.370" end="00:21:40.880" style="s2">countries and I thought we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.910" end="00:21:44.150" style="s2">the political will or the meritocracy or</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.880" end="00:21:47.180" style="s2">the awareness of pandemics as a risk to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.150" end="00:21:51.730" style="s2">handle this very well compared to China</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.180" end="00:21:54.730" style="s2">and I thought this is really bad this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.730" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">this is going to be a kind of global</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.730" end="00:22:01.340" style="s2">catastrophe because no matter what China</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:03.710" style="s2">does it is going to escape it is going</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.340" end="00:22:05.240" style="s2">to infect other countries and once it</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.710" end="00:22:08.600" style="s2">does that it&#39;s going to be a global</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.240" end="00:22:10.250" style="s2">pandemic so I&#39;d like to dig down on this</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.600" end="00:22:12.920" style="s2">a little bit because people are using</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.250" end="00:22:14.930" style="s2">the China case as a comparison for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.920" end="00:22:16.910" style="s2">United States and they&#39;re looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.930" end="00:22:19.370" style="s2">as being you know ahead of us in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.910" end="00:22:21.020" style="s2">future an example of what to do oh my</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.370" end="00:22:24.530" style="s2">god they bent the curve their numbers</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.020" end="00:22:26.620" style="s2">are down cases are down but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.530" end="00:22:30.380" style="s2">drill down onto China for a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.620" end="00:22:33.710" style="s2">just China have any motivations beyond</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.380" end="00:22:39.050" style="s2">on the same analysis that we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.710" end="00:22:40.310" style="s2">in terms of GDP health death you know is</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.050" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">a recession</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.310" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna kill more people than the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:48.220" style="s2">virus are they are they maximizing for</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:51.980" style="s2">the same outcome as we are I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.220" end="00:22:54.560" style="s2">honestly to a large degree they are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.980" end="00:22:56.900" style="s2">just I imagine that behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.560" end="00:22:59.330" style="s2">the smart people running China are much</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.900" end="00:23:00.830" style="s2">more willing to talk explicitly and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.330" end="00:23:03.170" style="s2">rationally about the trade-offs that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.830" end="00:23:06.200" style="s2">they face I think this is why they were</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.170" end="00:23:08.870" style="s2">willing to do such an intense lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.200" end="00:23:12.380" style="s2">so early you know there were a few weeks</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.870" end="00:23:14.780" style="s2">of kind of denialism and obscuring what</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.380" end="00:23:17.210" style="s2">was happening but once the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.780" end="00:23:20.720" style="s2">leadership took it seriously they</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.210" end="00:23:23.540" style="s2">realized either we go into full-scale</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.720" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">serious militarily enforced lock downs</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.540" end="00:23:31.940" style="s2">or we&#39;re gonna have a national recession</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.640" end="00:23:34.160" style="s2">that screws our economy we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.940" end="00:23:37.300" style="s2">ahead of this virus absolutely as fast</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.160" end="00:23:39.770" style="s2">as possible and we have to use the full</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.300" end="00:23:42.440" style="s2">decisiveness and power of the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.770" end="00:23:44.030" style="s2">government to do it now they had</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.440" end="00:23:46.430" style="s2">experience in dealing with something</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.030" end="00:23:49.130" style="s2">like this right I think I read that to</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.430" end="00:23:50.810" style="s2">h1n1 they actually enforced quarantines</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.130" end="00:23:53.000" style="s2">and shut down similar to this and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.810" end="00:23:55.100" style="s2">they also have their systems and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.000" end="00:23:57.350" style="s2">software tracking and guys in countries</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.100" end="00:23:59.360" style="s2">like Singapore and South Korea that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.350" end="00:24:02.840" style="s2">mean they&#39;re they&#39;re just like prepared</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.360" end="00:24:05.060" style="s2">right they they they like wargame this</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.840" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">stuff out they&#39;ve they&#39;ve had actual</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.060" end="00:24:09.620" style="s2">practical experience and so they can see</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:11.750" style="s2">into the future a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.620" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">clearly than we can or we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.750" end="00:24:17.090" style="s2">in the United States so assuming now</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:19.960" style="s2">that their their trade-off and</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.090" end="00:24:22.430" style="s2">optimization model is similar to ours</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.960" end="00:24:24.830" style="s2">you basically get out of this thing with</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.430" end="00:24:27.080" style="s2">the least amount of damage right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.830" end="00:24:31.070" style="s2">saving the most lies as possible at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.080" end="00:24:34.670" style="s2">same time that trade-off do you think</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.070" end="00:24:38.540" style="s2">that the data that&#39;s coming out of China</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.670" end="00:24:40.100" style="s2">is reliable do you think that the and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.540" end="00:24:41.430" style="s2">realize that you&#39;re not like a Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.100" end="00:24:43.050" style="s2">Studies expert or</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.430" end="00:24:44.280" style="s2">epidemiologist but you were there and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.050" end="00:24:45.420" style="s2">you&#39;ve had experience in you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.280" end="00:24:48.300" style="s2">smart guy and you&#39;ve talked a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.420" end="00:24:49.680" style="s2">people so do you do trust the data</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.300" end="00:24:50.940" style="s2">that&#39;s coming out of China because I</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.680" end="00:24:52.950" style="s2">really am litt interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.940" end="00:24:54.450" style="s2">comparison between what they did what</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.950" end="00:24:57.480" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do and is it gonna work the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.450" end="00:25:02.100" style="s2">same way I don&#39;t fully trust the data</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.480" end="00:25:04.650" style="s2">coming out of China I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.100" end="00:25:08.000" style="s2">playing a very subtle very long game in</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.650" end="00:25:13.560" style="s2">terms of geopolitical influence and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.000" end="00:25:15.180" style="s2">don&#39;t think they necessarily think okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.560" end="00:25:18.500" style="s2">we have to be fully open and fully</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.180" end="00:25:20.730" style="s2">disclose &#39;iv to the West in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.500" end="00:25:22.620" style="s2">everything that&#39;s happening internally I</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.730" end="00:25:24.510" style="s2">think their their view is it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.620" end="00:25:26.360" style="s2">none of the West&#39;s business and we will</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.510" end="00:25:30.090" style="s2">give you the information that we think</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.360" end="00:25:36.780" style="s2">helps China right not necessarily that</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.090" end="00:25:42.720" style="s2">helps you but you know having said that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.780" end="00:25:44.430" style="s2">I think I&#39;m as worried about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.720" end="00:25:46.410" style="s2">geopolitical side effects of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.430" end="00:25:49.740" style="s2">pandemic as I am about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.410" end="00:25:53.130" style="s2">economic side effects mm-hmm I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.740" end="00:25:56.160" style="s2">China knows very well that it is getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.130" end="00:25:58.580" style="s2">a lot of credit internationally for</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.160" end="00:26:01.710" style="s2">being able to handle this pandemic so</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.580" end="00:26:03.720" style="s2">decisively internally and offering a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.710" end="00:26:06.350" style="s2">of help to other countries I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.720" end="00:26:09.210" style="s2">China&#39;s reputation will emerge from this</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.350" end="00:26:11.820" style="s2">looking a lot better probably than</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.210" end="00:26:13.320" style="s2">America or Europe look in the eyes of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.820" end="00:26:16.230" style="s2">the third world and the eyes of other</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.320" end="00:26:18.240" style="s2">developing countries and I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.230" end="00:26:20.940" style="s2">perfectly willing to capitalize on that</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.240" end="00:26:24.240" style="s2">I think a lot of other countries are</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.940" end="00:26:25.650" style="s2">going to after this pandemic look at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.240" end="00:26:30.210" style="s2">relative efficiency of different</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.650" end="00:26:33.090" style="s2">governments and think wow China not only</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.210" end="00:26:34.800" style="s2">succeeded in an unprecedented rate of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.090" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">economic growth and lifting hundreds and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.800" end="00:26:40.530" style="s2">millions of people out of poverty in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:43.260" style="s2">last three decades but also they seem</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.530" end="00:26:45.990" style="s2">apparently to be able to handle global</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.260" end="00:26:50.040" style="s2">catastrophic risks better than</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.990" end="00:26:53.880" style="s2">american-style democracy can that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.040" end="00:26:54.940" style="s2">that is interesting comparison do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.880" end="00:26:58.360" style="s2">think in there now</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.940" end="00:27:02.050" style="s2">they put the same value on a human life</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.360" end="00:27:05.380" style="s2">as we do now I understand economically</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.050" end="00:27:08.260" style="s2">speaking this should be cut and dry</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.380" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">but there&#39;s more to it than that do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.260" end="00:27:13.510" style="s2">do you think in their calculations that</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:15.250" style="s2">they put the same value on a human life</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.510" end="00:27:17.800" style="s2">as we do in the West in the United</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.250" end="00:27:20.680" style="s2">States I think in the aggregate they</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.800" end="00:27:21.970" style="s2">actually do now care quite a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.680" end="00:27:24.490" style="s2">the health and well-being of their</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.970" end="00:27:28.180" style="s2">citizens more than they did maybe 15</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.490" end="00:27:30.610" style="s2">years ago a lot of Chinese politicians</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.180" end="00:27:32.980" style="s2">like mayors of big cities are promoted</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.610" end="00:27:35.020" style="s2">based on things like how quickly can you</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.980" end="00:27:37.740" style="s2">improve air quality and reduce pollution</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.020" end="00:27:40.540" style="s2">because they&#39;re extremely worried about</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.740" end="00:27:43.830" style="s2">you know the lung damage and the deaths</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.540" end="00:27:48.340" style="s2">that are caused by that so I think as</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.830" end="00:27:50.800" style="s2">you shift from a kind of manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.340" end="00:27:54.550" style="s2">based economy to a service economy they</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.800" end="00:27:57.250" style="s2">realize the economic well-being of China</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.550" end="00:28:01.510" style="s2">depends on most Chinese people being</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.250" end="00:28:04.930" style="s2">healthy happy workers and and consumers</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.510" end="00:28:07.210" style="s2">and citizens so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.930" end="00:28:10.750" style="s2">they they view human lives as expendable</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.210" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">the way that we sort of assumed that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.750" end="00:28:15.550" style="s2">they do however they are willing to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:17.920" style="s2">utilitarian and to make tough calls and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.550" end="00:28:20.680" style="s2">to say sorry it&#39;s inconvenient to lock</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.920" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">down a whole city for weeks on end but</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.680" end="00:28:25.750" style="s2">for the greater good we will do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:29.430" style="s2">because aggregate welfare depends on it</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.750" end="00:28:33.820" style="s2">and do you think the citizens of China</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.430" end="00:28:36.940" style="s2">have this a similar perspective in terms</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.820" end="00:28:38.440" style="s2">of the greater good because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.940" end="00:28:40.570" style="s2">something I think that we&#39;re struggling</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.440" end="00:28:43.440" style="s2">with right now in the United States I</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.570" end="00:28:46.000" style="s2">know a lot of the conversation is around</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.440" end="00:28:49.230" style="s2">really what is the damage to the economy</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.000" end="00:28:51.460" style="s2">gonna do for health indicators right</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.230" end="00:28:54.910" style="s2">unemployment is a leading indicator for</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.460" end="00:28:57.310" style="s2">all kinds of bad things for people but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.910" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">think baked somewhere deeper into it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.310" end="00:29:01.770" style="s2">this conflict between the innate</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:05.730" style="s2">individualism</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.770" end="00:29:07.980" style="s2">United States versus what do we have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.730" end="00:29:10.770" style="s2">give up in order to help our fellows and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.980" end="00:29:13.290" style="s2">I think that that probably ties in well</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.770" end="00:29:15.660" style="s2">with your studies in thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.290" end="00:29:18.570" style="s2">effective altruism so it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.660" end="00:29:22.710" style="s2">interesting scenario to consider at this</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.570" end="00:29:24.060" style="s2">time China is a very confusing place in</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.710" end="00:29:26.250" style="s2">this regard I think there is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.060" end="00:29:30.270" style="s2">stronger collectivism there&#39;s an intense</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.250" end="00:29:34.080" style="s2">you know Han Chinese nationalism they</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.270" end="00:29:36.360" style="s2">view their country as not just a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.080" end="00:29:39.630" style="s2">not just a country it&#39;s a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.360" end="00:29:42.060" style="s2">it&#39;s an F no state it&#39;s a population</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.630" end="00:29:43.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a gene pool right</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.060" end="00:29:45.840" style="s2">they don&#39;t have this civic nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.350" end="00:29:48.180" style="s2">where oh if you sign up to Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:50.220" style="s2">values you&#39;re Chinese they have a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.180" end="00:29:53.250" style="s2">biologically grounded view of what their</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.220" end="00:29:55.680" style="s2">civilization is and what its interests</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.250" end="00:29:59.820" style="s2">are so there&#39;s collectivism at that</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.680" end="00:30:01.250" style="s2">level to promote Chinese economic</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.820" end="00:30:04.170" style="s2">development I think the government has</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.250" end="00:30:07.470" style="s2">promoted kind of runaway consumerism and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.170" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">luxury consumerism and materialism at a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.470" end="00:30:14.070" style="s2">kind of strategic level so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:16.500" style="s2">lot of focus on luxury brands and kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.070" end="00:30:19.650" style="s2">of individuals and families getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.500" end="00:30:21.990" style="s2">ahead economically but I think basically</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.650" end="00:30:25.860" style="s2">that&#39;s a government policy that realizes</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.990" end="00:30:29.820" style="s2">hey we can harness individual</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.860" end="00:30:32.370" style="s2">competitiveness and family kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.820" end="00:30:35.280" style="s2">economic aspirations to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.370" end="00:30:37.770" style="s2">work harder and consume more and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.280" end="00:30:39.660" style="s2">good for the national economy but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.770" end="00:30:42.180" style="s2">think if they had to revert back to an</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.660" end="00:30:44.930" style="s2">intense collectivism like if they got</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.180" end="00:30:47.940" style="s2">into a serious war with another country</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.930" end="00:30:52.430" style="s2">then they could sort of pivot on a dime</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.940" end="00:30:55.220" style="s2">and renew that sense a national purpose</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.430" end="00:30:56.810" style="s2">that they have</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.220" end="00:30:58.820" style="s2">well the United States is sort of in one</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.810" end="00:31:01.850" style="s2">of those precarious situations right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.820" end="00:31:04.310" style="s2">where we have a common enemy at least a</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.850" end="00:31:07.670" style="s2">first-order common enemy of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.310" end="00:31:09.980" style="s2">coronavirus and one of the positive side</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.670" end="00:31:11.950" style="s2">effects that I have seen is that we all</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.980" end="00:31:14.630" style="s2">do seem to be focused on the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.950" end="00:31:19.790" style="s2">antagonist right now which in a way has</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.630" end="00:31:21.350" style="s2">a very powerful effect of reducing some</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.790" end="00:31:24.260" style="s2">of our differences that we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.350" end="00:31:27.320" style="s2">perceived or perceived differences and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.260" end="00:31:30.800" style="s2">and squashing some of our petty err</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.320" end="00:31:33.080" style="s2">political conflicts and social conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.800" end="00:31:37.400" style="s2">to get us focused perhaps like we were</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.080" end="00:31:40.520" style="s2">in the 70s and 80s or in the 40s or all</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.400" end="00:31:43.460" style="s2">the way back to 1776 these having these</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.520" end="00:31:47.060" style="s2">uniting uniting common enemies is a is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.460" end="00:31:48.820" style="s2">powerful force for national unity but</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.060" end="00:31:51.140" style="s2">you brought up an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.820" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">counterpoint or just an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.140" end="00:31:56.510" style="s2">topic which is the sense of nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:32:00.100" style="s2">and they&#39;re sort of their ethno bastes</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.510" end="00:32:04.250" style="s2">nationalism do you think that a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.100" end="00:32:07.190" style="s2">nationalistic perspective like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.250" end="00:32:09.440" style="s2">gonna lead to more optimal health</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.190" end="00:32:11.900" style="s2">outcomes or some outcomes that are more</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:13.300" style="s2">optimal than our civic nationalism do</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.900" end="00:32:17.240" style="s2">you think that there&#39;s some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.300" end="00:32:20.630" style="s2">biological reason why we may have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.240" end="00:32:23.600" style="s2">tougher time thinking holistically like</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.630" end="00:32:25.720" style="s2">they may in China given our you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.600" end="00:32:30.290" style="s2">diversity or ethnic diversity</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.720" end="00:32:32.150" style="s2">nationalistic diversity our nationalist</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.290" end="00:32:37.010" style="s2">countries better equipped to survive</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.150" end="00:32:38.900" style="s2">these existential type threats than ones</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.010" end="00:32:42.710" style="s2">perhaps based around a civic nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.900" end="00:32:44.540" style="s2">or or an imagined order absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.710" end="00:32:47.450" style="s2">I think diversity is our weakness in</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.540" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">terms of responding to crises and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.450" end="00:32:52.310" style="s2">been like I knew America was partisan</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.480" end="00:32:54.560" style="s2">and divided and I&#39;m very familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.310" end="00:32:59.260" style="s2">Trump derangement syndrome and woken us</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.560" end="00:33:01.700" style="s2">and you know everything that has hurt</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.260" end="00:33:03.740" style="s2">freedom of speech and thought and</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.700" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">universities and all of that but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.740" end="00:33:08.300" style="s2">really did think if we had a global</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:09.420" style="s2">pandemic that America would come</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.300" end="00:33:12.390" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.420" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">faster and and more decisively than it</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.390" end="00:33:17.970" style="s2">has seeing the partisan squabbling about</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:22.200" style="s2">the economic stimulus bill that just</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.970" end="00:33:25.490" style="s2">passed was baffling to me I could not</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.200" end="00:33:28.140" style="s2">believe that politicians were still</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.490" end="00:33:31.230" style="s2">genuinely more focused on election</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.140" end="00:33:34.560" style="s2">prospects than on the health and economy</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.230" end="00:33:37.530" style="s2">of the country so to some degree there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.560" end="00:33:39.450" style="s2">been a little bit of a a coming together</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.530" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">nationally to defeat the common enemy</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.450" end="00:33:49.170" style="s2">the virus but honestly I still see so</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:53.070" style="s2">much residual partisanship hatred of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.170" end="00:33:54.990" style="s2">perceived political opponent people</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.070" end="00:33:58.230" style="s2">still seem to think the election is more</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.990" end="00:34:02.100" style="s2">important than the pandemic at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.230" end="00:34:05.600" style="s2">level and that&#39;s partly journalistic</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.100" end="00:34:08.730" style="s2">malpractice the journalism has become</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.600" end="00:34:11.090" style="s2">mostly political propaganda rather than</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.730" end="00:34:13.380" style="s2">something done for the common good um</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.090" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">partly it&#39;s just our political system</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.380" end="00:34:18.360" style="s2">partly it&#39;s the fact that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:21.780" style="s2">American citizens are just not very well</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.360" end="00:34:24.090" style="s2">educated about global catastrophic risks</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.780" end="00:34:26.580" style="s2">yeah I mean there&#39;s a certain rational</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.090" end="00:34:28.890" style="s2">ignorance about those issues I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.580" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">the chance that an individual actor is</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.890" end="00:34:32.310" style="s2">going to be able to impact those</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:33.720" style="s2">conversations in a meaningful way or</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.310" end="00:34:37.050" style="s2">decisions in meaningful way sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.720" end="00:34:39.419" style="s2">leads one to a rational ignorance but</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.050" end="00:34:40.950" style="s2">you know in terms of the pandemic being</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.419" end="00:34:43.020" style="s2">more important than the election if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.950" end="00:34:44.250" style="s2">think about I guess last week there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.020" end="00:34:46.350" style="s2">about two million new unemployment</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.250" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">claims they&#39;re projecting maybe six to</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.350" end="00:34:50.220" style="s2">ten million claims this month at least</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:51.990" style="s2">based on what candidate or this week</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.220" end="00:34:54.660" style="s2">based on what Canada did they had ten</p>

<p begin="00:35:42.420" end="00:35:46.350" style="s2">people have the same expectations so</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.460" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">this is a good way for us to segue back</p>

<p begin="00:36:08.820" end="00:36:13.230" style="s2">study does seem to be the basis for a</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.650" end="00:36:15.810" style="s2">lot of the global response but what was</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.230" end="00:36:18.330" style="s2">your perspective back in February if</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.810" end="00:36:20.820" style="s2">nothing had happened and the virus just</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.330" end="00:36:23.010" style="s2">spread unchecked we&#39;re like us</p>

<p begin="00:36:24.510" end="00:36:28.920" style="s2">what&#39;s another you know two seasons</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.820" end="00:36:30.450" style="s2">worth of car wrecks you know all at once</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.920" end="00:36:33.480" style="s2">here but the that was in your</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.450" end="00:36:35.460" style="s2">perspective was it no I guess you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.480" end="00:36:37.530" style="s2">apart from being involved in effective</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.460" end="00:36:39.540" style="s2">altruism and apart from some personal</p>

<p begin="00:36:39.540" end="00:36:44.640" style="s2">the the pandemic more seriously because</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:47.280" style="s2">China took it seriously a third thing is</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.640" end="00:36:49.020" style="s2">I just throughout my whole life I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:51.360" style="s2">read a lot of science fiction including</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.020" end="00:36:53.460" style="s2">a lot of dystopian science fiction and</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.360" end="00:36:56.730" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of tuned into the the fragility</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.460" end="00:36:59.810" style="s2">of civilization and the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.730" end="00:37:03.000" style="s2">depends on a lot of interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.810" end="00:37:07.350" style="s2">networks that we tend to take for</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.000" end="00:37:09.810" style="s2">granted until they fail even just</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.350" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">reading the novel World War Z by Max</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.810" end="00:37:14.700" style="s2">Brooks I highly recommend you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:18.750" style="s2">not going to ever face a zombie pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.700" end="00:37:22.620" style="s2">per se but that novel was really good at</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.750" end="00:37:24.780" style="s2">tracing out the many many weird side</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.620" end="00:37:28.369" style="s2">effects that are likely to come about</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.780" end="00:37:32.269" style="s2">from a pandemic all the way from</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.369" end="00:37:34.309" style="s2">economic recession - social unrest to</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.269" end="00:37:39.109" style="s2">increase nationalism and international</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.309" end="00:37:41.420" style="s2">tensions to kind of mental health issues</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.109" end="00:37:43.249" style="s2">and psychological problems and family</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.420" end="00:37:48.009" style="s2">conflict and marital conflict and all</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.249" end="00:37:51.460" style="s2">that so I had a kind of roadmap for</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.009" end="00:37:54.079" style="s2">sketching out oh my god there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.460" end="00:37:56.990" style="s2">possible unanticipated side effects of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.079" end="00:37:58.940" style="s2">the pandemic even if it&#39;s relatively</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.990" end="00:38:02.150" style="s2">mild even if it&#39;s only a few hundred</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.940" end="00:38:05.470" style="s2">million cases even if the death rate is</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.150" end="00:38:08.210" style="s2">only one or two percent you still have</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.470" end="00:38:11.809" style="s2">all of these other effects that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.210" end="00:38:16.460" style="s2">seeing play out in kind of slow motion</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.809" end="00:38:18.190" style="s2">and I thought there are so many possible</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.460" end="00:38:23.029" style="s2">downsides to this and there&#39;s so few</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.190" end="00:38:25.700" style="s2">upsides I can see and the likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.029" end="00:38:28.999" style="s2">our political leaders dealing with it in</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.700" end="00:38:36.170" style="s2">a rational and decisive way is very very</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.999" end="00:38:37.999" style="s2">small almost zero and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.170" end="00:38:39.950" style="s2">hard for them because you know you look</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.999" end="00:38:42.140" style="s2">at the CDC you look at the World Health</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.950" end="00:38:43.970" style="s2">Organization and as late as late January</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.140" end="00:38:47.059" style="s2">early February they&#39;re given</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.970" end="00:38:48.950" style="s2">terrible exact opposite advice you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.059" end="00:38:49.970" style="s2">go out don&#39;t worry about it wash your</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.950" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">hands it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.970" end="00:38:55.720" style="s2">masks don&#39;t work it&#39;s just the flu I</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:38:59.960" style="s2">mean they were playing downplaying it</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.720" end="00:39:02.869" style="s2">for some time actually which is really</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.960" end="00:39:04.339" style="s2">interesting and frustrating and it just</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.869" end="00:39:06.410" style="s2">really comes back to sort of the general</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.339" end="00:39:09.109" style="s2">complexity of everything I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.410" end="00:39:10.819" style="s2">it&#39;s nuts for us to think that one</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.109" end="00:39:13.819" style="s2">person two people even a team of people</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.819" end="00:39:15.170" style="s2">in any institution or bureaucracy are</p>

<p begin="00:39:19.339" end="00:39:24.499" style="s2">and we&#39;re seeing this is the</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.900" end="00:40:37.410" style="s2">it&#39;s less politically mm-hm manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.470" end="00:40:39.660" style="s2">you know oh the game theory of advice</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.410" end="00:40:43.130" style="s2">giving at the sort of top national level</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.660" end="00:40:45.240" style="s2">is so complicated and so distorted</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.130" end="00:40:47.460" style="s2">everybody advising the president has</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.240" end="00:40:49.590" style="s2">their own agenda and that agenda is</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.460" end="00:40:51.960" style="s2">almost never perfectly aligned with the</p>

<p begin="00:41:03.660" end="00:41:08.310" style="s2">think Twitter has done a really good job</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.490" end="00:41:17.220" style="s2">ok certain epidemiologists who seem to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.720" end="00:41:18.600" style="s2">know what they&#39;re talking about under</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.220" end="00:41:20.490" style="s2">showing good judgment and making</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.490" end="00:41:27.840" style="s2">and they get followers and they get</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.740" end="00:41:30.750" style="s2">influenced very very quickly so to</p>

<p begin="00:41:37.299" end="00:41:41.260" style="s2">think of our society mainstream</p>

<p begin="00:44:42.210" end="00:44:46.380" style="s2">Oh actually came to pass at least for</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:48.780" style="s2">the first couple weeks after I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.380" end="00:44:52.050" style="s2">this this email the worst case scenario</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.780" end="00:44:53.730" style="s2">was the American leadership and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.050" end="00:44:58.320" style="s2">the European leadership would basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.730" end="00:45:01.880" style="s2">ignore the corona virus epidemic in</p>

<p begin="00:45:01.880" end="00:45:08.760" style="s2">that Trump&#39;s initial response would be</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.920" end="00:45:10.380" style="s2">oh no we this is a really bad time this</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.760" end="00:45:13.260" style="s2">is election year I don&#39;t want to think</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.380" end="00:45:15.990" style="s2">about a pandemic that it&#39;ll you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.260" end="00:45:19.350" style="s2">hurt the economy I&#39;m gonna go into</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.990" end="00:45:22.100" style="s2">denial mode and delay any decisive</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.350" end="00:45:26.130" style="s2">response I don&#39;t want to panic people I</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.100" end="00:45:29.130" style="s2">don&#39;t want to create widespread anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.130" end="00:45:32.510" style="s2">and concern and that&#39;s what we actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.130" end="00:45:35.850" style="s2">did see for a couple of weeks was</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.510" end="00:45:38.700" style="s2">denialism by the US and UK and and many</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.850" end="00:45:41.420" style="s2">European governments until the point</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.700" end="00:45:41.420" style="s2">where they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.450" end="00:45:46.160" style="s2">sweep it under the rug anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.339" end="00:45:48.950" style="s2">they&#39;re just too many confirmed cases in</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.160" end="00:45:50.810" style="s2">too many countries and then we saw the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.950" end="00:45:55.190" style="s2">sudden pivot into sort of taking it</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.810" end="00:45:57.050" style="s2">seriously for a while and shutdowns and</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.190" end="00:46:00.050" style="s2">shelter and plays since and if you lock</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.050" end="00:46:02.869" style="s2">downs and people kind of watched the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.050" end="00:46:05.240" style="s2">exponential rise but then in the last</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.869" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">week now we&#39;ve gotten to push back</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.240" end="00:46:10.430" style="s2">oh no the economy&#39;s tanking unemployment</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:12.820" style="s2">will spike global recession issues what</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.430" end="00:46:16.310" style="s2">are the trade offs of lives versus jobs</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.820" end="00:46:19.099" style="s2">so we had a sort of sweet spot for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.310" end="00:46:20.980" style="s2">couple weeks where everybody globally</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.099" end="00:46:23.420" style="s2">was taking the pandemic very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.980" end="00:46:28.849" style="s2">but now we&#39;re back into a kind of denial</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.420" end="00:46:30.619" style="s2">ISM that says oh we can&#39;t admit that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.849" end="00:46:33.829" style="s2">this pandemic could actually be</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.619" end="00:46:36.970" style="s2">massively economically inconvenient for</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.829" end="00:46:40.940" style="s2">at least a number of months or years</p>

<p begin="00:48:50.869" end="00:48:55.219" style="s2">states changing their behavior at all</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.029" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t that right I mean if anything</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.219" end="00:49:02.869" style="s2">things are continuing to get locked down</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:49:04.940" style="s2">even tighter yeah and I well another</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.869" end="00:49:07.700" style="s2">little piece of backstory about this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.940" end="00:49:09.319" style="s2">I was one of the few people in my local</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.700" end="00:49:11.539" style="s2">psychology department to take this</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.319" end="00:49:13.299" style="s2">pandemic seriously and to say you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.539" end="00:49:16.130" style="s2">we should actually start canceling</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.299" end="00:49:17.930" style="s2">faculty meetings and cloak Weah and we</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.130" end="00:49:21.019" style="s2">might actually have to cancel in-person</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.930" end="00:49:23.029" style="s2">classes and four weeks ago my colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.019" end="00:49:24.529" style="s2">generally thought I was insane and like</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.029" end="00:49:27.229" style="s2">Miller has gone off the deep end what</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.529" end="00:49:29.930" style="s2">the and then of course within again</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.229" end="00:49:31.700" style="s2">literally a week the president of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.930" end="00:49:33.499" style="s2">university is saying okay we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.700" end="00:49:35.779" style="s2">extend spring break by two weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.499" end="00:49:38.630" style="s2">then quickly okay we&#39;re not gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.779" end="00:49:43.880" style="s2">any more in-person classes till August</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.630" end="00:49:46.099" style="s2">at the earliest so but it helped a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.880" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">that I had a local colleague in my</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.099" end="00:49:50.630" style="s2">department who was from northern Italy</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:53.749" style="s2">and who had two siblings who worked in</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.630" end="00:49:56.239" style="s2">northern Italian hospitals and he was</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.749" end="00:49:58.670" style="s2">getting direct reports from his sibs</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.239" end="00:50:00.319" style="s2">about the conditions in northern Italy</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.670" end="00:50:04.339" style="s2">and what the pandemic was doing there</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.319" end="00:50:07.069" style="s2">and it was gruesome and alarming and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.339" end="00:50:09.380" style="s2">horrifying and that helps me kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.069" end="00:50:12.380" style="s2">take it seriously oh it&#39;s not just Wuhan</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.380" end="00:50:15.109" style="s2">it this thing is gonna go everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.380" end="00:50:18.710" style="s2">it might have that effect pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.109" end="00:50:20.479" style="s2">in America yeah well as it started</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.710" end="00:50:23.509" style="s2">happening I remember they closed my my</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.479" end="00:50:25.460" style="s2">kids school for one day big cliff they</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.509" end="00:50:26.930" style="s2">first closed it for one day and I told</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.460" end="00:50:28.339" style="s2">everybody look they&#39;re only closing it</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.930" end="00:50:31.549" style="s2">for one day so they can plan how to</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.339" end="00:50:32.930" style="s2">close it for the rest of the year and</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.549" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve been warning people that every</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.930" end="00:50:36.079" style="s2">school system that saw that they were</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:37.519" style="s2">gonna close for a week will come out</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.079" end="00:50:38.749" style="s2">later and by the end of the week and say</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.519" end="00:50:39.650" style="s2">they&#39;re closed for three weeks and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.749" end="00:50:40.670" style="s2">after that they&#39;ll say they&#39;re closed</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.650" end="00:50:42.140" style="s2">for the end the year and we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.670" end="00:50:43.849" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to really see that so to</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.140" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">the extent that Trump is cheerleading or</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.849" end="00:50:47.150" style="s2">giving people a little bit of hope or at</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.200" end="00:50:50.479" style="s2">least at least letting on that he</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.150" end="00:50:54.200" style="s2">understands course he understands that</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.479" end="00:50:56.599" style="s2">the economic fallout from basically what</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.200" end="00:50:58.819" style="s2">would constitute a depression really I</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.599" end="00:51:00.589" style="s2">mean if the if the unemployment numbers</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.819" end="00:51:02.869" style="s2">get to where they&#39;re being projected and</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.589" end="00:51:05.719" style="s2">if it GDP goes down by twenty or thirty</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.869" end="00:51:08.059" style="s2">percent or something that&#39;s juts</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.719" end="00:51:09.979" style="s2">depression this is this is a once in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.059" end="00:51:14.019" style="s2">hundred year event basically</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.979" end="00:51:17.210" style="s2">economically for us I mean 2008 2001</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.019" end="00:51:19.479" style="s2">1981 these were issues these were</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.210" end="00:51:23.390" style="s2">serious issues but this one seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.479" end="00:51:29.210" style="s2">even more powerful so how do we how do</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.390" end="00:51:31.249" style="s2">we go how do we go from from here into</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.210" end="00:51:32.869" style="s2">the future a little bit and I know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.249" end="00:51:34.579" style="s2">getting off track a smidge but I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.869" end="00:51:37.910" style="s2">just fascinated by what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.579" end="00:51:39.380" style="s2">that trade-offs are like how much I wish</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.910" end="00:51:42.410" style="s2">somebody could just give me a percentage</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.380" end="00:51:44.660" style="s2">point of GDP per life saved okay and</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.410" end="00:51:46.400" style="s2">then how many lives we thought we were</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.660" end="00:51:47.869" style="s2">going to lose and how much that would</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:49.549" style="s2">cost us and then just show me the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.869" end="00:51:50.630" style="s2">freaking the spreadsheet is there a</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.549" end="00:51:52.059" style="s2">spreadsheet Jeffrey have you seen</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.630" end="00:51:55.239" style="s2">anybody with a spreadsheet like this</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.059" end="00:51:57.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen a few people do like partial</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.239" end="00:51:59.119" style="s2">spreadsheets but almost nobody is enough</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.710" end="00:52:01.400" style="s2">of the generalist and knows enough</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.119" end="00:52:03.859" style="s2">different areas to really do a</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.400" end="00:52:08.660" style="s2">comprehensive kind of cost-benefit risk</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.859" end="00:52:10.130" style="s2">analysis of different policies which</p>

<p begin="00:52:12.200" end="00:52:17.400" style="s2">costs and there&#39;s so many unknowns still</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.930" end="00:52:18.990" style="s2">we still don&#39;t know if you get</p>

<p begin="00:52:31.800" end="00:52:38.060" style="s2">yeah and we also honestly don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.430" end="00:52:41.360" style="s2">resilient the economy is at this point</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.060" end="00:52:43.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve never had an economy that is this</p>

<p begin="00:52:59.220" end="00:53:05.340" style="s2">in America so I think you know if you</p>

<p begin="00:53:30.990" end="00:53:36.210" style="s2">expert in but III think at least a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.620" end="00:53:40.440" style="s2">of working-class people are going to</p>

<p begin="00:53:44.130" end="00:53:48.410" style="s2">like restaurants and stores a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:53:48.410" end="00:53:56.340" style="s2">they won&#39;t be easy to restart there will</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.960" end="00:53:58.680" style="s2">be mass unemployment and what jobs will</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.340" end="00:54:01.200" style="s2">those people go back to I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.680" end="00:54:03.990" style="s2">there is a political will to try to</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.200" end="00:54:05.910" style="s2">restore American manufacturing as Trump</p>

<p begin="00:54:07.860" end="00:54:13.440" style="s2">unfortunately that is something even in</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.040" end="00:54:16.100" style="s2">all these instances they always try to</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.440" end="00:54:18.480" style="s2">say we have shovel-ready projects</p>

<p begin="00:54:27.069" end="00:54:31.180" style="s2">impact on this it&#39;s gonna be months down</p>

<p begin="00:55:48.910" end="00:55:56.170" style="s2">of manufacturing and then square all of</p>

<p begin="00:56:05.559" end="00:56:10.180" style="s2">a whole number of weird things kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.150" end="00:56:12.339" style="s2">all coming together we have to think</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.180" end="00:56:14.979" style="s2">more collectively but this is this</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.339" end="00:56:18.160" style="s2">country is built on a completely</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.979" end="00:56:20.229" style="s2">different ethos isn&#39;t it well I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.160" end="00:56:23.799" style="s2">any evolutionary biologist who</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.229" end="00:56:25.869" style="s2">understands you know how organisms and</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.799" end="00:56:28.420" style="s2">adaptations evolve is familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.869" end="00:56:31.269" style="s2">concept of damage limitation and</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.420" end="00:56:33.759" style="s2">hierarchical structuring so you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.269" end="00:56:37.180" style="s2">cells have cell membranes around them</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.759" end="00:56:38.789" style="s2">and organs have tissues that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.180" end="00:56:41.339" style="s2">containerized them and</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.789" end="00:56:44.699" style="s2">organisms themselves have skins and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.339" end="00:56:47.660" style="s2">immune systems that create a separation</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.699" end="00:56:50.789" style="s2">between what&#39;s inside and what&#39;s outside</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.660" end="00:56:52.289" style="s2">and then you have tribal you know human</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.789" end="00:56:55.199" style="s2">tribes for hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.289" end="00:56:58.109" style="s2">years where it was very clear who was in</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.199" end="00:56:59.729" style="s2">the tribe in terms of physical</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.109" end="00:57:01.859" style="s2">appearance and ornamentation and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.729" end="00:57:04.919" style="s2">languages and dialects and who&#39;s outside</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.859" end="00:57:07.890" style="s2">the tribe and that is a very resilient</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.919" end="00:57:11.789" style="s2">system because if there&#39;s one cell or</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.890" end="00:57:14.519" style="s2">organ or organism that&#39;s damaged you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.789" end="00:57:17.489" style="s2">kind of easily distance from it and you</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.519" end="00:57:19.650" style="s2">can contain the damage and all the way</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.489" end="00:57:21.779" style="s2">from you know an organism fighting</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.650" end="00:57:24.689" style="s2">internal cancer to a tribe expelling</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.779" end="00:57:27.630" style="s2">Psychopaths you have to have boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.689" end="00:57:32.400" style="s2">and borders and this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.630" end="00:57:35.130" style="s2">hierarchically structured complexity now</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.400" end="00:57:37.799" style="s2">runaway globalization sounded great</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.130" end="00:57:40.380" style="s2">short term like let&#39;s have international</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.799" end="00:57:42.390" style="s2">flights that mix everybody together</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.380" end="00:57:44.400" style="s2">let&#39;s have massive international tourism</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.390" end="00:57:47.569" style="s2">let&#39;s have global supply chains let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.400" end="00:57:50.189" style="s2">have you know global financial markets</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.569" end="00:57:52.409" style="s2">that can be extremely efficient in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.189" end="00:57:55.949" style="s2">short term but it is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.409" end="00:57:59.400" style="s2">vulnerable long term and I think people</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.949" end="00:58:00.809" style="s2">are finally realizing yeah we need</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.400" end="00:58:04.919" style="s2">boundaries and borders and immune</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.809" end="00:58:11.849" style="s2">systems because otherwise you know you</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.919" end="00:58:15.239" style="s2">are vulnerable to any any local damage</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.849" end="00:58:18.199" style="s2">or you know virus or or cancer kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.239" end="00:58:18.199" style="s2">spreading unchecked</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.940" end="00:58:21.880" style="s2">this is gonna take a different</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.109" end="00:58:23.260" style="s2">perspective than we&#39;ve had collectively</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.880" end="00:58:24.790" style="s2">and it&#39;s definitely going to take</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.260" end="00:58:27.730" style="s2">challenging what the elites have been</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.790" end="00:58:32.349" style="s2">telling us for 30 years I do remember</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.730" end="00:58:34.450" style="s2">quite vividly being a economic student</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.349" end="00:58:36.819" style="s2">at George Mason&#39;s very libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.450" end="00:58:39.190" style="s2">economics school in the late 90s at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.819" end="00:58:41.770" style="s2">same time that the World Trade</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.190" end="00:58:45.280" style="s2">Organization had its meetings in Seattle</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.770" end="00:58:48.940" style="s2">and there was massive protests and I can</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.280" end="00:58:50.710" style="s2">I will never forget how convinced I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.940" end="00:58:53.470" style="s2">at the time 20 whatever years old</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.710" end="00:58:56.619" style="s2">listening to Brian Caplan and others</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.470" end="00:58:59.079" style="s2">back then he was just an adjunct telling</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.619" end="00:59:01.890" style="s2">us you know that globalization and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.079" end="00:59:04.869" style="s2">totally open neoliberal policies were</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.890" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">you know going to be net a higher</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.869" end="00:59:08.760" style="s2">benefit for everybody involved no matter</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:12.730" style="s2">what like it was some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.760" end="00:59:15.730" style="s2">rule from God and then sort of chuckling</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.730" end="00:59:17.589" style="s2">and laughing at the the the counter</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.730" end="00:59:19.990" style="s2">arguments that were put up by the</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.589" end="00:59:21.880" style="s2">protestors many of whom black bloc and</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.990" end="00:59:24.609" style="s2">tief oh by the way which strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.880" end="00:59:27.520" style="s2">super ironic at this point or weird or</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.609" end="00:59:28.720" style="s2">whatever and that they in they were</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.520" end="00:59:32.440" style="s2">saying that there was gonna be a race to</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.720" end="00:59:34.450" style="s2">the bottom and and and the guys from</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.440" end="00:59:37.569" style="s2">George Mason just dismissed that first</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.450" end="00:59:40.060" style="s2">of all and now it turns out that they</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.569" end="00:59:41.650" style="s2">were actually right in a lot of ways one</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.060" end="00:59:43.839" style="s2">of which which I don&#39;t want to get into</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.650" end="00:59:45.460" style="s2">it&#39;s climate change right like we</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.839" end="00:59:46.810" style="s2">basically just exported all this</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.460" end="00:59:48.339" style="s2">manufacturing to a place that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.810" end="00:59:51.700" style="s2">give a about the environment made</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.339" end="00:59:53.260" style="s2">it global warming worse and then also a</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.700" end="00:59:56.430" style="s2">race to the bottom in terms of wages</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.260" end="01:00:00.880" style="s2">waist race to the bottom in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.430" end="01:00:02.800" style="s2">sort of exporting our manufacturing and</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.880" end="01:00:06.280" style="s2">and just changing the whole face of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.800" end="01:00:08.440" style="s2">country and it strikes me as that moment</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.280" end="01:00:11.200" style="s2">seems suppression back then now thirty</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.440" end="01:00:14.380" style="s2">years later had we only listened to</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.200" end="01:00:15.430" style="s2">those crazy Black Bloc protestors and</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.380" end="01:00:16.990" style="s2">the voices of everyone</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.430" end="01:00:19.599" style="s2">maybe we&#39;re not here so what is it going</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.990" end="01:00:20.650" style="s2">to take for us to collectively are we</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.599" end="01:00:22.569" style="s2">gonna be able to capitalize on this</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.650" end="01:00:24.190" style="s2">moment of free what is it gonna take for</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.569" end="01:00:25.599" style="s2">us to collectively begin to understand</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.190" end="01:00:28.450" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about boundaries</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.599" end="01:00:30.250" style="s2">borders immune systems and it applies to</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.450" end="01:00:30.970" style="s2">all of our networks in all of our</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.250" end="01:00:32.890" style="s2">systems with</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.970" end="01:00:35.670" style="s2">their social systems your computer</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.890" end="01:00:38.440" style="s2">network systems your economic system</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.670" end="01:00:41.680" style="s2">when are we going to tune back into</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.440" end="01:00:44.860" style="s2">biology and understand that this is how</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.680" end="01:00:47.860" style="s2">how we work I think my big worry now is</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.860" end="01:00:49.960" style="s2">that people will say ok there&#39;s a global</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.860" end="01:00:53.250" style="s2">pandemic there&#39;s a global recession</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.960" end="01:00:55.720" style="s2">therefore we need global solutions</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.250" end="01:00:58.150" style="s2">basically we need you know the United</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.720" end="01:01:00.190" style="s2">Nations not more power and individual</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.150" end="01:01:02.680" style="s2">nations to have less power because</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.190" end="01:01:06.190" style="s2">global coordination is the only way to</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.680" end="01:01:08.860" style="s2">solve this I sympathize with that and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.190" end="01:01:11.080" style="s2">think for certain kinds of problems we</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.860" end="01:01:15.370" style="s2">do need better mechanisms to do global</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.080" end="01:01:18.610" style="s2">coordination and trade information and</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.370" end="01:01:21.700" style="s2">and sort of figure out what are the best</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.610" end="01:01:24.250" style="s2">practices and if we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.700" end="01:01:27.190" style="s2">these issues but I think that would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.250" end="01:01:29.350" style="s2">the wrong lesson mostly to take away</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.190" end="01:01:31.990" style="s2">from this I think the right lesson would</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.350" end="01:01:35.730" style="s2">be countries need to have a much larger</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.990" end="01:01:38.080" style="s2">degree of autonomy and the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.730" end="01:01:42.070" style="s2">strategically disengage from each other</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.080" end="01:01:44.890" style="s2">then they then they currently do and if</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.070" end="01:01:47.830" style="s2">that means you know the global economy</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.890" end="01:01:50.830" style="s2">is 10 or 20 percent less efficient by</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.830" end="01:01:52.840" style="s2">certain metrics in the short term so be</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.830" end="01:01:55.990" style="s2">it I would rather see humans still</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.840" end="01:01:58.180" style="s2">surviving in a thousand years even if it</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.990" end="01:02:02.260" style="s2">takes a little bit longer to get to a</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.180" end="01:02:05.260" style="s2">state of of universal prosperity than to</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.260" end="01:02:07.330" style="s2">have a sort of constant set of global</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.260" end="01:02:12.150" style="s2">catastrophic risks hanging over our</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.330" end="01:02:15.160" style="s2">heads just because we think globalism is</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.150" end="01:02:16.810" style="s2">kind of more efficient irrational</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.160" end="01:02:18.790" style="s2">according to a certain set of George</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.810" end="01:02:22.770" style="s2">Mason or University of Chicago</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.790" end="01:02:25.330" style="s2">economists yeah when you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.770" end="01:02:27.190" style="s2">global solutions and you said the phrase</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.330" end="01:02:30.130" style="s2">United Nations I laughed you know why</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.190" end="01:02:32.290" style="s2">because literally the first person I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.130" end="01:02:35.710" style="s2">said I&#39;ve heard mentioned the phrase</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.290" end="01:02:37.600" style="s2">United Nations in this whole thing I</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.710" end="01:02:38.920" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard anybody say United Nations</p>

<p begin="01:05:34.130" end="01:05:40.680" style="s2">is trivial garbage compared to an actual</p>

<p begin="01:05:40.680" end="01:05:45.300" style="s2">get little examples of like Vox or Vice</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.020" end="01:05:47.550" style="s2">coming up with kind of like this is our</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.300" end="01:05:49.410" style="s2">woke take on the pandemic and it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.550" end="01:05:51.510" style="s2">side effects are like it&#39;s especially</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.410" end="01:05:54.780" style="s2">bad for this minority or it&#39;s especially</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.510" end="01:05:56.430" style="s2">bad for women or blah blah blah but as</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.780" end="01:05:58.320" style="s2">far as I can tell nobody takes that</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.430" end="01:05:59.849" style="s2">seriously and the journalists who write</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.320" end="01:06:02.190" style="s2">that stuff end up being pretty</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.849" end="01:06:05.310" style="s2">embarrassed by it mm-hmm so I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.190" end="01:06:08.580" style="s2">we&#39;ve had a national reprioritization of</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.310" end="01:06:11.280" style="s2">issues and people are realizing now oh</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.580" end="01:06:14.070" style="s2">my gosh a lot of what we were doing six</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.280" end="01:06:16.890" style="s2">months ago was just dumb dumb virtue</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.070" end="01:06:20.310" style="s2">signaling if I can throw that phrase</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.890" end="01:06:25.130" style="s2">into the mix so that&#39;s heartening that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:06:39.869" end="01:06:45.869" style="s2">typical woke tactics of like oh chrono</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.170" end="01:06:48.270" style="s2">virus is a threat to us well let&#39;s write</p>

<p begin="01:07:03.330" end="01:07:07.950" style="s2">think at that point we&#39;ll have so many</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.210" end="01:07:09.900" style="s2">real-world economic issues and</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.950" end="01:07:13.410" style="s2">geopolitical issues to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.900" end="01:07:16.710" style="s2">that I think this might actually be the</p>

<p begin="01:07:16.710" end="01:07:24.000" style="s2">kind of runaway social justice well that</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.660" end="01:07:27.089" style="s2">would be optimistic that&#39;s an optimistic</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.000" end="01:07:31.380" style="s2">take sir I don&#39;t necessarily agree with</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.089" end="01:07:34.950" style="s2">that I think I see the deep-rooted</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.380" end="01:07:37.319" style="s2">philosophies are are so pervasive in</p>

<p begin="01:07:44.130" end="01:07:51.660" style="s2">those those views and I do think that</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.349" end="01:07:54.450" style="s2">there is a certain sort of just a deep</p>

<p begin="01:08:23.040" end="01:08:28.049" style="s2">completely don&#39;t see any connection</p>

<p begin="01:08:41.819" end="01:08:46.049" style="s2">nationalist society that was able to</p>

<p begin="01:08:46.049" end="01:08:49.549" style="s2">gonna say to all of that so I</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.609" end="01:08:52.290" style="s2">still think that there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.549" end="01:08:54.750" style="s2">competition there because people just</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.290" end="01:08:57.390" style="s2">can&#39;t shake it and I also do think that</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.750" end="01:08:59.370" style="s2">it led us partially to this point of a</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.390" end="01:09:03.630" style="s2">lack of preparedness or at least to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.370" end="01:09:06.540" style="s2">point of where we had 100% positive</p>

<p begin="01:09:06.540" end="01:09:12.449" style="s2">of boundaries a lack of borders a lack</p>

<p begin="01:09:12.449" end="01:09:17.069" style="s2">know but I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.600" end="01:09:20.370" style="s2">going to continue on and I think that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.069" end="01:09:21.670" style="s2">can also squarely lay blame to some of</p>

<p begin="01:09:21.670" end="01:09:27.590" style="s2">circumstances on that but I will take</p>

<p begin="01:16:17.940" end="01:16:23.080" style="s2">what I wanted to stop we emphasize the</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.830" end="01:16:25.210" style="s2">power of these intelligence networks and</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.080" end="01:16:28.990" style="s2">your network because we have a common</p>

<p begin="01:16:28.990" end="01:16:34.240" style="s2">sent out that memo to him and we can try</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.450" end="01:16:37.150" style="s2">not to use States or stuff but you sent</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.240" end="01:16:38.680" style="s2">out the memo to him and not only was he</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.150" end="01:16:41.440" style="s2">able to help his family but he took</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.680" end="01:16:43.480" style="s2">action that had pretty widespread right</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.440" end="01:16:44.980" style="s2">spread impact so if we want to talk</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.480" end="01:16:47.380" style="s2">about that vaguely and just talk about</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.980" end="01:16:49.570" style="s2">any other sort of reactions that people</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.380" end="01:16:51.460" style="s2">in your network had then we can start to</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.570" end="01:16:53.020" style="s2">talk about sort of the follow-on</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.460" end="01:16:54.760" style="s2">exponential effect of just being</p>

<p begin="01:16:54.760" end="01:17:00.010" style="s2">data dissemination yeah so this was a</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.580" end="01:17:03.280" style="s2">case where somebody was in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.010" end="01:17:07.810" style="s2">industry that could take sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.280" end="01:17:09.460" style="s2">proactive steps to do its thing better</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.810" end="01:17:11.530" style="s2">in this case it was mental health care</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.460" end="01:17:13.450" style="s2">and where they were able to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.530" end="01:17:15.370" style="s2">pivot from in-person meetings to more</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.450" end="01:17:17.920" style="s2">telemedicine and people being able to</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.370" end="01:17:20.730" style="s2">call their psychiatrists or clinical</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.920" end="01:17:23.200" style="s2">psychologists more effectively because</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.730" end="01:17:25.780" style="s2">this first one was able to anticipate oh</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.200" end="01:17:27.760" style="s2">my God if this pandemic really becomes</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.780" end="01:17:29.320" style="s2">an issue people aren&#39;t going to be able</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.760" end="01:17:31.840" style="s2">to go into their mental health care</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.320" end="01:17:33.340" style="s2">center or their you know drug treatment</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.840" end="01:17:38.020" style="s2">center or their homeless shelter or</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.340" end="01:17:41.020" style="s2">whatever then what so even if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.020" end="01:17:43.150" style="s2">personally influence you know the global</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.020" end="01:17:45.810" style="s2">outcome of the pandemic or the national</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.150" end="01:17:49.930" style="s2">policy level there&#39;s still a huge amount</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.810" end="01:17:54.100" style="s2">that smart professionals can do to kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.930" end="01:17:55.840" style="s2">of create more resilience within their</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.100" end="01:18:01.360" style="s2">own industry or within their own</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.840" end="01:18:04.960" style="s2">extended families or even to just kind</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.360" end="01:18:09.550" style="s2">of game out okay what what happens if we</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.960" end="01:18:10.900" style="s2">face a recession and you know I found it</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.550" end="01:18:12.790" style="s2">interesting that</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.900" end="01:18:15.310" style="s2">for example the evolutionary biology and</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.790" end="01:18:17.350" style="s2">evolutionary psychology conferences the</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.310" end="01:18:21.429" style="s2">the scientific societies were fairly</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.350" end="01:18:23.230" style="s2">early to understand Oh pandemic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.429" end="01:18:26.290" style="s2">gonna hit everywhere we should cancel</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.230" end="01:18:29.020" style="s2">our conferences early earlier rather</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.290" end="01:18:31.750" style="s2">than later we should try to you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.020" end="01:18:34.840" style="s2">encourage people not to fly around the</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.750" end="01:18:35.770" style="s2">country giving cloak wheel and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.840" end="01:18:40.860" style="s2">gonna have to learn how to collaborate</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.770" end="01:18:43.570" style="s2">online so I think what we saw there was</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.860" end="01:18:46.719" style="s2">people taking decisive action themselves</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.570" end="01:18:50.080" style="s2">in their little networks and having the</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.719" end="01:18:52.090" style="s2">influence that they can have at the</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.080" end="01:18:54.580" style="s2">level that&#39;s that&#39;s effective</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.090" end="01:18:56.290" style="s2">inappropriate yeah and that an army</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.580" end="01:18:58.300" style="s2">girlfriend not only did he was he able</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.290" end="01:19:00.370" style="s2">to influence his own practice but he got</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.300" end="01:19:03.580" style="s2">information to state-level actors state</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.370" end="01:19:05.290" style="s2">was able to take actions the the ripple</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.580" end="01:19:07.060" style="s2">effect of timely and well curated</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.290" end="01:19:09.010" style="s2">information is very powerful within the</p>

<p begin="01:20:54.070" end="01:20:59.380" style="s2">actually and we have been just working</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.520" end="01:21:01.510" style="s2">constantly to give updates to our</p>

<p begin="01:21:07.750" end="01:21:12.040" style="s2">we&#39;re the network is powerful and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.390" end="01:21:14.950" style="s2">there are people like yourself or in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.040" end="01:21:16.420" style="s2">sort of greater network who have been</p>

<p begin="01:21:16.420" end="01:21:21.430" style="s2">information as well and all this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.980" end="01:21:23.200" style="s2">works together so we as a group can have</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.430" end="01:21:26.500" style="s2">greater sense making and discernment</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.200" end="01:21:29.010" style="s2">better than the government better than</p>

<p begin="01:21:31.990" end="01:21:36.850" style="s2">cognitive abilities is fascinating to me</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.990" end="01:21:39.700" style="s2">but I want to just take a quick turn</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.850" end="01:21:42.250" style="s2">here Jeffrey how do you prepare yourself</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.700" end="01:21:44.590" style="s2">personally though right like there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.250" end="01:21:47.860" style="s2">this information there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.590" end="01:21:52.480" style="s2">networks but if you&#39;re if your body if</p>

<p begin="01:21:55.810" end="01:22:01.180" style="s2">not gonna be able to pick up on these</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.940" end="01:22:03.370" style="s2">signals so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.180" end="01:22:04.540" style="s2">the macro macro stuff then there&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.370" end="01:22:05.770" style="s2">we do on the network level then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.540" end="01:22:08.290" style="s2">what we have to do on the individual</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.770" end="01:22:10.720" style="s2">level and you know what is what is your</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.290" end="01:22:12.670" style="s2">take on that what do you do to tune your</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.720" end="01:22:16.780" style="s2">instruments so that you can tap into and</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.670" end="01:22:18.790" style="s2">identify and be able to discern with</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.780" end="01:22:21.790" style="s2">some integrity and to make choice and</p>

<p begin="01:22:26.810" end="01:22:31.640" style="s2">well you know I did this book mate a few</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.180" end="01:22:33.260" style="s2">years ago with Tucker Max and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.640" end="01:22:36.080" style="s2">sort of a self-improvement guide</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.260" end="01:22:38.510" style="s2">disguised as dating advice for young</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.080" end="01:22:40.610" style="s2">single guys but we focus a lot and there</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.510" end="01:22:43.550" style="s2">on how do you level up your physical</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.610" end="01:22:46.990" style="s2">health your mental health your world</p>

<p begin="01:22:46.990" end="01:22:53.750" style="s2">that kind of advice I think is always</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.200" end="01:22:55.520" style="s2">good but in particular it builds in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.750" end="01:22:59.660" style="s2">lot of resilience for dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.520" end="01:23:01.160" style="s2">crises so we know coronavirus is much</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.660" end="01:23:03.290" style="s2">much more dangerous if you have</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.160" end="01:23:06.020" style="s2">pre-existing medical conditions to some</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.290" end="01:23:09.530" style="s2">degree that&#39;s a code word for obesity</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.020" end="01:23:11.330" style="s2">diabetes metabolic syndrome all that</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.530" end="01:23:15.650" style="s2">stuff that comes from not being in shape</p>

<p begin="01:23:15.650" end="01:23:21.200" style="s2">you know all the stuff that everybody in</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.280" end="01:23:25.010" style="s2">the manosphere and the paleo movement</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.200" end="01:23:27.890" style="s2">you know knows to do so I think looking</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.010" end="01:23:30.500" style="s2">after your physical health normally</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.890" end="01:23:34.100" style="s2">people think oh yeah that&#39;s good cuz</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.500" end="01:23:36.230" style="s2">like I&#39;m a little bit sexier and you</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.100" end="01:23:38.630" style="s2">know I&#39;ll live a few years longer and</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.230" end="01:23:40.400" style="s2">then something like this hits and you go</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.630" end="01:23:43.370" style="s2">oh my god this is actually a matter of</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.400" end="01:23:46.690" style="s2">life or death but particularly for</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.370" end="01:23:49.120" style="s2">anybody&#39;s sort of over you know 30 or 40</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.690" end="01:23:51.470" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing I think build</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.120" end="01:23:55.100" style="s2">physical and mental resilience into your</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.470" end="01:23:56.600" style="s2">life the second thing is for example my</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.100" end="01:23:58.280" style="s2">whole extended family has really come</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.600" end="01:24:00.410" style="s2">together and we have regular kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.280" end="01:24:02.960" style="s2">zoom calls with each other and we</p>

<p begin="01:29:41.610" end="01:29:45.900" style="s2">afterwards so I think at the personal</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.220" end="01:29:48.239" style="s2">level a lot of people are confronting</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.900" end="01:29:52.010" style="s2">this oh I&#39;m at home all day what do</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.239" end="01:29:54.570" style="s2">I do with my time and some people are</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.010" end="01:29:56.580" style="s2">deliberately cultivating better habits</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.570" end="01:29:59.220" style="s2">and trying to figure out how do I often</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.580" end="01:30:02.190" style="s2">integrate my work life my family life my</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.220" end="01:30:05.010" style="s2">personal growth you know how can I treat</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.190" end="01:30:07.380" style="s2">this as a sabbatical rather than a</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.010" end="01:30:10.230" style="s2">staycation how can I read good books</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.380" end="01:30:12.840" style="s2">instead of watching trashy TV how can i</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.230" end="01:30:14.400" style="s2">watch you know good deliberately chosen</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.840" end="01:30:15.930" style="s2">movies like we had movie night last</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.400" end="01:30:18.090" style="s2">night and we watched Hitchcock&#39;s rear</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.930" end="01:30:20.160" style="s2">window the all four housemates and</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.090" end="01:30:22.980" style="s2">talked about it afterwards and watched</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.160" end="01:30:24.600" style="s2">YouTube videos analyzing it like I think</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.980" end="01:30:26.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of habit you need to</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.600" end="01:30:30.420" style="s2">cultivate rather than just you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.960" end="01:30:33.810" style="s2">watching random clips from reality TV on</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.420" end="01:30:36.080" style="s2">on YouTube oh but all the way up to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.810" end="01:30:40.410" style="s2">kind of the national and global level</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.080" end="01:30:43.170" style="s2">one thing I would love to see is you</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.410" end="01:30:46.170" style="s2">know within China they actually do quite</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.170" end="01:30:48.510" style="s2">a bit of kind of compare and contrast</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.170" end="01:30:51.150" style="s2">kind of a be split testing between</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.510" end="01:30:53.430" style="s2">provinces like at the moment they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.150" end="01:30:55.980" style="s2">doing a serious comparison of which</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.430" end="01:30:58.140" style="s2">cities did well at controlling the</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.980" end="01:31:01.230" style="s2">pandemic what exactly did they do what</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.140" end="01:31:03.390" style="s2">lessons learned you know can can we</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.230" end="01:31:06.330" style="s2">develop so we can roll them out next</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.390" end="01:31:08.220" style="s2">time at the national level I think at</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.330" end="01:31:11.790" style="s2">the global level we&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.220" end="01:31:14.370" style="s2">look around and ask which countries had</p>

<p begin="01:31:56.810" end="01:32:01.880" style="s2">America and what are our strengths I</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.170" end="01:32:03.350" style="s2">think this sort of intelligence network</p>

<p begin="01:32:17.600" end="01:32:22.760" style="s2">that is actually harder to do in certain</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.610" end="01:32:24.850" style="s2">kinds of authoritarian cultures so I</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.760" end="01:32:28.460" style="s2">hope that there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.850" end="01:32:31.100" style="s2">cross-fertilization of good ideas and</p>

<p begin="01:33:22.760" end="01:33:28.909" style="s2">have that big an immediate effect but I</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.780" end="01:33:29.240" style="s2">think a lot of students now are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.909" end="01:33:30.950" style="s2">reef</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.240" end="01:33:34.130" style="s2">thinking what are the pros and cons of</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.950" end="01:33:38.890" style="s2">live in-person classes what is their</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.130" end="01:33:41.660" style="s2">real function if it&#39;s this easy to take</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.890" end="01:33:44.060" style="s2">in-person classes online which it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.660" end="01:33:45.860" style="s2">actually every professor I know is</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.060" end="01:33:47.750" style="s2">absolutely panicked and spending a huge</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.860" end="01:33:50.180" style="s2">amount of time trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.750" end="01:33:52.540" style="s2">the do I teach online effectively</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.180" end="01:33:54.890" style="s2">if you&#39;ve never done it before</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.540" end="01:33:56.990" style="s2">but I think from the student point of</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.890" end="01:33:59.930" style="s2">view they will start asking hard</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.990" end="01:34:01.550" style="s2">questions like well I&#39;ve been closed</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.930" end="01:34:03.980" style="s2">during at home for a few weeks I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.550" end="01:34:06.950" style="s2">actually learning more from watching</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.980" end="01:34:09.680" style="s2">YouTube videos about this topic than I</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.950" end="01:34:11.390" style="s2">was from that Professor you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.680" end="01:34:13.310" style="s2">amazing YouTube channels that are</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.390" end="01:34:16.940" style="s2">sharing really high quality information</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.310" end="01:34:19.550" style="s2">presented in very compelling ways much</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.940" end="01:34:22.940" style="s2">better than academics are doing it in</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.550" end="01:34:25.970" style="s2">our classrooms and maybe students will</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.940" end="01:34:27.560" style="s2">start asking hard questions like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.970" end="01:34:30.230" style="s2">the point in university why am I getting</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.560" end="01:34:32.570" style="s2">this credential am I really learning</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.230" end="01:34:36.740" style="s2">anything is it just signaling us Brian</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.570" end="01:34:38.950" style="s2">Kaplan&#39;s argued and I think the</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.740" end="01:34:42.350" style="s2">universities themselves might face</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.950" end="01:34:44.950" style="s2">decreased enrollment a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.350" end="01:34:48.980" style="s2">figuring yeah maybe I should just</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.950" end="01:34:51.650" style="s2">cultivate my career outside the</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.980" end="01:34:56.960" style="s2">university why should I wait till I&#39;m 22</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.650" end="01:35:00.020" style="s2">to develop crucial life skills yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.960" end="01:35:02.780" style="s2">as if the university experience wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.020" end="01:35:07.430" style="s2">already on the ropes it does appear that</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.780" end="01:35:10.670" style="s2">this could be a serious blow the the</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.430" end="01:35:12.500" style="s2">public trends are definitely changing a</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.670" end="01:35:14.720" style="s2">little bit the winds at least are</p>

<p begin="01:36:05.130" end="01:36:08.459" style="s2">gonna be an amazing test case actually</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.479" end="01:36:10.800" style="s2">and a lot of things are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.459" end="01:36:12.659" style="s2">tested it&#39;s going to be interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.800" end="01:36:14.760" style="s2">see what the data shows and how it gets</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.659" end="01:36:17.209" style="s2">incorporated as we both know</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.760" end="01:36:19.979" style="s2">bureaucracies and institutions are and</p>

<p begin="01:36:24.929" end="01:36:29.940" style="s2">happens right away but it could it could</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.459" end="01:36:31.409" style="s2">provide some seeds for alternatives one</p>

<p begin="01:36:31.409" end="01:36:36.959" style="s2">been a positive and I&#39;d like to wrap on</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.300" end="01:36:39.780" style="s2">a positive here is that I&#39;m viewing this</p>

<p begin="01:36:50.760" end="01:36:55.110" style="s2">to make the most of it rather than to</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.709" end="01:36:56.670" style="s2">just endure it and one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.110" end="01:36:58.829" style="s2">we&#39;ve been able to do that is by having</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.670" end="01:37:00.510" style="s2">like a light schedule and it&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.829" end="01:37:03.360" style="s2">know every 15 minutes but like two hour</p>

<p begin="01:38:12.420" end="01:38:14.789" style="s2">think I&#39;m gonna miss it when it&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.530" end="01:38:16.380" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna try to take you the best</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.789" end="01:38:18.479" style="s2">advantage of it as I possibly can</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.380" end="01:38:20.099" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s a good attitude and</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.479" end="01:38:23.309" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do something similar in</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.099" end="01:38:24.689" style="s2">this household I mean most of us on to</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.309" end="01:38:27.209" style="s2">be honest working mostly from home</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.689" end="01:38:30.420" style="s2">anyway so it&#39;s not that big a change but</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.209" end="01:38:33.809" style="s2">I will say I feel much more closely</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.420" end="01:38:36.659" style="s2">connected to my sort of distant family</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.809" end="01:38:39.119" style="s2">members extended family and friends</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.659" end="01:38:41.489" style="s2">because we&#39;ll have time to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.119" end="01:38:44.010" style="s2">coordinate zoom calls and phone calls</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.489" end="01:38:47.219" style="s2">and we&#39;re actually spending the time to</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.010" end="01:38:50.130" style="s2">email each other much more actively</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.219" end="01:38:52.670" style="s2">I think there might actually be a kind</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.130" end="01:38:55.679" style="s2">of national shift away from workaholism</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.670" end="01:38:58.050" style="s2">you know possibly away from the kind of</p>

<p begin="01:38:58.050" end="01:39:01.530" style="s2">reason why a lot of Preppers do</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.400" end="01:39:04.800" style="s2">homeschooling and have very strong</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.530" end="01:39:07.949" style="s2">family values and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.800" end="01:39:10.229" style="s2">people will come out of this particular</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.949" end="01:39:12.079" style="s2">crisis thinking you know what I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.229" end="01:39:15.150" style="s2">want to go back to the way things were</p>

<p begin="01:39:39.130" end="01:39:46.320" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting interesting type</p>

<p begin="01:40:16.240" end="01:40:22.030" style="s2">value of personal connection and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.540" end="01:40:23.740" style="s2">hopeful that there could be a sea change</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.030" end="01:40:27.010" style="s2">but you know let&#39;s keep our fingers</p>

<p begin="01:40:39.460" end="01:40:43.660" style="s2">sudden it starts to snowball into</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.960" end="01:40:45.310" style="s2">something that that is meaningful and if</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.660" end="01:40:48.850" style="s2">we can if we can take the focus away</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.310" end="01:40:50.830" style="s2">from GDP at all costs and workaholism at</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.850" end="01:40:53.260" style="s2">all costs and start to remember about</p>
