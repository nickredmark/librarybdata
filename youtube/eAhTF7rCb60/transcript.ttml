<p begin="00:00:25.800" end="00:00:31.109" style="s2">went to university and graduated because</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.949" end="00:00:33.690" style="s2">part of a DD is kind of waiting for this</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.109" end="00:00:35.160" style="s2">adrenaline to kick in and then being</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.690" end="00:00:37.710" style="s2">able for me anyway and then being able</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.160" end="00:00:41.790" style="s2">to put all this information in my head</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.710" end="00:00:44.100" style="s2">and complex logical systems seem to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.790" end="00:00:47.100" style="s2">stick more easily but I was never able</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.100" end="00:00:49.440" style="s2">to study to sit and actually like force</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.100" end="00:00:51.239" style="s2">information in if it wasn&#39;t already</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:53.280" style="s2">there to be I could I could that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.239" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">true I could memorize things but for</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.280" end="00:00:56.489" style="s2">very short periods of time so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:00:58.469" style="s2">memorized the countries of the world but</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.489" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t stick you know they&#39;d just</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.469" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">be there for the test then I had my</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:07.680" style="s2">brain change which wasn&#39;t a switch it</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">wasn&#39;t one day I was one way in one day</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.680" end="00:01:09.930" style="s2">another way it&#39;s still changing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:11.939" style="s2">ever-changing</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.930" end="00:01:16.430" style="s2">it started happening after my first</p>

<p begin="00:01:16.430" end="00:01:23.640" style="s2">after the radiation it I there&#39;s was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.820" end="00:01:25.560" style="s2">more definite change and so I went from</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.640" end="00:01:28.049" style="s2">being able to put in information from</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:29.939" style="s2">feeling like my job in the world was to</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.049" end="00:01:32.130" style="s2">learn everything so I could save the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.939" end="00:01:33.450" style="s2">world I had to go through a big period</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:35.400" style="s2">of depression because I was no longer</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.450" end="00:01:39.000" style="s2">able to do that I couldn&#39;t learn I</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.400" end="00:01:41.670" style="s2">couldn&#39;t I could take a course not pay</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.000" end="00:01:43.290" style="s2">much attention and ace it before because</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:45.060" style="s2">might not pay much attention was paying</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.290" end="00:01:47.070" style="s2">attention with my EDD was like I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.060" end="00:01:48.750" style="s2">doing like doodlee and her playing card</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.070" end="00:01:50.250" style="s2">games on the computer while everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.750" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">else was listening and I would ace the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.250" end="00:01:55.799" style="s2">test to not be able to use adrenaline</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:01:59.100" style="s2">because it&#39;s poison for people with</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.799" end="00:02:00.600" style="s2">chronic fatigue syndrome and not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:02.670" style="s2">how to put new information in without it</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.600" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">not being able to concentrate on on</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.670" end="00:02:10.849" style="s2">words words would like it just took way</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:13.370" style="s2">too much energy to read and and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.849" end="00:02:15.560" style="s2">autism which both</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.370" end="00:02:18.530" style="s2">my whole life looking back but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.560" end="00:02:20.030" style="s2">difference of my a DD which I&#39;ve known</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.530" end="00:02:21.860" style="s2">I&#39;ve had my whole life and it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.030" end="00:02:24.590" style="s2">my childhood through adolescence</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.860" end="00:02:25.970" style="s2">identity and it didn&#39;t really I figured</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.590" end="00:02:28.519" style="s2">how to work with it so didn&#39;t really get</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.970" end="00:02:31.280" style="s2">in the way versus figuring out I had</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.519" end="00:02:33.860" style="s2">autism at the age of 39 and being like</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.280" end="00:02:35.840" style="s2">oh that&#39;s what all of that was being</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.860" end="00:02:39.980" style="s2">able to look back with retrospect and</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:41.720" style="s2">see that piece of the difference is and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.980" end="00:02:43.370" style="s2">I didn&#39;t mention this in my autism video</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.720" end="00:02:46.640" style="s2">that one of the main reasons I did also</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.370" end="00:02:49.220" style="s2">figure it out autism was that my child</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.640" end="00:02:51.140" style="s2">to me looks very neurodiverse but yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.220" end="00:02:53.390" style="s2">isn&#39;t she actually probably cause a DD</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.140" end="00:02:58.959" style="s2">like everybody else in my family but she</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.390" end="00:03:01.849" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have autism like she is she is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.959" end="00:03:03.859" style="s2">huge extrovert can read people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.849" end="00:03:05.900" style="s2">emotions can like the things she puts</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.859" end="00:03:08.060" style="s2">together I&#39;m like oh so there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.900" end="00:03:12.650" style="s2">something she had that I had that she</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.060" end="00:03:15.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t and as well as these brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.650" end="00:03:17.510" style="s2">changes this neurological thing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.560" end="00:03:21.430" style="s2">happens like I no longer my memory isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.510" end="00:03:23.780" style="s2">as good as it was I can&#39;t recall words I</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.430" end="00:03:25.069" style="s2">counted call people which was always</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.780" end="00:03:27.500" style="s2">kind of a problem there like face</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.069" end="00:03:28.940" style="s2">blindness which i think is a is a common</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.500" end="00:03:30.530" style="s2">trait in you know assist sick people as</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.940" end="00:03:32.629" style="s2">well and I&#39;ve had that my whole life I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.530" end="00:03:34.340" style="s2">would get people confused in my class if</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.629" end="00:03:36.200" style="s2">I have it really a really hard time</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.340" end="00:03:37.430" style="s2">unfortunately with them people that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.200" end="00:03:39.319" style="s2">a different race than me being able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.430" end="00:03:41.239" style="s2">tell them apart and I know that to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.319" end="00:03:44.359" style="s2">society makes you appear racist but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.239" end="00:03:46.519" style="s2">also sorry my brain doesn&#39;t do it its</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.359" end="00:03:49.370" style="s2">facial blindness like I can&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.519" end="00:03:51.139" style="s2">what I can&#39;t control I can apologize for</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.370" end="00:03:54.340" style="s2">it I can try to make amends for it I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.139" end="00:03:57.560" style="s2">explain it but I can&#39;t control it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.340" end="00:04:00.109" style="s2">but I feel like everything that I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.560" end="00:04:02.329" style="s2">it&#39;s part of my story but it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.109" end="00:04:04.970" style="s2">what I was supposed to experience to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.329" end="00:04:06.889" style="s2">what I&#39;m here to do if I had always been</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.970" end="00:04:09.889" style="s2">if it was just a TD and I want ISM and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.889" end="00:04:12.250" style="s2">I&#39;d always been the same way it I&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.889" end="00:04:14.510" style="s2">all of these same prejudices of like</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.250" end="00:04:15.859" style="s2">propping up people that are intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.510" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">like you two could be at elegent what a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.859" end="00:04:19.789" style="s2">horrible trait to not be intelligent now</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:23.419" style="s2">we look at intelligence like I look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.789" end="00:04:26.300" style="s2">looks like yeah life is easier if you if</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.419" end="00:04:26.990" style="s2">you look nice to a point life is easier</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.300" end="00:04:29.240" style="s2">if you&#39;re in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.990" end="00:04:30.860" style="s2">to a point it&#39;s actually I think this</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.240" end="00:04:34.039" style="s2">dislike show the opposite of that but</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.860" end="00:04:36.020" style="s2">like if you&#39;re if you&#39;re the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.039" end="00:04:38.539" style="s2">intelligent then it&#39;s definitely harder</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.020" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">I can&#39;t get a job if your IQ is very low</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.539" end="00:04:42.919" style="s2">it&#39;s very very hard to get a job keep a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:45.889" style="s2">job get relationships keep relationships</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.919" end="00:04:48.349" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve experienced two very</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.889" end="00:04:51.710" style="s2">distinct brains in fact I experienced</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.349" end="00:04:52.940" style="s2">them sometimes in the same day my brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.710" end="00:04:54.919" style="s2">is never gonna go back to where it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.940" end="00:04:56.750" style="s2">where I can I don&#39;t think but I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.919" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">input all this external information and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.750" end="00:05:00.650" style="s2">feel like I can learn physics and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:02.900" style="s2">chemistry and biology and economics and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.650" end="00:05:05.750" style="s2">and geography and world events all to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.900" end="00:05:07.759" style="s2">like save the world but if it hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.750" end="00:05:10.220" style="s2">changed I wouldn&#39;t have had to sit with</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.759" end="00:05:11.569" style="s2">the knowledge I already knew and revamp</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.220" end="00:05:13.610" style="s2">it to figure out how we can create a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.569" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">world that works for everyone if I</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.610" end="00:05:18.319" style="s2">hadn&#39;t had this experience of having</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:21.430" style="s2">both a brilliant mind and then in many</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.319" end="00:05:23.240" style="s2">areas away less than brilliant mind I</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.430" end="00:05:25.639" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have the compassion</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.240" end="00:05:28.849" style="s2">understanding for that right this is not</p>
