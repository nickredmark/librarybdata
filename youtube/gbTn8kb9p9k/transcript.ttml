<p begin="00:14:57.970" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">it&#39;s still adding an almost months of</p>

<p begin="00:15:32.710" end="00:15:37.330" style="s2">on the path to regeneration so when we</p>

<p begin="00:18:54.070" end="00:18:59.270" style="s2">the framework</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.390" end="00:19:01.490" style="s2">and to give you an example that is very</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.270" end="00:19:04.730" style="s2">much related to climate changes that how</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.490" end="00:19:08.030" style="s2">do we heal the planet how do we heal</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.730" end="00:19:12.440" style="s2">degraded ecosystems this graphic shows</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.030" end="00:19:15.920" style="s2">that as soon as you like the current way</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.440" end="00:19:19.040" style="s2">of land management and industrial</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.920" end="00:19:21.590" style="s2">agriculture have degraded our soils have</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.040" end="00:19:24.740" style="s2">impoverished our soils have impoverished</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.590" end="00:19:28.730" style="s2">biodiversity and so there&#39;s a whole set</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.740" end="00:19:30.830" style="s2">of less less ground cover means less</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.730" end="00:19:34.059" style="s2">roots in the ground less biomass in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.830" end="00:19:38.169" style="s2">ground means less carbon in the ground</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.059" end="00:19:41.750" style="s2">means less capacity for the soil to</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.169" end="00:19:46.520" style="s2">capture water and and let it infiltrate</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.750" end="00:19:48.470" style="s2">the aquifer it increases erosion it</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.520" end="00:19:51.230" style="s2">decreases bio productivity in</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.470" end="00:19:53.179" style="s2">biodiversity and it means that more</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.230" end="00:19:56.270" style="s2">carbon is released to the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.179" end="00:19:59.630" style="s2">and so we&#39;re driving climate change so</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.270" end="00:20:02.360" style="s2">that&#39;s on the right on the Left if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.630" end="00:20:04.970" style="s2">use holistic Land Management and we use</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.360" end="00:20:08.179" style="s2">techniques from regenerative agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.970" end="00:20:10.510" style="s2">we can do exactly the reverse if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.179" end="00:20:14.630" style="s2">double the amount of carbon in the soil</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.510" end="00:20:17.480" style="s2">you 20-fold increase the capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.630" end="00:20:20.030" style="s2">soil to retain water so when it rains</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.480" end="00:20:22.130" style="s2">the soil is like a sponge and it takes</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.030" end="00:20:25.130" style="s2">up all the water and then it can trickle</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.130" end="00:20:29.690" style="s2">into the aquifer again and replenish it</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.130" end="00:20:32.780" style="s2">the images that you can see on the right</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.690" end="00:20:36.160" style="s2">of this slide images from the Loess</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.160" end="00:20:44.760" style="s2">3500 square kilometres and in 1994 the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.179" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">Chinese government started to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.760" end="00:20:49.669" style="s2">toward this area which is a very dry</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.149" end="00:21:04.190" style="s2">between 1994 and 2009 they managed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.479" end="00:21:06.259" style="s2">regenerate 175 square kilometres of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.190" end="00:21:08.239" style="s2">loose plateau in the way that you see in</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.259" end="00:21:10.789" style="s2">these images for me this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.239" end="00:21:13.299" style="s2">hopeful image because it shows that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.789" end="00:21:15.649" style="s2">are actually capable of healing</p>

<p begin="00:21:26.090" end="00:21:30.059" style="s2">and there are a number of exam</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.020" end="00:21:31.110" style="s2">this also happening in Brazil the one</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.059" end="00:21:36.600" style="s2">that I came across</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.110" end="00:21:39.240" style="s2">today is the Sebastian Salgado who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.600" end="00:21:42.510" style="s2">famous photographer and his wife decided</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.240" end="00:21:45.140" style="s2">in the late 90s to buy a thinker from</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.510" end="00:21:47.220" style="s2">from their family and to start</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.140" end="00:21:51.120" style="s2">replanting the much Atlantic at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.220" end="00:21:55.410" style="s2">Atlantic rainforest and he can see here</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.120" end="00:21:57.240" style="s2">the 2001 to 2019 image is impressive and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.410" end="00:22:00.330" style="s2">they&#39;ve transformed the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.240" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">they&#39;ve planted over 2.7 million trees</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.330" end="00:22:04.830" style="s2">on that piece of land they&#39;ve restored</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:07.470" style="s2">one hundred one thousand seven hundred</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.830" end="00:22:10.110" style="s2">and forty acres what happened after</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.470" end="00:22:12.510" style="s2">years of doing that is that the springs</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.110" end="00:22:16.110" style="s2">came back because the water could filter</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.510" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">into the ground and so an area that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.110" end="00:22:22.230" style="s2">drying up suddenly had Springs running</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:24.570" style="s2">again at 20 20 litres per minute and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.230" end="00:22:28.470" style="s2">they have massively increased the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.570" end="00:22:30.030" style="s2">biodiversity of that area there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.470" end="00:22:31.590" style="s2">other projects all over the world that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.030" end="00:22:33.240" style="s2">tried to do the same thing there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.590" end="00:22:35.550" style="s2">organization in the Netherlands called</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.240" end="00:22:37.290" style="s2">common land that has pilot projects in</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.550" end="00:22:40.890" style="s2">Australia and South Africa and the</p>

<p begin="00:22:40.890" end="00:22:46.140" style="s2">and they&#39;re basically building</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.270" end="00:22:49.110" style="s2">multi-stakeholder partnerships between</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.140" end="00:22:51.809" style="s2">land owners of degraded land at the</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.809" end="00:22:58.590" style="s2">then they create they agree on a 25-year</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.530" end="00:23:01.410" style="s2">process of regenerating and restoring</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.590" end="00:23:03.210" style="s2">that land because nature works in</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.410" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">different time scales than our human</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.210" end="00:23:08.940" style="s2">economic cycles and to really heal an</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:11.790" style="s2">ecosystem much can be done in the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.940" end="00:23:14.100" style="s2">8 to 10 years but to really do it in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.790" end="00:23:17.640" style="s2">long term it means it takes about 25</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.100" end="00:23:19.580" style="s2">years and within this initiative of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.640" end="00:23:21.240" style="s2">common land sits another wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.580" end="00:23:24.059" style="s2">initiative which is called the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.240" end="00:23:26.160" style="s2">ecosystems restoration camps and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.059" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">first one was started here in I live in</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.160" end="00:23:30.450" style="s2">Spain it was started in Spain and in new</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:32.360" style="s2">Murcia and soon there will be another</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.450" end="00:23:34.760" style="s2">one in Mexico</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.360" end="00:23:36.470" style="s2">and it&#39;s basically an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.760" end="00:23:39.020" style="s2">people from all over the world to come</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.470" end="00:23:40.940" style="s2">to a place and learn how to regenerate</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.020" end="00:23:43.160" style="s2">and restore ecosystems to learn</p>

<p begin="00:23:50.960" end="00:23:56.000" style="s2">biodiversity but to do so in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.630" end="00:23:59.029" style="s2">actually become bio productive and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.000" end="00:24:03.049" style="s2">they&#39;re also increase the the regional</p>

<p begin="00:24:03.049" end="00:24:06.830" style="s2">fabric because a lot of these places get</p>

<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:17.330" style="s2">the land you get a return and social</p>

<p begin="00:24:48.870" end="00:24:55.500" style="s2">very briefly through the history of</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.940" end="00:24:59.250" style="s2">cities we used to live in cities that</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.500" end="00:25:02.610" style="s2">were a group Alice there were cities</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.250" end="00:25:05.070" style="s2">very closely connected to agriculture in</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.610" end="00:25:07.799" style="s2">their local region so the city was</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.070" end="00:25:09.540" style="s2">intimately linked to its regions and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.799" end="00:25:12.870" style="s2">most of the things that were produced</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.540" end="00:25:14.850" style="s2">and consumed in that city came from</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.870" end="00:25:17.179" style="s2">local resources there was always some</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.850" end="00:25:19.710" style="s2">trade but it was a small proportion of</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.179" end="00:25:22.919" style="s2">what people needed to meet their daily</p>

<p begin="00:25:46.049" end="00:25:53.309" style="s2">have lost contact to a large degree and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.820" end="00:25:56.520" style="s2">the challenge now is to move into a</p>

<p begin="00:26:53.059" end="00:26:57.470" style="s2">look at the city from above it should be</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.150" end="00:27:01.250" style="s2">not very different from looking at</p>

<p begin="00:27:17.240" end="00:27:21.169" style="s2">that we need to do more retrofitting</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.040" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">rather than build these futuristic new</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.169" end="00:27:26.900" style="s2">cities because really we need to deal</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.840" end="00:27:28.429" style="s2">with the cities we&#39;ve already got but</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.900" end="00:27:30.470" style="s2">how do we do this</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.429" end="00:27:34.700" style="s2">it&#39;s basically applying the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.470" end="00:27:37.580" style="s2">the circular economy to the city and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.700" end="00:27:40.010" style="s2">bio region and to rather than have the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.580" end="00:27:42.890" style="s2">city draw in resources from all over the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.010" end="00:27:45.110" style="s2">planet like the ecological footprint of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.890" end="00:27:47.240" style="s2">the City of London is about a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.110" end="00:27:49.010" style="s2">and twenty-five times as big as the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.240" end="00:27:52.040" style="s2">actual physical footprint of the city</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.010" end="00:27:54.410" style="s2">and that&#39;s obviously not sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.040" end="00:27:58.100" style="s2">cities cover only 3% three to four</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.410" end="00:28:00.260" style="s2">percent of the Earth&#39;s land surface but</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.100" end="00:28:02.750" style="s2">they use eighty percent of the resources</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.260" end="00:28:04.970" style="s2">and produce eighty percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.750" end="00:28:07.630" style="s2">greenhouse gas emissions so cities is</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.970" end="00:28:10.630" style="s2">where a lot of these issues will be</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.630" end="00:28:10.630" style="s2">tested</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.130" end="00:28:18.630" style="s2">and the future that we&#39;re moving into as</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.500" end="00:28:22.020" style="s2">we&#39;re and this is really the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.630" end="00:28:25.890" style="s2">of regenerative design to redesign the</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.020" end="00:28:28.520" style="s2">human presence on earth within the next</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.890" end="00:28:31.340" style="s2">generation like within our generation</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.520" end="00:28:36.059" style="s2">from a degenerative impact an</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.340" end="00:28:39.030" style="s2">exploitative impact to designing a human</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.059" end="00:28:41.970" style="s2">relationship to the ecosystems we</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.030" end="00:28:45.539" style="s2">inhabit that is healing and regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.970" end="00:28:47.820" style="s2">and if you look at the map now of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.539" end="00:28:52.080" style="s2">world there&#39;s lots of straight lines</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.820" end="00:28:53.820" style="s2">that were drawn by colonialists that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:56.520" style="s2">said okay this is where this country</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.820" end="00:28:59.370" style="s2">ends and the next country starts these</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.520" end="00:29:01.520" style="s2">lines have nothing to do with the bio</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.370" end="00:29:04.950" style="s2">cultural uniqueness of place they were</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.520" end="00:29:08.520" style="s2">introduced in the era of empires of</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.520" end="00:29:15.059" style="s2">dividing humanity into other nations so</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.429" end="00:29:20.070" style="s2">we can more easily be controlled by</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.059" end="00:29:23.190" style="s2">rulers as we move into the planetary era</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.070" end="00:29:26.060" style="s2">the future where we simply have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.190" end="00:29:28.400" style="s2">recognize that we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.060" end="00:29:30.920" style="s2">passengers on human spaceship earth and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.400" end="00:29:35.030" style="s2">that we better learn how to deal well</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.920" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">with this living spaceship earth we need</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.030" end="00:29:40.130" style="s2">to redesign our patterns of how we meet</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:41.660" style="s2">our ecosystems in ways that actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.130" end="00:29:43.160" style="s2">connect to the ecosystem and this</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.160" end="00:29:48.980" style="s2">you is a map by Robert Zuke&#39;s that shows</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.700" end="00:30:11.760" style="s2">patterns become natural patterns again I</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.470" end="00:30:13.740" style="s2">personally believe that the nation-state</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.760" end="00:30:16.370" style="s2">is an anachronism that doesn&#39;t serve us</p>

<p begin="00:30:29.290" end="00:30:34.070" style="s2">adapted regenerative cultures that are</p>

<p begin="00:30:36.309" end="00:30:40.480" style="s2">nation-states will be less important so</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:50.200" style="s2">this is a shift in worldview a shift in</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.980" end="00:30:50.200" style="s2">the missile Roman law and</p>

<p begin="00:31:13.210" end="00:31:19.330" style="s2">shift worldview through education we</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.419" end="00:31:21.340" style="s2">shift how we design and we can bring</p>

<p begin="00:31:21.340" end="00:31:24.460" style="s2">presence on earth and and I&#39;ve also put</p>

<p begin="00:31:36.220" end="00:31:42.159" style="s2">we&#39;ve always emphasized the importance</p>

<p begin="00:31:53.470" end="00:31:59.559" style="s2">relatively early on in the course in</p>

<p begin="00:32:10.330" end="00:32:19.240" style="s2">happened today and um so the day after</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.399" end="00:32:20.889" style="s2">September 12 2001 we had a session with</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.240" end="00:32:22.809" style="s2">the nine students on the masters and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.889" end="00:32:26.610" style="s2">with Stefan Harding and Brian Goodwin</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.809" end="00:32:31.029" style="s2">and our tutor Jody PGM and Jody wrote</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.610" end="00:32:33.669" style="s2">read two poems by Ted not on one of them</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.029" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">was the wonderful piece on interbeing</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.669" end="00:32:38.740" style="s2">and the other one is called call me by</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:41.730" style="s2">my true names which I highly recommend</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.740" end="00:32:44.170" style="s2">you look up and and and read and then we</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.730" end="00:32:46.630" style="s2">discussed</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.170" end="00:32:48.429" style="s2">the the bifurcation point that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.630" end="00:32:51.549" style="s2">critical point in history that we were</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.429" end="00:32:55.299" style="s2">at after this attack and how you could</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.549" end="00:32:57.429" style="s2">react to such a attack and that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.299" end="00:33:01.540" style="s2">could either react from fear or from</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.429" end="00:33:05.799" style="s2">love and so we developed in a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.540" end="00:33:07.929" style="s2">dynamic way this map which I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.799" end="00:33:09.549" style="s2">describes very well what the shift</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.929" end="00:33:12.040" style="s2">towards regenerative cultures is all</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.549" end="00:33:15.570" style="s2">about so we&#39;ve lived in a culture where</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.040" end="00:33:20.160" style="s2">science has homogenized has put</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.570" end="00:33:22.860" style="s2">disciplines into silos has looked at</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.160" end="00:33:24.720" style="s2">fractions parts of the system has tried</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.860" end="00:33:27.390" style="s2">to like our economic system tries to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.720" end="00:33:31.500" style="s2">maximize particular parts economic gain</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.390" end="00:33:34.380" style="s2">with in inefficient measures of success</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.500" end="00:33:36.900" style="s2">like the gross domestic product and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.380" end="00:33:39.420" style="s2">we&#39;ve created a culture that only looks</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.900" end="00:33:41.150" style="s2">at the benefits for individuals and of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.420" end="00:33:45.180" style="s2">course this then goes on to create</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.150" end="00:33:47.190" style="s2">alienation it is a expression of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.180" end="00:33:50.310" style="s2">separation from the world and it creates</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.190" end="00:33:55.620" style="s2">a separation between culture and nature</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.310" end="00:34:00.230" style="s2">and from this we get an even stronger</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.620" end="00:34:03.330" style="s2">need for like we begin to compete we</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.230" end="00:34:06.030" style="s2">want to predict and control because we</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.330" end="00:34:08.730" style="s2">with fear nature as other or other</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.030" end="00:34:12.320" style="s2">people and and we feel separated and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.730" end="00:34:15.490" style="s2">that then drives that vicious cycle</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.320" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">but if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.490" end="00:34:20.260" style="s2">to search for a deeper meaning because</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:22.659" style="s2">that is actually not fulfilling us to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.260" end="00:34:26.290" style="s2">just run after the money and we become</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.659" end="00:34:28.149" style="s2">playful and creative together we realize</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.290" end="00:34:31.990" style="s2">we can create collaborative abundance</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.149" end="00:34:37.659" style="s2">and we shift into the virtuous cycle of</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.990" end="00:34:39.970" style="s2">love of being valuing diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.659" end="00:34:43.419" style="s2">understanding that even if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.970" end="00:34:45.070" style="s2">agree the diversity of all of us seeing</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.419" end="00:34:47.349" style="s2">the world from slightly different angles</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.070" end="00:34:49.419" style="s2">gives us more information about this</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.349" end="00:34:51.879" style="s2">wonderful complex dynamic system in</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.419" end="00:34:54.669" style="s2">which we participate and so we begin to</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.879" end="00:34:57.310" style="s2">optimize the whole four benefits for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.669" end="00:34:59.530" style="s2">collective and the individual and we do</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.310" end="00:35:02.080" style="s2">so through collaboration participation</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.530" end="00:35:06.099" style="s2">and co-creation and it gives us in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.080" end="00:35:08.980" style="s2">sense of belonging in a sense of place</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.099" end="00:35:13.480" style="s2">we connect with the story of place again</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.980" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">and we begin to share deeper meaning</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.480" end="00:35:19.210" style="s2">what it is like to be life and as life</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:22.599" style="s2">create conditions conducive to life and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.210" end="00:35:26.320" style="s2">I think that for me that sums up quite</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.599" end="00:35:29.380" style="s2">well what culture shift we need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.320" end="00:35:31.990" style="s2">about as quickly as possible and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.380" end="00:35:35.830" style="s2">really excited to be able to come to</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.990" end="00:35:38.020" style="s2">Brazil in March and share these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.830" end="00:35:39.970" style="s2">with more people and there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.020" end="00:35:42.339" style="s2">people already working regenerative lis</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.970" end="00:35:45.940" style="s2">around Brazil and in Central and South</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.339" end="00:35:49.330" style="s2">America and I really feel that we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.940" end="00:35:53.080" style="s2">the regeneration the generation that</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.330" end="00:35:55.869" style="s2">regenerates rising and I mean we from</p>

<p begin="00:37:32.980" end="00:37:39.490" style="s2">or economic systems if you could talk a</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.670" end="00:37:42.150" style="s2">little bit about this one of the of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.490" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">course you&#39;re absolutely right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.150" end="00:37:48.850" style="s2">as sustainability has four dimensions so</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">does regenerative practice and actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.850" end="00:37:55.480" style="s2">very often doing the ecological</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:58.090" style="s2">regeneration can give a shared meaning</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.250" end="00:39:30.460" style="s2">is related to the Agra forest systems if</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.190" end="00:39:34.210" style="s2">they are considered as regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.460" end="00:39:38.920" style="s2">design experience and what would be</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.210" end="00:39:42.100" style="s2">other experiences and it&#39;s also related</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.920" end="00:39:45.240" style="s2">to the question how could we reintroduce</p>

<p begin="00:40:25.180" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">going to be the winner in 2019 and many</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:33.850" style="s2">of the projects that make it into the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">finalists are agroforestry projects</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.850" end="00:40:39.220" style="s2">there&#39;s usually a number of applicants</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:42.610" style="s2">from Brazil last year there were two</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.220" end="00:40:48.400" style="s2">winners from Brazil and agroforestry is</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.610" end="00:40:50.470" style="s2">a key practice and in terms of it is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.400" end="00:40:52.600" style="s2">regenerative practice already but if we</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.470" end="00:40:55.720" style="s2">look at this approach that I briefly</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.600" end="00:41:00.130" style="s2">mentioned the common land foundations</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.720" end="00:41:02.620" style="s2">approach is - in terms of regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.130" end="00:41:05.290" style="s2">environmental restoration practice it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.620" end="00:41:07.540" style="s2">about creating biosphere reserves that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.290" end="00:41:10.090" style="s2">really leave nature to herself a</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.540" end="00:41:12.340" style="s2">mortared them the more than human nature</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.090" end="00:41:15.640" style="s2">to herself so that so nature can</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.340" end="00:41:17.830" style="s2">generate its own abundance and then have</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.640" end="00:41:19.900" style="s2">buffer zones around it of mixed use with</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.830" end="00:41:22.210" style="s2">agroforestry system that where we begin</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.900" end="00:41:23.410" style="s2">to be more productive but of course many</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.210" end="00:41:25.360" style="s2">of you are probably already familiar</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.410" end="00:41:27.800" style="s2">with the fact that that now research</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.360" end="00:41:29.780" style="s2">shows that even the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.800" end="00:41:31.910" style="s2">the densest parts of the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.780" end="00:41:35.870" style="s2">rainforest I actually a forest garden</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.910" end="00:41:38.690" style="s2">system that were in part cultivated by</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.870" end="00:41:40.730" style="s2">the human beings that lived as nature</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.690" end="00:41:42.260" style="s2">and designed as nature within them I</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.730" end="00:41:44.150" style="s2">think it&#39;s really important to remember</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.260" end="00:41:47.360" style="s2">that when we talk about regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.150" end="00:41:49.970" style="s2">practice we&#39;re actually also bringing</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.360" end="00:41:54.170" style="s2">back indigenous practices in indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.970" end="00:41:56.450" style="s2">wisdom that has meant that as human</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.170" end="00:42:00.080" style="s2">beings we used to live by originally and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.450" end="00:42:01.670" style="s2">we used to live and design as nature and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.080" end="00:42:04.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve just lost our path a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.670" end="00:42:08.570" style="s2">and we need to come back to this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.550" end="00:42:10.490" style="s2">practice and and basically creating</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.570" end="00:42:13.640" style="s2">corridors between these buffer zones</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.490" end="00:42:15.680" style="s2">connecting the the system again in such</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.640" end="00:42:18.170" style="s2">a way that animal migration can continue</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.680" end="00:42:20.780" style="s2">to happen and in systems become vibrant</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.170" end="00:42:23.540" style="s2">again and there&#39;s exchange so depleted</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.780" end="00:42:26.030" style="s2">areas actually have influx of new</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.540" end="00:42:27.770" style="s2">biodiversity from other areas it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.030" end="00:42:31.340" style="s2">part of the system it&#39;s not it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.770" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">all these practices are part of what we</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.340" end="00:42:37.190" style="s2">now talk about as regenerative practice</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:40.610" style="s2">but they they might be much older than</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.190" end="00:42:43.410" style="s2">the name regeneration I hope that makes</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.610" end="00:42:45.819" style="s2">it clear</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.410" end="00:42:48.460" style="s2">Thank You Daniel there are many many</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.819" end="00:42:51.670" style="s2">questions I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll be able</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.460" end="00:42:54.760" style="s2">to address all of them one question is</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.670" end="00:42:58.480" style="s2">about is someone is asking you to bring</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.760" end="00:43:01.329" style="s2">to give more examples about projects</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:04.809" style="s2">related to the regenerative culture and</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.329" end="00:43:08.710" style="s2">someone else asked it if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.809" end="00:43:12.880" style="s2">example in this concept being used in</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.710" end="00:43:16.030" style="s2">human relations mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.880" end="00:43:20.430" style="s2">so in terms of big examples of course in</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.030" end="00:43:23.319" style="s2">a 30 minute webinar and and 25 minute</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.430" end="00:43:27.039" style="s2">question-and-answer I can&#39;t really cover</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.319" end="00:43:28.690" style="s2">all the examples that I know of but my</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.039" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">book designing regenerative cultures</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.690" end="00:43:34.930" style="s2">which I am sure that the beginning has</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:37.510" style="s2">is full of examples and the easiest way</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.930" end="00:43:39.390" style="s2">to find more examples is to go onto my</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.510" end="00:43:42.670" style="s2">medium block which if you just put</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.390" end="00:43:45.069" style="s2">Daniel Christian ball and medium it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.670" end="00:43:48.700" style="s2">come up in your search engine and there</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.069" end="00:43:51.520" style="s2">are 320 articles on there that all give</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.700" end="00:43:55.089" style="s2">examples in social examples economic</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.520" end="00:43:57.130" style="s2">examples ecological examples and some of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.089" end="00:43:59.829" style="s2">them are excerpts from Gaia education</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.130" end="00:44:01.569" style="s2">curriculum in for the online course some</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.829" end="00:44:03.670" style="s2">of them are excerpts from my book from</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.569" end="00:44:05.710" style="s2">my master&#39;s thesis from my PhD and</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.670" end="00:44:09.160" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve written in the last</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.710" end="00:44:12.490" style="s2">couple of years and so I I think I would</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.160" end="00:44:14.710" style="s2">end up speaking too long if I went into</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.490" end="00:44:16.750" style="s2">lots of specific examples right now but</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.710" end="00:44:18.460" style="s2">please do look them up and also I would</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.750" end="00:44:21.010" style="s2">give more examples in the next webinar</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.460" end="00:44:25.599" style="s2">and I will also give a lot more examples</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.010" end="00:44:28.720" style="s2">when when I&#39;m in in Brazil and of course</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.599" end="00:44:31.930" style="s2">if if you think of just the last part of</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:33.400" style="s2">your question Thai supposed and human</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.930" end="00:44:35.950" style="s2">relationships if you just look at that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.400" end="00:44:40.059" style="s2">last slide that shift from the vicious</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.950" end="00:44:43.000" style="s2">the virtuous a vicious cycle of fear to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.059" end="00:44:45.329" style="s2">the virtuous cycle of love and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.000" end="00:44:48.069" style="s2">clearly is applicable to human</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.329" end="00:44:50.710" style="s2">relationships it&#39;s it&#39;s asking yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.069" end="00:44:53.079" style="s2">in in interpersonal relationships but</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.710" end="00:44:55.510" style="s2">also in business relationships but with</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.079" end="00:44:56.900" style="s2">other enterprises when you feel that</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.510" end="00:45:00.560" style="s2">impulse that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.900" end="00:45:03.320" style="s2">so been trained in to see oh this person</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.560" end="00:45:06.470" style="s2">is trying to get onto my turf my area em</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.320" end="00:45:08.150" style="s2">and you feel competitive to just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.470" end="00:45:09.920" style="s2">go oh wow that&#39;s wonderful there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.150" end="00:45:11.930" style="s2">another person who actually does the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.920" end="00:45:14.060" style="s2">same thing than I than I do maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.930" end="00:45:16.010" style="s2">could do something together that would</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.060" end="00:45:17.960" style="s2">be more where the hole would be more</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.010" end="00:45:20.720" style="s2">than the sum of its parts where together</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.960" end="00:45:23.240" style="s2">we could achieve something that neither</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.720" end="00:45:26.360" style="s2">one of us could achieve alone and so you</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.240" end="00:45:28.490" style="s2">shift from that attitude of competition</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.360" end="00:45:33.530" style="s2">to the attitude of collaboration and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.490" end="00:45:35.750" style="s2">really try to work on em what responding</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.530" end="00:45:38.870" style="s2">to the person would be like from a</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.750" end="00:45:42.080" style="s2">collaborative space and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.870" end="00:45:44.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a it&#39;s a spiritual and a social</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.080" end="00:45:47.050" style="s2">practice um that will bring about a</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.600" end="00:45:47.050" style="s2">better world</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.650" end="00:45:53.150" style="s2">in cue Daniel there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.690" end="00:45:55.940" style="s2">questions that I just don&#39;t know what to</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.150" end="00:45:57.740" style="s2">do with all of them but I will read some</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.940" end="00:46:01.490" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.740" end="00:46:05.869" style="s2">if regenerative design can be applied in</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.490" end="00:46:09.829" style="s2">product development industry if you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.869" end="00:46:13.910" style="s2">examples about experience specific</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.829" end="00:46:16.609" style="s2">working with children how can we</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.910" end="00:46:19.520" style="s2">communicate this message the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.609" end="00:46:23.270" style="s2">regeneration message - governs and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.520" end="00:46:31.809" style="s2">corporations how can we spread this kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.270" end="00:46:31.809" style="s2">of practices ok many other specific ones</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.799" end="00:46:39.140" style="s2">ok the next the next webinar will be on</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.380" end="00:46:42.109" style="s2">nature inspired design and so I&#39;ll speak</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.140" end="00:46:44.839" style="s2">a lot more about the different scales of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.109" end="00:46:47.630" style="s2">design from from material science to</p>

<p begin="00:46:55.849" end="00:47:00.680" style="s2">of the key elements there is to look at</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.010" end="00:47:03.670" style="s2">the entire supply chain to shorten the</p>

<p begin="00:48:53.839" end="00:49:02.579" style="s2">so I think we you might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.670" end="00:49:04.469" style="s2">answer maybe one more question one thing</p>

<p begin="00:49:11.130" end="00:49:17.369" style="s2">can&#39;t promise it but I can try to create</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.160" end="00:49:19.949" style="s2">a medium post answering some of those</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.369" end="00:49:21.569" style="s2">questions and in writing so if if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.949" end="00:49:24.749" style="s2">are out there listening and yeah your</p>

<p begin="00:49:39.239" end="00:49:46.170" style="s2">we have many questions related also to</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.939" end="00:49:49.049" style="s2">to economic systems how we would apply</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.170" end="00:49:53.429" style="s2">these concepts to to create new economic</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.049" end="00:49:57.209" style="s2">systems and yeah many people are asking</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.429" end="00:50:01.289" style="s2">for more examples and so on I think you</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.209" end="00:50:09.420" style="s2">already said about the the next</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.289" end="00:50:12.019" style="s2">activities but maybe we can also with</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.420" end="00:50:14.549" style="s2">regard to regenerative economics I</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.019" end="00:50:16.439" style="s2">should definitely mention the wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.549" end="00:50:19.559" style="s2">work of the capital Institute in New</p>

<p begin="00:50:21.539" end="00:50:26.579" style="s2">well and basically what the capital</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.059" end="00:50:29.670" style="s2">Institute has done is they launched in</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.579" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">2000 and was at 16 or 15 the white paper</p>
