<p begin="00:00:08.480" end="00:00:12.660" style="s2">hello you found the portal</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.679" end="00:00:16.139" style="s2">I&#39;m your host Eric Weinstein and today</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.660" end="00:00:17.880" style="s2">we&#39;re here with a fabulous author who</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.139" end="00:00:19.949" style="s2">many of you will know Bret Easton Ellis</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.880" end="00:00:22.160" style="s2">famous from less than zero in American</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.949" end="00:00:25.439" style="s2">Psycho and now the book white welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.160" end="00:00:28.260" style="s2">thank you for having me Eric so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.439" end="00:00:31.170" style="s2">know exactly how to approach this but</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.260" end="00:00:33.930" style="s2">one of the one of the frames that I have</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.170" end="00:00:36.329" style="s2">is that we&#39;re sitting here in a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.930" end="00:00:38.460" style="s2">unusual city that many people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.329" end="00:00:41.129" style="s2">understand how important it is and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.460" end="00:00:43.559" style="s2">makes it so unusual and one way I might</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.129" end="00:00:44.910" style="s2">frame that is that because Los Angeles</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.559" end="00:00:46.980" style="s2">is the home of the entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.910" end="00:00:48.690" style="s2">industry there&#39;s a weird way in which</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">this is the only city in the world in</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.690" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">which I could make the argument that</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:54.300" style="s2">everyone some somehow partially lives</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:56.309" style="s2">here whether they know it or not they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.300" end="00:00:58.530" style="s2">consumed the street scenes which are</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.309" end="00:01:01.079" style="s2">used as backdrops for movies and TV and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.530" end="00:01:03.149" style="s2">they have an idea of what the ethos of</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.079" end="00:01:06.570" style="s2">the place is which sort of seeps into</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.149" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">the screenwriters mindsets no matter who</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">they are and in any way that la is</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">different it does broadcast itself to</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:14.850" style="s2">the world does that resonate with you</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:20.070" style="s2">and can you add anything well I think it</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.850" end="00:01:23.840" style="s2">it maybe resonated that way for me maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.070" end="00:01:26.700" style="s2">10 or 15 years ago a lot more I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.840" end="00:01:30.869" style="s2">the entertainment industry is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.700" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">centralized just to Los Angeles anymore</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.869" end="00:01:35.610" style="s2">or at least that&#39;s the way we look at</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:38.540" style="s2">entertainment it seems to be this kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.610" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">of global thing and not wholly</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.540" end="00:01:43.970" style="s2">concentrated in Los Angeles where it</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:48.329" style="s2">used to be though now you might have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.970" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">say that it is because Disney is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.329" end="00:01:53.430" style="s2">entertainment business Disney now owns</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:58.259" style="s2">everything that&#39;s the conglomerate that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.430" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">is going to produce an inordinately it</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.259" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">actually has come back here and is</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">centered here but you know it&#39;s strange</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.189" end="00:02:09.330" style="s2">there are some the the entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:11.670" style="s2">business or the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.330" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">entertainment business is now this</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.670" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">global thing whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:18.740" style="s2">it&#39;s China whether it&#39;s India has a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:21.209" style="s2">massive has the biggest entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.740" end="00:02:22.650" style="s2">complex in the world the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.209" end="00:02:24.600" style="s2">highest-grossing movies I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.650" end="00:02:26.420" style="s2">biggest you know utter but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.600" end="00:02:29.250" style="s2">different the consumer base for</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.420" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">Bollywood when he&#39;s very different so if</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.250" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">you&#39;re in Indonesia for example or if</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:34.620" style="s2">you&#39;re in East Africa you&#39;d be much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:37.650" style="s2">likely to run into somebody I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.620" end="00:02:39.660" style="s2">famously Raj Kapoor and you know some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.650" end="00:02:41.940" style="s2">his songs are known to by all Russians</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">right but that hasn&#39;t had the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.940" end="00:02:46.470" style="s2">impact I think I mean I think you could</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:48.600" style="s2">take the biggest films like a Sholay and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.470" end="00:02:52.019" style="s2">people in the US have never even heard</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.600" end="00:02:55.530" style="s2">of they haven&#39;t that&#39;s correct but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.019" end="00:02:56.790" style="s2">think it&#39;s because la has been so</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.530" end="00:02:58.920" style="s2">central in our minds to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.790" end="00:03:03.030" style="s2">entertainment business since its</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.920" end="00:03:07.170" style="s2">inception I guess in the 20s or before</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.030" end="00:03:09.030" style="s2">that that we that&#39;s where all of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.170" end="00:03:10.200" style="s2">associations are they&#39;re all but only</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.030" end="00:03:11.550" style="s2">think about the movie industry when we</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.200" end="00:03:13.830" style="s2">think about the entertainment industry</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.550" end="00:03:16.739" style="s2">that it&#39;s just been around for so long</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.830" end="00:03:19.860" style="s2">that we always think that la we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.739" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">activate that with that and I also think</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.860" end="00:03:30.209" style="s2">that it&#39;s um it has a lot to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:36.260" style="s2">way la looks as a kind of parrot</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.209" end="00:03:36.260" style="s2">paradise a kind of identic eden-like</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.459" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">location and of course we&#39;ve seen so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.890" end="00:03:44.519" style="s2">much of it in so much of of the content</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:46.530" style="s2">we&#39;ve consumed over the years we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.519" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">it&#39;s roads we&#39;ve seen as Hill sighs</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.530" end="00:03:51.780" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen its beaches we&#39;ve seen its</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:55.980" style="s2">deserts that I that that might be one</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.780" end="00:03:57.329" style="s2">reason why we&#39;re we connect LA with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.980" end="00:03:59.430" style="s2">business of entertainment well I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.329" end="00:04:00.900" style="s2">think just to riff off what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.430" end="00:04:04.200" style="s2">saying if I just thought about street</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.900" end="00:04:06.780" style="s2">names you know why is it that Mulholland</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.200" end="00:04:09.959" style="s2">shows up in Tom Petty&#39;s free fallin or</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:12.750" style="s2">is the title of a famous David Lynch</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.959" end="00:04:15.450" style="s2">film you know Sunset Boulevard all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.750" end="00:04:18.030" style="s2">these streets you know only New York</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.450" end="00:04:20.280" style="s2">might have in some sense as iconic</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.030" end="00:04:21.690" style="s2">street names which are sort of projected</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.280" end="00:04:25.560" style="s2">out through the industry</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.690" end="00:04:27.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s one indicator to me that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.560" end="00:04:28.680" style="s2">know if I thought about the streets</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.000" end="00:04:32.510" style="s2">houston I have no idea what the name of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.680" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">important streets in Houston might be no</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.510" end="00:04:40.920" style="s2">nor do i yeah I mean well look so much</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:45.740" style="s2">of the talent that creates this content</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.920" end="00:04:48.150" style="s2">of course lives here and they reference</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.740" end="00:04:50.910" style="s2">everything about the place in their work</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.150" end="00:04:53.610" style="s2">and you know look I have to say as</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.910" end="00:04:57.300" style="s2">someone who grew up out here and someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.610" end="00:05:00.419" style="s2">who has written about this in about</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.300" end="00:05:07.200" style="s2">three of my novels were holy holy set in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.419" end="00:05:09.240" style="s2">Los Angeles it is the most creatively</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.200" end="00:05:10.680" style="s2">suggestive place that I&#39;ve ever lived</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.240" end="00:05:12.120" style="s2">and I&#39;ve lived in New York and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.680" end="00:05:14.130" style="s2">lived in Vermont and I&#39;ve lived in</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.120" end="00:05:17.550" style="s2">Virginia and I spent a long time in</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.130" end="00:05:21.000" style="s2">England and in Paris nothing really</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.550" end="00:05:23.610" style="s2">compares to Los Angeles in terms of how</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.000" end="00:05:28.050" style="s2">was activated my mind and made me want</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.610" end="00:05:29.730" style="s2">to write and I still feel that way I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.050" end="00:05:31.350" style="s2">always felt that way since I was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.730" end="00:05:33.240" style="s2">teenager there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.350" end="00:05:36.300" style="s2">possibilities and a sense of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.240" end="00:05:38.940" style="s2">here because of the constant mobility</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.300" end="00:05:41.250" style="s2">and especially the freedom I associated</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.940" end="00:05:45.090" style="s2">with being a young person in LA and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.250" end="00:05:47.400" style="s2">having access if I wanted to to be at</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.090" end="00:05:48.930" style="s2">the beach and then an hour later via the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.400" end="00:05:50.850" style="s2">mountains and maybe an hour and a half</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.930" end="00:05:52.919" style="s2">late or be at the desert that this whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.850" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">thing was so available to me and I had</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.919" end="00:05:58.530" style="s2">the mobility to get to all these places</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:00.840" style="s2">and that activated a kind of freedom in</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.530" end="00:06:02.700" style="s2">my mind that&#39;s not wasn&#39;t only physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.840" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">but it was also creative and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.700" end="00:06:07.260" style="s2">hard to explain that to people I mean um</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:09.780" style="s2">when I talked to writers that I knew who</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.260" end="00:06:14.340" style="s2">grew up in New York or grew up in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.780" end="00:06:18.180" style="s2">suburbs I don&#39;t know if they really can</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.340" end="00:06:21.540" style="s2">access that and I I think about that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.180" end="00:06:26.070" style="s2">alone it seems to me that in some how in</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.540" end="00:06:28.710" style="s2">some ways that huge number of different</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.070" end="00:06:32.250" style="s2">environments really defines the place</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.710" end="00:06:33.630" style="s2">and because la doesn&#39;t have in what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.250" end="00:06:35.130" style="s2">consider to be a good general</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.630" end="00:06:36.840" style="s2">description in the world we don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.130" end="00:06:39.870" style="s2">about it the way we think about Paris</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.840" end="00:06:43.290" style="s2">for example or you know even knew you</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.870" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">work people very often don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.290" end="00:06:47.400" style="s2">that this is like you know the home in</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:49.380" style="s2">part of the rand corporation or that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.400" end="00:06:52.170" style="s2">there&#39;s an oil field that partially</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.380" end="00:06:54.300" style="s2">defines the city it&#39;s not a very easy to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.170" end="00:06:57.270" style="s2">understand place and I thought that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.300" end="00:06:58.920" style="s2">part you know just as you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.270" end="00:07:01.170" style="s2">about the natural environments of Los</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.920" end="00:07:03.660" style="s2">Angeles also the ability to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.170" end="00:07:08.970" style="s2">forth between Skid Row and Sunset Strip</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.660" end="00:07:11.640" style="s2">and to see the sort of ways in which the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.970" end="00:07:14.550" style="s2">you know the illusion of the Hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.640" end="00:07:17.760" style="s2">Hills and the dark underbelly make this</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.550" end="00:07:20.790" style="s2">place just far more generative and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.760" end="00:07:24.090" style="s2">know dark it&#39;s one of these places that</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.790" end="00:07:26.610" style="s2">that fits the description a sunny place</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.090" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">for shady people well that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.610" end="00:07:31.290" style="s2">thought about a lot when I was growing</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:36.000" style="s2">up out here in the 70s and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.290" end="00:07:38.760" style="s2">in the early 80s when for example Venice</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.000" end="00:07:42.810" style="s2">is a is a good place to start</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.760" end="00:07:45.270" style="s2">I mean Venice in the 70s was a slum dark</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.810" end="00:07:47.640" style="s2">very dark place you didn&#39;t go to Venice</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.270" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">after night you didn&#39;t go to Venice</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.640" end="00:07:54.090" style="s2">during the day but I remember they</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:55.950" style="s2">started opening a few restaurants there</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.090" end="00:07:58.260" style="s2">there were few art galleries</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.950" end="00:08:00.930" style="s2">I remember 72 Market Street was one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.260" end="00:08:03.810" style="s2">the first very first restaurants a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.930" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">upscale kind of piano bar restaurant in</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.810" end="00:08:09.240" style="s2">a kind of derelict alley and there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:11.190" style="s2">something kind of very Los Angeles about</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.240" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">that very thrilling right off the beach</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.190" end="00:08:19.500" style="s2">and and a Los Angeles really does have</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:21.540" style="s2">the kind of imagination that allows that</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.500" end="00:08:23.700" style="s2">to open there and then flourish into</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.540" end="00:08:26.850" style="s2">other restaurants began opening I</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.700" end="00:08:29.460" style="s2">remember Wolfgang Puck open xinhua on on</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.850" end="00:08:31.650" style="s2">I think Main Street and then everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.460" end="00:08:33.930" style="s2">kind of started to flower out of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.650" end="00:08:36.120" style="s2">but that was not unusual because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.930" end="00:08:38.730" style="s2">remember a lot of times there would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.120" end="00:08:41.220" style="s2">especially as a club kid and going into</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.730" end="00:08:44.940" style="s2">a lot of clubs you go to these really</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.220" end="00:08:49.230" style="s2">cool chic clubs in the sleaziest parts</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.940" end="00:08:51.030" style="s2">of downtown in the lower lower reaches</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.230" end="00:08:53.160" style="s2">of Wilshire Boulevard</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.030" end="00:08:56.130" style="s2">and there was just something kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.160" end="00:08:58.050" style="s2">fabulous about an environment that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.130" end="00:09:03.480" style="s2">allowed all of this to kind of coexist</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.050" end="00:09:05.970" style="s2">and you know Melrose for example was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.480" end="00:09:08.250" style="s2">place a strip that I spent a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.970" end="00:09:10.700" style="s2">adolescence on and there were very</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.250" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">high-end stores next to you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.700" end="00:09:16.590" style="s2">discount clothing stores next to vintage</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:18.630" style="s2">sunglasses stores next to the seediest</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.590" end="00:09:21.990" style="s2">bar imaginable and the fact that all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.630" end="00:09:24.390" style="s2">this could coexist as really thrilling</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.990" end="00:09:27.390" style="s2">to me and you know it just didn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.390" end="00:09:28.620" style="s2">anywhere else that I&#39;ve lived in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.390" end="00:09:31.770" style="s2">world and it&#39;s something that I still</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.620" end="00:09:35.670" style="s2">appreciate about the city though of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.770" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">course la I think like all places now to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.670" end="00:09:39.180" style="s2">a degree and I don&#39;t want to grossly</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:42.140" style="s2">generalize about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.180" end="00:09:47.720" style="s2">but you know we&#39;re sitting here in</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.140" end="00:09:52.380" style="s2">Hollywood basically in a newish</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.720" end="00:09:54.120" style="s2">high-rise and all around us is massive</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.380" end="00:09:56.990" style="s2">construction yeah they&#39;re high-rises</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.120" end="00:10:00.930" style="s2">going up all around going all around</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.990" end="00:10:03.600" style="s2">Cole right by the ArcLight Theatre here</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.600" end="00:10:09.450" style="s2">Boulevard from my childhood is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.450" end="00:10:11.850" style="s2">gone and has become a corridor not</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.450" end="00:10:14.100" style="s2">unlike some of the canyons of Manhattan</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.850" end="00:10:16.350" style="s2">and not unlike the Wilshire corridor in</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.100" end="00:10:19.680" style="s2">a lot of ways there is massive expansion</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.350" end="00:10:22.260" style="s2">and massive building here and also done</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.680" end="00:10:27.270" style="s2">on that on that kind of global style</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.260" end="00:10:29.190" style="s2">free zone that is so popular wherever</p>

<p begin="00:10:37.530" end="00:10:42.750" style="s2">of the more fabulous enclaves here</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.530" end="00:10:48.030" style="s2">very mysterious you&#39;d walk through a</p>

<p begin="00:10:51.540" end="00:10:57.240" style="s2">then you&#39;d enter into this mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.870" end="00:10:59.700" style="s2">dark dark bar from out of the 30s and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.240" end="00:11:03.150" style="s2">very kind of charming conservative</p>

<p begin="00:11:07.170" end="00:11:15.389" style="s2">basically looked like any Airport</p>

<p begin="00:11:15.389" end="00:11:22.709" style="s2">wherever it just something&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.750" end="00:11:24.930" style="s2">and as someone who tours a lot I see it</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.709" end="00:11:27.839" style="s2">all over the place it&#39;s kind of global</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.930" end="00:11:29.870" style="s2">style right taking over and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.839" end="00:11:32.819" style="s2">restaurant the bar the Bel Air now</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.870" end="00:11:35.730" style="s2">resemble pretty much everywhere else as</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.730" end="00:11:43.079" style="s2">Beverly Hills was Wolfgang Puck recently</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.490" end="00:11:47.069" style="s2">felt he had to redesign in the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.079" end="00:11:51.139" style="s2">anonymous global style you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.069" end="00:11:51.139" style="s2">already black-and-white photographs</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.670" end="00:12:01.500" style="s2">so the LA that I think you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.130" end="00:12:05.370" style="s2">referencing and that you can still find</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.500" end="00:12:10.170" style="s2">a pockets around here is like everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.370" end="00:12:15.180" style="s2">else it seems kind of fading into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.170" end="00:12:18.120" style="s2">new generic global style in a way I sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.180" end="00:12:22.740" style="s2">of agree with this however I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.740" end="00:12:28.529" style="s2">are ways in which the old weirdness of</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.800" end="00:16:56.060" style="s2">happens because there is that that</p>

<p begin="00:17:04.039" end="00:17:13.309" style="s2">it LA really does in some sense live its</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.319" end="00:17:15.640" style="s2">Noir at a level that would be fictional</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.309" end="00:17:18.199" style="s2">somewhere else I mean I think about so</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.640" end="00:17:22.039" style="s2">there&#39;s this very strange coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.199" end="00:17:25.549" style="s2">that you and I came from essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.039" end="00:17:28.610" style="s2">exact same milieu we both graduated high</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.549" end="00:17:31.010" style="s2">school in 1982 yes we were both at in</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.610" end="00:17:33.049" style="s2">the same sort of private school milieu I</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.010" end="00:17:34.460" style="s2">believe that we knew people in common</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.049" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">although I&#39;ve forgotten who they who</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.460" end="00:17:39.770" style="s2">they might be and I very much had the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:43.000" style="s2">sense that when less than zero debuted</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.770" end="00:17:44.179" style="s2">that you had privatized my childhood and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.000" end="00:17:47.990" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.179" end="00:17:49.879" style="s2">it was this it was this period which if</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.990" end="00:17:52.159" style="s2">somebody hadn&#39;t written about it would</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.879" end="00:17:54.110" style="s2">never be believed and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.159" end="00:17:56.659" style="s2">the reason I&#39;m trying to get at this I</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.110" end="00:17:59.539" style="s2">guess is that I think it had an</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.659" end="00:18:01.309" style="s2">importance that we didn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.539" end="00:18:03.259" style="s2">while we were living through it so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.309" end="00:18:04.789" style="s2">wanted to try some theories with you</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.259" end="00:18:08.179" style="s2">because I think that you are in some</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.789" end="00:18:12.110" style="s2">sense the poet laureate of whatever this</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.179" end="00:18:14.360" style="s2">firmament was which is sort of Los</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.110" end="00:18:18.350" style="s2">Angeles gen-x and then I&#39;ll tie it back</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.360" end="00:18:20.869" style="s2">if if if successful to to what I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.350" end="00:18:21.320" style="s2">it&#39;s significance is for us now because</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.869" end="00:18:24.919" style="s2">I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.320" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">I think it&#39;s underrated as a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.919" end="00:18:28.509" style="s2">point of departure with the past so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.960" end="00:18:32.659" style="s2">guess what my theory is</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.509" end="00:18:34.999" style="s2">is that if you look out at this backdrop</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.659" end="00:18:38.929" style="s2">behind behind us imagine a neutron bomb</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.999" end="00:18:42.110" style="s2">went off which was the divorce bomb and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.929" end="00:18:44.029" style="s2">it started with no-fault divorce in 1970</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.110" end="00:18:46.820" style="s2">with Ronald Reagan who himself was</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.029" end="00:18:50.269" style="s2">divorced signing this thing into law and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.820" end="00:18:53.899" style="s2">if you look at a graph of like divorce</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.269" end="00:18:56.419" style="s2">rates per you know whatever a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.899" end="00:18:58.249" style="s2">women it&#39;s got this weird sort of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.419" end="00:19:01.340" style="s2">declining declining declining and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.249" end="00:19:03.049" style="s2">just skyrockets for the entire 1970s</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.340" end="00:19:07.220" style="s2">before it starts going to decline again</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.049" end="00:19:10.039" style="s2">and we lived through this yes and while</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.220" end="00:19:13.730" style="s2">I&#39;m asking do you remember that suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.039" end="00:19:15.470" style="s2">like everybody&#39;s parents were on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.730" end="00:19:17.210" style="s2">rocks that suddenly the parents</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.470" end="00:19:20.210" style="s2">disappeared that there were like</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.210" end="00:19:24.039" style="s2">children supposedly of privilege roaming</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.210" end="00:19:29.899" style="s2">the streets and that it was really dark</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.039" end="00:19:35.080" style="s2">ie well that&#39;s a lot am i sir ever no no</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.899" end="00:19:38.090" style="s2">certainly remember a lot of divorces</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.080" end="00:19:41.690" style="s2">becoming much more aware of them as I</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.090" end="00:19:43.909" style="s2">entered into junior high school my</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.690" end="00:19:46.669" style="s2">parents marriage was very strained and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.909" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">by the time I was fifteen and I realized</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.669" end="00:19:52.609" style="s2">that they were going to split my sisters</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:53.960" style="s2">and I were however relieved because</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.609" end="00:19:57.230" style="s2">there was so much tension in the house</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.960" end="00:19:57.950" style="s2">caused by numerous things my including</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.230" end="00:20:02.120" style="s2">my father&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.950" end="00:20:04.460" style="s2">call ISM so that was the divorce wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.120" end="00:20:08.389" style="s2">the problem the marriage was the problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.460" end="00:20:12.950" style="s2">okay so that was so I the the darkness</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.389" end="00:20:15.919" style="s2">and I have to say as a teenager I wished</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.950" end="00:20:18.590" style="s2">that I had and I did to a degree enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.919" end="00:20:21.340" style="s2">the smell you much more than I did but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.590" end="00:20:23.750" style="s2">was an alienated kid and I was haunted</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.340" end="00:20:27.350" style="s2">one of the reasons I was so alienated</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.750" end="00:20:30.860" style="s2">was I was gay which was even living in</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.350" end="00:20:33.049" style="s2">liberal Los Angeles in 1980-81 even when</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.860" end="00:20:35.450" style="s2">it seemed gayness was in the culture and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.049" end="00:20:38.409" style="s2">announcing itself in specific ways with</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.450" end="00:20:41.330" style="s2">whether it was David Bowie or prints or</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.409" end="00:20:45.049" style="s2">American Gigolo or Calvin Klein</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.330" end="00:20:48.019" style="s2">advertisements you still worn out as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.049" end="00:20:49.460" style="s2">teenager and so that alienates you and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.019" end="00:20:51.710" style="s2">you begin to see the world in a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.460" end="00:20:53.870" style="s2">darker place or I think you begin to see</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.710" end="00:20:57.019" style="s2">the world as it really is you see</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.870" end="00:20:59.659" style="s2">through the facade of it you see through</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.019" end="00:21:01.909" style="s2">kind of the poses everyone is making in</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.659" end="00:21:03.590" style="s2">order to get through and you really see</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.909" end="00:21:04.340" style="s2">the lie of high school in so many ways</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.590" end="00:21:05.630" style="s2">when you&#39;re gay</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.340" end="00:21:08.600" style="s2">and you&#39;re standing on the sidelines and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.630" end="00:21:09.620" style="s2">no song is about you and no movie is</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.600" end="00:21:11.659" style="s2">about you and you have to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.620" end="00:21:15.190" style="s2">reprocess everything so that was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.659" end="00:21:21.889" style="s2">of the darkness of my la experience</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.190" end="00:21:25.669" style="s2">divorce sure but um I think that for me</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.889" end="00:21:27.980" style="s2">it was it was a being gay and being a</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.669" end="00:21:30.260" style="s2">writer I didn&#39;t know anyone else that</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.980" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">was writing a novel I&#39;d have written one</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.260" end="00:21:35.750" style="s2">already when I was 13 or 14 and those</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:39.740" style="s2">two things really did separate me from</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.750" end="00:21:41.659" style="s2">the rest of the crowd it&#39;s not to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.740" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t participate I went to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.659" end="00:21:46.010" style="s2">parties I even had a girlfriend I went</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:48.110" style="s2">to the beach</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.010" end="00:21:51.409" style="s2">I had my group of close male friends I</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.110" end="00:21:56.450" style="s2">danced at parties when they were at what</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.409" end="00:21:59.779" style="s2">point always six six seven yeah and it</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.450" end="00:22:01.549" style="s2">was nothing that ever I ever agonized</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.779" end="00:22:03.019" style="s2">over it was something I just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.549" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">accept it and said okay this is another</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.019" end="00:22:06.950" style="s2">thing that I&#39;ve got to deal with how am</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:10.220" style="s2">I going to navigate through this and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.950" end="00:22:11.430" style="s2">really was never something that tortured</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.220" end="00:22:13.830" style="s2">me or I felt I had to</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.430" end="00:22:15.980" style="s2">like tell other people or come at</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.830" end="00:22:19.830" style="s2">anybody so I had a very even keel</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.980" end="00:22:22.560" style="s2">acceptance of that but it does separate</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.830" end="00:22:25.970" style="s2">you you are only four percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.560" end="00:22:29.880" style="s2">population there isn&#39;t a large pool of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.970" end="00:22:32.850" style="s2">you know of other people like that so</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.880" end="00:22:39.090" style="s2">that was that was my burden in a way but</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.850" end="00:22:42.450" style="s2">um and I also did there there was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.090" end="00:22:46.200" style="s2">of darkness in LA in the late 70s and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.450" end="00:22:48.360" style="s2">into the early 80s I felt it I saw it in</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.200" end="00:22:51.180" style="s2">music I saw it as a kind of it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.360" end="00:22:54.930" style="s2">minimalism and it was a kind of numbness</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.180" end="00:22:57.930" style="s2">that was being explored in a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.930" end="00:23:00.270" style="s2">art and a lot of the music certainly in</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.930" end="00:23:04.080" style="s2">part of the punk scene and in the new</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.270" end="00:23:07.740" style="s2">wave scene but it was a numbness that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.080" end="00:23:09.150" style="s2">had a feeling as well it was numbness as</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.740" end="00:23:11.580" style="s2">I mean this is beautiful and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.150" end="00:23:14.580" style="s2">completely that to me was what</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.580" end="00:23:16.470" style="s2">influenced less than zero this notion</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.580" end="00:23:19.310" style="s2">that numbness was a feeling and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.470" end="00:23:23.910" style="s2">numbness was something that you could</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.310" end="00:23:27.060" style="s2">enter into and and play with and try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.910" end="00:23:31.050" style="s2">express in some ways and that was where</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.060" end="00:23:33.420" style="s2">I was at in my late teenage years in LA</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.050" end="00:23:35.190" style="s2">that was what was on my mind all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.420" end="00:23:37.110" style="s2">time and that&#39;s what influenced the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.190" end="00:23:38.610" style="s2">style and the tone of less than zero if</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.110" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">that makes any sense well this is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.610" end="00:23:41.190" style="s2">weird thing about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:44.580" style="s2">I&#39;ve never heard anyone say this</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.190" end="00:23:48.120" style="s2">numbness is home to me like there is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.580" end="00:23:53.370" style="s2">weird way I found myself driving the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.120" end="00:23:55.890" style="s2">Ventura Freeway after college and I had</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.370" end="00:23:57.510" style="s2">gone to some party that hadn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.890" end="00:24:00.300" style="s2">worked out and was unclear what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.510" end="00:24:02.430" style="s2">address was and whether somebody&#39;s was</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.300" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">squatting in somebody else&#39;s it like had</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.430" end="00:24:08.430" style="s2">all of these weird characteristics and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:10.830" style="s2">the emptiness just washed over me and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.430" end="00:24:14.730" style="s2">think Tom Petty was playing on the radio</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.830" end="00:24:17.910" style="s2">and I just felt I&#39;m totally numb</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.730" end="00:24:22.110" style="s2">I&#39;m completely alienated and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.910" end="00:24:24.990" style="s2">completely home that is what I felt but</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.110" end="00:24:29.070" style="s2">I do think that might be</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.990" end="00:24:33.179" style="s2">very specific to our generation so that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.070" end="00:24:36.270" style="s2">that&#39;s I think our generation is weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.179" end="00:24:39.179" style="s2">the key to a lot of what we see going on</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.270" end="00:24:41.940" style="s2">in general but because our generation is</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.179" end="00:24:44.490" style="s2">also invisible and because this place</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.940" end="00:24:45.960" style="s2">had very different characteristics I do</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.490" end="00:24:48.360" style="s2">see it that there&#39;s a little bit you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.960" end="00:24:50.520" style="s2">know the the portal theme here has to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.360" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">with trying to figure out how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.520" end="00:24:54.960" style="s2">out of all of these mysteries that were</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:59.399" style="s2">trapped within and culturally in in part</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.960" end="00:25:03.899" style="s2">my belief is that la pushed our a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.399" end="00:25:06.059" style="s2">this kind of nihilism to the world it</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.899" end="00:25:08.909" style="s2">couldn&#39;t easily travel and so you were</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.059" end="00:25:13.649" style="s2">talking about music before I remember</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.909" end="00:25:17.100" style="s2">being very cued into this band X Y s and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.649" end="00:25:19.169" style="s2">X I thought was going to be huge I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.100" end="00:25:22.440" style="s2">at a huge mistake on my part</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.169" end="00:25:24.480" style="s2">on mine too and how could it not be they</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.440" end="00:25:26.429" style="s2">were witty they had these weird</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.480" end="00:25:30.059" style="s2">harmonies I think that happened in</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.429" end="00:25:32.669" style="s2">fourths between John Doe and xzen Billy</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.059" end="00:25:34.980" style="s2">zoom Billy zoom was et a bone virus well</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.669" end="00:25:36.870" style="s2">the the drummer yeah but they get so do</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.980" end="00:25:38.850" style="s2">you remember the song their big hit</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.870" end="00:25:41.100" style="s2">regionally was the song Johnny hit and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.850" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">run Paulene or set him off the Los</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.100" end="00:25:45.510" style="s2">Angeles LP right now this song do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:49.470" style="s2">remember the lick the lyrics of how it</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.510" end="00:25:52.200" style="s2">goes um vaguely you got a rubato sterile</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.470" end="00:25:55.320" style="s2">hypo right shoot a sex machine drugs</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.200" end="00:25:58.529" style="s2">about serial rape he&#39;s got a rape 24</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.320" end="00:25:59.340" style="s2">women in 24 hours and the last one</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.529" end="00:26:02.520" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.340" end="00:26:06.690" style="s2">this thing is so off it&#39;s so dark it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.520" end="00:26:09.690" style="s2">so completely wrong and it felt normal</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.690" end="00:26:10.909" style="s2">for Los Angeles at the time yeah and it</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.690" end="00:26:12.899" style="s2">was like this massive miscalculation</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.909" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">that first of all no fault divorce</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.899" end="00:26:17.940" style="s2">hadn&#39;t happened nationwide like in New</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:21.390" style="s2">York it doesn&#39;t happen until I really</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.940" end="00:26:26.549" style="s2">late right and so there was something</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.390" end="00:26:28.980" style="s2">about this period that was highly</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.549" end="00:26:32.610" style="s2">regional but also was being broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.980" end="00:26:36.179" style="s2">everywhere even in kind of cryptic ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.610" end="00:26:38.730" style="s2">and I think that your book probably less</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.179" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">than zero probably looked kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.730" end="00:26:43.620" style="s2">mildly weirdly exaggerated to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:47.820" style="s2">outside world I don&#39;t think it was that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.620" end="00:26:50.220" style="s2">exaggerated well look certainly there</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.820" end="00:26:52.890" style="s2">were things in it that I wanted to do as</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.220" end="00:26:54.540" style="s2">a writer I certainly did not see a</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.890" end="00:26:56.760" style="s2">twelve-year-old girl get gang-raped</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.540" end="00:27:01.080" style="s2">which happens near the end of the book</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.760" end="00:27:03.870" style="s2">and where its treated as just as natural</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.080" end="00:27:05.040" style="s2">as stubbing your toe or something to</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.870" end="00:27:06.120" style="s2">come across something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.040" end="00:27:07.620" style="s2">isn&#39;t there&#39;s something about where</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.120" end="00:27:10.620" style="s2">people are hanging out with a corpse</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.620" end="00:27:12.419" style="s2">I mean well now that was based on</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.620" end="00:27:15.540" style="s2">something that I had heard you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.419" end="00:27:17.429" style="s2">kidding me there there and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.540" end="00:27:20.190" style="s2">story going around that there had been</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.429" end="00:27:23.490" style="s2">this person who would od&#39;d in an alley</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.190" end="00:27:27.030" style="s2">mm-hmm I think somewhere along Melrose</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.490" end="00:27:29.910" style="s2">this rumor went around in 1981-82 and</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.030" end="00:27:33.150" style="s2">that kids just were brought to see the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.910" end="00:27:35.280" style="s2">body of another kid and people had heard</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.150" end="00:27:37.470" style="s2">about it and someone would beat someone</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.280" end="00:27:39.809" style="s2">up at a party because of course remember</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.470" end="00:27:41.610" style="s2">there was no cell phones then and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.809" end="00:27:45.390" style="s2">people would come over find the space</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.610" end="00:27:48.570" style="s2">and just gawk at this dead body and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.390" end="00:27:52.470" style="s2">is a scene in less than zero but um</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.570" end="00:27:58.080" style="s2">overall I really did try to make it seem</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.470" end="00:28:00.090" style="s2">as realistic as possible and almost as</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.080" end="00:28:03.270" style="s2">if it was journalism almost as if it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.090" end="00:28:08.190" style="s2">reportage that clay of the narrator of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.270" end="00:28:10.830" style="s2">the book was really describing the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.190" end="00:28:12.780" style="s2">he was a part of but not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.830" end="00:28:14.880" style="s2">describing what his emotions were and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.780" end="00:28:17.429" style="s2">all of the things he was feeling during</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.880" end="00:28:20.220" style="s2">that time you understood that he was</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.429" end="00:28:21.809" style="s2">very detached and alienated because he</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.220" end="00:28:23.250" style="s2">never talked about himself and he just</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.809" end="00:28:25.350" style="s2">described what his friends would say he</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.250" end="00:28:27.660" style="s2">just just read what he would see what he</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.350" end="00:28:29.640" style="s2">would be seen and I think part of why</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.660" end="00:28:32.640" style="s2">the book works for people is that this</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.640" end="00:28:36.480" style="s2">voice never varies as the book gets</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.640" end="00:28:39.540" style="s2">darker and more violent and nightmarish</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.480" end="00:28:41.190" style="s2">in a way and so they&#39;re you know I guess</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.540" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was aiming for when I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.190" end="00:28:48.150" style="s2">writing it to find that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:51.240" style="s2">accumulation of power by resisting</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.150" end="00:28:51.990" style="s2">hyperbole and then describing everything</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.240" end="00:28:55.230" style="s2">in a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.990" end="00:28:57.020" style="s2">flat minimal way and of course writers</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.230" end="00:29:00.380" style="s2">in the past had done this but</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.020" end="00:29:04.770" style="s2">transposing that into a contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.380" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">teenager living in a big city was</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.770" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">something that I hadn&#39;t seen before</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:12.570" style="s2">teenagers in who were narrating novels</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.880" end="00:29:15.690" style="s2">were usually very emotional look going</p>

<p begin="00:29:26.040" end="00:29:31.050" style="s2">drifted away from your question which</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.110" end="00:29:34.080" style="s2">was kind of about I mean first of all</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.050" end="00:29:38.790" style="s2">getting back to X they were a part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.080" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">the reason that they didn&#39;t fully work</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.790" end="00:29:45.179" style="s2">as a band was that they didn&#39;t have hits</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:50.010" style="s2">they kept each subsequent studio album</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.179" end="00:29:54.210" style="s2">from Los Angeles - I guess what dealt</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.010" end="00:29:57.120" style="s2">toys yeah - under the big black Sun</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.210" end="00:30:01.080" style="s2">right and then I think it was the ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.120" end="00:30:03.890" style="s2">love grand was their stab at MTV kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.080" end="00:30:05.970" style="s2">a commercial relative the story then</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.890" end="00:30:07.320" style="s2">after under the big black so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.970" end="00:30:10.170" style="s2">thought that was my favorite of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.320" end="00:30:13.140" style="s2">three records that had been even more so</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.170" end="00:30:15.330" style="s2">than Los Angeles I there&#39;s the you see</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.140" end="00:30:21.470" style="s2">that the songwriting was kind of moving</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.330" end="00:30:25.530" style="s2">away from the really kind of rough speed</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.470" end="00:30:26.580" style="s2">rock of Los Angeles and entering into a</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.530" end="00:30:28.740" style="s2">kind of more thoughtful kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.580" end="00:30:32.130" style="s2">songwriting but for for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.740" end="00:30:36.179" style="s2">they never really broke and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.130" end="00:30:39.090" style="s2">think that they were a huge influence on</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.179" end="00:30:42.870" style="s2">less than zero one of the epic raps in</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.090" end="00:30:44.550" style="s2">less than zero is from X so I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.870" end="00:30:45.990" style="s2">obviously thinking about them but I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.550" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">also thinking about Led Zeppelin because</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.990" end="00:30:50.910" style="s2">Led Zeppelin is also the other epigraph</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:52.950" style="s2">in less than 0 but exaggerated I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.910" end="00:30:58.020" style="s2">know look as I said to you earlier I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.950" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">really ran with that story I heard and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.020" end="00:31:04.050" style="s2">also knew parts of from a couple of boys</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:05.510" style="s2">who were living on their own actually in</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.050" end="00:31:07.549" style="s2">Beverly Hills</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.510" end="00:31:10.549" style="s2">were not staying out of Malibu with</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.549" end="00:31:12.500" style="s2">their divorce dad couldn&#39;t deal with</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.549" end="00:31:15.020" style="s2">them and they&#39;ve got an apartment in</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.500" end="00:31:18.410" style="s2">town a 17 year olds or the father had</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.020" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">rented it for them and I often wondered</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.410" end="00:31:23.240" style="s2">how they had such nice clothes how they</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:25.340" style="s2">were able to go to this place or that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.240" end="00:31:28.610" style="s2">place and it was interesting because I</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.340" end="00:31:31.700" style="s2">look at that they knew a guy named Ronny</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.610" end="00:31:34.490" style="s2">Love Levine who was murdered by Johan of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.700" end="00:31:36.890" style="s2">the billionaires boys club is at Levine</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.490" end="00:31:38.360" style="s2">eleven Robert loves Levin right run 11</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.890" end="00:31:41.179" style="s2">this I should know this this was my high</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.360" end="00:31:44.929" style="s2">school and so I got to know Ron Levin</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.179" end="00:31:47.990" style="s2">through these kids we&#39;re all 16 and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.929" end="00:31:51.380" style="s2">remember this just goes to show an idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.990" end="00:31:53.330" style="s2">of what my adolescence was like we would</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.380" end="00:31:56.330" style="s2">congregate because we all had cars at</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.330" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">Ron Levin&#39;s and have drinks in wrong</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.330" end="00:32:00.830" style="s2">Levin&#39;s living room and then Ron Levin</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:03.950" style="s2">would pour us all into his convertible</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.830" end="00:32:07.429" style="s2">rolls-royce and we would all he would</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.950" end="00:32:12.110" style="s2">drive us two flippers which was a roller</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.429" end="00:32:15.320" style="s2">rink kind of bar disco that&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.110" end="00:32:18.620" style="s2">corner of La Cienega and Santa Monica</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.320" end="00:32:20.750" style="s2">Boulevard that is now a CVS we were and</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.620" end="00:32:23.030" style="s2">by the way this is a weeknight this is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.750" end="00:32:25.480" style="s2">school night and so we would go with Ron</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.030" end="00:32:29.390" style="s2">to his booth Ron must have been I guess</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.480" end="00:32:32.809" style="s2">48 47 maybe and he was gay very</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.390" end="00:32:34.549" style="s2">definitely gay and he would have six 16</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.809" end="00:32:36.919" style="s2">year old boys sitting with him at a</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.549" end="00:32:38.600" style="s2">booth flippers was all ages by the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.919" end="00:32:40.010" style="s2">there were a couple of clubs around town</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.600" end="00:32:42.590" style="s2">there were all ages he didn&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.010" end="00:32:44.900" style="s2">18 to get into somebody it was just a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.590" end="00:32:47.809" style="s2">short stop it I left this town when I</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.900" end="00:32:51.880" style="s2">was 16 and when I think about all of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.809" end="00:32:54.559" style="s2">stories that I had in clubs and bars</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.880" end="00:32:57.669" style="s2">they have to be 16 and earlier and it</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.559" end="00:33:02.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense to me um look I</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.669" end="00:33:04.130" style="s2">guess the drinking age was 18 in LA it</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.600" end="00:33:06.650" style="s2">didn&#39;t move to 21 until I think the</p>

<p begin="00:33:06.650" end="00:33:13.190" style="s2">when I was 16 in LA I got in everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.010" end="00:33:16.700" style="s2">I got into bars I was it ordered drinks</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.190" end="00:33:18.020" style="s2">I could get into the whisky on a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.700" end="00:33:21.530" style="s2">weeknight</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.020" end="00:33:23.210" style="s2">I never and all my friends did - I never</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.530" end="00:33:26.450" style="s2">remember having any problems with</p>

<p begin="00:33:26.450" end="00:33:29.900" style="s2">along those lines right like somebody</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.860" end="00:33:32.600" style="s2">would always know somebody the place was</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.900" end="00:33:36.140" style="s2">totally fluid and that the route I mean</p>

<p begin="00:33:36.140" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">nothing else about the lovin story it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.640" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">just it gives you an idea and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:42.620" style="s2">there was a little cocaine involved but</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:44.660" style="s2">that just gives you and that looked most</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.620" end="00:33:47.240" style="s2">of the 1980-1981</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.660" end="00:33:50.750" style="s2">that kind of just gives you an idea and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.240" end="00:33:52.370" style="s2">all and all nobody was damaged none of</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.750" end="00:33:53.660" style="s2">us were triggered none of us thought we</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.370" end="00:33:56.150" style="s2">had to go to the police</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.660" end="00:33:58.520" style="s2">none of everyone just felt tip okay but</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.150" end="00:34:00.620" style="s2">true but how many funerals did you go to</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.520" end="00:34:02.390" style="s2">back in the day I have to tell you I</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.620" end="00:34:05.630" style="s2">don&#39;t know I didn&#39;t go to anything I</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.390" end="00:34:08.929" style="s2">didn&#39;t I mean look I mean compared to</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.630" end="00:34:11.179" style="s2">now in terms or emergency rooms I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.929" end="00:34:15.169" style="s2">maybe funerals wasn&#39;t that much but they</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.179" end="00:34:16.940" style="s2">were all they were this was not cheap it</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.169" end="00:34:20.679" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that everybody was fine at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.940" end="00:34:23.919" style="s2">end of it no but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.679" end="00:34:26.510" style="s2">comparatively there was a kind of Gen X</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.919" end="00:34:28.520" style="s2">resiliency that&#39;s and strength which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.510" end="00:34:32.210" style="s2">what I want to get to okay but I do I</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.520" end="00:34:33.399" style="s2">think there is and I think that we were</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.480" end="00:34:53.720" style="s2">or 82 I didn&#39;t have friends who had</p>

<p begin="00:35:08.020" end="00:35:14.780" style="s2">the notion that no one believed you</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.540" end="00:35:17.150" style="s2">could get addicted to cocaine from 1982</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.780" end="00:35:18.950" style="s2">no one really believed that look I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.150" end="00:35:20.990" style="s2">know if I forgot anyone who&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.950" end="00:35:21.830" style="s2">addicted to cocaine either but back in</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.670" end="00:36:37.880" style="s2">analogy and I thought about that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.450" end="00:36:40.850" style="s2">then I thought about how how that gives</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.880" end="00:36:42.440" style="s2">way to the 70s and the 70s is this</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.850" end="00:36:46.100" style="s2">period it&#39;s like the Golden Age of</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.440" end="00:36:48.980" style="s2">serial killers yes and then you you end</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.100" end="00:36:51.110" style="s2">up with like this very weird concept of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.980" end="00:36:52.760" style="s2">privilege which is one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.110" end="00:36:55.700" style="s2">that the Millennials concept of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.760" end="00:36:57.320" style="s2">privilege absolutely doesn&#39;t work for me</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.700" end="00:37:00.380" style="s2">where you have like these very</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.320" end="00:37:04.970" style="s2">privileged schools and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.380" end="00:37:06.950" style="s2">murderous Club of investors who somehow</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.970" end="00:37:09.290" style="s2">the kids are just not happy with their</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.950" end="00:37:12.100" style="s2">station in life and you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.290" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">these schemes may be to kill parents and</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.100" end="00:37:19.910" style="s2">you know you get the Menendez brothers</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:21.830" style="s2">and I get the feeling that her feeling</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.910" end="00:37:24.020" style="s2">is that things ended with the murders on</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.830" end="00:37:26.950" style="s2">Cielo Drive and our story like just</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.020" end="00:37:30.080" style="s2">getting started in some weird way that</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.950" end="00:37:32.990" style="s2">60s versus the 70s is a big shift</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.080" end="00:37:36.470" style="s2">because the 60s had this horror and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.990" end="00:37:38.420" style="s2">idealism fused together yes and the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.470" end="00:37:41.500" style="s2">that the sort of the idealism just drops</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.420" end="00:37:44.260" style="s2">out but the horror keeps going yes</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.500" end="00:37:49.210" style="s2">I think you said something about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.260" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">very interesting about living here maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.210" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">you didn&#39;t say it maybe I&#39;m taking what</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:38:00.130" style="s2">you said and Moses unless about how I</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:38:03.250" style="s2">think me and my peers were very aware</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.130" end="00:38:06.970" style="s2">that we were living in a in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.250" end="00:38:10.869" style="s2">time that was a kind of movie and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.970" end="00:38:13.300" style="s2">was youth culture of the early 80s</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.869" end="00:38:14.950" style="s2">really seemed to be centered in LA you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.300" end="00:38:17.500" style="s2">saw it in all of the movies from Fast</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.950" end="00:38:19.720" style="s2">Times to valley girl to the music that</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.500" end="00:38:22.840" style="s2">was being made to the go-go&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.720" end="00:38:25.750" style="s2">thrown out there there there was this</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.840" end="00:38:28.450" style="s2">sense that we were at the red-hot center</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.750" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">of youth culture in Los Angeles in say</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.450" end="00:38:33.790" style="s2">1982 certainly look let&#39;s do some echo</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">of like Jim Carroll and the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.790" end="00:38:39.300" style="s2">coast yeah I guess so but there was</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:42.340" style="s2">something more interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.300" end="00:38:44.950" style="s2">contradicting about Los Angeles or</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.340" end="00:38:47.260" style="s2">something you know the darkness and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.950" end="00:38:51.099" style="s2">beach and whatever I mean it was this</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.260" end="00:38:54.839" style="s2">young yang thing and so um very being</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.099" end="00:38:58.330" style="s2">very aware of that of course adds I</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.839" end="00:39:01.390" style="s2">don&#39;t know a kind of artificiality about</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.330" end="00:39:03.430" style="s2">the way you interacted with people and</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.390" end="00:39:06.369" style="s2">the way behave now I&#39;m saying this not</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.430" end="00:39:09.760" style="s2">on a completely literal level I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.369" end="00:39:13.720" style="s2">this just an overall sense of a costume</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.760" end="00:39:15.220" style="s2">your car the decor of a nightclub that</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.720" end="00:39:18.730" style="s2">you would walk into and be very aware</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.220" end="00:39:21.430" style="s2">that you know this was the place just</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.730" end="00:39:24.430" style="s2">the staging is this really goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.430" end="00:39:27.300" style="s2">what you first talked about LA as this</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.430" end="00:39:30.369" style="s2">stage it&#39;s movie sets Sunset Boulevard</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.300" end="00:39:33.160" style="s2">cruising around Mulholland Drive going</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.369" end="00:39:35.619" style="s2">up to mom to get high the beach the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.160" end="00:39:39.070" style="s2">beach such a huge part of Southern</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.619" end="00:39:40.930" style="s2">California childhood but that&#39;s also not</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.070" end="00:39:42.609" style="s2">to say and to move it out for a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.930" end="00:39:43.089" style="s2">bit but you said this about the East</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.609" end="00:39:45.609" style="s2">Coast</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.089" end="00:39:48.550" style="s2">I felt that time for the East Coast</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.609" end="00:39:51.730" style="s2">wasn&#39;t necessarily the late 70s complete</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.550" end="00:39:54.010" style="s2">I think it comes in wolf for me I felt I</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.730" end="00:39:55.390" style="s2">was never more in a movie than I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.010" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">during the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.390" end="00:40:02.170" style="s2">yuppie years of the late 80s in New York</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:04.300" style="s2">right before the crash 1987 and that to</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.170" end="00:40:06.610" style="s2">me and even afterwards the crash didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.300" end="00:40:11.410" style="s2">really change or alter the way New York</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.610" end="00:40:14.230" style="s2">operated but 87 88 89 Manhattan to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.410" end="00:40:16.600" style="s2">was something as evocative as the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.230" end="00:40:18.760" style="s2">Roaring Twenties or the swinging 60s of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.600" end="00:40:23.260" style="s2">London you are very aware when was</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.760" end="00:40:25.360" style="s2">Gordon Gekko 87 okay so you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.260" end="00:40:27.160" style="s2">with the party you see from my</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.360" end="00:40:29.230" style="s2">trajectory was I I&#39;m in the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.160" end="00:40:31.500" style="s2">firmament with you in Los Angeles then I</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.230" end="00:40:34.090" style="s2">go to college on the East Coast and</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.500" end="00:40:35.980" style="s2">suddenly it occurs to me that the East</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.090" end="00:40:38.380" style="s2">Coast has not gone through this they are</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.980" end="00:40:40.540" style="s2">having right people are getting drunk on</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.380" end="00:40:44.610" style="s2">cold duck for the first time and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.540" end="00:40:47.260" style="s2">thinking that&#39;s so cute right because</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.610" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">drunk and cold duck in ninth grade but</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.260" end="00:40:55.660" style="s2">anyway I mean I mean that yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:58.150" style="s2">wasn&#39;t conscious of wanting to chase the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.660" end="00:41:00.520" style="s2">scene but I don&#39;t know how you felt but</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.150" end="00:41:02.320" style="s2">I felt growing up here which really now</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.520" end="00:41:04.420" style="s2">in retrospect was kind of glorious</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.320" end="00:41:07.060" style="s2">growing up as a teenager here in LA is</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.420" end="00:41:08.800" style="s2">like fantastic is the worst thing ever</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.060" end="00:41:10.180" style="s2">this is so interesting for a writer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.800" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">you&#39;re able to do so well look I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.180" end="00:41:13.060" style="s2">less than zero</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">would ya is a complete note that was it</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.060" end="00:41:21.490" style="s2">kind of yes but there there is also I</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">mean I gotta tell you Eric that so many</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.490" end="00:41:26.710" style="s2">people who read less than zero so many</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:28.120" style="s2">kids loved it because they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.710" end="00:41:29.800" style="s2">move here it won&#39;t be part of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.120" end="00:41:32.710" style="s2">that&#39;s a weird thing they thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.800" end="00:41:35.290" style="s2">so it was cool and it wasn&#39;t supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.710" end="00:41:38.620" style="s2">be in some weird way would but be when</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.290" end="00:41:41.440" style="s2">you have death and sex and money people</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.620" end="00:41:43.080" style="s2">react and respond medically even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.440" end="00:41:46.180" style="s2">the most unhealthy</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.080" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">well best here the late 70s here we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.180" end="00:41:50.110" style="s2">and they&#39;ll in the late 70s and into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:52.660" style="s2">early 80s but um I</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.110" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve locked completely lost my train of</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.660" end="00:42:01.180" style="s2">thought we were talking about oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:05.710" style="s2">I mean lesson zero was dark there was</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.180" end="00:42:07.040" style="s2">darkness around my the years that led up</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.710" end="00:42:09.290" style="s2">to me riding it</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.040" end="00:42:11.420" style="s2">but I also when I was living here I know</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.290" end="00:42:13.700" style="s2">what I wanted to say but it had to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.420" end="00:42:16.070" style="s2">with the fact that in so many ways I</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.700" end="00:42:19.010" style="s2">feel that we were lucky to grow up out</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.070" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">here yes it had its disadvantages and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.010" end="00:42:23.120" style="s2">its darkness but looking back I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">there there were things about it that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.120" end="00:42:30.170" style="s2">loved and maybe I loved them at 17 and</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.200" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">18 and you missed those two years of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.170" end="00:42:34.670" style="s2">massive freedom that one would have we</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.720" end="00:42:36.890" style="s2">weren&#39;t living out here in 1718 where</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.670" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">you graduated at 16 and then you went</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.890" end="00:42:43.940" style="s2">off or did you stay here no no I was I</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:46.730" style="s2">was I I was 16 turned 17 in Philadelphia</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.940" end="00:42:51.590" style="s2">okay and then I was in Boston and what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.730" end="00:42:54.830" style="s2">found was that I mean just to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.590" end="00:42:57.860" style="s2">honest about it I I&#39;ve stayed away from</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.830" end="00:43:00.620" style="s2">the city really for 37 years because I</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.860" end="00:43:04.700" style="s2">just thought it was the blackest darkest</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.620" end="00:43:06.980" style="s2">most seductive hellhole which it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.700" end="00:43:09.200" style="s2">which is which it is and it can be and</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.980" end="00:43:13.850" style="s2">it was generative I mean it so that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.200" end="00:43:17.510" style="s2">notion of repulsion and fascination and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.850" end="00:43:21.410" style="s2">home and total alienation it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.510" end="00:43:23.390" style="s2">impossible to talk about because it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:43:26.660" end="00:43:32.930" style="s2">and and meaning and that bundling didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.710" end="00:43:35.300" style="s2">happen and what I start you know if I</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.930" end="00:43:36.620" style="s2">think about the title of this film that</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.300" end="00:43:38.870" style="s2">you probably remember the decline of</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.520" end="00:43:48.890" style="s2">overblown and in many ways I actually</p>

<p begin="00:45:26.390" end="00:45:32.839" style="s2">up in that world where as as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.950" end="00:45:35.390" style="s2">can remember I play back so many scenes</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.839" end="00:45:37.579" style="s2">from the 70s and I can&#39;t see grown-ups</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.390" end="00:45:39.290" style="s2">the moms in particular apps and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.579" end="00:45:41.569" style="s2">the dads have been apps in a long time</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.290" end="00:45:44.690" style="s2">yeah but like the mobs are somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.569" end="00:45:47.210" style="s2">else but where were they because I would</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.210" end="00:45:50.930" style="s2">work so where were they were they up in</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.369" end="00:45:53.300" style="s2">their bedrooms were they out having</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.930" end="00:45:55.190" style="s2">lunch with their friends yeah well do</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.300" end="00:45:57.410" style="s2">you remember I mean I remember some moms</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.190" end="00:45:59.000" style="s2">but sometimes mom was getting high with</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.410" end="00:46:00.920" style="s2">the kids I remember that was a</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.000" end="00:46:03.140" style="s2">particular mom there were moms who were</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.920" end="00:46:04.420" style="s2">looking for mr. Goodbar you know moms</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.140" end="00:46:06.140" style="s2">were trying to find some</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.420" end="00:46:08.690" style="s2">self-actualization and that the women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.140" end="00:46:10.190" style="s2">movement promised maybe there&#39;s some new</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.690" end="00:46:12.260" style="s2">thing to do but everybody was hard</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.190" end="00:46:16.040" style="s2">having a hard time finding what that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.260" end="00:46:18.260" style="s2">right I think getting back to one thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.040" end="00:46:23.780" style="s2">you said before we move on to that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.260" end="00:46:27.650" style="s2">that the real darkness for me had to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.780" end="00:46:30.560" style="s2">with the Manson Family and the Manson</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.650" end="00:46:32.450" style="s2">Family haunted my childhood and my</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.560" end="00:46:33.440" style="s2">adolescence and still haunts my notion</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.450" end="00:46:36.310" style="s2">of Los Angeles</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.440" end="00:46:39.590" style="s2">so if I had to choose something that I</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.310" end="00:46:42.140" style="s2">fixated on and honestly became obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.590" end="00:46:44.690" style="s2">by were the tate-labianca murders and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.140" end="00:46:47.240" style="s2">the Manson Family and that book that</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.690" end="00:46:48.950" style="s2">Vincent Bugliosi wrote about the case of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.240" end="00:46:52.070" style="s2">helter skelter was kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.950" end="00:46:56.840" style="s2">strange Bible for me and it became a</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.070" end="00:47:02.840" style="s2">kind of a dark touchstone yes there</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.840" end="00:47:06.020" style="s2">there I still saw and I was still in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.840" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">group of people who were trying to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.020" end="00:47:10.970" style="s2">fun and when I was in adolescence in LA</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:13.880" style="s2">and especially when we were free with</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.970" end="00:47:18.920" style="s2">our cars and basically free from our</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.880" end="00:47:21.320" style="s2">parents and had that kind of sense of I</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.920" end="00:47:26.060" style="s2">don&#39;t know ascendancy or being able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.320" end="00:47:28.730" style="s2">go anywhere we we wanted to it erased</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.060" end="00:47:31.160" style="s2">some of the darkness I mean I I there</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.730" end="00:47:34.400" style="s2">there was a lot of opportunity to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.160" end="00:47:37.580" style="s2">fun out here but I also have to say and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.400" end="00:47:39.710" style="s2">this I think connects more with what in</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.580" end="00:47:41.120" style="s2">a way what your trajectory was I want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.710" end="00:47:42.860" style="s2">get out mmm</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.120" end="00:47:45.970" style="s2">I did not want to stay here oh so you</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.860" end="00:47:49.610" style="s2">okay I wanted to get out and I knew at</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.970" end="00:47:51.770" style="s2">14 I wanted to get out and I had to wait</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.610" end="00:47:54.950" style="s2">for the plan to happen because when I</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.770" end="00:47:58.340" style="s2">was 18 boom I was gonna go as far away</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.950" end="00:48:01.390" style="s2">from here as possible I did ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.340" end="00:48:04.160" style="s2">feel I think what you felt I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.390" end="00:48:07.730" style="s2">beneath the facade of beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.160" end="00:48:11.780" style="s2">teenagers and you know lovely setting</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.730" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">and nice houses that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.780" end="00:48:17.750" style="s2">darkness that was encroaching upon</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:20.330" style="s2">everything and it really did notice it</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.750" end="00:48:22.610" style="s2">much more strongly after I&#39;d left for a</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.330" end="00:48:24.080" style="s2">year and I came back Ashley Ashley left</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.610" end="00:48:26.000" style="s2">for five or six months and came back</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.080" end="00:48:28.160" style="s2">after I went to college for my first</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.000" end="00:48:30.980" style="s2">term but that was always the plan and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.160" end="00:48:33.020" style="s2">remember seeing so many movies that took</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.980" end="00:48:35.300" style="s2">place in New York even if they were dark</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.020" end="00:48:36.860" style="s2">as hell I wanted to go there and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.300" end="00:48:38.870" style="s2">remember seeing Woody Allen&#39;s Manhattan</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.860" end="00:48:41.180" style="s2">for example and that&#39;s where I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.870" end="00:48:44.540" style="s2">to be I&#39;m going to be in that world I</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.180" end="00:48:46.850" style="s2">mean now that world nauseates me</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.540" end="00:48:48.470" style="s2">but at the time I was 14 or 15</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.850" end="00:48:49.700" style="s2">that was the goal and I was going to go</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.470" end="00:48:52.580" style="s2">to college back east and then I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.700" end="00:48:54.290" style="s2">going to move to New York all of my</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.580" end="00:48:55.460" style="s2">friends stayed out here all of my</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.290" end="00:48:57.920" style="s2">friends were going to get into the film</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.460" end="00:48:59.390" style="s2">business because that&#39;s what la is I</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.920" end="00:49:01.250" style="s2">mean in a certain if you live in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.390" end="00:49:03.920" style="s2">certain area of LA it is a company town</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.250" end="00:49:05.420" style="s2">and you end up you know working for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.920" end="00:49:07.670" style="s2">company which is the entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.420" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">complex and that is what happened my</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.670" end="00:49:12.920" style="s2">four closest male friends all got into</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:16.220" style="s2">the business really and that was what I</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.920" end="00:49:18.500" style="s2">was supposed to be doing too because we</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.220" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">were all making movies and writing</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.500" end="00:49:24.110" style="s2">scripts when were teenagers and all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.200" end="00:49:26.600" style="s2">our fathers mine accepted were somehow</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.110" end="00:49:30.170" style="s2">involved in the industry and that was</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.600" end="00:49:33.770" style="s2">going to be the next move and it just I</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.170" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">was writing novels and I was working on</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.770" end="00:49:39.740" style="s2">less than zero when I was 17 18 16 17 18</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:42.470" style="s2">and I knew I had to go I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.740" end="00:49:45.680" style="s2">you must have felt that to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.470" end="00:49:48.920" style="s2">in order to I mean I don&#39;t know if the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.680" end="00:49:51.550" style="s2">escape was your choice but the escape</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.920" end="00:49:56.930" style="s2">from LA was certainly mine I only</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.550" end="00:49:59.540" style="s2">applied to colleges back east and and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.930" end="00:50:01.700" style="s2">and so I knew senior year that this was</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.540" end="00:50:03.710" style="s2">going to be over at a certain point and</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.700" end="00:50:05.420" style="s2">that summer of 82 I just could not wait</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.710" end="00:50:10.730" style="s2">forward to well that&#39;s the Running Room</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.420" end="00:50:13.520" style="s2">I mean that we we were we were living</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.730" end="00:50:15.860" style="s2">through a something that I think hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:18.200" style="s2">been understood or digested in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.860" end="00:50:20.750" style="s2">its importance and I think that if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.200" end="00:50:23.030" style="s2">think about well it&#39;s being resisted</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.750" end="00:50:25.370" style="s2">because I talk about it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.030" end="00:50:27.860" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s being resisted people</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.370" end="00:50:31.130" style="s2">don&#39;t want to believe that this happened</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.860" end="00:50:33.260" style="s2">and that we were we&#39;re okay they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.130" end="00:50:35.180" style="s2">contradicts it contradicts what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.260" end="00:50:38.390" style="s2">called the gated institutional narrative</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.180" end="00:50:40.070" style="s2">that there is this thing where the New</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.390" end="00:50:42.680" style="s2">York Times is talking to the political</p>

<p begin="00:50:48.980" end="00:50:55.550" style="s2">cracking and we have this funny thing</p>

<p begin="00:50:59.630" end="00:51:03.740" style="s2">yeah then you have the anti-trump errs</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.640" end="00:51:05.810" style="s2">who are the people who are completely</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.740" end="00:51:08.180" style="s2">deranged by any mention of Trump</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.810" end="00:51:10.130" style="s2">whatever he said my was partner my</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.180" end="00:51:13.160" style="s2">boyfriend yeah your boy failure is a</p>

<p begin="00:51:34.670" end="00:51:41.090" style="s2">my belief is that if you were an anti</p>

<p begin="00:51:41.090" end="00:51:47.120" style="s2">Trump er that is I against Trump right</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.150" end="00:51:50.690" style="s2">but mere mention of his name doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.120" end="00:51:52.850" style="s2">send me into paroxysms I don&#39;t write I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.690" end="00:51:54.260" style="s2">not apoplectic with rage when he said</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.850" end="00:51:56.420" style="s2">something that&#39;s been carefully</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.260" end="00:51:59.030" style="s2">constructed to set everybody off who</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.420" end="00:52:00.740" style="s2">carries certain behavior pattern right</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.030" end="00:52:02.480" style="s2">and so what my belief is is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.740" end="00:52:05.290" style="s2">going through a very private weird</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.480" end="00:52:08.390" style="s2">little mini hell in which I</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.290" end="00:52:11.270" style="s2">intellectually can&#39;t stand the guy but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.390" end="00:52:13.520" style="s2">understand him very well yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.270" end="00:52:15.560" style="s2">understand why it works I&#39;ve predicted</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.520" end="00:52:18.380" style="s2">this in some weird way I wrote an essay</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.560" end="00:52:20.330" style="s2">on kayfabe I don&#39;t know if you I do yes</p>

<p begin="00:52:28.700" end="00:52:33.710" style="s2">press release positive I thought</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.870" end="00:52:35.570" style="s2">everyone was lying about their feelings</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.710" end="00:52:38.660" style="s2">about Trump when they were asked about</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.570" end="00:52:41.630" style="s2">it public well because you you needed it</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.660" end="00:52:44.870" style="s2">you needed to say how horrible he was if</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.630" end="00:52:47.420" style="s2">you were part of the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.870" end="00:52:49.340" style="s2">milieu or if you needed to keep a job</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.420" end="00:52:53.120" style="s2">and make sure that you weren&#39;t on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.340" end="00:52:55.880" style="s2">wrong side of your clients and what what</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.120" end="00:52:58.310" style="s2">has been go what I find very frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.880" end="00:53:00.860" style="s2">I mean you have to appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.310" end="00:53:03.440" style="s2">mainstream has no positive interest in</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.860" end="00:53:07.280" style="s2">this show me or anything that my group</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.440" end="00:53:11.030" style="s2">is doing whatsoever right yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.280" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not just I mean it it&#39;s the fact</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.030" end="00:53:19.260" style="s2">that we have this very negative</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:21.990" style="s2">view of CNN and NPR not what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.260" end="00:53:24.210" style="s2">supposedly standing for right right so</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.990" end="00:53:26.220" style="s2">this in this narrative you know I guess</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.210" end="00:53:30.900" style="s2">what my take on it is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.220" end="00:53:35.940" style="s2">dominant I don&#39;t even know how to say</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.900" end="00:53:38.040" style="s2">idealism of a time is usually a false</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.940" end="00:53:40.020" style="s2">narrative that&#39;s hiding how people can</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.040" end="00:53:42.720" style="s2">make money during that period right</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.020" end="00:53:46.920" style="s2">right we are the world all right is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.720" end="00:53:49.890" style="s2">portrayal of concern about Africa the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.920" end="00:53:52.650" style="s2">poor in Asia what can we do to uplift</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.890" end="00:53:55.680" style="s2">the people but really it was a story</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.650" end="00:53:59.130" style="s2">about if we don&#39;t break our bonds to our</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.680" end="00:54:02.010" style="s2">fellow countrymen if we don&#39;t make sure</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.130" end="00:54:04.380" style="s2">that we can not have to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.010" end="00:54:07.910" style="s2">Appalachia and the poor in the south and</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.380" end="00:54:09.930" style="s2">the downtrodden in our inner cities</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.910" end="00:54:12.359" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna be able to make money</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.930" end="00:54:15.059" style="s2">the way to make money is to move</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.359" end="00:54:18.180" style="s2">operations overseas to keep your you</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.059" end="00:54:21.299" style="s2">know your country with its headquarters</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.180" end="00:54:24.329" style="s2">wherever its tax-advantaged that there</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.299" end="00:54:26.910" style="s2">was some process by which globalization</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.329" end="00:54:32.010" style="s2">was the betrayal of your countrymen</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.910" end="00:54:34.549" style="s2">right and that thing was portrayed as</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.010" end="00:54:37.859" style="s2">the Davos idealism yeah and the Davos</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.549" end="00:54:40.410" style="s2">idealism is cratering yeah because it</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.859" end="00:54:42.750" style="s2">was a wealth transfer program posing as</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.410" end="00:54:44.309" style="s2">a philanthropic effort right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.750" end="00:54:46.380" style="s2">reason that nobody wants the Clintons</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.309" end="00:54:49.859" style="s2">nobody wants the Democratic Party nobody</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.380" end="00:54:51.930" style="s2">wants the sanctimonious nonsense about</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.859" end="00:54:55.079" style="s2">you know our thirst for justice and our</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.930" end="00:54:57.599" style="s2">hatred of oppression is is that this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.079" end="00:54:59.309" style="s2">a search for a constituency that&#39;s large</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.599" end="00:55:01.920" style="s2">enough to get people elected who can</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.309" end="00:55:03.660" style="s2">continue to keep people making money who</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.920" end="00:55:07.559" style="s2">have been figuring out how to make money</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.660" end="00:55:09.900" style="s2">and Trump the reason I&#39;m anti Trump is</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.559" end="00:55:12.210" style="s2">is that he&#39;s taking lots of ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.900" end="00:55:16.940" style="s2">are actually originally wholesome and</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.210" end="00:55:21.420" style="s2">he&#39;s giving them this shitty kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.940" end="00:55:22.710" style="s2">mean-spirited nasty spin like for</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.420" end="00:55:24.839" style="s2">example there is nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.710" end="00:55:26.700" style="s2">restriction ISM whatsoever there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.839" end="00:55:29.099" style="s2">nothing xenophobic about history</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.700" end="00:55:31.470" style="s2">right the desire to want to keep a</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.099" end="00:55:33.960" style="s2">border is not a xenophobic early</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.470" end="00:55:37.320" style="s2">I completely agree okay so when he</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.960" end="00:55:39.210" style="s2">tinges it with hints you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.320" end="00:55:40.829" style="s2">playing around with something he knows</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.210" end="00:55:42.810" style="s2">what the inference patterns of the left</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.829" end="00:55:44.339" style="s2">are so we&#39;ll say something and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.810" end="00:55:46.470" style="s2">levant will say oh my god you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.339" end="00:55:48.750" style="s2">saying that you know you think all</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.470" end="00:55:51.359" style="s2">Mexicans are rapists and then the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.750" end="00:55:52.890" style="s2">Wrights fault is that pardon I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.359" end="00:55:53.700" style="s2">whose fault is that I mean that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.890" end="00:55:56.550" style="s2">lefts fault</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.700" end="00:55:59.609" style="s2">from taking the bait or overreact no</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.550" end="00:56:02.369" style="s2">it&#39;s not that they figured out a means</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.609" end="00:56:04.290" style="s2">of keeping people in line whereas as you</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.369" end="00:56:06.810" style="s2">start to explore something that will</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.290" end="00:56:09.510" style="s2">stop the money-making that the transfer</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.810" end="00:56:11.849" style="s2">of wealth from whoever it&#39;s like force</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.510" end="00:56:14.280" style="s2">transfusion right the institutional left</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.849" end="00:56:19.490" style="s2">I believe figures out how to transfuse</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.280" end="00:56:22.680" style="s2">one group to supply blood to another and</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.490" end="00:56:24.630" style="s2">what what the left is supposed to be is</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.680" end="00:56:26.970" style="s2">something you know more wholesome and</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.630" end="00:56:28.920" style="s2">more decent as you start to question the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.970" end="00:56:30.390" style="s2">transfusion mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.920" end="00:56:32.220" style="s2">you start to get this question like</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.390" end="00:56:33.720" style="s2">surely you&#39;re not suggesting that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.220" end="00:56:37.609" style="s2">should close our borders to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.720" end="00:56:40.500" style="s2">downtrodden s&#39;right and Trump is saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.609" end="00:56:41.880" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not scared I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.500" end="00:56:43.920" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna back me off by just</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.880" end="00:56:48.060" style="s2">saying that surely you weren&#39;t saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.920" end="00:56:51.000" style="s2">you know that&#39;s a menacing tone and for</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.060" end="00:56:53.790" style="s2">that many people love him because do you</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.000" end="00:56:58.920" style="s2">remember the scene in Reservoir Dogs of</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.790" end="00:57:01.619" style="s2">Tarantino where you&#39;ve got I guess is it</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.920" end="00:57:04.530" style="s2">Steve Buscemi and I can&#39;t remember the</p>

<p begin="00:57:04.530" end="00:57:09.390" style="s2">rat is and mr. blonde comes in and mr.</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.589" end="00:57:11.130" style="s2">blonde is the psychopath who shot up the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.390" end="00:57:12.510" style="s2">jewelry store right and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.130" end="00:57:14.190" style="s2">figure out who they can trust the only</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.510" end="00:57:16.079" style="s2">person you can trust is the psychopath</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.190" end="00:57:17.119" style="s2">because the psychopath isn&#39;t under</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.079" end="00:57:20.240" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.119" end="00:57:23.609" style="s2">well Trump came through as mr. blonde</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.240" end="00:57:26.010" style="s2">mm-hmm and the one person we know isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.609" end="00:57:27.660" style="s2">under institutional control is Donald</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.010" end="00:57:32.130" style="s2">Trump because he would never say those</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.660" end="00:57:33.750" style="s2">things okay so now we&#39;ve got a new</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.130" end="00:57:37.380" style="s2">paradigm where the only trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.750" end="00:57:40.049" style="s2">person is the least trustworthy person</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.380" end="00:57:43.049" style="s2">which I&#39;ve been trying to map this out</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.049" end="00:57:44.759" style="s2">and the problem with it is you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:00:09.540" end="01:00:12.930" style="s2">anything but Trump because Trump drove</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.130" end="01:00:16.620" style="s2">him insane and there was just no</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.930" end="01:00:18.270" style="s2">way that Trump could be elected</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.620" end="01:00:21.420" style="s2">president so that was all going to be um</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.270" end="01:00:24.030" style="s2">but you know so I did know and I and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.420" end="01:00:26.100" style="s2">write about this in white people said</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.030" end="01:00:26.820" style="s2">don&#39;t tell anybody I&#39;m going to vote for</p>

<p begin="01:00:28.950" end="01:00:39.210" style="s2">and so I wasn&#39;t completely surprised</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.850" end="01:00:41.190" style="s2">when Trump won but in but what surprised</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.210" end="01:00:43.260" style="s2">me and this ties into what you were</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.190" end="01:00:45.060" style="s2">first asking what completely surprised</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.260" end="01:00:48.590" style="s2">me for the next two years leading up to</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.060" end="01:00:54.050" style="s2">now is how so many of my smart friends</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.590" end="01:00:56.100" style="s2">became infected by Trump look look the</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.050" end="01:00:58.860" style="s2">same or what do you mean by that and</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.100" end="01:01:02.040" style="s2">well look all of our narratives we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.860" end="01:01:03.210" style="s2">been forced to deal with Trump I talked</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.040" end="01:01:07.500" style="s2">about this in an interview that I gave</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.210" end="01:01:10.440" style="s2">with Washington Post where I even if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.500" end="01:01:12.420" style="s2">don&#39;t want Trump in your life he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.440" end="01:01:14.310" style="s2">your life and you have to have an</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.420" end="01:01:16.170" style="s2">opinion about him because everyone else</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.310" end="01:01:19.050" style="s2">is talking about him either people</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.170" end="01:01:21.210" style="s2">loathe into such a degree that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.050" end="01:01:22.830" style="s2">sucked into the conversation and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.210" end="01:01:26.460" style="s2">believe it&#39;s the same with people who</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.830" end="01:01:30.870" style="s2">love him and I just what was a huge</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.460" end="01:01:33.840" style="s2">exhale what was that about no no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.870" end="01:01:36.450" style="s2">with you I&#39;m with you I want to write an</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.840" end="01:01:39.830" style="s2">Eliza program I swear I could write a</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.450" end="01:01:43.200" style="s2">small program that generates his tweets</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.830" end="01:01:46.620" style="s2">like for example before Trump I had a</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.200" end="01:01:49.110" style="s2">simple idea which is that if I wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.620" end="01:01:50.970" style="s2">win in an election as a Republican all I</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.110" end="01:01:54.180" style="s2">would have to do is to talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.970" end="01:01:56.760" style="s2">nuclear family and every educated person</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.180" end="01:01:59.940" style="s2">would say you mean nuclear not new</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.760" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">killer and then they&#39;d lose it was like</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.940" end="01:02:04.000" style="s2">an automated reaction that there was a</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:07.050" style="s2">class thing that says</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.000" end="01:02:10.360" style="s2">correct anyone who says nucular okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.050" end="01:02:12.160" style="s2">well that&#39;s a pretty simple program yes</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.360" end="01:02:14.470" style="s2">you win the correct pronunciation of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.160" end="01:02:15.700" style="s2">word nuclear and you lose an election</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.470" end="01:02:18.640" style="s2">because you&#39;re a dick</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.700" end="01:02:20.920" style="s2">alright so Trump is going to hit this</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.640" end="01:02:24.400" style="s2">thing over and over again it&#39;s a the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.920" end="01:02:27.880" style="s2">left is programmed to say certain things</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.400" end="01:02:29.380" style="s2">to defend certain things and you know if</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.880" end="01:02:32.710" style="s2">you have to make the point that there is</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.380" end="01:02:35.380" style="s2">absolutely zero connection whatsoever</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.710" end="01:02:38.500" style="s2">between Islam and terror there is no</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.380" end="01:02:42.370" style="s2">connection whatsoever zero it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.500" end="01:02:44.830" style="s2">illusion okay somebody can hit that I</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.370" end="01:02:46.660" style="s2">mean all day long every day</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.830" end="01:02:50.260" style="s2">well I remember reading an issue of</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.660" end="01:02:52.240" style="s2">dabiq put out by Isis where their point</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.260" end="01:02:55.060" style="s2">was I think was called that they had an</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.240" end="01:02:57.100" style="s2">article called why we hate you why we</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.060" end="01:02:59.020" style="s2">fight you and they said you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.100" end="01:03:01.660" style="s2">marginalized all the people in your</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.020" end="01:03:04.300" style="s2">society who point out that there is an</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.660" end="01:03:05.860" style="s2">aspect of fundamentalist jihadi Islam</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.300" end="01:03:07.500" style="s2">that just hates you because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.860" end="01:03:12.610" style="s2">believe in all of the way we do and</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.500" end="01:03:15.340" style="s2">because that couldn&#39;t be said like they</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.610" end="01:03:17.080" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be said I mean that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.340" end="01:03:21.130" style="s2">there&#39;s what the break I okay well as a</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.080" end="01:03:25.660" style="s2">general sit there there was once upon a</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.130" end="01:03:28.780" style="s2">time a heuristic that said the best way</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.660" end="01:03:30.400" style="s2">to have a multicultural society is is</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.780" end="01:03:33.130" style="s2">that you have to have some load bearing</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.400" end="01:03:35.530" style="s2">fictions like all religions are equally</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.130" end="01:03:37.080" style="s2">problematic in all ways there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.530" end="01:03:39.700" style="s2">that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.080" end="01:03:41.620" style="s2">Jane you know Jane&#39;s are not equally</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.700" end="01:03:43.630" style="s2">problematic as Jews Jews are more</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.620" end="01:03:44.710" style="s2">problematic than Jane&#39;s and I&#39;m able to</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.630" end="01:03:50.100" style="s2">say that because I&#39;m Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.710" end="01:03:52.690" style="s2">okay as a result those heuristics</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.100" end="01:03:56.620" style="s2">hardened into dogmas because they were</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.690" end="01:03:59.290" style="s2">necessary to keep our society operating</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.620" end="01:04:02.350" style="s2">we have to believe at the moment that a</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.290" end="01:04:04.210" style="s2">jury of 12 people knows how to convict</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.350" end="01:04:06.070" style="s2">somebody based on guilt even though that</p>

<p begin="01:04:06.070" end="01:04:12.160" style="s2">real rubric okay well I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.070" end="01:04:15.160" style="s2">heuristic maybe it maybe it works some</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.160" end="01:04:17.740" style="s2">of the time right okay so as these sort</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.160" end="01:04:17.920" style="s2">of heuristics have been breaking down in</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.740" end="01:04:20.470" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.920" end="01:04:22.359" style="s2">heuristics of the left are on top of the</p>

<p begin="01:04:35.470" end="01:04:40.720" style="s2">moronic right right but it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.690" end="01:04:43.390" style="s2">recently that you have economists like</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.720" end="01:04:45.490" style="s2">Brad DeLong saying actually it&#39;s a so</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.390" end="01:04:49.380" style="s2">you know what you&#39;re optimizing is a</p>

<p begin="01:05:31.770" end="01:05:38.920" style="s2">extremely new into the conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.910" end="01:05:40.750" style="s2">the left can deal with it the media can</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.920" end="01:05:42.940" style="s2">deal with it I always felt that if they</p>

<p begin="01:05:42.940" end="01:05:47.650" style="s2">way and just reported what he did</p>

<p begin="01:05:47.650" end="01:05:52.869" style="s2">if he would have won necessarily because</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.119" end="01:05:56.220" style="s2">all of just smart honest people had to</p>

<p begin="01:05:56.220" end="01:06:04.270" style="s2">terrifying well no no no it is your</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.040" end="01:06:05.829" style="s2">universal expulsion yeah of people who</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.270" end="01:06:07.839" style="s2">will not go along with the gated</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.829" end="01:06:10.540" style="s2">institutional night my theory about this</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.839" end="01:06:12.970" style="s2">if you haven&#39;t met it is that we grew</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.540" end="01:06:14.980" style="s2">very quickly in a very stable way that</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.970" end="01:06:19.569" style="s2">was totally anomalous post-world War two</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.980" end="01:06:21.910" style="s2">to about 1972 and every single</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.569" end="01:06:23.980" style="s2">institution that you see has an</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.910" end="01:06:26.650" style="s2">expectation of that kind of growth</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.980" end="01:06:28.359" style="s2">continuing and so what happened is is</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.650" end="01:06:31.420" style="s2">that all of those institutions when they</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.359" end="01:06:33.220" style="s2">went pathological they</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.420" end="01:06:35.640" style="s2">became ponzi schemes and you needed to</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.220" end="01:06:37.630" style="s2">have a group of people in that</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.640" end="01:06:39.609" style="s2">institution who would not reveal the</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.630" end="01:06:43.210" style="s2">Ponzi scheme and so effectively our</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.609" end="01:06:45.220" style="s2">expert class has been selected for as</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.210" end="01:06:48.369" style="s2">the people who will not blow the whistle</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.220" end="01:06:49.990" style="s2">on the fact that they&#39;re lying all right</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.369" end="01:06:51.579" style="s2">right and so you can get this at Harvard</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.990" end="01:06:53.530" style="s2">or you can get this at Stanford maybe</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.579" end="01:06:55.960" style="s2">the University of Chicago is something</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.530" end="01:06:58.299" style="s2">of an exception Hollywood while</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.960" end="01:07:01.569" style="s2">Hollywood is right exactly Lacan Valley</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.299" end="01:07:03.520" style="s2">and so all of these institutional things</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.569" end="01:07:06.220" style="s2">are suffering from the embedded growth</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.520" end="01:07:10.930" style="s2">obligation disease or ego right and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.220" end="01:07:13.450" style="s2">these egos have turned like the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.930" end="01:07:17.530" style="s2">institutions are not interested in</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.450" end="01:07:19.839" style="s2">hearing how to beat Trump because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.530" end="01:07:21.369" style="s2">easy it&#39;s easy to be Trump it is but the</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.839" end="01:07:22.900" style="s2">only problem is is that if you beat</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.369" end="01:07:25.270" style="s2">Trump in the way that&#39;s easy to beat</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.900" end="01:07:27.400" style="s2">Trump you will not service the people</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.270" end="01:07:30.040" style="s2">with second and third homes in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.400" end="01:07:32.619" style="s2">Hamptons right right and so those people</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.040" end="01:07:36.220" style="s2">are saying well I wasn&#39;t thinking of</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.619" end="01:07:38.500" style="s2">spending that much to beat Trump right</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.220" end="01:07:41.770" style="s2">no no that&#39;s really yeah that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.500" end="01:07:44.500" style="s2">issue is is that right now I the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.770" end="01:07:49.599" style="s2">exciting part is I want to retake the</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.500" end="01:07:51.490" style="s2">institution&#39;s do you do you really want</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.599" end="01:07:53.589" style="s2">nine conservative Supreme Court justices</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.490" end="01:07:56.589" style="s2">if you do if you if that&#39;s if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.589" end="01:07:59.790" style="s2">what excites you no I highly recommend</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.589" end="01:08:01.809" style="s2">talking about reparations for slavery</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.790" end="01:08:04.240" style="s2">well why don&#39;t you tell something some</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.809" end="01:08:06.040" style="s2">sort of a child Holocaust survivor that</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.240" end="01:08:10.059" style="s2">they need to pay reparations for slavery</p>

<p begin="01:08:44.000" end="01:08:48.710" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna write all wrongs it</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.800" end="01:08:52.010" style="s2">would be absolutely unjust to go after</p>

<p begin="01:09:17.780" end="01:09:25.160" style="s2">look I think part of why I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.340" end="01:09:29.000" style="s2">sensitive about this is that because I</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.160" end="01:09:31.520" style="s2">am a gen Xer I think boomers like my</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.000" end="01:09:35.330" style="s2">parents like my mom my stepdad Laurie</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.520" end="01:09:38.570" style="s2">Paris born my father was born in Nevada</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.330" end="01:09:41.570" style="s2">and my mother in Illinois they were born</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.570" end="01:09:45.050" style="s2">in the you know technically not island</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.570" end="01:09:47.540" style="s2">they&#39;re silent but but my mom completely</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.050" end="01:09:49.400" style="s2">relates to boom right my dad technically</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.540" end="01:09:52.880" style="s2">you&#39;re the last boomer yes I am but I</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.400" end="01:09:54.590" style="s2">know I know I know that you are but turn</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.880" end="01:09:56.270" style="s2">in terms of the chart right right right</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.590" end="01:09:58.280" style="s2">in terms of the chart so yes my parents</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.270" end="01:10:01.100" style="s2">were my mom and my stepdad are silent</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.280" end="01:10:03.350" style="s2">but they really are boomers but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.100" end="01:10:06.320" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna disagree with you are ya I</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.350" end="01:10:08.870" style="s2">think that what we don&#39;t understand is</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:12.500" style="s2">that we settled on a narrative in which</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.870" end="01:10:15.320" style="s2">the boomers are the problem the Silent</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.500" end="01:10:17.390" style="s2">Generation really begins the problem and</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.320" end="01:10:19.580" style="s2">we are letting the Silent Generation off</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.390" end="01:10:23.240" style="s2">just as we are not paying attention to</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.580" end="01:10:25.370" style="s2">Gen X and I believe sir that you are the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.240" end="01:10:27.920" style="s2">last of the boomers but that you are</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.370" end="01:10:29.930" style="s2">spiritually Gen X and that you figured</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.920" end="01:10:31.700" style="s2">out you almost started really defining</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.930" end="01:10:34.160" style="s2">Gen X I forget who it was who wrote the</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.700" end="01:10:37.820" style="s2">book Gen X you probably nod does with</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.160" end="01:10:40.820" style="s2">Oakland right I think that what I</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.820" end="01:10:43.610" style="s2">remember from this is that a few years</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.820" end="01:10:46.820" style="s2">either way was really important right</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.610" end="01:10:48.830" style="s2">and I believe that the silence are the</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.820" end="01:10:50.840" style="s2">first generation to wrestle with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.830" end="01:10:52.730" style="s2">problem in 1972 seven</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.840" end="01:10:55.369" style="s2">three that the country won&#39;t wake up to</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.730" end="01:10:57.230" style="s2">which is that our growth pattern changed</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.369" end="01:10:58.969" style="s2">for structural reasons it wasn&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.230" end="01:11:00.739" style="s2">some bad decision it wasn&#39;t about the</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.969" end="01:11:02.750" style="s2">gold standard it wasn&#39;t about the Arab</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.739" end="01:11:04.400" style="s2">oil embargo something really</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.750" end="01:11:07.610" style="s2">structurally changed okay</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.400" end="01:11:10.099" style="s2">and in my telling of the tale the</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.610" end="01:11:12.409" style="s2">silence try to figure out how to restart</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.099" end="01:11:13.940" style="s2">real growth it&#39;s like the engine has</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.409" end="01:11:16.730" style="s2">gone out they&#39;re gonna try to restart</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.940" end="01:11:19.250" style="s2">the engine it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.730" end="01:11:22.040" style="s2">the boomers look at these efforts and</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.250" end="01:11:24.830" style="s2">they say huh that doesn&#39;t work but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.040" end="01:11:27.440" style="s2">good enough for redistribution and to</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.830" end="01:11:29.210" style="s2">play games with fake growth so why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.440" end="01:11:31.280" style="s2">we help ourselves to fake growth and</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.210" end="01:11:33.530" style="s2">we&#39;ll just grow our slices of the pie as</p>

<p begin="01:17:04.430" end="01:17:08.360" style="s2">guess is that you&#39;ll find that it has</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.690" end="01:17:10.520" style="s2">changed quite considerably being</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.360" end="01:17:13.940" style="s2">dominated by one gender rather than a</p>

<p begin="01:18:41.860" end="01:18:47.170" style="s2">basically how you toughen up is that you</p>

<p begin="01:18:47.170" end="01:18:52.840" style="s2">into a person that can deal with life&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.690" end="01:18:54.849" style="s2">everyday hassles and the pain then</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.840" end="01:18:58.090" style="s2">inevitably comes to all of us what</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.849" end="01:19:04.560" style="s2">worries me is how this affects the arts</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.090" end="01:19:09.699" style="s2">and how we deal with art how we how we</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.560" end="01:19:11.829" style="s2">let it into our lives and that is the</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.699" end="01:19:15.099" style="s2">most worrying thing to me in the last</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.829" end="01:19:17.349" style="s2">five to ten years seeing that art must</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.099" end="01:19:20.020" style="s2">be a certain way that there have to be</p>

<p begin="01:19:27.070" end="01:19:31.449" style="s2">in and certainly it was something that I</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.230" end="01:19:32.829" style="s2">wanted to explore as the writer of less</p>

<p begin="01:21:22.809" end="01:21:29.010" style="s2">recently wrote a piece for Italian Vogue</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.860" end="01:21:32.559" style="s2">about the differences between fashion in</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.010" end="01:21:33.730" style="s2">1999 when I published a large novel that</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.559" end="01:21:36.969" style="s2">took place within the fashion world</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.730" end="01:21:38.530" style="s2">called glamour AMA and today and so I</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.969" end="01:21:40.239" style="s2">thought about I thought oh okay well</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.530" end="01:21:42.429" style="s2">they&#39;re paying quite well when no one</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.239" end="01:21:44.050" style="s2">else pays well and I can riff on this</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.429" end="01:21:47.440" style="s2">for a couple thousand words and so I</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.050" end="01:21:50.949" style="s2">wrote about how mysterious the fashion</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.440" end="01:21:53.099" style="s2">world was in in the late 90s and how its</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.949" end="01:21:57.559" style="s2">exclusivity was what a</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.099" end="01:22:01.859" style="s2">made what it made it so alluring it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.559" end="01:22:04.859" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s lack of inclusion is what made</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.859" end="01:22:07.439" style="s2">people want to be a part of it so so</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.859" end="01:22:09.809" style="s2">badly compared to now where you can see</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.439" end="01:22:13.349" style="s2">the met Gaul is streaming online and</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.809" end="01:22:14.939" style="s2">everyone can be interacting and throwing</p>

<p begin="01:22:20.699" end="01:22:26.699" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know is that exciting is it</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.699" end="01:22:28.349" style="s2">more exciting to not know exactly once</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.699" end="01:22:30.090" style="s2">behind the curtain and of course I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.349" end="01:22:32.189" style="s2">writing this as a gen Xer I&#39;m writing</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.090" end="01:22:33.959" style="s2">about this in a way that is really</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.189" end="01:22:37.289" style="s2">conforms to my Sensibility</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.959" end="01:22:39.840" style="s2">I also talked about how the models the</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.289" end="01:22:41.879" style="s2">women and the men were really quite</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.840" end="01:22:45.329" style="s2">extraordinarily beautiful and they were</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.879" end="01:22:47.699" style="s2">they were goddesses and they were gods</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.329" end="01:22:50.369" style="s2">and we looked up to them because they</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.699" end="01:22:52.979" style="s2">weren&#39;t us they weren&#39;t us and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.369" end="01:22:55.019" style="s2">why we were so drawn to them these women</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.979" end="01:22:57.329" style="s2">were otherworldly these men were</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.019" end="01:22:59.820" style="s2">otherworldly and there was something</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.329" end="01:23:00.449" style="s2">about that that I thought it we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.820" end="01:23:02.789" style="s2">have anymore</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.449" end="01:23:06.090" style="s2">where we need models that look like us</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.789" end="01:23:10.289" style="s2">that we have to be more inclusive of you</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.090" end="01:23:12.269" style="s2">know body image and that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.289" end="01:23:14.609" style="s2">accept and that and that the modeling</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.269" end="01:23:16.229" style="s2">world in the fashion world is trying its</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.609" end="01:23:20.689" style="s2">best to do that and you can see it in</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.229" end="01:23:26.010" style="s2">shows where you know they have whatever</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.689" end="01:23:29.820" style="s2">buck-toothed it whatever it is I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.010" end="01:23:32.989" style="s2">not people who conform to normal not</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.820" end="01:23:36.269" style="s2">even normal but let&#39;s be clear about it</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.989" end="01:23:38.969" style="s2">model bone structure is almost like a</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.269" end="01:23:41.519" style="s2">mutation completely it&#39;s the what we</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.969" end="01:23:44.639" style="s2">traditionally think of is something that</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.519" end="01:23:47.550" style="s2">is is extraordinarily rare</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.639" end="01:23:51.149" style="s2">it does particular things for clothes</p>

<p begin="01:23:59.070" end="01:24:03.959" style="s2">her response was yeah I&#39;m all legs and</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.530" end="01:24:04.850" style="s2">no torso and her hands are like Ezard</p>

<p begin="01:24:09.770" end="01:24:17.420" style="s2">the David somehow these people are</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.620" end="01:24:19.880" style="s2">actually distorted I got blasted for</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.420" end="01:24:22.700" style="s2">writing this yeah absolutely blasted by</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.880" end="01:24:25.370" style="s2">Millennials huge a huge controversy</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.700" end="01:24:27.200" style="s2">about this piece now I think part of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.370" end="01:24:29.590" style="s2">problem was that was translated into</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.200" end="01:24:31.970" style="s2">Italian and then someone wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.590" end="01:24:34.250" style="s2">translate it into English so when you</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.970" end="01:24:36.110" style="s2">were translating the Italian back into</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.250" end="01:24:38.900" style="s2">English it&#39;s a whole other can be all</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.110" end="01:24:41.870" style="s2">these other meanings but basically the</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.900" end="01:24:44.660" style="s2">beef was I don&#39;t believe in inclusivity</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.870" end="01:24:48.100" style="s2">in the fashion world well I meant I</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.660" end="01:24:52.700" style="s2">meant exclusivity was what made it so</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.100" end="01:24:56.510" style="s2">erotic and alluring no that&#39;s they read</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.700" end="01:24:57.830" style="s2">it as I&#39;m saying that inclusivity I</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.510" end="01:25:02.150" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in inclusivity mean that</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.830" end="01:25:05.060" style="s2">I&#39;m a racist that I am a body shame er</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.150" end="01:25:08.210" style="s2">and it was so remarkable to me that</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.060" end="01:25:11.180" style="s2">that&#39;s the message that they got out of</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.210" end="01:25:13.940" style="s2">an older man talking about what he liked</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.180" end="01:25:15.410" style="s2">about in the late 90s about fashion that</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.940" end="01:25:18.650" style="s2">moved him to actually write a novel set</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.410" end="01:25:20.750" style="s2">in that world a complete distortion of</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.650" end="01:25:25.690" style="s2">really what I was saying based on this</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.750" end="01:25:28.460" style="s2">emotional idea of being excluded</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.690" end="01:25:34.850" style="s2">themselves and it&#39;s just such a</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.460" end="01:25:37.100" style="s2">remarkable way to to reread something so</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.850" end="01:25:39.980" style="s2">that it conforms to your view of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.100" end="01:25:41.420" style="s2">world I certainly didn&#39;t have that when</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.980" end="01:25:44.240" style="s2">I read things that I didn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.420" end="01:25:45.950" style="s2">agree in when I was that age</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.240" end="01:25:50.690" style="s2">can I push back on the slightly yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.950" end="01:25:53.360" style="s2">please so the way I read it is that they</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.690" end="01:25:56.810" style="s2">might have actually had a point and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.360" end="01:25:59.800" style="s2">they missed a point right so one of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.810" end="01:26:03.430" style="s2">costs of having fashioned be mysterious</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.800" end="01:26:07.730" style="s2">aspirational and dare I say transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.430" end="01:26:09.890" style="s2">is that it does remind us of our merely</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.730" end="01:26:12.020" style="s2">mortal nature there was a period of time</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.890" end="01:26:14.100" style="s2">where you know you would show people</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.020" end="01:26:16.530" style="s2">without makeup</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.100" end="01:26:19.860" style="s2">and just how completely plain and</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.530" end="01:26:22.050" style="s2">ordinary they were right there all sorts</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.860" end="01:26:25.100" style="s2">of faces that lend themselves to being</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.050" end="01:26:27.510" style="s2">turned into something that cannot be as</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.100" end="01:26:30.030" style="s2">canvases on which to be painted let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.510" end="01:26:35.730" style="s2">say and that there is something powerful</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.030" end="01:26:37.590" style="s2">about deconstructing fashion if I if you</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.730" end="01:26:40.200" style="s2">remember someone at when I bring up</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.590" end="01:26:44.070" style="s2">sometimes is Jennifer Lopez&#39;s famous for</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.200" end="01:26:47.340" style="s2">Sachi dress yeah I am sure that adhesive</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.070" end="01:26:49.950" style="s2">is somehow lurking in the background but</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.340" end="01:26:52.560" style="s2">the idea of having adhesive on your</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.950" end="01:26:56.390" style="s2">boobs and having the fabric somehow</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.560" end="01:27:00.750" style="s2">stick you know all sorts of contrivances</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.390" end="01:27:02.850" style="s2">that&#39;s much less exciting and alluring</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.750" end="01:27:05.880" style="s2">if I know how the magic trick is or done</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.850" end="01:27:08.400" style="s2">so the idea of a magic show in which the</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.880" end="01:27:12.030" style="s2">audience demands to know how every trick</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.400" end="01:27:14.610" style="s2">is done is a very weird thing because</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.030" end="01:27:17.880" style="s2">some of us want to be fooled we want to</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.610" end="01:27:20.760" style="s2">be seduced but we also are shamed in</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.880" end="01:27:22.320" style="s2">this process because of our own very</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.760" end="01:27:24.030" style="s2">plain nature one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.320" end="01:27:26.220" style="s2">have to deal with is is that I have</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.030" end="01:27:28.350" style="s2">moles all over my face and some some</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.220" end="01:27:29.240" style="s2">percentage of every YouTube video that</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.350" end="01:27:31.020" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever done</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.240" end="01:27:32.190" style="s2">comments and you think the guy would</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.020" end="01:27:34.470" style="s2">have some money you need to have the</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.190" end="01:27:36.270" style="s2">moles removed why is that guy wearing a</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.470" end="01:27:38.190" style="s2">wig right you know that&#39;s clearly a</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.270" end="01:27:41.220" style="s2">weave no but nobody his age has hair</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.190" end="01:27:45.480" style="s2">like that you know whatever and the</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.220" end="01:27:47.940" style="s2">shaming is incredibly powerful on the</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.480" end="01:27:50.280" style="s2">other hand the transcendence is</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.940" end="01:27:52.680" style="s2">incredibly powerful and the number of</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.280" end="01:27:54.870" style="s2">people who can see both of these things</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.680" end="01:27:56.900" style="s2">which is yeah they have a point and</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.870" end="01:27:58.890" style="s2">they&#39;re also creating a huge negative</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.900" end="01:28:03.150" style="s2">externality and cost that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.890" end="01:28:05.250" style="s2">taking into account we are in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.150" end="01:28:07.470" style="s2">in some sort of awkward waking up that</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.250" end="01:28:09.810" style="s2">there there has been a very dark side to</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.470" end="01:28:12.660" style="s2">fashion to the models to the way in</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.810" end="01:28:14.340" style="s2">which we neuroticism these women are</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.660" end="01:28:19.260" style="s2">recognized when they&#39;re 12 and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.340" end="01:28:21.990" style="s2">14 and we have been complicit as a</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.260" end="01:28:24.600" style="s2">society in the you know errata cessation</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.990" end="01:28:27.180" style="s2">of children for a great deal of time so</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.600" end="01:28:27.770" style="s2">what what astounds me is not that they</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.180" end="01:28:30.690" style="s2">push</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.770" end="01:28:35.720" style="s2">but that the quality of the pushback is</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.690" end="01:28:39.690" style="s2">so shitty well it it&#39;s it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.720" end="01:28:43.800" style="s2">reflection of their way of thinking it</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.690" end="01:28:47.130" style="s2">is pure ideology I don&#39;t send someone I</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.800" end="01:28:51.240" style="s2">mean look writing anything is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.130" end="01:28:54.630" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t say an act of magic or</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.240" end="01:28:56.250" style="s2">an act of willing disbelief in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.630" end="01:28:58.650" style="s2">your creating something out of nothing</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.250" end="01:29:03.270" style="s2">and I&#39;m creating this idea about my</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.650" end="01:29:06.080" style="s2">memories of the 90s and what I was</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.270" end="01:29:09.210" style="s2">attracted to about fashion and</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.080" end="01:29:11.520" style="s2">contrasting it negatively to what I feel</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.210" end="01:29:15.630" style="s2">fashion is now where I just it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.520" end="01:29:21.270" style="s2">interesting because it&#39;s mmm I guess</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.630" end="01:29:22.890" style="s2">more inclusive in terms of letting you</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.270" end="01:29:24.210" style="s2">see the strings and everything but</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.890" end="01:29:25.800" style="s2">letting you see the strings and letting</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.210" end="01:29:28.260" style="s2">you see how everything is made is really</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.800" end="01:29:29.550" style="s2">endemic to this culture now it&#39;s it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.260" end="01:29:31.620" style="s2">every with the PDA</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.550" end="01:29:33.630" style="s2">it&#39;s in connecting all the Marvel movies</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.620" end="01:29:36.630" style="s2">and all the back stories to all the</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.630" end="01:29:38.130" style="s2">characters this generation that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.630" end="01:29:40.230" style="s2">is no mystery in terms of that they</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.130" end="01:29:43.250" style="s2">don&#39;t want mr. I think mystery frightens</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.230" end="01:29:45.540" style="s2">them and makes them feel whatever unsafe</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.250" end="01:29:47.940" style="s2">ambiguity makes them feel unsafe and it</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.540" end="01:29:49.740" style="s2">confuses them so I don&#39;t know is it</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.940" end="01:29:52.110" style="s2">really shitty to thinking this shitty I</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.740" end="01:29:55.710" style="s2">guess it is to a degree it also is</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.110" end="01:29:57.090" style="s2">overly reactive to me and it and of</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.710" end="01:30:00.630" style="s2">course it is because the minute</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.090" end="01:30:02.190" style="s2">something is posted you want to get your</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.630" end="01:30:04.530" style="s2">voice out there so you post something 20</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.190" end="01:30:08.190" style="s2">minutes well that&#39;s true but like I</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.530" end="01:30:09.810" style="s2">would say that for example I always ask</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.190" end="01:30:12.600" style="s2">this question do people want to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.810" end="01:30:14.940" style="s2">seduced if you if you believe that you</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.600" end="01:30:17.310" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be manipulated you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.940" end="01:30:20.460" style="s2">never have the experience of being</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.310" end="01:30:24.630" style="s2">seduced because seduction is in some</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.460" end="01:30:27.330" style="s2">sense a willing manipulation usually on</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.630" end="01:30:29.250" style="s2">to people&#39;s part right and so when when</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.330" end="01:30:30.810" style="s2">Jennifer Lopez was trying to seduce the</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.250" end="01:30:34.860" style="s2">world at scale with this dress that</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.810" end="01:30:37.320" style="s2">miraculously stayed on her body we</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.860" end="01:30:39.570" style="s2">wanted to be in the audience and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.320" end="01:30:41.940" style="s2">sure you know one of the I&#39;ve had about</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.570" end="01:30:43.350" style="s2">gay men is that in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.940" end="01:30:46.890" style="s2">it&#39;s very often gay men are like</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.350" end="01:30:48.660" style="s2">magicians assistants or consultants they</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.890" end="01:30:53.910" style="s2">very often take great pleasure in seeing</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.660" end="01:30:55.500" style="s2">how the trick is done without wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.910" end="01:30:57.170" style="s2">be completely like the heterosexual</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.500" end="01:30:59.850" style="s2">manager sitting there in the audience</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.170" end="01:31:02.100" style="s2">lapping it up right and the gay men are</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.850" end="01:31:03.780" style="s2">like oh you know did you see her makeup</p>

<p begin="01:44:23.920" end="01:44:26.469" style="s2">they&#39;ll often say is that was a little</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.989" end="01:44:29.800" style="s2">rapey</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.469" end="01:44:32.739" style="s2">yeah and if you use the word rape to a</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.800" end="01:44:36.219" style="s2">gen Xer it&#39;s like boom you&#39;ve just</p>

<p begin="01:44:36.219" end="01:44:41.619" style="s2">would never use the word rapey right and</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.150" end="01:44:43.060" style="s2">but and then another one of them will</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.619" end="01:44:45.580" style="s2">say yeah you&#39;re right it was a little</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.060" end="01:44:48.849" style="s2">bit rapey and then they go on and so the</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.580" end="01:44:51.070" style="s2">idea is that they&#39;re trading there they</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.849" end="01:44:53.409" style="s2">have an agreement which is like it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:45:07.030" end="01:45:12.280" style="s2">what we do is say what did you say like</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.570" end="01:45:14.920" style="s2">we&#39;re back on our heels cuz we&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="01:45:14.920" end="01:45:18.760" style="s2">an idea of like there was nothing wrong</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.510" end="01:45:21.250" style="s2">with what I said don&#39;t you dare talk to</p>

<p begin="01:46:34.880" end="01:46:44.030" style="s2">and being ironic was you know a key a</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.409" end="01:46:45.530" style="s2">key part of our generation and it was a</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.030" end="01:46:48.979" style="s2">way we expressed ourselves and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.530" end="01:46:51.949" style="s2">way that we dealt with things a lot of</p>

<p begin="01:46:51.949" end="01:47:00.530" style="s2">that we listen to very rarely was music</p>

<p begin="01:47:04.190" end="01:47:13.159" style="s2">in the late 70s and into the 80s but</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.979" end="01:47:17.139" style="s2">that lack of irony rips up takes away</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.159" end="01:47:21.139" style="s2">shading and takes away a humanity</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.139" end="01:47:24.440" style="s2">because nothing is exactly as it seems</p>

<p begin="01:48:17.690" end="01:48:21.739" style="s2">way too much credit for those pulling up</p>

<p begin="01:48:42.679" end="01:48:47.150" style="s2">see now maybe there are ways in which</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.539" end="01:48:49.760" style="s2">I&#39;m wrong I&#39;m open to that but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.150" end="01:48:51.679" style="s2">open to the idea that suddenly every</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.760" end="01:48:53.689" style="s2">everything has been wrong and the one</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.679" end="01:48:55.340" style="s2">generation has suddenly figured it out I</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.689" end="01:48:58.579" style="s2">have to say something</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.340" end="01:48:59.329" style="s2">Early&#39;s as we I realized that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.579" end="01:49:02.119" style="s2">really care</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.329" end="01:49:03.800" style="s2">yeah here what Millennials think about</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.119" end="01:49:06.199" style="s2">me and I really don&#39;t know if I care</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.800" end="01:49:08.479" style="s2">what I think about them the overreaction</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.199" end="01:49:10.909" style="s2">to the hashtag generation was which I</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.479" end="01:49:13.880" style="s2">thought was a perfect example of a kind</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.909" end="01:49:15.979" style="s2">of snarky Gen X way of looking at</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.880" end="01:49:17.900" style="s2">Millennials was intended as comedy and</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.979" end="01:49:20.900" style="s2">it was tending this something to talk</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.900" end="01:49:23.300" style="s2">exactly I got all chuckle at it I write</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.900" end="01:49:25.669" style="s2">but still did too</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.300" end="01:49:27.800" style="s2">and then when I did take it a bit</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.669" end="01:49:32.079" style="s2">serious more seriously and expounded on</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.800" end="01:49:34.519" style="s2">it in my book and realized that I was</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.079" end="01:49:36.709" style="s2">sympathetic as well as annoyed right um</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.519" end="01:49:42.769" style="s2">I just I don&#39;t know I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.709" end="01:49:45.650" style="s2">reaction to that was endemic of of you</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.769" end="01:49:49.130" style="s2">know millennial thinking and that it is</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.650" end="01:49:51.289" style="s2">um I don&#39;t know it&#39;s problematic but I</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.130" end="01:49:53.479" style="s2">also realized I&#39;ve got other things to</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.289" end="01:49:56.780" style="s2">worry that&#39;s fine but what I&#39;m worried</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.479" end="01:50:00.199" style="s2">about is we&#39;ve got a generation that is</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.780" end="01:50:02.449" style="s2">now going to probably use its high</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.199" end="01:50:06.019" style="s2">leverage positions to deranged a lot</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.449" end="01:50:07.999" style="s2">yeah and and cancel and well canceling</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.019" end="01:50:10.789" style="s2">you know some of us can afford what yeah</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.999" end="01:50:15.530" style="s2">but what worries me is I see this as</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.789" end="01:50:17.769" style="s2">eroding the outer layers of our civil</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.530" end="01:50:20.929" style="s2">society they&#39;re about to get to core</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.769" end="01:50:23.869" style="s2">structure and it&#39;s gonna keep going and</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.929" end="01:50:26.599" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s cute I think you know</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.869" end="01:50:27.860" style="s2">I think it is absolutely capable of</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.599" end="01:50:29.510" style="s2">getting us into war</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.860" end="01:50:31.909" style="s2">I think it&#39;s capable of getting us a</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.510" end="01:50:34.939" style="s2">president that would be dictatorial as</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.909" end="01:50:37.429" style="s2">an overreaction to their nonsense yeah</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.939" end="01:50:38.920" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think nothing is riding on it</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.429" end="01:50:41.140" style="s2">I think a lot is riding on</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.920" end="01:50:43.840" style="s2">and I have to Scott redic turi impulses</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.140" end="01:50:45.580" style="s2">one is to say what is it that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.840" end="01:50:47.530" style="s2">actually trying to say maybe we can work</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.580" end="01:50:48.880" style="s2">to try to understand you better and the</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.530" end="01:50:51.940" style="s2">other one is cut that out</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.880" end="01:50:53.680" style="s2">know Christ and so I I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.940" end="01:50:56.230" style="s2">indifference I think that you do I think</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.680" end="01:50:58.780" style="s2">what I have is I have two contradictory</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.230" end="01:51:00.250" style="s2">impulses one of which is to say I bet</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.780" end="01:51:02.050" style="s2">you&#39;re saying something and I&#39;m just not</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.250" end="01:51:04.090" style="s2">getting it and the other is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.050" end="01:51:05.260" style="s2">wildly out of control and you need to</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.090" end="01:51:08.530" style="s2">see a different path</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.260" end="01:51:11.470" style="s2">of course boomer youth millennial youths</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.530" end="01:51:18.010" style="s2">Gen X youth I know which one that I am</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.470" end="01:51:21.190" style="s2">probably most impressed by on a certain</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.010" end="01:51:26.440" style="s2">level in terms of I&#39;m shocked in terms</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.190" end="01:51:29.700" style="s2">of a kind of level of clear-headed I</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.440" end="01:51:32.830" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say adulthood but just a</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.700" end="01:51:35.020" style="s2">way of dealing with the world that is</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.830" end="01:51:36.730" style="s2">wildly different from millennial and</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.020" end="01:51:38.860" style="s2">boomer and I think that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.730" end="01:51:42.520" style="s2">that you think that there could be a</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.860" end="01:51:45.580" style="s2">moment where Gen X might step up to the</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.520" end="01:51:47.350" style="s2">stage and announce itself forcefully in</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.580" end="01:51:49.020" style="s2">a way that perhaps we have we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.350" end="01:51:51.550" style="s2">this as well I mean you and I thought</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.020" end="01:51:53.560" style="s2">we&#39;re modeling a conversation which we</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.550" end="01:51:56.170" style="s2">have a couple of disagreements yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.560" end="01:51:58.180" style="s2">think it&#39;s polite both of us are capable</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.170" end="01:52:00.580" style="s2">of taking our sabers out of their sheath</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.180" end="01:52:03.790" style="s2">but there&#39;s usually no reason to know I</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.580" end="01:52:06.010" style="s2">don&#39;t never and and what I do find is is</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.790" end="01:52:07.840" style="s2">that I just think what I was hoping to</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.010" end="01:52:10.420" style="s2">do here a little bit is to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.840" end="01:52:13.240" style="s2">this context in this firmament which I</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.420" end="01:52:15.100" style="s2">think has been invisible that we have a</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.240" end="01:52:17.590" style="s2">boomer millennial story there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.100" end="01:52:19.750" style="s2">important role of Gen X that has been</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.590" end="01:52:22.030" style="s2">ignored and your your work I think has</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.750" end="01:52:24.670" style="s2">been probably the best example of it to</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.030" end="01:52:27.330" style="s2">be honest I find it almost impossible to</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.670" end="01:52:31.120" style="s2">read because it&#39;s so it&#39;s so right and</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.330" end="01:52:32.920" style="s2">that what what we do next is we have to</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.120" end="01:52:34.930" style="s2">think about the long term longevity of</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.920" end="01:52:37.600" style="s2">our society I&#39;m very worried for example</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.930" end="01:52:39.940" style="s2">that some of these millennial females</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.600" end="01:52:41.410" style="s2">need to start families even though</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.940" end="01:52:42.520" style="s2">they&#39;re pretending that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.410" end="01:52:44.950" style="s2">really matter one way or the other</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.520" end="01:52:46.180" style="s2">whether they have families or not I</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.950" end="01:52:47.620" style="s2">think it&#39;s going to be incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.180" end="01:52:50.380" style="s2">destructive if we don&#39;t have people</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.620" end="01:52:52.070" style="s2">invested in the longevity of our society</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.380" end="01:52:54.020" style="s2">through somewhat normal</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.070" end="01:52:56.090" style="s2">truckers now I could be wrong in that</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.020" end="01:52:57.980" style="s2">maybe the idea is is that a family is an</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.090" end="01:53:00.650" style="s2">outmoded concept and that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.980" end="01:53:02.420" style="s2">need this to be fulfilled but I do think</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.650" end="01:53:04.550" style="s2">that if we don&#39;t actually have adults in</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.420" end="01:53:08.150" style="s2">the room and if we don&#39;t become those</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.550" end="01:53:09.380" style="s2">adults and strong and caring above you</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.150" end="01:53:12.170" style="s2">know that&#39;s just the way you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.380" end="01:53:14.329" style="s2">with a bratty child we&#39;re too cowed by</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.170" end="01:53:16.730" style="s2">these bratty children we actually have</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.329" end="01:53:18.469" style="s2">to say hey I&#39;m really sorry but you you</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.730" end="01:53:20.510" style="s2">have to stop throwing a temper tantrum</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.469" end="01:53:22.880" style="s2">and if you have to go to your room go to</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.510" end="01:53:24.489" style="s2">your room but you&#39;re out of control you</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.880" end="01:53:27.739" style="s2">we can&#39;t have the New York Times</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.489" end="01:53:30.530" style="s2">becoming the agent of like individual</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.739" end="01:53:32.150" style="s2">destruction as it destroys the</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.530" end="01:53:34.340" style="s2">reputations of people who fall out of</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.150" end="01:53:38.020" style="s2">line of the orthodoxy that that thing is</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.340" end="01:53:40.790" style="s2">a threat to our society writ large</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.020" end="01:53:43.510" style="s2">anyway I don&#39;t know whether you agree on</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.790" end="01:53:46.159" style="s2">that note all right I think I I</p>
