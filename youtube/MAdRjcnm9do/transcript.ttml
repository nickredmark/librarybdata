<p begin="00:03:37.860" end="00:03:41.610" style="s2">issue and I came to you&#39;re right that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.989" end="00:03:44.160" style="s2">racist that she wants us to have more</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.610" end="00:03:45.600" style="s2">diversity not because I would love us to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.160" end="00:03:48.150" style="s2">have more diversity I would love us to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.600" end="00:03:51.030" style="s2">have more physical visible everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.150" end="00:03:53.100" style="s2">right I want everyone in that space but</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.030" end="00:03:54.870" style="s2">what that means in an inclusive open</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.100" end="00:03:57.750" style="s2">space that isn&#39;t a panel of ten people</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.870" end="00:04:00.299" style="s2">right it is thousands of people and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.750" end="00:04:03.060" style="s2">growing and hopefully growing so what it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.299" end="00:04:04.530" style="s2">would mean to even a toe is not two it</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.060" end="00:04:06.570" style="s2">would mean not admitting white people</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.530" end="00:04:09.980" style="s2">and not admitting ya would be both</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.570" end="00:04:14.489" style="s2">sexist and racist it would be both like</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.980" end="00:04:17.340" style="s2">that&#39;s an example yeah and what do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.489" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">get what are we supposed to do if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.340" end="00:04:20.100" style="s2">an open group and it just happens a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:22.410" style="s2">of white men are interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.100" end="00:04:25.670" style="s2">particular subject matter what does that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.410" end="00:04:28.040" style="s2">make it wrong inherently or bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.670" end="00:04:30.990" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.040" end="00:04:34.200" style="s2">that that&#39;s the inference right because</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.990" end="00:04:35.550" style="s2">it is an open group and people hear</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.200" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">about it one way or the other they watch</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.550" end="00:04:38.760" style="s2">something or see something to read</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:40.550" style="s2">something find their way to the group</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.760" end="00:04:42.900" style="s2">and if that happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.550" end="00:04:44.220" style="s2">disproportionately white men that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.900" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">interested in this Pacific took his</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.220" end="00:04:50.640" style="s2">subject matter is that supposed to mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">something important in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.640" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">does it mean something different if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">a bunch of white man as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:05:01.290" style="s2">bunch of like Hispanic women that are in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:02.550" style="s2">another group with Hispanic women happen</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.290" end="00:05:03.900" style="s2">to be particularly attracted to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.550" end="00:05:07.530" style="s2">particular subject matter group that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.900" end="00:05:08.790" style="s2">they disproportionately go to and does</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.530" end="00:05:13.320" style="s2">that mean something about that group</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.790" end="00:05:16.890" style="s2">like so the analysis of all that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.320" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">know I I consider what I was taught at</p>

<p begin="00:06:44.390" end="00:06:50.070" style="s2">another one of the messages like they</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.370" end="00:06:52.410" style="s2">showed us the Lorax which was all about</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.070" end="00:06:53.760" style="s2">remember this is a dr. Seuss book about</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.410" end="00:06:56.460" style="s2">patting down all the trees and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.760" end="00:06:58.910" style="s2">no more trees left like that&#39;s a message</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.460" end="00:07:01.530" style="s2">that sticks that lands for me as a kid</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.910" end="00:07:03.270" style="s2">which they did make into a full-length</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.530" end="00:07:06.660" style="s2">film in the last decade</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.270" end="00:07:07.980" style="s2">yeah I loved it I mean my kids watch</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.660" end="00:07:15.450" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know all the songs and all that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.980" end="00:07:16.860" style="s2">stuff but then there&#39;s the message it</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.450" end="00:07:18.390" style="s2">was called stereotyping and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.860" end="00:07:21.210" style="s2">discrimination is what they called it</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.390" end="00:07:22.500" style="s2">and then it just taught the basic thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.210" end="00:07:23.760" style="s2">that if you see somebody and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.500" end="00:07:27.780" style="s2">different than you or they&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.760" end="00:07:35.010" style="s2">in some way you know and you don&#39;t treat</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.780" end="00:07:36.420" style="s2">them badly because of it and it was you</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.010" end="00:07:39.320" style="s2">know came I came up with a clear</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.420" end="00:07:42.020" style="s2">understanding that is just the kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.320" end="00:07:48.600" style="s2">thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.020" end="00:07:50.850" style="s2">that you would never assume something</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.600" end="00:07:54.650" style="s2">about somebody because of a physical</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.850" end="00:07:57.480" style="s2">feature they have that that is just rude</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.650" end="00:07:59.490" style="s2">so if somebody is a different like has a</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.480" end="00:08:02.250" style="s2">color skin that&#39;s not common in your</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.490" end="00:08:04.560" style="s2">where you&#39;re growing up to assume</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.250" end="00:08:07.200" style="s2">something about them because their skin</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.560" end="00:08:12.480" style="s2">color is different it&#39;s just bad manners</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.200" end="00:08:16.050" style="s2">it&#39;s just in not nice behavior because</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.480" end="00:08:17.460" style="s2">you don&#39;t know them yet get to know them</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.050" end="00:08:19.380" style="s2">as a person they&#39;re a human being just</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.460" end="00:08:20.400" style="s2">like you are and until then if you want</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.380" end="00:08:22.050" style="s2">to get to know them and come up with</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.400" end="00:08:24.030" style="s2">judgments that&#39;s totally different than</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.050" end="00:08:26.220" style="s2">just assuming things about them because</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.030" end="00:08:28.140" style="s2">they look a certain way yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.220" end="00:08:30.600" style="s2">blessed I was taught as a kid and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.140" end="00:08:31.980" style="s2">seems like a really good like all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.600" end="00:08:33.390" style="s2">things I&#39;ve been naming this that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.980" end="00:08:36.150" style="s2">remember being caught as a kid</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.390" end="00:08:38.190" style="s2">these to me are good social behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.150" end="00:08:39.900" style="s2">positive social behaviors that create a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.190" end="00:08:41.250" style="s2">cohesive working social environments</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.900" end="00:08:45.210" style="s2">where people can get along and do stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.250" end="00:08:47.250" style="s2">together yes so despite my lack of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.210" end="00:08:49.950" style="s2">eat social like really deep social</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.250" end="00:08:52.410" style="s2">graces of any kind until I was in my 30s</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.950" end="00:08:54.449" style="s2">these things still did stick with me</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.410" end="00:08:56.009" style="s2">you know and so that&#39;s my definition of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.449" end="00:08:58.680" style="s2">you know state would call it</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.009" end="00:09:00.449" style="s2">stereotyping discrimination I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.680" end="00:09:02.850" style="s2">they outright use the word racism back</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.449" end="00:09:05.639" style="s2">then but so when I wonder when the word</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.850" end="00:09:07.889" style="s2">racism sort of becoming a word that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.639" end="00:09:10.370" style="s2">more talked about in my world I just</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.889" end="00:09:12.899" style="s2">assumed it meant the same thing roughly</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.370" end="00:09:14.040" style="s2">that you know racism is when you see</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.899" end="00:09:15.720" style="s2">somebody identify physical</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.040" end="00:09:19.579" style="s2">characteristic about them and then make</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.720" end="00:09:19.579" style="s2">assumptions about them and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.300" end="00:09:25.949" style="s2">characteristic yeah right so basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.420" end="00:09:28.319" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna come into a group</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.949" end="00:09:29.370" style="s2">identify a physical characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.319" end="00:09:32.189" style="s2">the majority of the group and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.370" end="00:09:35.009" style="s2">disparage the group because of that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.189" end="00:09:36.750" style="s2">is exactly that behavior so this is like</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.009" end="00:09:39.209" style="s2">so crystal clear to me I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.750" end="00:09:41.779" style="s2">quite baffled what happened in the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.209" end="00:09:44.490" style="s2">to where that clarity got lost</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.779" end="00:09:48.230" style="s2">yeah like I don&#39;t even really understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.490" end="00:09:51.389" style="s2">is there a better way to behave that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.230" end="00:09:53.129" style="s2">it has changed and I don&#39;t think what</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.389" end="00:09:54.839" style="s2">game B needs to do is shift and become</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.129" end="00:09:55.980" style="s2">PC culture and I don&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.839" end="00:09:58.860" style="s2">do that I think we&#39;re actually a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.980" end="00:10:01.259" style="s2">knee-jerk reaction to that and they</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.860" end="00:10:03.300" style="s2">thought Oh logical emotional reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.259" end="00:10:04.860" style="s2">it as well but also knee-jerk right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.300" end="00:10:07.139" style="s2">so when someone comes in we have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.860" end="00:10:10.350" style="s2">knee-jerk reaction to be like oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.139" end="00:10:12.420" style="s2">you know the pre trans fallacy like more</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.350" end="00:10:13.470" style="s2">of the imperial ken wilber work I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.420" end="00:10:14.550" style="s2">never going to be able to explain it</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.470" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">right because I can only do it with</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.550" end="00:10:18.120" style="s2">abortion because I can&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:21.019" style="s2">another option but um the pre trans</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.120" end="00:10:24.269" style="s2">fallacy is is the idea that we have we</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.019" end="00:10:26.910" style="s2">continue in a progression as as</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.269" end="00:10:31.829" style="s2">individuals and a society we go from a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.910" end="00:10:34.740" style="s2">position of let&#39;s say being Pro to be an</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.829" end="00:10:36.449" style="s2">auntie and then Pro again and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.740" end="00:10:40.199" style="s2">difference between the first Pro in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.449" end="00:10:42.149" style="s2">second Pro is a world of difference but</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.199" end="00:10:45.839" style="s2">to the middle person it looks the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.149" end="00:10:47.819" style="s2">and so so if you&#39;re someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.839" end="00:10:49.259" style="s2">pro-life this is the way who bring an</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.819" end="00:10:50.670" style="s2">abortion pro-life and you&#39;re like you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.259" end="00:10:51.990" style="s2">know we couldn&#39;t possibly like be</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.670" end="00:10:54.480" style="s2">killing fetuses that&#39;s murder that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.990" end="00:10:56.490" style="s2">that to know women have the right to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.480" end="00:10:57.720" style="s2">choose hundred percent doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.490" end="00:11:00.149" style="s2">what it&#39;s for what reason it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.720" end="00:11:01.410" style="s2">absolutely all of the women to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.149" end="00:11:02.550" style="s2">it&#39;s a little more complex than that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.410" end="00:11:03.990" style="s2">mean but we don&#39;t use it for birth</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.550" end="00:11:05.930" style="s2">control I mean you know I mean maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.990" end="00:11:06.950" style="s2">don&#39;t see the person in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.930" end="00:11:08.270" style="s2">looks like you&#39;re trying to take our</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.950" end="00:11:11.990" style="s2">rights away and it&#39;s you don&#39;t be the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.270" end="00:11:13.310" style="s2">same there&#39;s nuance to the other one</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.990" end="00:11:14.360" style="s2">right like I&#39;m like right I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.310" end="00:11:16.580" style="s2">I should all decide what you do with</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.360" end="00:11:18.290" style="s2">your body but nor should we like it be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.580" end="00:11:20.750" style="s2">frivolous thing like taking a two</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.290" end="00:11:25.060" style="s2">thousand like alright it&#39;s not nothing</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.750" end="00:11:28.310" style="s2">and it is devastating to anyway so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.060" end="00:11:30.860" style="s2">think that is exactly what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.310" end="00:11:33.110" style="s2">with racism is it&#39;s like okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.860" end="00:11:34.940" style="s2">this in between that is PC culture and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.110" end="00:11:38.270" style="s2">those of us who are like I get it I get</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.940" end="00:11:42.649" style="s2">that there is a privilege to be in white</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.270" end="00:11:44.570" style="s2">and there is a systemic racism and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.649" end="00:11:45.529" style="s2">invokes everything that is like just in</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.570" end="00:11:48.790" style="s2">everything I&#39;ll see that we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.529" end="00:11:51.589" style="s2">subconscious bias and all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.790" end="00:11:53.480" style="s2">we&#39;re breaking it by demanding everyone</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.589" end="00:11:56.209" style="s2">like shaming people into it like there</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.480" end="00:11:59.209" style="s2">is no I know how I&#39;ve gotten to be less</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.209" end="00:12:01.430" style="s2">racist or more woke in any way is not by</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.209" end="00:12:04.430" style="s2">being shamed it&#39;s by wanting to be and</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.430" end="00:12:06.080" style="s2">seeking it out and so the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.430" end="00:12:12.040" style="s2">can shame people into being better</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.080" end="00:12:14.420" style="s2">people is like ridiculous white men</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.040" end="00:12:16.610" style="s2">right of all classes of people they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.420" end="00:12:19.400" style="s2">not going to receive your shame they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.610" end="00:12:21.110" style="s2">going to become more racist if anything</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.400" end="00:12:22.520" style="s2">yeah especially when you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.110" end="00:12:23.810" style="s2">position of privilege right it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.520" end="00:12:25.700" style="s2">like if you&#39;re in game if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.810" end="00:12:28.370" style="s2">succeeding at game a it&#39;s really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.700" end="00:12:30.050" style="s2">see game B as a valid option it is and</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.370" end="00:12:32.510" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing it&#39;s like wait like</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.050" end="00:12:33.529" style="s2">you&#39;re trying like there is a truth to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.510" end="00:12:35.300" style="s2">it feels like you&#39;re getting your</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.529" end="00:12:39.470" style="s2">privilege taken away because you are</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.300" end="00:12:40.730" style="s2">actually and like there&#39;s a animosity</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.470" end="00:12:42.740" style="s2">that there&#39;s like and you&#39;re not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.730" end="00:12:44.420" style="s2">to have emotions about it simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.740" end="00:12:47.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of conflict in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.420" end="00:12:49.520" style="s2">world because of I think we and we do</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.480" end="00:12:50.570" style="s2">this in game be to the difference</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.520" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">between the individual and the group</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.570" end="00:12:55.310" style="s2">right someone comes into a group and</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.320" end="00:14:44.890" style="s2">also is important to not recreate game B</p>

<p begin="00:15:02.470" end="00:15:08.260" style="s2">that um but when people come into game B</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:10.150" style="s2">they come in with the idea of everything</p>

<p begin="00:16:00.319" end="00:16:03.050" style="s2">chart does a really great job of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.939" end="00:16:04.939" style="s2">describing it but I think it does</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.939" end="00:16:08.839" style="s2">I just want to drop that in there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.500" end="00:16:12.620" style="s2">so the blue church let&#39;s go game B lingo</p>

<p begin="00:16:18.709" end="00:16:21.319" style="s2">around and go wait this is a bunch of</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.529" end="00:16:34.579" style="s2">figuring out exactly what game B is and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.750" end="00:16:36.319" style="s2">implementing it it would be a huge</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.579" end="00:16:39.500" style="s2">problem that we don&#39;t have diversity</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.319" end="00:16:40.850" style="s2">like all of the diversity and at the</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.039" end="00:24:49.740" style="s2">was like that doesn&#39;t make sense what he</p>

<p begin="00:25:07.460" end="00:25:11.220" style="s2">just because they don&#39;t know you whether</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.570" end="00:25:14.909" style="s2">they were talking about the you</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.220" end="00:25:17.340" style="s2">person and and I was like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.909" end="00:25:18.750" style="s2">like just you can&#39;t just blanket Lee</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.340" end="00:25:20.429" style="s2">kick someone oh until they&#39;ve broken a</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.860" end="00:25:26.940" style="s2">was joking like I think that that was it</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.049" end="00:25:28.490" style="s2">was in the thing that I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.940" end="00:25:31.110" style="s2">about before more of a sarcastic</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.490" end="00:25:32.850" style="s2">pointing out the irony that isn&#39;t irony</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.110" end="00:25:35.100" style="s2">but is irony right like in the pre trans</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.850" end="00:25:36.240" style="s2">way and in no way are you getting kicked</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.100" end="00:25:38.460" style="s2">out but I was like brings like</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.240" end="00:25:41.190" style="s2">instrumental and game B itself I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.460" end="00:25:43.049" style="s2">like that&#39;s not but realizing that part</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.190" end="00:25:46.580" style="s2">of that is because I talked to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.049" end="00:25:49.049" style="s2">right so when I read these things I get</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.580" end="00:25:50.909" style="s2">Raymond&#39;s energy behind it right like I</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.049" end="00:25:52.919" style="s2">can picture you saying it my mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.909" end="00:25:57.960" style="s2">wearing like I couldn&#39;t imagine you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.919" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">saying hey MA like it has to be a little</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.960" end="00:26:00.720" style="s2">bit sarcastic because I can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:04.350" style="s2">you saying it in the tone that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.720" end="00:26:07.620" style="s2">taken without you realize I&#39;m at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.350" end="00:26:10.770" style="s2">what&#39;s the trans phase I&#39;m like I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.620" end="00:26:12.779" style="s2">so I see all sides of the issue and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.770" end="00:26:14.789" style="s2">it happened lean towards a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.779" end="00:26:17.820" style="s2">of behaving based on my understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.789" end="00:26:20.130" style="s2">all sides of the issue which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.820" end="00:26:22.860" style="s2">different then not seeing any sides of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.130" end="00:26:25.980" style="s2">the issue being blocked into a wall of</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.860" end="00:26:29.240" style="s2">whatever by you&#39;re not dissidents or</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.980" end="00:26:31.409" style="s2">whatever that causes you to see things a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.240" end="00:26:31.980" style="s2">certain way without being able to see</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.409" end="00:26:35.850" style="s2">the whole picture</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.980" end="00:26:38.980" style="s2">which is it so yes the blue church will</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.850" end="00:26:41.140" style="s2">anything that I say as a white male to</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.980" end="00:26:42.549" style="s2">be the pre and so the trans is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.140" end="00:26:45.160" style="s2">right is that the right way to talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.549" end="00:26:47.380" style="s2">about it also pretty trans yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.160" end="00:26:49.059" style="s2">so I mean it&#39;s making sense to me really</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.380" end="00:26:53.230" style="s2">right so they&#39;re all askew but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.059" end="00:26:56.380" style="s2">understand the black perspective or the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.230" end="00:26:58.299" style="s2">underclass perspective to me it&#39;s to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.380" end="00:26:59.920" style="s2">in my analysis or whatever it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.299" end="00:27:01.330" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely more related to</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.920" end="00:27:02.130" style="s2">economics than it is the color of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.330" end="00:27:04.270" style="s2">skin</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.130" end="00:27:05.950" style="s2">that&#39;s comes from personal experience</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.270" end="00:27:10.090" style="s2">with me and many of my hippie friends</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.950" end="00:27:11.770" style="s2">because you know not angry not and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.090" end="00:27:14.530" style="s2">know what it&#39;s like to be black I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.770" end="00:27:18.429" style="s2">that&#39;s a fact do I have privileges being</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.530" end="00:27:21.100" style="s2">white absolutely that&#39;s a fact and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.429" end="00:27:22.780" style="s2">we all have privileges we all have</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.100" end="00:27:24.490" style="s2">everybody has privileges that other</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.780" end="00:27:26.350" style="s2">people don&#39;t have in some way shape or</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.490" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">form so I think I think is a really</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.350" end="00:27:32.080" style="s2">useful exercise to acknowledge that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:33.610" style="s2">you know all of us have been had the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.080" end="00:27:35.320" style="s2">feeling of being discriminated against</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.610" end="00:27:37.480" style="s2">or disadvantaged based on one thing or</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.320" end="00:27:39.160" style="s2">the other for me as we started the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.480" end="00:27:41.710" style="s2">conversation privately it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.160" end="00:27:42.970" style="s2">neuro divergence like yeah there is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.710" end="00:27:44.620" style="s2">huge discrimination against</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.970" end="00:27:47.740" style="s2">neurodivergent people if you want it</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.620" end="00:27:49.330" style="s2">like play that game and I came to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.740" end="00:27:53.860" style="s2">realize that you know the oppression</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.330" end="00:27:57.100" style="s2">Olympics it&#39;s probably not a competition</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.860" end="00:27:58.870" style="s2">that&#39;s worth showing up for cuz what do</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.100" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">you get by winning the gold medal of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.870" end="00:28:02.530" style="s2">oppression Olympics to say I have been</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:07.090" style="s2">discriminated against far more than all</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.530" end="00:28:12.760" style="s2">of you now what what does that mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.090" end="00:28:15.340" style="s2">I think like yes like hi my heart breaks</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.760" end="00:28:17.760" style="s2">for anybody who really has this</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.340" end="00:28:19.750" style="s2">experience deep discrimination</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.760" end="00:28:21.790" style="s2">consistently and regularly and felt like</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.750" end="00:28:25.179" style="s2">all their opportunities in life have</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.790" end="00:28:26.470" style="s2">been blocked over some physical</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.179" end="00:28:31.059" style="s2">characteristic or whatever it may be</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.470" end="00:28:32.890" style="s2">like yeah that breaks my heart and like</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.059" end="00:28:35.140" style="s2">what you said like okay so what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.890" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">like I&#39;m open</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.140" end="00:28:41.290" style="s2">but coming with anger and blame and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:43.450" style="s2">just a group identity politics to where</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.290" end="00:28:46.270" style="s2">I&#39;m black you&#39;re white so that means I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.450" end="00:28:47.860" style="s2">this and you&#39;re that takes all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.270" end="00:28:48.700" style="s2">nuance out of the discussion takes all</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.860" end="00:28:51.210" style="s2">the personal really</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.700" end="00:28:54.160" style="s2">ship building out of the discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.210" end="00:28:59.830" style="s2">doesn&#39;t allow transcendent you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.160" end="00:29:04.650" style="s2">approach to be taken so I yeah I get</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.830" end="00:29:06.820" style="s2">really saddened and angry I guess urge</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.650" end="00:29:08.500" style="s2">approach to this the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.820" end="00:29:10.930" style="s2">religious approach to this to</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.500" end="00:29:13.900" style="s2">immediately weight the questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.930" end="00:29:14.830" style="s2">anything there&#39;s something that&#39;s sorry</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.900" end="00:29:16.120" style="s2">to interrupt you but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.830" end="00:29:16.780" style="s2">that&#39;s coming up for me right now in</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.120" end="00:29:20.170" style="s2">this moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.780" end="00:29:24.070" style="s2">um the thing I talked about about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.170" end="00:29:27.360" style="s2">ADHD in black people and if there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.070" end="00:29:29.590" style="s2">enough black people honestly in green be</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:31.840" style="s2">and what we were talking about before we</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.590" end="00:29:34.660" style="s2">went live that there&#39;s actually probably</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:40.180" style="s2">a high high high chance if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.660" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">game B or neurodivergent that there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.180" end="00:29:44.890" style="s2">those two things or actually probably</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:50.080" style="s2">why we don&#39;t have a lot of black people</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.890" end="00:29:54.070" style="s2">in game B that knowing you don&#39;t belong</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.080" end="00:29:56.710" style="s2">in the world is a common experience in</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.070" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">neuro divergence right is like well I</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.710" end="00:29:59.770" style="s2">feel like an alien what are you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.720" end="00:30:01.840" style="s2">all playing by a game I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.770" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">understand we get to gain B and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.840" end="00:30:04.810" style="s2">like mad paintball which is the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:07.690" style="s2">thing I felt when I figured out I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.810" end="00:30:10.030" style="s2">autistic and I was like oh you&#39;re my</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.690" end="00:30:12.010" style="s2">people you&#39;re the ones who get it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.030" end="00:30:14.340" style="s2">not weird to you but that&#39;s that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.010" end="00:30:19.270" style="s2">or all weird in different unique ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.340" end="00:30:24.640" style="s2">that neuro divergence that expresses</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.270" end="00:30:27.460" style="s2">itself in the other cultures is even</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.640" end="00:30:29.520" style="s2">less free to be itself right then at</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.460" end="00:30:34.270" style="s2">least because we&#39;re in the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.520" end="00:30:36.220" style="s2">that we are more like the world still is</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.270" end="00:30:38.830" style="s2">not okay with our neurodivergent any way</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.220" end="00:30:42.940" style="s2">shape or form but they want to be right</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.830" end="00:30:46.050" style="s2">bond not neurodivergent and black yes or</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.940" end="00:30:48.580" style="s2">in personal comment right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.050" end="00:30:50.230" style="s2">because basically I can&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.580" end="00:30:51.670" style="s2">anyone in game B that I&#39;ve interacted</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.230" end="00:30:52.900" style="s2">with that I wouldn&#39;t be like if they</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.670" end="00:30:54.490" style="s2">were like yeah I&#39;m on the spectrum I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.900" end="00:30:56.890" style="s2">be like no you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.490" end="00:30:59.110" style="s2">no no you&#39;re not like everyone have</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.890" end="00:31:02.190" style="s2">interacted with them like yeah I can see</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.110" end="00:31:03.419" style="s2">I can see some more than others and</p>

<p begin="00:31:15.480" end="00:31:19.080" style="s2">basically I think because we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.860" end="00:31:20.549" style="s2">neurodivergent we either don&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.080" end="00:31:24.570" style="s2">and so we don&#39;t even know that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.549" end="00:31:26.090" style="s2">part of who we are anyway but that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.570" end="00:31:29.820" style="s2">that exactly the pattern of</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:44.070" style="s2">pattern of knowing that&#39;s not for me and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.389" end="00:31:45.419" style="s2">then knowing that you&#39;re gonna that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.070" end="00:31:48.419" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.419" end="00:31:54.269" style="s2">feelings of rejection and all the things</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.419" end="00:31:57.299" style="s2">that come with it so exactly that as a</p>

<p begin="00:32:51.929" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">partly what I don&#39;t type out my thoughts</p>

<p begin="00:33:01.559" end="00:33:04.970" style="s2">those seventeen layers of nuance that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:07.289" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to explain constantly right</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.970" end="00:33:09.590" style="s2">whereas if I didn&#39;t need to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.289" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">I&#39;m learning not to do that then I could</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.590" end="00:33:16.140" style="s2">explain things in a linear way but other</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:19.330" style="s2">people can understand better</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.140" end="00:33:22.450" style="s2">like part of what are the reason I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.630" end="00:33:43.390" style="s2">just that PC culture blue church that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.410" end="00:33:45.250" style="s2">you can&#39;t make a safe space for everyone</p>

<p begin="00:34:13.720" end="00:34:17.860" style="s2">bring because I can&#39;t expect the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.070" end="00:34:19.300" style="s2">to accommodate me and that is very</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.860" end="00:34:21.010" style="s2">unlike wait a minute why are we talking</p>

<p begin="00:34:28.030" end="00:34:33.880" style="s2">what can help you thrive and succeed and</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.420" end="00:34:36.010" style="s2">so it&#39;s like well wait why why do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.880" end="00:34:37.960" style="s2">care about the words that trigger you</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.010" end="00:34:39.370" style="s2">and not the words that trigger me or why</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.960" end="00:34:41.110" style="s2">don&#39;t you care about this and not that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.370" end="00:34:42.730" style="s2">why does one person get something that</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.110" end="00:34:45.160" style="s2">one person doesn&#39;t just based on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.730" end="00:34:48.040" style="s2">squeaky wheel or just based on that like</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.160" end="00:34:51.340" style="s2">why it&#39;s not fair and I need it to be</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.500" end="00:38:24.130" style="s2">as a general statement in the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.260" end="00:38:25.940" style="s2">second you get out of the face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.130" end="00:38:27.260" style="s2">discussion and of course not all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.940" end="00:38:28.250" style="s2">time of course I&#39;m sure there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:39.220" style="s2">that happens from time to time of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.030" end="00:38:43.580" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s really the exception I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.220" end="00:38:46.240" style="s2">people people are good kind people and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.580" end="00:38:49.340" style="s2">this is where that&#39;s part of my question</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.240" end="00:38:51.980" style="s2">that I want to ask people in game be</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.340" end="00:38:55.880" style="s2">anywhere is like what is your viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.980" end="00:38:58.280" style="s2">of humanity as a whole like what is your</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.880" end="00:39:00.080" style="s2">feeling on how smart they are how kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.280" end="00:39:04.790" style="s2">they are how cuz I think that is a big</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.080" end="00:39:08.180" style="s2">part of our issue is that we look at</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.790" end="00:39:11.630" style="s2">humanity as like a stupid unwashed</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.180" end="00:39:13.760" style="s2">unlike mean horrible and we&#39;ve been that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.630" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">we definitely do that but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.760" end="00:39:17.480" style="s2">certain amount of there&#39;s this parable I</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:19.010" style="s2">don&#39;t roars from of leg which wolf</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.480" end="00:39:21.740" style="s2">inside of you to feed it&#39;s like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.010" end="00:39:23.390" style="s2">has like the kind one evil one it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.740" end="00:39:26.690" style="s2">which one wins well whichever one you</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.390" end="00:39:29.060" style="s2">feed and in society we feed the evil one</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.690" end="00:39:31.100" style="s2">we definitely have we create a Mrs Brady</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.060" end="00:39:32.510" style="s2">like the more sociopathic the more</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.100" end="00:39:35.930" style="s2">narcissistic you are the easier it is to</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.510" end="00:39:38.660" style="s2">win but the option and I&#39;m from my point</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.930" end="00:39:41.780" style="s2">that was but they&#39;re like the cure for</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.660" end="00:39:44.270" style="s2">that is not to vilify one of the wolves</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.780" end="00:39:46.340" style="s2">it&#39;s to stop feeding it right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.270" end="00:39:48.830" style="s2">like when you vilify it inside of you if</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.340" end="00:39:50.510" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh no I&#39;m greedy I&#39;m don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.830" end="00:39:52.160" style="s2">be greedy that&#39;s bad bad you just become</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.510" end="00:39:54.290" style="s2">more greedy you know it doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.160" end="00:39:55.609" style="s2">release itself and I think the same in</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.290" end="00:39:57.220" style="s2">society we have to figure out which wolf</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.609" end="00:40:01.890" style="s2">to feed but we also</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.220" end="00:40:06.670" style="s2">to realize they&#39;re both there and my</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.890" end="00:40:08.680" style="s2">perspective on that is we just we all</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.670" end="00:40:10.119" style="s2">know what it everything we need to know</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.680" end="00:40:11.710" style="s2">we learn in kindergarten right like all</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.119" end="00:40:13.450" style="s2">the manners and ways to be kind to other</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.710" end="00:40:14.980" style="s2">people like it&#39;s obvious we all learn it</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.450" end="00:40:17.890" style="s2">it&#39;s in our programming because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.980" end="00:40:22.150" style="s2">tribal creatures like but the second we</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.890" end="00:40:23.770" style="s2">get abstracted into non personal</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.150" end="00:40:25.180" style="s2">relationships it&#39;s like we forget all</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.770" end="00:40:26.440" style="s2">those lessons when we look at things</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.180" end="00:40:28.450" style="s2">systemically or we look at things</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.440" end="00:40:31.390" style="s2">through the economic socio economics of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.450" end="00:40:32.619" style="s2">getting money so I can have me powerful</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.390" end="00:40:34.210" style="s2">and free in the world and be fully</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.619" end="00:40:38.710" style="s2">expressed in the world like that drive</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.210" end="00:40:40.840" style="s2">causes us to be able to go through ever</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.710" end="00:40:43.830" style="s2">more levels of you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.840" end="00:40:47.410" style="s2">sociopathic just unethical behavior</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.830" end="00:40:50.460" style="s2">unkind behavior behavior that is not the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.410" end="00:40:56.280" style="s2">lessons we got taught in kindergarten</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.460" end="00:40:56.280" style="s2">and and then being accepted of that hey</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.619" end="00:41:05.440" style="s2">and then and then kind of never</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.400" end="00:41:08.050" style="s2">addressing the conversation that oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.440" end="00:41:10.599" style="s2">we&#39;re acting shitty right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.050" end="00:41:15.640" style="s2">taking all the other kids toys like we</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.599" end="00:41:17.500" style="s2">don&#39;t even have that conversation and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.640" end="00:41:19.510" style="s2">just gets buried and it&#39;s in the mix and</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.500" end="00:41:23.250" style="s2">then it becomes and we learn we learn</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.510" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">more and more techniques subtly to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.250" end="00:41:28.510" style="s2">confronting the fact that we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:31.150" style="s2">shitty people and yes that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.510" end="00:41:33.400" style="s2">did so you but you can win as you you</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.150" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">have more opportunity to have access to</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.400" end="00:41:37.810" style="s2">wealth and power in the world and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:38.920" style="s2">continue to show up as you will not look</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.810" end="00:41:41.290" style="s2">at the way you&#39;re being a shitty person</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.920" end="00:41:43.240" style="s2">as you do that you&#39;ll be invited to</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.290" end="00:41:45.640" style="s2">higher circle of wealth and power yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.240" end="00:41:47.710" style="s2">which is also like the more you see the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.640" end="00:41:50.710" style="s2">world of shitty the more you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.710" end="00:41:52.570" style="s2">to it over and the more it proves</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.710" end="00:41:54.700" style="s2">itself is shitty and the more than you</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.570" end="00:41:56.589" style="s2">in ownership of the media because those</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.700" end="00:41:58.810" style="s2">who owns the media as well you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.589" end="00:42:01.060" style="s2">put forward a view of humans or shitty</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.810" end="00:42:03.310" style="s2">and look at all these shitty humans and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.060" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">we feed off of it we absolutely do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.310" end="00:42:06.730" style="s2">like you tell us all those shitty humans</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:08.020" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what then tell me more</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.730" end="00:42:10.750" style="s2">about what we&#39;re doing to each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.020" end="00:42:13.330" style="s2">that&#39;s horrible and bio and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.750" end="00:42:15.070" style="s2">there&#39;s something about I know I used to</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.330" end="00:42:18.970" style="s2">have a viewpoint of humanity that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.070" end="00:42:21.340" style="s2">less than stellar but then I realized as</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.970" end="00:42:23.140" style="s2">and I still do somewhat as a whole like</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.340" end="00:42:25.060" style="s2">I&#39;m like what are we doing but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.140" end="00:42:27.670" style="s2">but I see the beauty of me in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.060" end="00:42:30.550" style="s2">individual and so I&#39;ve yet to meet</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.670" end="00:42:32.680" style="s2">someone that isn&#39;t intelligent that</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.550" end="00:42:34.660" style="s2">isn&#39;t kind that doesn&#39;t have and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.680" end="00:42:36.190" style="s2">like right even when I see people after</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.660" end="00:42:37.330" style="s2">acting horrific lian line and I want</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.190" end="00:42:40.349" style="s2">them cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.330" end="00:42:43.060" style="s2">besides the very few clear clear cases</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.349" end="00:42:46.690" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah and you caught them in</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.060" end="00:42:48.820" style="s2">their worst moments and is what we are</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.690" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">doing working is it getting us less</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.820" end="00:42:54.099" style="s2">racism is getting us less homophobia</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.800" end="00:42:57.220" style="s2">less transphobia no it&#39;s not it&#39;s not at</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.099" end="00:42:59.650" style="s2">all and so even if it feels good to want</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.220" end="00:43:03.250" style="s2">to like punish the person that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.650" end="00:43:05.349" style="s2">working it&#39;s on any level especially</p>

<p begin="00:45:41.900" end="00:45:47.329" style="s2">wiped out their societies that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.030" end="00:45:50.660" style="s2">natural pattern of of kind of non</p>

<p begin="00:45:53.750" end="00:45:57.980" style="s2">and so we&#39;re still dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.430" end="00:45:59.299" style="s2">cycle that&#39;s like white people that</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.980" end="00:46:01.549" style="s2">European something around you know I</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.299" end="00:46:02.990" style="s2">wish I was a better scholar on that but</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.549" end="00:46:04.309" style="s2">something where we&#39;ve stumbled into some</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.990" end="00:46:07.430" style="s2">technology that allows us to be a</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.309" end="00:46:08.930" style="s2">dominant culture and we have been that</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.430" end="00:46:11.540" style="s2">dominant culture and now we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.930" end="00:46:15.710" style="s2">we&#39;re alerting in a transcendent stage</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.540" end="00:46:17.660" style="s2">where we realize dominant culture pyram</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.710" end="00:46:20.690" style="s2">being the highest on the food chain and</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.660" end="00:46:22.579" style="s2">just dominating because you can is not</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.690" end="00:46:24.500" style="s2">going to create a world that works for</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.579" end="00:46:26.630" style="s2">any of us and we were reaching that</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.500" end="00:46:28.160" style="s2">conclusion and we know that okay now we</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.630" end="00:46:30.440" style="s2">can transcend this conversation and do</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.160" end="00:46:32.450" style="s2">something different so again that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.440" end="00:46:34.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the trans right I&#39;ve gone through</p>

<p begin="00:46:44.590" end="00:46:49.580" style="s2">because I&#39;m acknowledging they have</p>

<p begin="00:49:08.910" end="00:49:15.830" style="s2">don&#39;t know that that was diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.930" end="00:49:18.150" style="s2">diversity that it isn&#39;t about like</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.830" end="00:49:23.190" style="s2">whatever you called it the like whatever</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.150" end="00:49:25.890" style="s2">limb fix oppression Olympics it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.190" end="00:49:28.290" style="s2">what piece do you encompass and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.890" end="00:49:29.730" style="s2">issue with like when me for me anyway</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.290" end="00:49:31.440" style="s2">when everyone&#39;s like the biggest issue</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.730" end="00:49:34.080" style="s2">was racism we have to deal with it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.440" end="00:49:35.940" style="s2">like I wasn&#39;t born here maybe to tackle</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.080" end="00:49:38.250" style="s2">that one or and maybe would have been</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.940" end="00:49:39.870" style="s2">born a person of color like my things</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.250" end="00:49:41.400" style="s2">are the neuro diversions I&#39;m not here to</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.870" end="00:49:42.870" style="s2">stand in their way either I&#39;m not you</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.400" end="00:49:44.700" style="s2">know what I mean I&#39;m here I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.870" end="00:49:46.680" style="s2">an ally but unfortunately what I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.700" end="00:49:48.570" style="s2">looks like an ally is not what that</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.680" end="00:49:51.570" style="s2">middle part thinks looks like an ally</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.570" end="00:49:52.680" style="s2">right I&#39;m hopefully trans that but</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.570" end="00:49:54.510" style="s2">that&#39;s the other thing is I actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.680" end="00:49:55.950" style="s2">think this can Wilbur&#39;s work and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.510" end="00:49:58.080" style="s2">actually think it&#39;s not because pre</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.950" end="00:49:59.760" style="s2">trans definitely isn&#39;t it&#39;s a triad</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.080" end="00:50:01.950" style="s2">right you start in pre you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.760" end="00:50:04.230" style="s2">middle and then you go trans I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.950" end="00:50:06.870" style="s2">it&#39;s actually like it continues on and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.230" end="00:50:08.550" style="s2">so you never know what position you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.870" end="00:50:10.920" style="s2">in like you really don&#39;t really like</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.550" end="00:50:14.940" style="s2">your ideas shift as they get deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.920" end="00:50:16.470" style="s2">deeper and great complexity then you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.940" end="00:50:18.270" style="s2">go there&#39;s a new level of complexities</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.470" end="00:50:23.300" style="s2">you can transfer that you could be pre</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.270" end="00:50:26.340" style="s2">and then transcend yeah so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.300" end="00:50:30.920" style="s2">thing that I&#39;m most interested in doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.340" end="00:50:33.840" style="s2">with all this that I pray or you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.920" end="00:50:35.190" style="s2">like it feels hopeless sometimes because</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.840" end="00:50:36.840" style="s2">it&#39;s my team and so I&#39;m just not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.190" end="00:50:38.490" style="s2">to be part of the conversation a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.840" end="00:50:40.230" style="s2">the time that&#39;s literally I&#39;m told that</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.490" end="00:50:42.600" style="s2">straight up to my face</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.230" end="00:50:47.640" style="s2"> off white man you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.600" end="00:50:49.770" style="s2">voice okay so Oh getting what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.640" end="00:50:51.960" style="s2">been dishing out for centuries okay well</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.770" end="00:50:53.850" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t mean but yes I get it okay like</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.960" end="00:50:55.230" style="s2">yes like I can see the perspective so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.850" end="00:50:58.190" style="s2">can&#39;t really be too mad</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.230" end="00:51:00.090" style="s2">and yet it&#39;s real racism coming at me</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.190" end="00:51:02.490" style="s2">literally because the color of my skin</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.090" end="00:51:06.180" style="s2">or the gender because I have</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.490" end="00:51:07.500" style="s2">you have a male body because of only</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.180" end="00:51:08.940" style="s2">that I&#39;m not allowed to have voice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.500" end="00:51:10.470" style="s2">just literally the definition observer</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.940" end="00:51:16.650" style="s2">at the racism or discrimination or</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.470" end="00:51:19.110" style="s2">whatever what also is influencer culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.650" end="00:51:20.810" style="s2">and soapboxing and things because like</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.110" end="00:51:24.420" style="s2">to me there&#39;s a big difference between</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.810" end="00:51:27.060" style="s2">giving somebody the voice versus giving</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.420" end="00:51:28.980" style="s2">them a voice right like and they do this</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.060" end="00:51:30.480" style="s2">cause it&#39;s like injured anything if they</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.980" end="00:51:31.920" style="s2">do this less and less now and now they</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.480" end="00:51:33.420" style="s2">do it up like they just wanted to plunge</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.920" end="00:51:35.130" style="s2">alone far the other way where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.420" end="00:51:36.840" style="s2">like can we get her to save a black</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.130" end="00:51:41.310" style="s2">weird woman in here to speak please</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.840" end="00:51:42.570" style="s2">about like but like you know anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.310" end="00:51:43.800" style="s2">they would interview the white man about</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.570" end="00:51:46.470" style="s2">like women&#39;s rights and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.800" end="00:51:48.570" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s not the person but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.470" end="00:51:49.250" style="s2">he&#39;s an expert in it right so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.570" end="00:51:51.500" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.250" end="00:51:54.390" style="s2">entering the random guy on the street</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.500" end="00:51:56.369" style="s2">versus the head gynecologist or</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.390" end="00:51:58.619" style="s2">something right about women&#39;s health and</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.369" end="00:52:03.990" style="s2">I really hope that because just as</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.619" end="00:52:06.090" style="s2">female just yeah of knowing that they</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.990" end="00:52:08.820" style="s2">truly relate to the issues we&#39;re sure a</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.090" end="00:52:11.400" style="s2">white man could relate to all the female</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.820" end="00:52:13.350" style="s2">issues because he has had true and past</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.400" end="00:52:16.350" style="s2">the connection with his clients for 20</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.350" end="00:52:18.600" style="s2">years there&#39;s patients and and really</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.350" end="00:52:20.460" style="s2">learn to get inside their head and</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.600" end="00:52:22.290" style="s2">understand it&#39;s the gas that&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.460" end="00:52:24.240" style="s2">possible but how do you know it&#39;s a pre</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.290" end="00:52:25.530" style="s2">trans fallacy thing again right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.240" end="00:52:27.119" style="s2">like do you know you don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.530" end="00:52:28.920" style="s2">guy is that one who hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.119" end="00:52:31.530" style="s2">perfectly connected with the experience</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.920" end="00:52:34.470" style="s2">of somebody very different than him for</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.530" end="00:52:38.310" style="s2">a long enough time to really be a be in</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.470" end="00:52:39.300" style="s2">that experience it war or the argument</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.310" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">of course would be is it even possible</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.300" end="00:52:44.130" style="s2">to have the depth of connection to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:45.660" style="s2">experience if you didn&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.130" end="00:52:46.920" style="s2">to experience it yourself it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.660" end="00:52:48.630" style="s2">the blue church argues no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.920" end="00:52:52.050" style="s2">absolutely not possible you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.630" end="00:52:53.880" style="s2">possibly understand but I guess like gee</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.050" end="00:52:57.390" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to live as</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.880" end="00:52:59.700" style="s2">an empath do you because I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.390" end="00:53:02.100" style="s2">like yes I&#39;m never gonna live the actual</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.700" end="00:53:03.960" style="s2">experience but I also can hear about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.100" end="00:53:07.530" style="s2">experience without feeling it in my body</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.960" end="00:53:09.030" style="s2">so there is like they don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.530" end="00:53:10.859" style="s2">that feels like and so they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.030" end="00:53:11.850" style="s2">imagine what that is so they can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.859" end="00:53:13.050" style="s2">know what I mean it&#39;s like well you</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.850" end="00:53:15.119" style="s2">couldn&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be that</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.050" end="00:53:16.180" style="s2">absolutely watching a movie but does</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:18.400" style="s2">actually put me</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.180" end="00:53:19.960" style="s2">that driver&#39;s seat not in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.400" end="00:53:22.839" style="s2">because I can also turn it off right I</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.960" end="00:53:25.480" style="s2">can no I can watch a new movie but you</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.839" end="00:53:28.030" style="s2">can&#39;t turn off your lived experience but</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.480" end="00:53:30.790" style="s2">this anyway there&#39;s a lot like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.030" end="00:53:34.329" style="s2">influencer culture because it&#39;s like one</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.790" end="00:53:36.160" style="s2">person broadcasting to so many that</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.329" end="00:53:37.960" style="s2">person if they&#39;re talking on a specific</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.160" end="00:53:40.119" style="s2">topic probably should be that topic</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.960" end="00:53:41.440" style="s2">right like like if I&#39;m if I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.119" end="00:53:43.240" style="s2">listen to somebody on racism I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.440" end="00:53:46.270" style="s2">probably gonna want to hear from people</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.240" end="00:53:48.220" style="s2">who live to that experience but but if</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.270" end="00:53:50.800" style="s2">I&#39;m sitting at a table with people I</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.220" end="00:53:52.660" style="s2">want to hear everyone&#39;s opinion right</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.800" end="00:53:54.220" style="s2">that&#39;s very different I&#39;m not listening</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.660" end="00:53:55.809" style="s2">you don&#39;t I mean one person broadcasting</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.220" end="00:54:00.880" style="s2">to millions versus having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.809" end="00:54:02.950" style="s2">and there&#39;s something to be offered by</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.880" end="00:54:04.809" style="s2">everyone including people who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.950" end="00:54:07.510" style="s2">completely and privileged and then woke</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.809" end="00:54:09.640" style="s2">up when they&#39;re 40 and been like I got</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.510" end="00:54:12.520" style="s2">pretty much rubbing white those people</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.640" end="00:54:15.010" style="s2">are actually highly valuable well sure</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.520" end="00:54:18.730" style="s2">or even people who are steeped in</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.010" end="00:54:22.859" style="s2">privilege no can&#39;t admit it this is not</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.730" end="00:54:25.299" style="s2">the way it&#39;s still not the way and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.859" end="00:54:27.670" style="s2">guess that&#39;s that&#39;s what I have my</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.299" end="00:54:29.230" style="s2">greatest hope that at some point we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.670" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">ready to have the conversation some way</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.230" end="00:54:36.819" style="s2">or some way we realize we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">a lot more in common that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.819" end="00:54:42.790" style="s2">experienced privilege if you were born</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:48.059" style="s2">in the in the color people of color</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.790" end="00:54:51.040" style="s2">ghetto low low income area you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.059" end="00:54:55.390" style="s2">we&#39;re the best thing to do was go sell</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.040" end="00:54:58.000" style="s2">weed on the corner and begin you get a</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.390" end="00:55:00.250" style="s2">car and somebody you know like whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.000" end="00:55:04.299" style="s2">the lifestyle would make you a winner</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.250" end="00:55:05.890" style="s2">like you still could be said to have</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.299" end="00:55:08.770" style="s2">privilege or for somebody born in Rwanda</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.890" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">where the tribal warfare is like</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.770" end="00:55:13.329" style="s2">literally stabbing your family chopped</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:15.670" style="s2">into pieces yeah and being in threat of</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.329" end="00:55:17.140" style="s2">being killed any day right I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.670" end="00:55:19.299" style="s2">so we all have privilege that we all</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.140" end="00:55:20.650" style="s2">have privilege and if we could all</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.299" end="00:55:23.020" style="s2">acknowledge that we can realize we all</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.650" end="00:55:24.700" style="s2">have that in common and we all I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.020" end="00:55:26.140" style="s2">care who you are how privileged you</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.700" end="00:55:27.880" style="s2">appear to be you know what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.140" end="00:55:29.619" style="s2">be discriminated against to be out-group</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.880" end="00:55:32.619" style="s2">to be the one pushed aside</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.619" end="00:55:33.640" style="s2">and not understood well they just go</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.619" end="00:55:36.609" style="s2">about their merry way</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.640" end="00:55:38.559" style="s2">we&#39;ve all experienced that more than</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.609" end="00:55:40.690" style="s2">others and so but the fact that we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.559" end="00:55:43.630" style="s2">both all relate to both of those things</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.690" end="00:55:45.400" style="s2">is the thing we have in common in like I</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.630" end="00:55:47.740" style="s2">really think it would be powerful if we</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.400" end="00:55:49.900" style="s2">could get a movement going where we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.740" end="00:55:51.910" style="s2">admit it emit the ways we are privileged</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.900" end="00:55:56.190" style="s2">and emit the ways that we&#39;ve experienced</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.910" end="00:55:59.559" style="s2">discrimination or you know disadvantage</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.190" end="00:56:01.569" style="s2">and realize how let&#39;s listen to those</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.559" end="00:56:03.009" style="s2">stories let&#39;s listen to everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.569" end="00:56:06.309" style="s2">stories of privilege and disadvantage</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.009" end="00:56:07.869" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s relate as humans on</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.309" end="00:56:10.059" style="s2">that I think that would be a super</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.869" end="00:56:12.039" style="s2">powerful exercise I&#39;m in no way gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.059" end="00:56:14.499" style="s2">actually read it but Donald Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.039" end="00:56:16.299" style="s2">niece just wrote a book or had someone</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.499" end="00:56:17.950" style="s2">else write the book about you basically</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.299" end="00:56:19.900" style="s2">his traumatic childhood right I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.950" end="00:56:22.269" style="s2">it&#39;s called too much and never enough</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.900" end="00:56:26.130" style="s2">which is the perfect title for it</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.269" end="00:56:26.130" style="s2">because that is it&#39;s like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.190" end="00:56:29.740" style="s2">holding people on a pedestal and</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.299" end="00:56:32.440" style="s2">thinking they have the solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.740" end="00:56:34.930" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna like save us all like</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.440" end="00:56:36.549" style="s2">people feel about Trump is not it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.930" end="00:56:38.440" style="s2">that is broken to me we need to figure</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.549" end="00:56:41.079" style="s2">out how to save our own our own skin and</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.440" end="00:56:42.970" style="s2">how humanity how do you employ humanity</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.079" end="00:56:45.609" style="s2">to save humanity because it&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.970" end="00:56:48.099" style="s2">a lot of us not a handful of us but</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.609" end="00:56:49.569" style="s2">there&#39;s also like holding one pedestal</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.099" end="00:56:51.369" style="s2">not the solution either is vilifying</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.569" end="00:56:55.900" style="s2">them it&#39;s like he got to where he is</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.369" end="00:56:57.849" style="s2">because of his his trauma and to have</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.900" end="00:56:59.079" style="s2">sympathy for that and empathy and also</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.849" end="00:57:00.489" style="s2">not want him to be the president you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.079" end="00:57:01.480" style="s2">don&#39;t need someone with that many wounds</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.489" end="00:57:03.279" style="s2">full-out</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.480" end="00:57:04.839" style="s2">you know being being the president I</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.279" end="00:57:06.309" style="s2">don&#39;t I already am dealing with my own</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.839" end="00:57:07.480" style="s2">wounds and feeling like you don&#39;t I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.309" end="00:57:11.859" style="s2">I can show it better in the world the</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.480" end="00:57:13.749" style="s2">more I heal myself and yeah like there</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.859" end="00:57:15.849" style="s2">is we need to have compassion for one</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.749" end="00:57:20.619" style="s2">another and develop the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.849" end="00:57:22.299" style="s2">and start seeing and that is like what</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.619" end="00:57:24.970" style="s2">we currently have on social media with</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.299" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">technology is is it&#39;s geared towards the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.970" end="00:57:28.630" style="s2">exact opposite I think when it first</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:30.579" style="s2">came into existence there was a kernel</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.630" end="00:57:32.049" style="s2">of when we get a connect we got a talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.579" end="00:57:33.299" style="s2">you get a talk with strangers and we</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.049" end="00:57:35.950" style="s2">were like thought it was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.299" end="00:57:37.900" style="s2">crystallize in that same way and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.950" end="00:57:39.750" style="s2">turned out it fed the wrong wolf it fed</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.900" end="00:57:41.730" style="s2">that like dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.750" end="00:57:44.090" style="s2">I get to hide behind a screen and like</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.730" end="00:57:46.530" style="s2">you&#39;re wrong and that&#39;s where like</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.090" end="00:57:48.990" style="s2">having the conversation we&#39;re like what</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.530" end="00:57:52.620" style="s2">you wrote written by anyone else I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.990" end="00:57:54.570" style="s2">like yeah no that&#39;s not okay in this</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.620" end="00:57:56.820" style="s2">space um right but then knowing you I</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.570" end="00:57:58.590" style="s2">was like first all the questions of why</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.820" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">is that not okay why is it not just as</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.590" end="00:58:03.270" style="s2">what she said versus what you said</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:06.630" style="s2">versus like you&#39;ve been here longer and</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.270" end="00:58:09.240" style="s2">whatever whatever like it&#39;s we can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.630" end="00:58:14.070" style="s2">the nuance in written word and in</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.240" end="00:58:19.440" style="s2">Facebook&#39;s algorithm how do we with this</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.070" end="00:58:20.880" style="s2">very limited platform as a group come</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.440" end="00:58:22.740" style="s2">off the best when we&#39;re full of</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.880" end="00:58:26.100" style="s2">imperfect individuals we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.740" end="00:58:28.200" style="s2">fail constantly and in little ways and</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.100" end="00:58:30.240" style="s2">in big ways it&#39;s like partly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.200" end="00:58:33.480" style="s2">showcasing that and that&#39;s where as it</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.240" end="00:58:35.970" style="s2">admit like the idea I do think we do it</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.480" end="00:58:38.580" style="s2">more on a group level than an individual</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.970" end="00:58:40.620" style="s2">level like oh is this is this best for</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.580" end="00:58:42.270" style="s2">game B as opposed to right is this</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.620" end="00:58:44.760" style="s2">person getting something from game being</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.270" end="00:58:46.920" style="s2">are they giving something to game be on</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.760" end="00:58:49.140" style="s2">a regular basis the full picture instead</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.920" end="00:58:51.240" style="s2">of you know like one off who they swore</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.140" end="00:58:53.220" style="s2">they said this right beignet freaked out</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.240" end="00:58:54.840" style="s2">about air condition in India and swore</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.220" end="00:58:56.640" style="s2">at people because he thought people were</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.840" end="00:59:00.480" style="s2">not gonna die this year in India which</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.640" end="00:59:01.710" style="s2">is like yeah that&#39;s something to get</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.480" end="00:59:03.300" style="s2">passionate about and when you do it</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.710" end="00:59:07.260" style="s2">constantly and you keep showing up in</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.300" end="00:59:09.000" style="s2">that way how much what is that level</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.260" end="00:59:10.230" style="s2">right I don&#39;t think zero is the level I</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.000" end="00:59:11.490" style="s2">don&#39;t think once someone does one thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.230" end="00:59:16.170" style="s2">they get kicked out especially when they</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.490" end="00:59:18.480" style="s2">have a series of stuff and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.170" end="00:59:20.250" style="s2">time we can&#39;t have a free-for-all like</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.480" end="00:59:21.840" style="s2">constantly isn&#39;t it man people are like</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.250" end="00:59:25.680" style="s2">well just let me post whatever then the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.840" end="00:59:27.660" style="s2">group can decide because the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.680" end="00:59:33.930" style="s2">is not friendly with that one anyway</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.660" end="00:59:37.980" style="s2">right yep so many great trails we could</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.930" end="00:59:41.160" style="s2">follow but as usual it feels like we</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.980" end="00:59:44.450" style="s2">could go for hours and would like to and</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.160" end="00:59:46.440" style="s2">I should move on with my day though yes</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.450" end="00:59:48.150" style="s2">the same way I&#39;m trying to keep my</p>
