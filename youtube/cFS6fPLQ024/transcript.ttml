<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.400" style="s2">Okay, so we divided up the brain one way.</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.400" end="00:00:08.870" style="s2">Now we’re going to divide it up another<br />way, so this is the brain from the top down.</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.870" end="00:00:12.599" style="s2">You know you have two hemispheres and you<br />might think, “well why do you need two hemispheres?”</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.599" end="00:00:22.200" style="s2">Do know that Gazzaniga, who’s a relatively<br />famous neuropsychologist, studied split-brain</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.200" end="00:00:23.200" style="s2">patients.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.200" end="00:00:27.750" style="s2">You know that your cortical hemispheres – your<br />brain is united down in the sub-cortical areas.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.750" end="00:00:35.420" style="s2">It’s sort of stuck together, although you<br />have twins of many of the sub-cortical structures.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.420" end="00:00:41.050" style="s2">You have two hippoc8ampi and two amygdala<br />for example – one on each side.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.050" end="00:00:46.850" style="s2">At the top, the hemispheres are quite separate,<br />but they’re connected by the corpus callosum,</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.850" end="00:00:47.850" style="s2">which makes them communicate.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.850" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">It’s kind of interesting because you wonder<br />why they aren’t all glued together.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:57.870" style="s2">What it seems to indicate is that there’s<br />some utility of functional independence, combined</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:00.340" style="s2">with some utility of communication.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.340" end="00:01:04.239" style="s2">So it might be like, “do you really want<br />to be networked at the same time to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.239" end="00:01:05.239" style="s2">in the world?”</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.239" end="00:01:11.409" style="s2">No you don’t, you want some narrow pathway<br />so that only the important information comes</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.409" end="00:01:12.409" style="s2">through.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.409" end="00:01:16.030" style="s2">So it’s sort of like, maybe the right hemisphere’s<br />the one kind of computational device, and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.030" end="00:01:19.790" style="s2">the left hemisphere is another kind of computational<br />device – of course they’re not computational</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.790" end="00:01:21.860" style="s2">devices, but you get the point.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.860" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">Only the important information – the processed<br />information from the right hemisphere goes</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:27.000" style="s2">across.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.000" end="00:01:30.270" style="s2">And only the processed information from the<br />left hemisphere goes across.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.270" end="00:01:31.689" style="s2">Something like that, whatever.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.689" end="00:01:39.520" style="s2">If you have someone who’s epileptic or that<br />has a brain illness of some sort, it’s usually</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.520" end="00:01:45.439" style="s2">epilepsy but not always, and you do surgery<br />on them and cut the corpus callosum; what</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.439" end="00:01:50.830" style="s2">you find, weirdly enough, is that each hemisphere<br />develops its own personality.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.830" end="00:01:56.650" style="s2">This is other evidence, I would say, for the<br />idea that what the brain does is produce personalities.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.650" end="00:02:00.880" style="s2">You can keep paring the brain down, and what<br />it’s going to do is produce lower and lower</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.880" end="00:02:06.880" style="s2">resolution personalities all the way down<br />to the bottom – they’re just not as detailed.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.880" end="00:02:11.060" style="s2">If you lost, say eighty percent of your cortex<br />randomly, you’d sort of being like a thumbnail</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.060" end="00:02:12.060" style="s2">of yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.060" end="00:02:17.180" style="s2">So, you’d still be you, just not at the<br />same detail.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.180" end="00:02:23.510" style="s2">Here’s an interesting idea from the Catholics,<br />it kind of goes along with the avatar idea.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.510" end="00:02:28.120" style="s2">So the Catholics had been wrestling for a<br />long time with the question of how God could</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.120" end="00:02:32.129" style="s2">have fit himself in a human body– because<br />you could imagine that could obsess Christians</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.129" end="00:02:38.060" style="s2">– this great, big God in an itty-bitty body,<br />but God in there just bursts the boundaries.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.060" end="00:02:41.940" style="s2">They have this idea called Kenosis, which<br />means emptying.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.940" end="00:02:47.209" style="s2">The idea is that God had to empty himself<br />out before he could inhabit a human body,</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.209" end="00:02:49.830" style="s2">and it’s very much like a thumbnail idea.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.830" end="00:02:55.310" style="s2">Jung would have of course thought exactly,<br />that the self was a thumbnail of God.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.310" end="00:03:00.880" style="s2">He wouldn’t put it that way, but definitely<br />that’s where his thinking was leading.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.880" end="00:03:04.650" style="s2">So that’s a pretty damn cool idea.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.650" end="00:03:12.470" style="s2">Anyways, so I developed this before I read<br />what I’m going to tell you, but it doesn’t</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.470" end="00:03:13.470" style="s2">matter.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.470" end="00:03:16.980" style="s2">I’m going to talk about it from another<br />theorist’s point of view.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.980" end="00:03:19.730" style="s2">The guy I’m going to tell you about, his<br />name is Elkhonon Goldberg.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.730" end="00:03:24.659" style="s2">He’s a neuropsychologist, and he was one<br />of Luria’s students who ended up in New</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.659" end="00:03:25.720" style="s2">York.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.720" end="00:03:31.080" style="s2">Goldberg was obviously influenced by Luria<br />and all the unknown, Grey, and all those people</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.080" end="00:03:33.299" style="s2">that I’ve already talked to you about.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.299" end="00:03:35.450" style="s2">He was interested in why you have two hemispheres.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.450" end="00:03:40.360" style="s2">Well, there’s a bunch of things you can<br />say, broadly speaking about the hemispheres,</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.360" end="00:03:42.430" style="s2">and I’ve written some of them down there.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.430" end="00:03:47.950" style="s2">The right hemisphere – this is an idealized<br />representation of a relatively highly lateralized</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.950" end="00:03:50.330" style="s2">right-handed male.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.330" end="00:03:55.180" style="s2">The reason I’m saying that is men seem to<br />be more lateralized than women, and the right-handed</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.180" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">lateralization is the standard kind.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:01.540" style="s2">The brain can be lateralized all sorts of<br />ways.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.540" end="00:04:06.200" style="s2">What you might say is that – there’s a<br />bunch of ways of looking at it.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.200" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">One way you can look at it is that your cortex<br />gets colonized by underlying structures.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">Each underlying structure is likely to colonize<br />a particular area.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:25.229" style="s2">For example, when you are born and you wake<br />up and you see, your eyes are going to colonize</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.229" end="00:04:27.210" style="s2">your visual cortex most likely.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.210" end="00:04:28.979" style="s2">It’s sort of adapted for that.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.979" end="00:04:34.669" style="s2">If you don’t have a visual cortex then your<br />eyes will colonize something else.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.669" end="00:04:41.760" style="s2">So the brain has proclivities towards a certain<br />kind of structure, especially early in development,</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.760" end="00:04:46.520" style="s2">it’s unbelievably plastic, and so brains<br />can be organized and lateralized in a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.520" end="00:04:48.910" style="s2">of different ways.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.910" end="00:04:54.850" style="s2">To simplify it, what you do is you kind of<br />take, well let’s take the most straight-forward</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.850" end="00:04:58.810" style="s2">and typical brain and talk about it as if<br />it’s the canonical brain.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.810" end="00:05:04.030" style="s2">I think what you can say is, regardless of<br />where these systems are localized, they exist.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.030" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">So it’s an oversimplification – whatever,<br />doesn’t matter.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">What you’ve got with regards to your cortices<br />is a quick and dirty cortex, that’s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:16.820" style="s2">right hemisphere, and then you’ve got a<br />long-term detailed cortex and that’s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.820" end="00:05:17.820" style="s2">left hemisphere.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.820" end="00:05:20.750" style="s2">The left hemisphere is specialized for language.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.750" end="00:05:24.520" style="s2">Language cuts things up into little, tiny,<br />bitty pieces.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.520" end="00:05:28.750" style="s2">That’s really useful if you’re doing little,<br />tiny, bitty things.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.750" end="00:05:31.040" style="s2">You should be – precision, right?</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.040" end="00:05:34.630" style="s2">Pinpoint accuracy; but that takes a lot of<br />time and a lot of computation.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.630" end="00:05:38.370" style="s2">Whereas the right hemisphere says, “yeah,<br />yeah, let’s get to the bloody point.”</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.370" end="00:05:41.479" style="s2">So it captures the thing in an image.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.479" end="00:05:45.070" style="s2">So like the monster I showed you from the<br />hippie cartoon, that’s a right hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.070" end="00:05:46.070" style="s2">thing.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.070" end="00:05:52.020" style="s2">It’s an image that represents a class of<br />entities; which, of course, images do.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.020" end="00:06:00.490" style="s2">There’s this woman named - can’t remember<br />- autistic woman.</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.490" end="00:06:04.550" style="s2">She’s developed paddle-handling facilities<br />all across –</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.550" end="00:06:05.610" style="s2">“what’s her name?”</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.610" end="00:06:06.680" style="s2">Student “Temple Grandin.”</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.680" end="00:06:08.449" style="s2">Temple Grandin, yes a very cool person.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.449" end="00:06:13.320" style="s2">Yes I saw Temple Grandin speak at the University<br />of Arizona at the Consciousness Conference,</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.320" end="00:06:16.569" style="s2">and it was the funniest speech I’ve ever<br />seen in my life.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.569" end="00:06:18.990" style="s2">Not because it wasn’t perfect – it was<br />bloody perfect.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.990" end="00:06:23.720" style="s2">She’s a tough woman – she looks a like<br />a cowboy, and she spent a lot of time with</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.720" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">animals.</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:29.330" style="s2">She comes out on the stage in her cowboy outfit<br />and she’s unbelievably straightforward and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.330" end="00:06:33.690" style="s2">without nuance – she’s autistic, she’s<br />severely autistic.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.690" end="00:06:37.800" style="s2">You know, her mother helped her a lot, she<br />developed this thing that she would go inside</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.800" end="00:06:42.300" style="s2">to compress her and hold her – like a little<br />machine and that would comfort her.</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.300" end="00:06:47.669" style="s2">Anyways, she turned herself into quite the<br />person and she thinks, she thinks like an</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.669" end="00:06:48.669" style="s2">animal.</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.669" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">This is why she can design cattle handling<br />facilities, which are often slaughter houses,</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:56.600" style="s2">so that the cattle don’t get all freaked<br />out as they’re on their way to their eventual</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.600" end="00:06:57.660" style="s2">demise.</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.660" end="00:07:01.550" style="s2">So one of the things she does, is she walks<br />through where the cattle are going, and anything</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.550" end="00:07:05.000" style="s2">that bothers her, she assumes will bother<br />a cow.</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.000" end="00:07:10.180" style="s2">So for example, if the cows are walking through<br />this spiral as they’re on their way to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.180" end="00:07:14.460" style="s2">slaughter-house and there’s a coke can lying<br />on the ground, all the cows will stop and</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.460" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">look at the coke can – it’s anomalous.</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:23.599" style="s2">Now, she talked a lot about how she thought<br />and what she said was that she could not devise</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.599" end="00:07:26.110" style="s2">abstract representations.</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.110" end="00:07:31.860" style="s2">So she said, okay, imagine how a child draws<br />a house.</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.860" end="00:07:32.860" style="s2">What is in that child’s house?</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.860" end="00:07:39.600" style="s2">There’s a triangle and a square on the left,<br />and then there’s another rectangle, and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.600" end="00:07:43.950" style="s2">another parallelogram, and there’s a door<br />and two windows, right?</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.950" end="00:07:47.740" style="s2">Then there’s a chimney with smoke coming<br />out – which is quite cool, it’s like why</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.740" end="00:07:48.740" style="s2">is that?</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.740" end="00:07:49.740" style="s2">Where’s the smoke?</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.740" end="00:07:51.820" style="s2">You don’t see that in modern houses, but<br />kids still do that.</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.820" end="00:07:57.919" style="s2">And then there’s a tree, and usually there’s<br />a sun, and then - house.</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.919" end="00:08:00.530" style="s2">You think, oh, isn’t that cute, a simple<br />drawing.</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.530" end="00:08:02.120" style="s2">That drawing is not simple.</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.120" end="00:08:05.270" style="s2">You’ve never seen a house that looks like<br />that in your life.</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.270" end="00:08:07.240" style="s2">It looks nothing like a house.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.240" end="00:08:10.640" style="s2">It’s not a house, it’s not a picture,<br />it’s a hieroglyph.</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.640" end="00:08:13.009" style="s2">It’s a pre-linguistic representation.</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.009" end="00:08:16.720" style="s2">It’s like the essential elements of “house.”</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.720" end="00:08:21.270" style="s2">So you might say what the child has done is<br />extracted out all those things that are common</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.270" end="00:08:24.410" style="s2">across all houses, and then represented that.</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.410" end="00:08:25.960" style="s2">It’s not a drawing.</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.960" end="00:08:30.081" style="s2">Now if you take autistic people, sometimes,<br />and you get them to draw, they’ll start</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.081" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">in one corner of the house, and what they’ll<br />draw is that house – with every damn brick</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:36.860" style="s2">in place.</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.860" end="00:08:41.409" style="s2">So there are autistic people, for example,<br />who – they can look at a building and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.409" end="00:08:43.580" style="s2">can count every single window at one glance.</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.580" end="00:08:48.300" style="s2">Then, there’s another guy in England who’s<br />really famous, and this guy is unbelievable.</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.300" end="00:08:53.360" style="s2">You take him up in a helicopter and show him<br />a city that he’s never seen, then he goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.360" end="00:08:57.350" style="s2">home and has a piece of paper, like as big<br />as a wall, and he starts in one corner and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.350" end="00:08:59.170" style="s2">he draws the entire city.</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.170" end="00:09:03.620" style="s2">He doesn’t sketch it out – it’s from<br />the bottom up.</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.620" end="00:09:06.200" style="s2">That’s autistic savant drawing.</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.200" end="00:09:09.440" style="s2">Often what happens is, it’s very realistic<br />looking.</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.440" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">What happens if the autistic drawings of blank<br />language is they stop being able to draw.</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:19.510" style="s2">That’s because the abstraction interferes<br />with the realism.</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.510" end="00:09:22.930" style="s2">It’s really hard to draw a hand.</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.930" end="00:09:26.890" style="s2">The reason for that is if you draw a hand,<br />you draw a hieroglyph of hand.</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.890" end="00:09:28.700" style="s2">This is what a hand looks like.</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.700" end="00:09:31.529" style="s2">You try to draw your hand and it’s really<br />strange.</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.529" end="00:09:35.550" style="s2">One of the really strange things about trying<br />to draw your hand is that in order to draw</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.550" end="00:09:39.560" style="s2">it, you have to stop seeing it as if it’s<br />a hand.</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.560" end="00:09:42.470" style="s2">Then it pops out and you think, my God, that’s<br />the weirdest looking thing.</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.470" end="00:09:46.600" style="s2">It’s like a tree root, you know, it’s<br />like a claw.</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.600" end="00:09:50.070" style="s2">You know if you look at your hand like that,<br />it looks nothing like a hand.</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.070" end="00:09:52.300" style="s2">That’s how a hand looks.</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.300" end="00:09:53.300" style="s2">What the hell’s that?</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.300" end="00:09:58.580" style="s2">It’s like some sort of spider, but you have<br />to see it that way before you can draw it.</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.580" end="00:10:05.279" style="s2">So partly what happens is, is that your capacity<br />for abstraction interferes with your ability</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.279" end="00:10:09.470" style="s2">to see detail, that’s probably good – it’s<br />one of the ways that you simplify the world.</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.470" end="00:10:15.390" style="s2">Anyways, the right hemisphere looks like it’s<br />specialized for anomaly.</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.390" end="00:10:19.620" style="s2">The way I look at it is this: Okay, so you’ve<br />got your hippocampus down there, and it’s</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.620" end="00:10:23.880" style="s2">keeping track of the comparison between what<br />you want and what you think is happening.</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.880" end="00:10:24.880" style="s2">“Bang!”</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:26.010" style="s2">Something emerges, and it’s anomalous.</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.010" end="00:10:27.720" style="s2">You don’t know what the hell’s going on.</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.720" end="00:10:31.250" style="s2">So you freeze, that’s the notoric representation.</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.250" end="00:10:33.190" style="s2">Then you start to feel anxious.</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.190" end="00:10:37.500" style="s2">Then the right hemisphere comes up with some<br />pictures – what might this be?</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.500" end="00:10:40.320" style="s2">You can experience this at home, for your<br />own enjoyment.</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.320" end="00:10:44.450" style="s2">Let’s say you’re home at two in the morning,<br />it’s dark and you’re alone.</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.450" end="00:10:47.380" style="s2">Maybe you’ve watched a horror movie, so<br />you’re all nicely blank.</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.380" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">You know and then you hear a noise in another<br />room and that noise shouldn’t be there.</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:53.649" style="s2">So you’re going to go investigate, right?</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.649" end="00:10:56.580" style="s2">So let’s say the door’s just a little<br />bit open, and it’s dark in the room, and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.580" end="00:10:59.810" style="s2">you have to put your hand in to turn on the<br />light.</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.810" end="00:11:04.940" style="s2">You just watch what your imagination populates<br />that room with when you do that.</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.940" end="00:11:08.120" style="s2">You know, it’s like – guy with axe, snake,<br />alligator, like whatever!</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.120" end="00:11:14.760" style="s2">You’re right hemisphere is going: there<br />may be one of this class of dangerous thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.760" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">in there.</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:19.420" style="s2">What it’s doing is it’s basically coming<br />up with a hypothesis: what sort of monster</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.420" end="00:11:20.420" style="s2">might be in there.</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.420" end="00:11:25.420" style="s2">You’re all freaked out about that, even<br />though you know – who knows what happened;</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.420" end="00:11:29.751" style="s2">nothing but something creaked, but you’re<br />all on edge because your brain doesn’t work</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.751" end="00:11:31.810" style="s2">at night like it does during the day.</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.810" end="00:11:37.190" style="s2">Everyone knows that – wake up in the middle<br />of the night, a manner of horrors go through</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.190" end="00:11:39.990" style="s2">your imagination, and that usually happens<br />when you’re asleep.</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.990" end="00:11:44.550" style="s2">You’re asleep for that most of the time,<br />but sometimes you wake up and you worry about</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.550" end="00:11:45.550" style="s2">everything.</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.550" end="00:11:49.990" style="s2">Anyways, so that’s the right hemisphere<br />– it’s coming up with pictures of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.990" end="00:11:51.260" style="s2">might be there.</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.260" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">They’re generally monstrous pictures and<br />the reason for that is, well it’s obvious,</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:11:57.880" style="s2">what the reason for that is.</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.880" end="00:12:01.480" style="s2">You’ll probably turn the light on and look<br />anyways, even though you might sort of peer</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.480" end="00:12:04.220" style="s2">around the corner, and then when there’s<br />nothing you’ll be embarrassed about how</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.220" end="00:12:06.010" style="s2">foolish you are.</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.010" end="00:12:10.610" style="s2">But you can see the instinctual behavior right<br />there, and it’s wise.</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.610" end="00:12:15.190" style="s2">You know, there’s a low probability that<br />something terrible is there.</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.190" end="00:12:21.279" style="s2">Low probability times infinitely equals large<br />danger.</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.279" end="00:12:26.279" style="s2">So if there’s a two percent chance that<br />there’s a killer in there, it pays to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.279" end="00:12:29.320" style="s2">a little on the tense side, because being<br />killed really sucks.</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.320" end="00:12:35.190" style="s2">So you’re primed to feel negative emotion<br />more intensely, because you’re so vulnerable.</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.190" end="00:12:40.030" style="s2">Anyways, that’s kind of what the right hemisphere<br />is up to – it does quick and dirty representations.</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.030" end="00:12:46.670" style="s2">It also does categorization, so it’s not<br />– it doesn’t give you exactly realistic</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.670" end="00:12:48.339" style="s2">representations of what’s there.</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.339" end="00:12:52.170" style="s2">What it does instead, is it gives you categorical<br />representations.</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.170" end="00:12:55.720" style="s2">So you might say, “how should you represent<br />an unknown danger?”</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.720" end="00:13:01.560" style="s2">You should use an amalgam of all known dangers<br />to represent it.</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.560" end="00:13:03.829" style="s2">That is what it is in a sense, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.829" end="00:13:08.230" style="s2">That’s why I talked to you about the category<br />of “all dangerous things.”</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.230" end="00:13:15.250" style="s2">So the Aboriginals in Australia have this<br />category which is, “women, fire, and dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.250" end="00:13:16.250" style="s2">things.”</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.250" end="00:13:20.070" style="s2">Well you think, well why are all of those<br />things in that category?</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.070" end="00:13:23.670" style="s2">It’s not that hard to figure out if you<br />think about it, but it’s also a category</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.670" end="00:13:27.000" style="s2">that you very frequently see, say in Disney<br />cartoons.</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.000" end="00:13:31.630" style="s2">So the Wicked Queen, for example, in Sleeping<br />Beauty – she’s constantly bursting into</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.630" end="00:13:35.610" style="s2">flames and turning into a dragon and no one<br />seems to object to that – it makes perfect</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.610" end="00:13:38.529" style="s2">sense that the Wicked Queen would turn into<br />a fire-breathing dragon.</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.529" end="00:13:44.829" style="s2">It doesn’t make any sense at all, although<br />it does, but it’s not a rational transformation.</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.829" end="00:13:49.480" style="s2">But because it’s in keeping with an archetypal<br />structure, everybody goes, “yeah, of course</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.480" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">that’s what she’s going to do.”</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:55.620" style="s2">It happens all of the time in Disney movies<br />– like Ursula, remember her from the Little</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.620" end="00:13:56.620" style="s2">Mermaid?</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.620" end="00:13:58.770" style="s2">She’s trying to keep her daughter from becoming<br />conscious.</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.770" end="00:14:01.570" style="s2">Yeah, nice Mother doing that.</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.570" end="00:14:06.570" style="s2">She traps old Zeus – she squeezes his soul<br />to death and traps him in the underworld.</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.570" end="00:14:10.770" style="s2">He’s also – well, we won’t get into<br />that.</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.770" end="00:14:14.000" style="s2">Anyways, what happens to Ursula is when you<br />finally get her irritated enough she grows</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:21.220" style="s2">into this huge, ship-destroying, storm monster<br />that’s part octopus – a giant octopus.</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.220" end="00:14:23.850" style="s2">You think, “well, that makes sense.”</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.850" end="00:14:28.540" style="s2">Okay, it doesn’t make a lot of sense, but<br />it’s a kind of hypothesis.</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.540" end="00:14:33.329" style="s2">Now that’s a representation of Mother Nature<br />– red and tooth and claw, and there’s</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.329" end="00:14:37.269" style="s2">also a reason that’s female – it’s not<br />female, it’s feminine – it’s actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.269" end="00:14:38.610" style="s2">a different thing.</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.610" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">We’ll get to that.</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:45.649" style="s2">So the right hemisphere, well it’s specialized<br />for anomaly – it does quick and dirt analysis</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.649" end="00:14:47.580" style="s2">under the influence of the limbic system.</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.580" end="00:14:52.029" style="s2">It’s not linguistic, so I would say that<br />it’s still dominated by the sub-cortical</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.029" end="00:14:53.029" style="s2">systems.</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.029" end="00:14:57.320" style="s2">My suspicion is that animals are still dominated<br />by the sub-cortical systems.</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.320" end="00:14:59.510" style="s2">Their brains work from the bottom up.</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.510" end="00:15:01.399" style="s2">We have a top down module.</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.399" end="00:15:04.720" style="s2">That’s at least in part of the left hemisphere<br />linguistic system.</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:09.660" style="s2">It’s a new thing that people have, and it’s<br />based on our capacity to abstract, so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.660" end="00:15:14.680" style="s2">would partly be visual, like hieroglyphic,<br />and then also to transform things into linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.680" end="00:15:15.680" style="s2">form.</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.680" end="00:15:19.750" style="s2">It seems to me that that’s the part that<br />we really identify as ourselves, right?</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.750" end="00:15:24.290" style="s2">It’s weird – let’s say you’re home<br />alone, and you get freaked out and all these</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.290" end="00:15:29.779" style="s2">images come to mind; do you think of those<br />images as part of you?</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.779" end="00:15:32.470" style="s2">You think of them more as these things that<br />appeared to you.</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.470" end="00:15:35.310" style="s2">That’s what you think about your dreams.</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.310" end="00:15:38.269" style="s2">They’re things that appeared to you - they’re<br />not you.</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.269" end="00:15:39.500" style="s2">Why would you think that?</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.500" end="00:15:45.880" style="s2">I mean, they’re in your experiential space,<br />so why is there that separation between you</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.880" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">and your dream?</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:48.040" style="s2">“I had a dream.”</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.040" end="00:15:49.740" style="s2">Not, “I thought up a dream.”</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.740" end="00:15:53.380" style="s2">Or, “look what I created,” it’s like<br />there you are, the observer, and up comes</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.380" end="00:15:54.380" style="s2">a dream.</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.380" end="00:15:55.740" style="s2">It’s very, very weird.</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.740" end="00:16:01.220" style="s2">It shows you that there are forces operating<br />in your psyche that are impersonal, genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.220" end="00:16:02.220" style="s2">impersonal.</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.220" end="00:16:04.779" style="s2">That’s part of what you call the collective<br />unconscious.</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.779" end="00:16:08.570" style="s2">It’s the thing that generates these weird<br />images and protects you.</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.570" end="00:16:10.790" style="s2">It’s nature, that’s for sure.</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.790" end="00:16:13.380" style="s2">It can be absolutely terrifying.</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.380" end="00:16:18.570" style="s2">People can have dreams that are so terrible<br />– well like the one my little nephew had,</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.570" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">that’s pretty damn nasty; little greasy<br />dwarf things with big beaks, that’s a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:29.509" style="s2">ugly representation, and if that wasn’t<br />bad enough there had to be a fire-breathing</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.509" end="00:16:31.959" style="s2">dragon behind them, creating them endlessly.</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.959" end="00:16:34.550" style="s2">There’s no bloody-wonder he was waking up<br />screaming.</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.550" end="00:16:38.029" style="s2">It’s like, “Oh no, I figured out what<br />life is like.”</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.029" end="00:16:40.820" style="s2">At four, that’s pretty traumatic.</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.820" end="00:16:43.250" style="s2">So, okay, now the left hemisphere.</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.250" end="00:16:44.759" style="s2">This is Elkonon Goldberg’s hypothesis.</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.759" end="00:16:53.649" style="s2">You get one hemisphere or system that operates<br />when you know what you’re doing and when</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.649" end="00:16:55.540" style="s2">what you want is happening.</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.540" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">That’s the happy-talky part that thinks<br />it knows what-the-hell is going on.</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:04.559" style="s2">Then you have another part that only turns<br />on when you don’t know what’s going on.</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.559" end="00:17:07.030" style="s2">It’s full of anxiety and negative emotion.</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.030" end="00:17:10.750" style="s2">The right hemisphere, by the way, is specialized<br />for negative emotion.</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.750" end="00:17:16.319" style="s2">If you sustain right, pre-frontal damage,<br />you become inappropriately happy.</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.319" end="00:17:18.709" style="s2">You’re full of positive illusions.</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.709" end="00:17:20.809" style="s2">You think, “well, that’s an excellent<br />thing.”</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.809" end="00:17:26.380" style="s2">It’s not – you make really impulsive risky<br />decisions and your life goes directly to hell.</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.380" end="00:17:29.500" style="s2">You need the negative emotion, obviously.</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.500" end="00:17:33.929" style="s2">The reason you suffer with negative emotion<br />is because if you didn’t suffer with negative</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.929" end="00:17:37.820" style="s2">emotion, you’d suffer from being destroyed.</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.820" end="00:17:39.419" style="s2">Those are your options.</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.419" end="00:17:43.220" style="s2">There are people, by the way, who are born<br />without pain.</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.220" end="00:17:44.820" style="s2">You think, “hey, that’s a good deal.”</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.820" end="00:17:49.299" style="s2">They never last past twenty, and part of the<br />reason for that is – you don’t notice</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.299" end="00:17:52.720" style="s2">this – but while you’re sitting there,<br />you’re going like this all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.720" end="00:17:58.570" style="s2">The reason for that is that if you sit for<br />any length of time on one part of your body,</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.570" end="00:18:01.580" style="s2">then it doesn’t get much blood and it doesn’t<br />get oxygenated.</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.580" end="00:18:05.300" style="s2">You do that, it bitches a little bit, a little<br />pain, so you shift.</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.300" end="00:18:08.500" style="s2">You shift and you shift, so you’re just<br />doing this all of the time.</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.500" end="00:18:12.040" style="s2">Otherwise you wear out your damn body and<br />you get bed sores, or that sort of thing.</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.040" end="00:18:17.080" style="s2">These people that don’t have any pain, they<br />just wear themselves out.</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.080" end="00:18:20.060" style="s2">So you need the negative emotion, it keeps<br />you going.</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.060" end="00:18:24.900" style="s2">It can get out of hand and have its own pathologies,<br />but it’s definitely necessary.</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.900" end="00:18:27.530" style="s2">So the right hemisphere does negative emotion.</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.530" end="00:18:31.130" style="s2">Inhibition of behavior – that’s the freezing<br />that’s attended on anxiety.</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.130" end="00:18:35.650" style="s2">It does image processing, holistic thinking<br />– so it’s the quick and dirty hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.650" end="00:18:39.910" style="s2">- pattern recognition, pattern generation<br />and gross motor action.</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.910" end="00:18:44.360" style="s2">That’s interesting too, because the gross<br />motor action is, again, the quick and dirty</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.360" end="00:18:45.480" style="s2">stuff.</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.480" end="00:18:51.299" style="s2">If you need to slap something away, it doesn’t<br />really matter that it’s a gross-motor gesture.</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.299" end="00:18:56.760" style="s2">You don’t have to go like this, and be precise;<br />it can just be fast and sloppy, and it will</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.760" end="00:18:57.760" style="s2">still work.</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.760" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">Now the left hemisphere is specialized for<br />when you know what-the-hell’s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:04.460" style="s2">you can concentrate on the details.</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.460" end="00:19:08.430" style="s2">So then you can think about it in terms of<br />the hierarchy that we discussed, right?</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.430" end="00:19:14.240" style="s2">So what it implies is that at the level of<br />specific, fine, detailed motor output, the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.240" end="00:19:15.810" style="s2">left hemisphere is operating.</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.810" end="00:19:19.850" style="s2">That’s kind of associated with positive<br />affect – I know exactly what I’m doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.850" end="00:19:23.270" style="s2">and I’m making minor adjustments and everything’s<br />going well.</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.270" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">If you go up the hierarchy towards more and<br />more abstracted representations then increasingly,</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:32.080" style="s2">that’s moving over to right hemisphere space.</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.080" end="00:19:38.440" style="s2">So that’s also partly why, when you disrupt<br />those higher-order structures, literally all</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.440" end="00:19:39.750" style="s2">hell breaks loose.</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.750" end="00:19:41.419" style="s2">So, left hemispheres.</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.419" end="00:19:46.299" style="s2">Operation in explored territory – positive<br />emotion, activation of behavior, so that’s</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.299" end="00:19:47.350" style="s2">also exploration.</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.350" end="00:19:55.020" style="s2">Word processing, linear thinking, detail recognition,<br />detail generation, and fine motor action.</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.020" end="00:19:58.390" style="s2">So you need one system that works when you<br />don’t know what’s going on and you need</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.390" end="00:20:01.620" style="s2">another system that works when you do.</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.620" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">Sometimes you’re where you don’t know<br />what you’re doing and sometimes you’re</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:05.669" style="s2">where do know what you’re doing.</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.669" end="00:20:11.740" style="s2">Now Ramachandran, who’s a fairly famous<br />neurologist, who operates out of LA, he associated</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.740" end="00:20:16.430" style="s2">the totalitarian ego with hyper domination<br />of the left hemisphere.</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.430" end="00:20:19.980" style="s2">The reason he did that is very cool.</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.980" end="00:20:27.590" style="s2">So he’s got these patients that have – what’s<br />it called, is it agnosia?</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.590" end="00:20:30.470" style="s2">It isn’t, we’ll call it neglect.</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.470" end="00:20:32.330" style="s2">Okay so this is what happens.</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.330" end="00:20:38.039" style="s2">You have a stroke and the stroke affects the<br />back part of the right hemisphere, alright?</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.039" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">So what happens?</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.640" end="00:20:44.660" style="s2">Your left side is paralyzed; you can’t do<br />anything with it.</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.660" end="00:20:49.470" style="s2">Okay, so, however you also don’t notice<br />that it’s not working, so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.470" end="00:20:53.960" style="s2">you might do if you do become aware – you’re<br />laying in bed, you’ve had a stroke and for</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.960" end="00:20:57.420" style="s2">some reason you notice that there’s an arm<br />lying in there with you.</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.420" end="00:21:00.100" style="s2">Then what you do is you try to pick it up<br />with your other hand and you try to throw</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.100" end="00:21:02.410" style="s2">it out of the bed.</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.410" end="00:21:04.700" style="s2">When you find out that it’s attached to<br />you, because it’s not your arm, you’re</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.700" end="00:21:08.100" style="s2">not very happy – or maybe you throw yourself<br />right out of bed.</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.100" end="00:21:12.250" style="s2">Then if someone gets you to draw a clock you<br />draw half a clock and if you eat a plateful</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.250" end="00:21:16.820" style="s2">of food you eat half the plate, unless someone<br />turns it – and then you eat half of that.</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.820" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">So half the world is gone – it’s hard<br />to imagine what that would be like.</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:26.930" style="s2">I think what it’s sort of like is – you<br />know how there’s a whole world behind you?</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.930" end="00:21:32.049" style="s2">You don’t detect it as not there – it’s<br />not black or anything, like when your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.049" end="00:21:34.250" style="s2">are closed – it’s just not there.</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.250" end="00:21:39.679" style="s2">I think what happens with people with neglect<br />is that the “not there” becomes three</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.679" end="00:21:41.630" style="s2">quarters instead of just half.</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.630" end="00:21:45.429" style="s2">It’s something like that anyways.</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.429" end="00:21:49.590" style="s2">You don’t know what’s going on and there<br />you are like this and someone says to you,</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.590" end="00:21:52.450" style="s2">“I notice that you can’t move your left<br />arm today.”</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.450" end="00:21:53.450" style="s2">What do you say?</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.450" end="00:21:55.990" style="s2">You say, “that’s because I’m tired.”</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.990" end="00:21:59.930" style="s2">Or, “I don’t feel like moving it.”</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.930" end="00:22:03.780" style="s2">And so forth, so you have this reason that<br />you’re not going to move it.</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.780" end="00:22:07.830" style="s2">You might say the same thing about the left<br />foot, “yeah well I don’t feel like moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.830" end="00:22:08.830" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.830" end="00:22:11.130" style="s2">“ You’ll have some story about why you’re<br />not going to move it.</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.130" end="00:22:12.970" style="s2">Okay so that’s fine.</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.970" end="00:22:16.230" style="s2">Freudian’s thought about that is traumatic<br />denial.</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.230" end="00:22:21.940" style="s2">It was so overwhelming to you that you lost<br />the left part of your body.</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.940" end="00:22:24.540" style="s2">You couldn’t face it and you just denied<br />it happened.</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.540" end="00:22:31.299" style="s2">It’s not a bad theory, it’s not quite<br />right, but it’s not a bad theory.</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.299" end="00:22:33.539" style="s2">I’ll tell you a couple of related stories.</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.539" end="00:22:36.050" style="s2">Let’s say you’re on dialysis.</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.050" end="00:22:37.320" style="s2">That sucks.</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.320" end="00:22:40.820" style="s2">You have to have this big thing in your arm,<br />it’s like a shunt, and you have to go get</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.820" end="00:22:44.230" style="s2">hooked up to a dialysis machine like all the<br />time.</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.230" end="00:22:46.929" style="s2">Your kidneys are failing and who wants that?</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.929" end="00:22:51.320" style="s2">Nobody, so everybody thinks: time for a kidney<br />transplant, and then they’re on a long waiting</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.320" end="00:22:53.170" style="s2">list and they get one kidney.</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.170" end="00:22:56.220" style="s2">That’s not very many kidneys.</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.220" end="00:22:59.789" style="s2">Then they say, “okay, you got your kidney<br />and everyone’s thrilled about that, here’s</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.789" end="00:23:02.800" style="s2">your anti-rejection medication, make sure<br />you take it.</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.800" end="00:23:06.870" style="s2">Then a year later you lose your kidney, why?</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.870" end="00:23:10.191" style="s2">You don’t take your damn anti-rejection<br />medication, that’s the most common reason.</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.191" end="00:23:13.890" style="s2">You might think, well why in the world would<br />you not take your anti-rejection medication?</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.890" end="00:23:15.909" style="s2">The Freudians would say denial.</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.909" end="00:23:22.980" style="s2">Here’s a different hypothesis: Your whole<br />map of you is person with kidney.</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.980" end="00:23:26.210" style="s2">Then you lose your kidneys and it’s like<br />you’re a whole, weird thing that you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.210" end="00:23:27.450" style="s2">no idea about.</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.450" end="00:23:30.980" style="s2">It’s virtually impossible for you to update<br />your model.</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.980" end="00:23:33.190" style="s2">You think, does that make any sense?</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.190" end="00:23:34.840" style="s2">Have you ever lost a tooth?</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:35.840" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.840" end="00:23:37.870" style="s2">What does your tongue do for six months?</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.870" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">You’re sitting there and your tongue is<br />fiddling away there like a mad dog investigating</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:48.460" style="s2">every teensy nook and cranny like it’s an<br />obsessive exploratory device.</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.460" end="00:23:50.600" style="s2">It does it even when you don’t want it to.</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.600" end="00:23:53.320" style="s2">Then six months later you get your mouth remapped.</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.320" end="00:23:58.220" style="s2">That’s just a tooth, man; lose a kidney<br />and see what happens.</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.220" end="00:24:01.570" style="s2">Or lose the whole left side of you body, it’s<br />like, what are you going to do about that?</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.570" end="00:24:07.039" style="s2">Well, okay, then Ramachandran, he’s testing<br />these people for balance.</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.039" end="00:24:14.840" style="s2">What he does is he checks out this phenomena<br />called nystagmus, and so if you pour cold</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.840" end="00:24:19.190" style="s2">water in someone’s ear their eyes will move<br />back and forth because it screws up the – you</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.190" end="00:24:23.590" style="s2">know you have a balance system in you, in<br />ear your ear – and if you pour cold water</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.590" end="00:24:26.950" style="s2">in there it screws it up and then your eyes<br />move back and forth.</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.950" end="00:24:28.770" style="s2">You know, it’s not very pleasant.</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.770" end="00:24:34.250" style="s2">What he found was that if he poured cold water<br />in the left ear, then all of a sudden the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.250" end="00:24:38.029" style="s2">people would wake up and go, “Oh my God,<br />I don’t have the left side of my body,”</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.029" end="00:24:42.200" style="s2">and then they’d have a catastrophic emotional<br />experience and they’d be all upset about</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.200" end="00:24:46.770" style="s2">it crying away; which is of course what they<br />should do.</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.770" end="00:24:50.539" style="s2">Twenty minutes later it would wear off and<br />you’d say is there anything wrong with your</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.539" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">left side and they’d say well yeah, I just<br />don’t feel like moving it.</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:59.740" style="s2">So what seems to have happened is something<br />– so there’s a body representation center</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.740" end="00:25:02.830" style="s2">in the back of the right hemisphere.</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.830" end="00:25:06.890" style="s2">You blow that sucker out with a stroke, and<br />that means that you can’t represent that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.890" end="00:25:08.790" style="s2">part of your body anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.790" end="00:25:12.900" style="s2">Maybe there are tatters of it left; it’s<br />like a network that’s damaged and under</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.900" end="00:25:17.110" style="s2">some conditions you can more or less get it<br />to operate so you pour some cold water in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.110" end="00:25:19.679" style="s2">the ear and you shock the whole system.</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:24.200" style="s2">Then there’s enough neurological activity<br />so the network kicks in, even though it’s</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.200" end="00:25:28.980" style="s2">damaged for ten minutes, and then you get<br />this tremendous burst of negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.980" end="00:25:33.080" style="s2">- which is what the right hemisphere should<br />be doing when you lose half of your body.</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.080" end="00:25:37.409" style="s2">You experience that when your left hemisphere<br />is flapping away trying to account for this</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.409" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">– which it can’t, because it’s such<br />a massive, utter catastrophe.</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:47.350" style="s2">Then you know, the shock wears off and “bang!”<br />the system shuts back down, and “poof!”</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.350" end="00:25:48.930" style="s2">you’re back in denial.</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.930" end="00:25:52.971" style="s2">That’s a good example of the relationship<br />between the left hemisphere and the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.971" end="00:25:53.971" style="s2">hemisphere.</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.971" end="00:25:57.309" style="s2">The left hemisphere has a fixed idea about<br />the world.</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.309" end="00:26:02.830" style="s2">So in some sense you might think about it<br />as the instantiation of your latest avatar;</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.830" end="00:26:05.799" style="s2">you can certainly see that with people who<br />are ideologically possessed.</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.799" end="00:26:10.940" style="s2">They’ve got this verbal system that accounts<br />for the whole world and there’s just no</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.940" end="00:26:13.480" style="s2">damn way that thing’s going anywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.480" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">It’s got this totalitarian aspect because<br />it wants to explain every last thing; it doesn’t</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:20.789" style="s2">like anomaly at all.</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.789" end="00:26:23.419" style="s2">It hasn’t come to terms with anomaly at<br />all.</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.419" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">There’s no sense of transformation within<br />the system, which is partly why totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.320" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">systems die.</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:35.730" style="s2">The Red Queen said to Alice in Wonderland<br />when she was in the underworld, “in my kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.730" end="00:26:39.059" style="s2">you have to run as fast as you can just to<br />stay in the same place.”</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.059" end="00:26:42.190" style="s2">That’s why totalitarian systems don’t<br />work.</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.190" end="00:26:45.230" style="s2">The damn environment keeps shifting around<br />on them.</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.230" end="00:26:50.650" style="s2">If they’re fixed in place, the gap between<br />their theory and reality gets larger and larger</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.650" end="00:26:56.610" style="s2">and larger and larger until finally they fall<br />into a pit; and that’s the end of it.</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.610" end="00:26:59.370" style="s2">That’s what happens to people too, if they<br />don’t stay updated.</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.370" end="00:27:07.020" style="s2">They let things get away on them; eventually<br />the ignored reality comes flooding back, and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.020" end="00:27:10.630" style="s2">we’ll see that represented in mythology<br />because it’s represented very nicely in</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.630" end="00:27:11.630" style="s2">mythology.</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.630" end="00:27:17.730" style="s2">It’s why often dragons in fairytales, for<br />example, in the Saint George story, and in</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.730" end="00:27:21.750" style="s2">the Hobbit for that matter – the dragon<br />is an eternal thing: it lives underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.750" end="00:27:25.309" style="s2">earth and most of the time it leaves you the<br />hell alone.</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.309" end="00:27:29.750" style="s2">Now and then it comes back and it tries to<br />destroy the city, and then you have to zip</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.750" end="00:27:32.950" style="s2">out there and fight the thing so you can get<br />it to go back in its hole.</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.950" end="00:27:36.649" style="s2">Maybe you get the treasure that it’s carrying,<br />and then it’s back in the hole for while;</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.649" end="00:27:38.539" style="s2">but that thing’s coming back.</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.539" end="00:27:43.560" style="s2">It’s always coming back, and so you build<br />the walls and all that, that’s fine.</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.560" end="00:27:46.640" style="s2">A dragon can destroy any walls.</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.640" end="00:27:49.710" style="s2">Walls aren’t enough – you have to be prepared<br />to go out there and fight the damn thing,</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.710" end="00:27:53.070" style="s2">and that’s how you keep it at bay.</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.070" end="00:27:56.501" style="s2">That basically means you have to maintain<br />everything that you build, it’s something</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.501" end="00:27:57.740" style="s2">like that, right?</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.740" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">Otherwise it falls apart with increasing entropy.</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.200" end="00:28:12.030" style="s2">Alright, so <br />Goldberg thought about this as an anomaly</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.030" end="00:28:14.790" style="s2">system, a novelty system and a routinization<br />system.</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.790" end="00:28:24.049" style="s2">I intended to think about it from more of<br />an Anthropological or an Ethological perspective;</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.049" end="00:28:27.240" style="s2">thinking about an animal (us) in our natural<br />environment.</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.240" end="00:28:33.340" style="s2">It’s not so much novelty versus routinization,<br />as it’s explored versus unexplored territory.</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.340" end="00:28:38.539" style="s2">That’s what the world’s made out of – it’s<br />made out of explored versus unexplored territory.</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.539" end="00:28:43.919" style="s2">So there’s a domain that you inhabit, which<br />is the center of the universe, from a mythological</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.919" end="00:28:46.970" style="s2">perspective, with you right in the middle<br />of it.</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.970" end="00:28:51.650" style="s2">Around you is this circle, which is your place,<br />which you move around with you, and in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.650" end="00:28:53.809" style="s2">circle you know what-the-hell’s going on.</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.809" end="00:28:58.990" style="s2">That’s partly because you’ve mapped it,<br />but it’s also partly because you don’t</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.990" end="00:29:00.530" style="s2">go outside of it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.530" end="00:29:05.390" style="s2">You have your friends and you have your routine<br />and that’s nested inside your culture, and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.390" end="00:29:08.380" style="s2">you try and keep that thing from flipping<br />upside down.</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.380" end="00:29:14.159" style="s2">You do that all sorts of way: partly by doing<br />the same thing all the time, but also partly</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.159" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">by refusing to go anywhere that might seriously<br />challenge your beliefs.</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:22.929" style="s2">Fair enough, you can understand that, although<br />it makes you weak to do that, because you’re</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.929" end="00:29:24.660" style="s2">not as prepared as you might be.</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.660" end="00:29:34.289" style="s2">So you could say human beings are tribal,<br />social animals that have a territory.</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.289" end="00:29:35.960" style="s2">Then you think, “well what’s the territory?”</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.960" end="00:29:40.340" style="s2">Well let’s say tree-dwelling chimp ancestors;<br />the territory’s the jungle.</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.340" end="00:29:41.340" style="s2">No, it’s not.</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.340" end="00:29:43.789" style="s2">That’s not the territory.</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.789" end="00:29:51.039" style="s2">The territory is a little bit of the jungle,<br />plus the things that come in from the outside,</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.039" end="00:29:56.059" style="s2">plus the primate dominance hierarchy that<br />exists in that area.</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.059" end="00:30:00.440" style="s2">So that’s the territory, that’s the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.440" end="00:30:05.610" style="s2">For mythological reasons we tend to make a<br />separation between the environment and culture.</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.610" end="00:30:11.529" style="s2">Yes, it makes sense at one level of analysis,<br />but at another level of analysis all it does</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.529" end="00:30:12.899" style="s2">is screw you up.</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.899" end="00:30:18.350" style="s2">You’re territory, fundamentally, isn’t<br />the world; not the natural, objective world.</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.350" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">You want to stay as far away from that thing<br />as you possibly can.</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:28.260" style="s2">Your territory is that circle of people with<br />whom you spend ninety percent of your time.</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.260" end="00:30:33.000" style="s2">If you’re a chimp, for example, or some<br />other kind of monkey, highly social, what</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.000" end="00:30:34.260" style="s2">do you do all day?</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.260" end="00:30:39.640" style="s2">You sleep, you eat, you chew leaves if you’re<br />a chimp, and you groom other chimps.</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.640" end="00:30:45.140" style="s2">It’s constant social interaction, and you’re<br />jockeying for a position in the dominance</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.140" end="00:30:49.810" style="s2">hierarchy like mean girls in that movie, you<br />know.</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.810" end="00:30:53.000" style="s2">You’re mapping out the social territory<br />knowing who’s who, and what’s what, and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.000" end="00:30:55.170" style="s2">then trying to get up somewhere near the top.</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.170" end="00:31:06.929" style="s2">That’s your environment, that’s your environment,<br />and so your world is that social, natural</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.929" end="00:31:12.610" style="s2">circle, which is a four-dimensional territory,<br />because its got length, width and height – plus</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.610" end="00:31:14.120" style="s2">it stretches across time.</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.120" end="00:31:18.490" style="s2">So it’s this transforming natural entity.</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.490" end="00:31:20.651" style="s2">Inside that there’s a pyramid.</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.651" end="00:31:24.130" style="s2">The pyramid is made out of all the primates<br />that you interact with.</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.130" end="00:31:27.590" style="s2">That’s the world; circle with a pyramid<br />on it.</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.590" end="00:31:31.240" style="s2">Now I’ll give you a vision, this is a vision<br />I had once when I was trying to figure this</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.240" end="00:31:32.240" style="s2">stuff out.</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.240" end="00:31:33.990" style="s2">Now what is the world?</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.990" end="00:31:40.490" style="s2">So imagine that there’s a field in front<br />of you that stretches as far as you can see.</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.490" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">You’re flying above it.</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:45.580" style="s2">What you see everywhere are these pyramids.</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.580" end="00:31:50.039" style="s2">Let’s say for the sake of argument, that<br />they’re skyscrapers made out of glass.</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.039" end="00:31:51.990" style="s2">There are tears in them.</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.990" end="00:31:56.510" style="s2">You fly down and one’s here and one’s<br />here, and some of them are really big and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.510" end="00:31:58.549" style="s2">some of them are really small.</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.549" end="00:32:00.010" style="s2">They’re just everywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.010" end="00:32:03.910" style="s2">You’re flying around above them, and you<br />fly close enough to look inside and what you</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.910" end="00:32:08.780" style="s2">see inside them are people all packed together,<br />trying to scramble up to the top.</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.780" end="00:32:12.210" style="s2">That’s the world, that’s reality.</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.210" end="00:32:16.110" style="s2">The funny thing is, is that you can be in<br />one of those pyramids clambering away to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.110" end="00:32:19.289" style="s2">top, or you can be flying above it – those<br />are your options.</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.289" end="00:32:23.120" style="s2">If you have to choose, you should be flying<br />above it.</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.120" end="00:32:28.789" style="s2">So the relationship between the self and the<br />ego avatar is the same as the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.789" end="00:32:32.840" style="s2">between the thing that’s flying above, and<br />the thing that’s within one of those pyramids</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.840" end="00:32:35.070" style="s2">trying to scramble to the top.</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.070" end="00:32:36.940" style="s2">You know, well you say well I’m going to<br />get to the top.</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.940" end="00:32:38.649" style="s2">“Top of what?”</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.649" end="00:32:41.830" style="s2">There’s a hundred tops, there’s two hundred<br />tops.</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.830" end="00:32:44.779" style="s2">Then you might say, “well is there anything<br />above the top?”</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.779" end="00:32:51.429" style="s2">There is, there’s the part of you that isn’t<br />entrapped within that particular system and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.429" end="00:32:53.470" style="s2">that can move from place to place.</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.470" end="00:32:57.200" style="s2">If you look at Egyptian mythology: so you<br />know you’ll see if you look at the back</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:00.340" style="s2">of the American dollar bill, that’s a symbol<br />of value, right?</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.340" end="00:33:02.600" style="s2">Okay, so what’s the pyramid?</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.600" end="00:33:04.540" style="s2">There’s a pyramid on it, right?</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.540" end="00:33:06.019" style="s2">What’s the top of a pyramid?</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.019" end="00:33:08.179" style="s2">It’s a triangle, it’s separate from the<br />pyramid.</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.179" end="00:33:09.909" style="s2">There’s an eye inside of it.</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.909" end="00:33:15.100" style="s2">That’s because the top of the pyramid is<br />an eye, and it’s separate from the pyramid.</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.100" end="00:33:23.500" style="s2">What that means, fundamentally, is that the<br />thing that transcends the structure is attention,</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.500" end="00:33:25.250" style="s2">voluntary attention.</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.250" end="00:33:31.140" style="s2">Now the Egyptians worshiped voluntary attention<br />in the form of Horus, because he was a God.</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.140" end="00:33:33.730" style="s2">I’ll tell you about Horus in detail.</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.730" end="00:33:38.289" style="s2">One of Horus’ avatars was the falcon.</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.289" end="00:33:40.559" style="s2">The reason for that is falcons can really,<br />really, really see.</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.559" end="00:33:45.110" style="s2">They fly around, and so they’re like the<br />king’s eyes.</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.110" end="00:33:48.220" style="s2">Like the little bird Zazu in the Lion King.</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.220" end="00:33:51.950" style="s2">He was the king’s eyes, the thing that flies<br />around above.</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.950" end="00:33:56.570" style="s2">He was a particular enemy of Scar, remember<br />Scar eats him at the beginning and then spits</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.570" end="00:33:57.680" style="s2">him out.</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.680" end="00:34:01.789" style="s2">The reason that the King’s eyes is an enemy<br />of scar is because the King’s eyes can see</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.789" end="00:34:03.340" style="s2">what he is, right?</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.340" end="00:34:08.599" style="s2">He’s the eternal force that works to disrupt<br />the kingdom and bring everything into ruins.</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.599" end="00:34:14.429" style="s2">Classic myth, classic myth, partly accounting<br />for why it was the largest selling, highest</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.429" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">grossing cartoon in Disney history.</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:22.280" style="s2">They got the mythology pretty right.</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.280" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">So you might say, “what’s a human being<br />like?”</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:42.880" style="s2">Remember I told you that when Penfield was<br />mapping the brain he was poking people.</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.880" end="00:34:47.510" style="s2">You can either poke them along the sensory<br />strip, which is – if the motor strip is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.510" end="00:34:51.139" style="s2">here, the sensory strip is just behind it.</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.139" end="00:34:56.030" style="s2">The motor strip is where the motor systems<br />of your body are represented in so far as</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.030" end="00:34:57.970" style="s2">you can control them.</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.970" end="00:35:03.190" style="s2">The sensory strip is where the sensory systems<br />are represented in so far as you can feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.190" end="00:35:04.190" style="s2">them.</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.190" end="00:35:10.650" style="s2">So what this is, is a – the body is laid<br />out weirdly on the motor cortex.</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.650" end="00:35:14.680" style="s2">One of the things that’s pretty funny is<br />that the genitalia area in the sensory cortex</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.680" end="00:35:16.800" style="s2">is right beside the feet.</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.800" end="00:35:22.320" style="s2">So I think that’s why people have foot fetishes<br />and love foot massages, is because they’re</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:27.000" style="s2">spreading activation from the foot area to<br />the genital area, and God only knows why that</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.000" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">is.</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:32.060" style="s2">Maybe because you had to have had really sensitive<br />feet to stomp around without stepping on really</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.060" end="00:35:33.670" style="s2">horrible things.</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.670" end="00:35:41.190" style="s2">So you can put this weird, stretched-out,<br />body representation together in a representational</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.190" end="00:35:46.250" style="s2">form like this, they call that the homunculus,<br />which is like a little-man that exists inside</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.250" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">your brain.</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:50.310" style="s2">So what you see, that’s the motor-homunculus,<br />not the sensory-homunculus.</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.310" end="00:35:52.630" style="s2">So what do you see?</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.630" end="00:35:55.260" style="s2">Well what is a person as far as its brain<br />is concerned?</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.260" end="00:35:58.420" style="s2">Well, hand – that’s for sure.</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.420" end="00:36:03.250" style="s2">Thumb, that’s for sure – your thumb is<br />as representative of your whole body.</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.250" end="00:36:09.500" style="s2">It’s because your torso is hardly represented<br />at all.</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.500" end="00:36:10.700" style="s2">Why is that?</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.700" end="00:36:14.070" style="s2">How many things do you manipulate with your<br />chest?</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.070" end="00:36:15.430" style="s2">None.</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.430" end="00:36:19.589" style="s2">You don’t have motor control over it, so<br />it’s not represented.</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.589" end="00:36:23.580" style="s2">So, the hands man, those things, they’re<br />represented like mad.</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.580" end="00:36:26.340" style="s2">So are the face, and the lips and the tongue.</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.340" end="00:36:30.589" style="s2">There’s a bunch of reasons for that: One<br />is when you’re an infant, you explore like</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.589" end="00:36:35.330" style="s2">mad with your mouth – but you do that your<br />whole life because when you eat- you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.330" end="00:36:36.330" style="s2">what it’s like.</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.330" end="00:36:40.410" style="s2">If you’re eating something and there’s<br />a bit of sand in it, you find it and you take</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.410" end="00:36:41.410" style="s2">it out.</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.410" end="00:36:45.170" style="s2">You can detect this teeny, little thing that’s<br />not supposed to be in your mouth.</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.170" end="00:36:48.970" style="s2">Well that’s a good thing because lots of<br />things aren’t supposed to be in your mouth.</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.970" end="00:36:50.680" style="s2">That’s part of the reason.</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.680" end="00:36:54.220" style="s2">The other part of the reason is, well think<br />about what you do with your tongue?</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.220" end="00:36:58.660" style="s2">There are a lot of things you do with your<br />tongue: Some of them are eating, some of them</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.660" end="00:36:59.880" style="s2">are talking.</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.880" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">Some of them are all sorts of intimate behaviors,<br />that thing is wired up; and it’s wired up</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:06.130" style="s2">right at birth.</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.130" end="00:37:12.140" style="s2">Then it’s the same with your lips and the<br />rest of your mouth, you use that to communicate.</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.140" end="00:37:16.270" style="s2">Your hands wander around, taking the world<br />apart, and putting it back together, which</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.270" end="00:37:20.910" style="s2">is exactly what your brain does, and then<br />you blab about what you’re doing to everyone.</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.910" end="00:37:23.160" style="s2">That’s basically a human being.</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.160" end="00:37:29.480" style="s2">I like to think of this thing as it’s a<br />comical representation of the hero that goes</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.480" end="00:37:31.800" style="s2">out to confront the world, right?</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.800" end="00:37:33.270" style="s2">The hero has two elements.</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.270" end="00:37:39.700" style="s2">One is explore, and that’s where the west<br />is powerful.</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.700" end="00:37:43.450" style="s2">We have a really well developed mythology<br />of the exploratory hero.</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.450" end="00:37:46.130" style="s2">Where we’re not so well developed is the<br />second part.</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.130" end="00:37:51.310" style="s2">In the second part of the classic hero story,<br />you’re supposed to come back and communicate</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.310" end="00:37:53.349" style="s2">about what you’ve found.</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.349" end="00:37:57.609" style="s2">So if there’s an individual exploration<br />element, and then there’s a communicate</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.609" end="00:38:00.160" style="s2">and update the culture element.</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.160" end="00:38:04.360" style="s2">Both of those are equally important an it’s<br />something we don’t do well, we don’t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.360" end="00:38:09.530" style="s2">much respect for tradition in the west, and<br />it’s a really, really big problem.</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.530" end="00:38:14.530" style="s2">The ethical responsibility of a human being<br />is to take the dead culture, so that’s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.530" end="00:38:20.200" style="s2">dead father, or the dead God, and to revivify<br />it with attention and communication.</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.200" end="00:38:23.730" style="s2">If you fail to do that then everything disappears.</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.730" end="00:38:27.530" style="s2">We’re failing to do that – we’re leaving<br />it all behind instead.</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.530" end="00:38:29.579" style="s2">It’s not a good idea.</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.579" end="00:38:36.280" style="s2">You know if the old Gods die as Nietzsche<br />said they had, new Gods swoop in very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.280" end="00:38:41.630" style="s2">and if you thought the old God was bad, you<br />wait until the new God gets a hold of you.</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.630" end="00:38:46.750" style="s2">So, well we saw what happened in the twentieth<br />century, with all of the ideologies that sprang</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.750" end="00:38:49.310" style="s2">up in the absence of classical religious belief.</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.310" end="00:38:54.710" style="s2">Okay, you’re not so thrilled with Catholicism,<br />if you think about that as the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.710" end="00:38:56.170" style="s2">tradition of the West.</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.170" end="00:38:58.630" style="s2">You know, with the witch burnings and the<br />inquisition and all that.</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.630" end="00:39:03.450" style="s2">It’s like yeah, yeah, get a load of the<br />Nazis and then see what you think; or the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.450" end="00:39:11.910" style="s2">Communists for that matter - from bad to worse<br />in an unimaginable way.</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.910" end="00:39:17.619" style="s2">You know, and it’s partly because those<br />archaic systems, those archaic, religious</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.619" end="00:39:21.810" style="s2">systems, they weren’t ideologies, they were<br />a whole different class of thing.</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.810" end="00:39:25.859" style="s2">We don’t understand them very well, and<br />it’s not good because you cannot live without</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.859" end="00:39:26.920" style="s2">understanding them.</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.920" end="00:39:28.700" style="s2">You don’t know who you are.</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.700" end="00:39:32.599" style="s2">Then you fall prey to weird mental diseases,<br />like Nihilism, that’s one.</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.599" end="00:39:37.869" style="s2">The other one is ideological possession – so<br />you become a Totalitarian or a Nihilist.</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.869" end="00:39:40.170" style="s2">That’s a bad outcome.</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.170" end="00:39:42.190" style="s2">You might think, “well, what’s the alternative?”</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.190" end="00:39:44.690" style="s2">Well, you know what happens in Pinocchio,<br />right?</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.690" end="00:39:45.710" style="s2">You’ve watched Pinocchio?</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.710" end="00:39:48.960" style="s2">Okay, I often show Pinocchio to this class,<br />but I don’t know if I’m going to do that</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.960" end="00:39:49.960" style="s2">this year.</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.960" end="00:39:52.670" style="s2">Anyways, Pinocchio, he’s a puppet, a marionette.</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.670" end="00:39:53.960" style="s2">Someone else is pulling his strings.</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.960" end="00:39:55.370" style="s2">He has a wooden head.</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.370" end="00:39:56.390" style="s2">He’s not very bright.</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.390" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">He hasn’t banged the world at all.</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.320" end="00:40:02.420" style="s2">He’s got a good father, the old Geppetto,<br />who would really rather that he was a real</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.420" end="00:40:04.120" style="s2">boy, a real person.</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.120" end="00:40:09.060" style="s2">So he’s the kind of father that wants to<br />produce an individual, not a slave.</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.060" end="00:40:13.339" style="s2">That’s why in his workshop it’s all friendly<br />and there’s a nice fire, and he’s making</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.339" end="00:40:16.770" style="s2">toys and there’s lots of music, it’s like<br />“Go Geppetto!” he’s a good guy.</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.770" end="00:40:19.210" style="s2">He makes this little puppet and he sends him<br />out in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.210" end="00:40:20.819" style="s2">He says, “go be a real boy.”</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.819" end="00:40:28.970" style="s2">Well, Pinocchio runs into a whole class of<br />different obstacles; one is evil, that’s</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.970" end="00:40:36.099" style="s2">the Coachman, and the Italian stereotype guy<br />who makes him a dancing puppet celebrity.</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.099" end="00:40:41.410" style="s2">I think that’s pretty funny, that’s really<br />prescient.</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.410" end="00:40:47.460" style="s2">You might think well what’s the goal of<br />your typical bone-headed, mid-adolescent in</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.460" end="00:40:49.480" style="s2">North America – unearned celebrity.</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.480" end="00:40:52.990" style="s2">Well that’s exactly what Pinocchio goes<br />for first.</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.990" end="00:40:57.140" style="s2">That doesn’t work out so well because he<br />ends up a slave and then the next thing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.140" end="00:41:01.730" style="s2">happens is he capitalizes on the fact that<br />he’s vulnerable, and pretends he’s sick</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.730" end="00:41:05.970" style="s2">and goes off for a vacation, under the direction<br />of the Coachman (who’s basically Satan in</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.970" end="00:41:06.970" style="s2">disguise).</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.970" end="00:41:12.690" style="s2">Then he goes out to treasure island and meets<br />all of the delinquents who are just like Nazis,</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.690" end="00:41:17.920" style="s2">and turns out in fact the whole ploy is to<br />enslave everyone, to deprive them of their</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.920" end="00:41:21.990" style="s2">voice – that’s the donkey’s breying<br />– and to make them into slaves.</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.990" end="00:41:28.680" style="s2">Pretty damn horrifying and that movie came<br />out around the time that the Nazis were really</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.680" end="00:41:31.320" style="s2">grasping power in central Europe.</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.320" end="00:41:33.210" style="s2">They got it exactly right.</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.210" end="00:41:36.619" style="s2">Here’s what’s really going on behind the<br />scenes.</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.619" end="00:41:40.280" style="s2">Then what happens is Pinocchio turns halfway<br />into a braying donkey.</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.280" end="00:41:44.690" style="s2">He’s gone off the path and in order to get<br />back on it he tries to go home.</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.690" end="00:41:48.540" style="s2">It’s too late, he can’t go home, because<br />he’s not a kid anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.540" end="00:41:52.250" style="s2">He goes home and Dad isn’t there, surprise,<br />surprise.</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.250" end="00:41:58.010" style="s2">Once you grow up and you go home, Dad isn’t<br />there – it’s just another human being.</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.010" end="00:42:00.560" style="s2">So then what happens is he has to go into<br />the ocean.</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.560" end="00:42:02.510" style="s2">Well that’s particularly weird, right?</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.510" end="00:42:07.839" style="s2">There he is, half donkey, he’s a puppet,<br />the dove comes down and drops him a message</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.839" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">from God.</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.880" end="00:42:13.819" style="s2">It’s like the Holy Spirit descending, except<br />it’s from the blue fairy, weirdly enough.</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.819" end="00:42:18.280" style="s2">The message says you have to go to the deepest<br />part of the ocean and rescue your father.</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.280" end="00:42:23.580" style="s2">Yeah that is what you have to do if you don’t<br />want to be a bloody, puppet donkey.</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.580" end="00:42:28.020" style="s2">You have to go down into the depths and find<br />your dead Father and you have to revivify</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.020" end="00:42:29.020" style="s2">him.</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.020" end="00:42:30.020" style="s2">That’s what happens.</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.020" end="00:42:34.349" style="s2">So Pinocchio goes way down there into the<br />deepest depths and finds Monstro, who’s</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.349" end="00:42:38.990" style="s2">a monster so terrible that the fish swim away<br />at the sound of his voice.</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.990" end="00:42:45.410" style="s2">Just like, “he who shall not be named – Voldemort.”</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.410" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">You can’t even say his damn name.</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:49.109" style="s2">Same with Monstro.</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.109" end="00:42:53.320" style="s2">Pinocchio goes down there, he goes into the<br />whale, what happens?</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.320" end="00:42:57.490" style="s2">Geppetto says there’s no getting out of<br />this, there’s no getting out of this.</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.490" end="00:43:01.050" style="s2">We just have to sit here and cook fish and<br />Pinocchio thinks, “cook!”</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.050" end="00:43:05.520" style="s2">He starts breaking up all the chairs and everything<br />and his Father is freaking out, “what are</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.520" end="00:43:06.880" style="s2">you doing breaking all of these chairs?</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.880" end="00:43:08.050" style="s2">What are we going to sit out?”</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.050" end="00:43:09.619" style="s2">Pinocchio lights them on fire.</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.619" end="00:43:11.040" style="s2">He’s a master of fire.</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.040" end="00:43:12.760" style="s2">It’s a Shemanic ritual.</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.760" end="00:43:17.420" style="s2">He is a master of fire and that’s what human<br />being is.</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.420" end="00:43:21.630" style="s2">He gets everything burning, of course Geppetto’s<br />all freaked out about that because what are</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.630" end="00:43:24.230" style="s2">the going to sit on, and Pinocchio thinks,<br />“who cares about sitting?</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.230" end="00:43:27.650" style="s2">We’re going to solve the problem once and<br />for all.”</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.650" end="00:43:31.140" style="s2">Then the whale turns into a fire-breathing<br />dragon, which is pretty damn weird thing for</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.140" end="00:43:32.260" style="s2">a whale to do.</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.260" end="00:43:36.590" style="s2">He half-kills Pinocchio, he washes up on shore<br />dead, but he saves his father.</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.590" end="00:43:40.910" style="s2">Then at the very end of the movie he’s lying<br />on his bed, all drowned.</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.910" end="00:43:43.640" style="s2">So he’s a dead puppet now.</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.640" end="00:43:46.280" style="s2">Do you want to be a live puppet or a dead<br />puppet?</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.280" end="00:43:50.150" style="s2">Well the maybe the dead puppet is better than<br />the live puppet, it depends on where your</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.150" end="00:43:51.150" style="s2">going.</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.150" end="00:43:54.970" style="s2">Then he’s on the bed, and the blue fairy<br />comes down and says well you’ve been honest</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.970" end="00:43:57.010" style="s2">and courageous, “bang!” now you’re real.</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.010" end="00:44:04.730" style="s2">Then they have a little part, and that’s<br />just exactly right, they got that exactly</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.730" end="00:44:05.730" style="s2">right.</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.730" end="00:44:09.210" style="s2">That’s part of the hero mythology, it’s<br />the rescuing of the father.</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.210" end="00:44:14.180" style="s2">Student: Why do you have to rescue the father?</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.180" end="00:44:16.230" style="s2">Otherwise you’re a corpse.</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.230" end="00:44:23.140" style="s2">You’re a historical creature, you’re a<br />cultural creature.</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.140" end="00:44:26.440" style="s2">You cannot live without your culture.</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.440" end="00:44:28.670" style="s2">You think you can, but you can’t.</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.670" end="00:44:32.860" style="s2">it disappears, and look, I’ll give an example.</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.860" end="00:44:36.780" style="s2">In the Mesopotamian creation myth, which I’m<br />going to tell you about next week, one of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.780" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">the things that happens is that the first<br />round of Gods, so they’re like primordial</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:46.060" style="s2">forces, they’re pretty damn careless, and<br />they kill their father.</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.060" end="00:44:49.500" style="s2">They make this place to live on his corpse.</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.500" end="00:44:53.880" style="s2">That’s where we live, we live on the corpse<br />of our ancestors.</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.880" end="00:44:57.460" style="s2">We live in the society, it’s dead, it’s<br />the product of dead people.</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.460" end="00:45:00.300" style="s2">It’s got this dead element, but we’re<br />living on it.</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.300" end="00:45:05.650" style="s2">They’re very careless, they kill it, so<br />they render it completely dead.</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.650" end="00:45:10.400" style="s2">Well what happens is Tiamat, who’s the Mother<br />of Chaos, she comes flooding back and she</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.400" end="00:45:14.150" style="s2">thinks, “oh you killed the thing that protects<br />you.</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.150" end="00:45:16.030" style="s2">You just wait to see what happens.”</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.030" end="00:45:20.510" style="s2">That’s exactly it, if you kill the thing<br />that structures you, you won’t know it – it’s</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.510" end="00:45:23.540" style="s2">like Nietzsche’s prediction from the death<br />of God.</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.540" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">You killed this, think it doesn’t make any<br />difference, - wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:31.560" style="s2">It’s like the Striders protecting the Hobbits.</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.560" end="00:45:36.099" style="s2">If you get rid of the thing that protects<br />you then chaos comes flooding in and you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.099" end="00:45:37.970" style="s2">no idea what’s possible.</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.970" end="00:45:40.460" style="s2">We do, though, because we lived through the<br />twentieth century.</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.460" end="00:45:42.680" style="s2">We know exactly what’s possible.</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.680" end="00:45:46.560" style="s2">Hundreds of millions of unnecessary deaths,<br />that’s what’s possible.</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.560" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">We’re lucky we didn’t blow the whole damn<br />thing up, and we still could.</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.160" end="00:45:56.490" style="s2">People pursing their dead ideologies – you<br />don’t rescue the dead Father, than you’re</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.490" end="00:45:58.840" style="s2">the puppet of death, that’s what you are.</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.840" end="00:46:02.910" style="s2">Okay, on that cheery note.</p>
