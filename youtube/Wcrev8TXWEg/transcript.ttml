<p begin="00:01:55.250" end="00:02:01.640" style="s2">now I&#39;ve realized that basically what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.710" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">need to do is to understand that this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.640" end="00:02:07.009" style="s2">a marathon and not a sprint I can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.100" end="00:02:45.920" style="s2">to get in the word out and what I call</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.470" end="00:02:49.359" style="s2">big-picture activism because you know we</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.920" end="00:02:53.230" style="s2">all need to live in that way but I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.359" end="00:02:56.090" style="s2">see there&#39;s still this huge need for</p>

<p begin="00:03:02.000" end="00:03:06.010" style="s2">there&#39;s all this discussion about people</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.640" end="00:03:08.349" style="s2">having this fear about</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.010" end="00:03:11.379" style="s2">didn&#39;t go of the civilization and what a</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.349" end="00:03:14.530" style="s2">tragedy that&#39;s breaking down well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.379" end="00:03:16.720" style="s2">you and I know from our myosin from my</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.530" end="00:03:18.209" style="s2">work with ecovillages there lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:21.310" style="s2">people who live in those ecological</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.209" end="00:03:24.129" style="s2">communities have a lot better lives than</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.310" end="00:03:26.349" style="s2">the people in the big city were running</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.129" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">after the dream of being you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.349" end="00:03:34.120" style="s2">powerful wealthy important famous yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:36.489" style="s2">no I mean but but for me it I got to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.120" end="00:03:38.290" style="s2">point where it is a balance and I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.489" end="00:03:42.459" style="s2">basically to balanced on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.290" end="00:03:46.720" style="s2">advocacy side and not enough living my</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.459" end="00:03:49.870" style="s2">practice also having a little daughter</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.720" end="00:03:53.290" style="s2">means I naturally in the next now she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.870" end="00:03:54.940" style="s2">turning 3 in the next three years I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.290" end="00:03:56.829" style="s2">to find the community in which I feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.940" end="00:03:58.540" style="s2">comfortable that she gets that the sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.829" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">of it takes a village to raise a child</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.540" end="00:04:07.420" style="s2">and and so I mean it&#39;s always going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:08.950" style="s2">be a bit of a dance for me and to find</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.420" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">the right balance because of course that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.950" end="00:04:14.730" style="s2">my income comes from more of the global</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:17.590" style="s2">work rather than the local work but but</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.730" end="00:04:18.940" style="s2">being locked and you can&#39;t imagine what</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.590" end="00:04:22.389" style="s2">it was like here in Spain we were</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.940" end="00:04:25.750" style="s2">literally locked into our apartments</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.389" end="00:04:28.090" style="s2">with no ability to exercise or even go</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.750" end="00:04:28.840" style="s2">for a brisk short walk in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.090" end="00:04:31.060" style="s2">some fresh air</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.840" end="00:04:34.570" style="s2">and we were lucky enough to have a roof</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.060" end="00:04:37.000" style="s2">terrace 2 on 15 square meters run around</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.570" end="00:04:40.210" style="s2">him a little bit but that all these</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.000" end="00:04:42.130" style="s2">large families locked into 4050 square</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.210" end="00:04:46.360" style="s2">meter apartments with five people and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.130" end="00:04:48.250" style="s2">with with no balcony and I mean I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.360" end="00:04:49.960" style="s2">only imagine that the scenes and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.250" end="00:04:53.669" style="s2">horror that that some people lived in</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.960" end="00:04:57.039" style="s2">Spain yeah and I think it led to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.669" end="00:04:59.789" style="s2">developing this appetite for nature for</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.039" end="00:05:02.889" style="s2">community for connection and in all this</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.789" end="00:05:05.830" style="s2">you know appetite to to start doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.889" end="00:05:07.570" style="s2">things more creatively you know like</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.830" end="00:05:11.770" style="s2">baking and sort of buying things</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.570" end="00:05:17.139" style="s2">ready-made and so I that happen in Spain</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.770" end="00:05:19.330" style="s2">as well didn&#39;t it like also I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.139" end="00:05:21.340" style="s2">there&#39;s some already some wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.330" end="00:05:25.560" style="s2">developments in terms of localization</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.340" end="00:05:28.210" style="s2">Jayceon on my okay what happened is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.560" end="00:05:31.090" style="s2">all the local farmers suddenly get the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.210" end="00:05:33.639" style="s2">attention that deserve and even though</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.090" end="00:05:35.770" style="s2">the more conventional local farmers like</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.639" end="00:05:37.750" style="s2">not necessarily the organic farming or</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.770" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">regenerative farming community everybody</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.750" end="00:05:43.150" style="s2">was suddenly rapidly trying to build up</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:45.520" style="s2">direct marketing to the customer and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.150" end="00:05:47.889" style="s2">everybody or Mayaka seems to be getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:51.789" style="s2">rich boxes now from from local farmers</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.889" end="00:05:55.210" style="s2">it&#39;s wonderful so you know for us that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.789" end="00:05:57.969" style="s2">such an important foundation stone for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.210" end="00:06:00.909" style="s2">healthier economy so it&#39;s a it is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.969" end="00:06:02.979" style="s2">really really positive effective the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.909" end="00:06:06.310" style="s2">whole family are naked and I can see</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.979" end="00:06:08.169" style="s2">some signs like for example just last</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.310" end="00:06:10.509" style="s2">week the government the local government</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.169" end="00:06:14.740" style="s2">announced that there were investing in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.509" end="00:06:17.529" style="s2">50 new solar parks on dry land and land</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.740" end="00:06:19.629" style="s2">that isn&#39;t farmed there before they were</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.529" end="00:06:22.210" style="s2">very hesitant to give out permits to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.629" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">build up this solar energy of renewable</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.210" end="00:06:26.789" style="s2">energy capacity of the island and now it</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:29.669" style="s2">seems something has startled them into</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.789" end="00:06:32.430" style="s2">understanding that we we really need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.669" end="00:06:35.349" style="s2">provide the basics for the regional</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.430" end="00:06:37.120" style="s2">population as much regionally as</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.349" end="00:06:41.169" style="s2">possible and that includes energy and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.120" end="00:06:43.270" style="s2">food and and water sovereignty I must</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.169" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">say I&#39;m a bit worried about you thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.270" end="00:06:49.810" style="s2">you know putting the panels on the land</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.520" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">rather than on rooftops so you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.810" end="00:06:53.889" style="s2">because I would love to see that land</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:56.440" style="s2">you know again in terms of climate</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.889" end="00:06:59.349" style="s2">everything you know restoring carbon</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.440" end="00:07:01.419" style="s2">means you know either diversified</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.349" end="00:07:03.969" style="s2">healthy food production including</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.419" end="00:07:07.150" style="s2">animals which can actually help you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.969" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">to be a carbon sink or forestry but to</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.150" end="00:07:11.860" style="s2">have the land fertile and to just put is</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:13.449" style="s2">that what they&#39;re doing there right no I</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.860" end="00:07:16.330" style="s2">completely agree with you it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.449" end="00:07:20.050" style="s2">I my experience of working with</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.330" end="00:07:22.330" style="s2">political processes it&#39;s already a move</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.050" end="00:07:24.279" style="s2">forward for them to say we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.330" end="00:07:26.589" style="s2">give permission to 50 new solar funds</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.279" end="00:07:28.930" style="s2">then you can have the conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.589" end="00:07:31.149" style="s2">what the appropriate place would be in</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.930" end="00:07:32.500" style="s2">and you&#39;ll definitely get a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.149" end="00:07:34.420" style="s2">issue of</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.500" end="00:07:37.510" style="s2">we should really be planting forests</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.420" end="00:07:41.650" style="s2">here not putting solar panels up here</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.510" end="00:07:43.900" style="s2">but yeah I think it&#39;s it&#39;s always for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.650" end="00:07:46.570" style="s2">one of the things where we where we fall</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.900" end="00:07:48.940" style="s2">short sometimes is that we very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.570" end="00:07:52.150" style="s2">jump at pointing out the the shortfall</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.940" end="00:07:53.530" style="s2">of something rather than say yes great</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.150" end="00:07:56.050" style="s2">and we need to really have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.530" end="00:07:58.090" style="s2">conversation on where&#39;s the best place</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.050" end="00:08:00.520" style="s2">to put the solar panels yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.090" end="00:08:03.550" style="s2">that can happen but I also see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.520" end="00:08:06.130" style="s2">people who simply don&#39;t think about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.550" end="00:08:08.260" style="s2">holistic picture and therefore will</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.130" end="00:08:10.990" style="s2">think you know solar anywhere everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.260" end="00:08:12.430" style="s2">you know you need and you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.990" end="00:08:14.370" style="s2">you know the whole discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.430" end="00:08:17.530" style="s2">fueling the global economy with</p>

<p begin="00:08:22.900" end="00:08:28.360" style="s2">how you see you know now the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.320" end="00:08:30.750" style="s2">and the fork in the road what do you see</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.360" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2">as their options as we come out of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.750" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">well I find all the work did I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:41.020" style="s2">spent another 25 years longer than me</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">and I&#39;ve already spent 20 years on this</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.020" end="00:08:51.400" style="s2">path of of reminding people that as</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:54.550" style="s2">we&#39;re becoming a global species moving</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.400" end="00:08:56.980" style="s2">into the planetary era and there has</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.550" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">been this globalization of awareness in</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.980" end="00:09:02.950" style="s2">terms of we are one species living on</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:05.710" style="s2">this planet we need to rebalance all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.950" end="00:09:07.330" style="s2">that by by paying much more attention to</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.710" end="00:09:10.060" style="s2">what we haven&#39;t paid attention to in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.330" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">last 250 years which is the local and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.060" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">the regional and the pandemic has shown</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:19.870" style="s2">and will I think continue to show in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:22.510" style="s2">next years to come how fragile global</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.870" end="00:09:25.900" style="s2">supply lines are how destructive they</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.510" end="00:09:30.460" style="s2">really are and M also having had that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.900" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">really close to home personal experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.460" end="00:09:36.180" style="s2">almost everybody on the planet now with</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:38.020" style="s2">this sudden change being possible and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.180" end="00:09:39.670" style="s2">the whole conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.020" end="00:09:41.860" style="s2">transformative change has a whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.670" end="00:09:44.140" style="s2">different basis now because previously</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.860" end="00:09:46.360" style="s2">people like uni and vision</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.140" end="00:09:48.480" style="s2">is saying we can redesign the system in</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.360" end="00:09:51.190" style="s2">a much healthier way that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.480" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">reintegrate into the community of life</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.190" end="00:09:56.740" style="s2">and become a nurturing keystone species</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:09:58.360" style="s2">in the local ecosystems we inhabit and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.740" end="00:10:00.579" style="s2">make the places more abundant and more</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.360" end="00:10:03.250" style="s2">vibrant and more resilient all of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.579" end="00:10:05.130" style="s2">sounded like our that&#39;s very nice but</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.250" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">it&#39;s in impractical and we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.130" end="00:10:10.180" style="s2">fundamentally change things quickly no</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:12.040" style="s2">you can always say to people well did</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.180" end="00:10:15.010" style="s2">you see how fundamentally quickly we</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.040" end="00:10:19.240" style="s2">changed things in response to this this</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.010" end="00:10:22.420" style="s2">viral pandemic and so I think that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.240" end="00:10:25.740" style="s2">of people have been touched in one way</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.420" end="00:10:29.170" style="s2">or another by something that previously</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.740" end="00:10:31.899" style="s2">seemed to obstruct ins to theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.170" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">for them and and so building on that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.899" end="00:10:39.670" style="s2">experience it makes sense even to local</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:43.570" style="s2">government officials that a post covert</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.670" end="00:10:45.670" style="s2">19 recovery plan has to build community</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.570" end="00:10:47.740" style="s2">resilience has to build ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.670" end="00:10:50.019" style="s2">health and I&#39;m delighted to see how much</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.740" end="00:10:52.149" style="s2">the conversation has moved on to let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.019" end="00:10:53.829" style="s2">move on to a new normal rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.149" end="00:10:55.480" style="s2">old normal because the old normal was</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.829" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">murderous and killed more people than</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.480" end="00:11:02.459" style="s2">the virus has killed so far and and also</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:08.130" style="s2">the the way that people are</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.459" end="00:11:10.510" style="s2">understanding that to reinvest in</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.130" end="00:11:13.350" style="s2">technologies that were actually driving</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.510" end="00:11:17.560" style="s2">us full speed over the climate cliff and</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.350" end="00:11:19.779" style="s2">that the suffering that that would would</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.560" end="00:11:22.810" style="s2">cause a will cause is it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.779" end="00:11:25.390" style="s2">exorbitant larger than the the endemic</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.810" end="00:11:26.800" style="s2">suffering although never compared</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.390" end="00:11:29.769" style="s2">suffering I mean that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.800" end="00:11:32.440" style="s2">in German you I&#39;m always very sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.769" end="00:11:33.820" style="s2">to not comparing that many people to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.440" end="00:11:37.720" style="s2">that many people suffering because</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.820" end="00:11:40.690" style="s2">suffering is is is something to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.720" end="00:11:42.850" style="s2">for all of humanity but yeah I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.690" end="00:11:45.190" style="s2">kind of still I honestly couldn&#39;t sorry</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.850" end="00:11:49.269" style="s2">but could you push the screen down a bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.190" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">more so your head is I saw earlier even</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.269" end="00:11:55.029" style="s2">that in and slightly more cuz when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:57.310" style="s2">sit back it&#39;s proven extremely difficult</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.029" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">to do this in most speakers</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.310" end="00:12:01.300" style="s2">I don&#39;t know you know I know but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:03.610" style="s2">very good that&#39;s much better you&#39;re much</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.300" end="00:12:05.320" style="s2">more central but are you gonna stay like</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.610" end="00:12:12.100" style="s2">that or you&#39;re gonna lean back more I</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.320" end="00:12:14.710" style="s2">can stay like that yeah okay yeah one</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.100" end="00:12:19.060" style="s2">thing that I realized increasingly is</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.710" end="00:12:21.580" style="s2">that if we want to one thing that I say</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.060" end="00:12:24.100" style="s2">a lot redesign the human impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.580" end="00:12:26.140" style="s2">planet from being degenerative to being</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.100" end="00:12:29.730" style="s2">regenerative and if we want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.140" end="00:12:31.720" style="s2">in accordance with the patterns of life</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.730" end="00:12:34.690" style="s2">and I had this wonderful conversation</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.720" end="00:12:37.420" style="s2">with Fritjof Capra where we basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.690" end="00:12:39.610" style="s2">pretty of distilled his lifetime&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.420" end="00:12:41.320" style="s2">experience of studying the system&#39;s view</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.610" end="00:12:44.970" style="s2">of life down to saying life is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.320" end="00:12:47.500" style="s2">regenerative community and that life</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.970" end="00:12:53.610" style="s2">creates conditions conducive to life by</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.500" end="00:12:53.610" style="s2">creating communities and if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">redesign the human impact on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.980" end="00:13:03.640" style="s2">we need the political ideal of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:06.400" style="s2">subsidiarity to become the new real</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.640" end="00:13:08.730" style="s2">because you cannot get citizen</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.400" end="00:13:10.870" style="s2">participation you cannot empower re</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.730" end="00:13:12.700" style="s2">regionalization and local resilience</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.870" end="00:13:14.770" style="s2">building and climate response and more</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.700" end="00:13:16.930" style="s2">collaboration and cooperation at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.770" end="00:13:19.240" style="s2">local level if people are disempowered</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.930" end="00:13:21.480" style="s2">by political systems where where</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.240" end="00:13:23.710" style="s2">decisions are made by centralized</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.480" end="00:13:25.330" style="s2">governments and like even the co-ed</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.710" end="00:13:27.790" style="s2">response here in Spain you could see</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.330" end="00:13:30.640" style="s2">that some of the decisions were made by</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.790" end="00:13:32.770" style="s2">panicked politicians in Madrid very much</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.640" end="00:13:34.870" style="s2">with the situation of Madrid in front of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.770" end="00:13:37.089" style="s2">them but more understanding that for</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.870" end="00:13:38.770" style="s2">many many people around the country the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.089" end="00:13:41.530" style="s2">situation of living in a small village</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.770" end="00:13:42.970" style="s2">in maybe two kilometers from the centre</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.530" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">of the village having your little wept</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.970" end="00:13:46.870" style="s2">or your little farm and your little</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:49.690" style="s2">garden which supplied these families for</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.870" end="00:13:51.130" style="s2">vital food the the restrictions were</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.690" end="00:13:52.839" style="s2">such that people weren&#39;t allowed to go</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.130" end="00:13:54.760" style="s2">to those Gardens and that at the point</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.839" end="00:13:56.680" style="s2">where food sovereignty and local food</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.760" end="00:13:58.110" style="s2">was the most important food was rotting</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.680" end="00:14:00.339" style="s2">in the fields because of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.110" end="00:14:04.290" style="s2">regulations and that kind of thing would</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.339" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">never happen in a subsidiarity based</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.290" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">governance system and so so the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:13.830" style="s2">whole enabling step to really</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:16.980" style="s2">power real localization means that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.830" end="00:14:20.610" style="s2">have to become much more political in</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.980" end="00:14:22.170" style="s2">asking for subsidiarity to not just be</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.610" end="00:14:25.560" style="s2">written into the european constitution</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.170" end="00:14:29.339" style="s2">but actually be the fundamental of how</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.560" end="00:14:31.500" style="s2">we rearrange things now and and i I see</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.339" end="00:14:33.060" style="s2">a lot of positive change like I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.500" end="00:14:37.769" style="s2">contacted by people who work with</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.060" end="00:14:41.579" style="s2">Doncaster City Council and they want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.769" end="00:14:43.790" style="s2">look at there&#39;s this whole notion of</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.579" end="00:14:46.529" style="s2">regenerative cultures and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.790" end="00:14:48.690" style="s2">regionalization and and using that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.529" end="00:14:51.149" style="s2">frameworks that we&#39;ve developed in an h3</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.690" end="00:14:53.910" style="s2">uni to take their their team through a</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.149" end="00:14:57.470" style="s2">process of of really looking at what can</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.910" end="00:15:01.290" style="s2">we do to revitalize the regional economy</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.470" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">to build food water energy sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.290" end="00:15:06.839" style="s2">and to basically make ourselves less</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:08.700" style="s2">dependent on large supply lines that can</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.839" end="00:15:10.500" style="s2">be disrupted so easily by so many</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.700" end="00:15:13.980" style="s2">different scenarios that that we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.500" end="00:15:15.990" style="s2">imagine for the 21st century I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.980" end="00:15:19.020" style="s2">think it&#39;s really important that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.990" end="00:15:21.510" style="s2">really understand that decentralizing</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.020" end="00:15:24.180" style="s2">political power is simply not possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.510" end="00:15:29.520" style="s2">unless we also decentralized economic</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.180" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">activity so you had you know certain you</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.520" end="00:15:33.300" style="s2">know throwing off to the local</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:35.760" style="s2">government oh yeah you can do this you</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.300" end="00:15:38.220" style="s2">can do that but no funding to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.760" end="00:15:40.350" style="s2">it&#39;s ended up being you can look after</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.220" end="00:15:42.410" style="s2">the elderly even look after the sick you</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.480" end="00:16:26.910" style="s2">another really important part of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.370" end="00:16:28.830" style="s2">rushon is this economic reality of who</p>

<p begin="00:16:58.790" end="00:17:06.329" style="s2">zero-sum game type system set up we</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.829" end="00:17:08.910" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.329" end="00:17:10.439" style="s2">regenerative I mean I find like even in</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.910" end="00:17:12.839" style="s2">the in the corporate world even with</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.439" end="00:17:19.790" style="s2">larger international companies that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.839" end="00:17:22.949" style="s2">trying to be regenerative these days M</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.790" end="00:17:26.069" style="s2">the most intelligent leaders in those</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.949" end="00:17:28.230" style="s2">companies understand that there is a too</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.069" end="00:17:31.890" style="s2">large not to fail too large not to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.230" end="00:17:34.500" style="s2">degenerative and and the guy I often</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.890" end="00:17:37.350" style="s2">remind people of like last year Yvonne</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.500" end="00:17:38.550" style="s2">who not from Patagonia wrote this piece</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.350" end="00:17:41.250" style="s2">where he was basically saying they</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.550" end="00:17:43.260" style="s2">brought me the news that our company is</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.250" end="00:17:47.309" style="s2">a billion-dollar turn-over company I</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.260" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">dread at that moment and there&#39;s I I</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.309" end="00:17:51.090" style="s2">cannot see how I could lead a company</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.440" end="00:17:55.710" style="s2">that has a meaningful impact in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.090" end="00:17:58.230" style="s2">world at that scale yeah I I know Yvonne</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.710" end="00:18:00.179" style="s2">quite well and I think you know we need</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.230" end="00:18:01.800" style="s2">to point out that this is a privately</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.179" end="00:18:04.170" style="s2">owned company and that&#39;s the great</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.800" end="00:18:06.600" style="s2">paradox that the publicly traded</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.170" end="00:18:09.390" style="s2">corporation is a much more dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.600" end="00:18:11.730" style="s2">animal because it becomes this blind</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.390" end="00:18:15.740" style="s2">machine with this expectations of profit</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.730" end="00:18:18.510" style="s2">again that are blind and systemic and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.740" end="00:18:20.790" style="s2">paradoxically you know Chris generally</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.510" end="00:18:23.820" style="s2">speaking you know we&#39;re assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.790" end="00:18:26.309" style="s2">trial it is worse than publicly owned or</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.820" end="00:18:27.840" style="s2">publicly traded but this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.309" end="00:18:29.880" style="s2">important distinction to and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.840" end="00:18:33.240" style="s2">understanding why things have gone so</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.880" end="00:18:34.510" style="s2">wrong and there are some leading lights</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.240" end="00:18:38.560" style="s2">you know in</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.510" end="00:18:39.940" style="s2">private like working with Russia a</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.560" end="00:18:42.910" style="s2">little bit in in the last few years</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.940" end="00:18:47.530" style="s2">mainly on their giving site and their</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.910" end="00:18:50.260" style="s2">kind of animating new regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.530" end="00:18:53.470" style="s2">production in local areas to basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.260" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">build a responsible supply chain they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.470" end="00:18:57.580" style="s2">doing they&#39;re doing really wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.600" end="00:18:59.230" style="s2">work but they can again also only really</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.580" end="00:19:03.220" style="s2">do it because they&#39;re largely</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.230" end="00:19:05.530" style="s2">family-owned and now also partially</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.220" end="00:19:08.340" style="s2">employee or owned and because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.530" end="00:19:11.500" style="s2">done a transfer to their employees and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.340" end="00:19:13.210" style="s2">those are the really leading companies</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.500" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">tend to be in that structure and not to</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.210" end="00:19:18.550" style="s2">be too beholden to shareholders that</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:23.560" style="s2">that are just then ultimately taking</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.550" end="00:19:25.960" style="s2">over do you also see how even when you</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.560" end="00:19:28.780" style="s2">have this enlightened companies and even</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.960" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">when you have attempts by citizens to</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.780" end="00:19:33.280" style="s2">come together to to create more</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:35.770" style="s2">localized economic structures they were</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.280" end="00:19:38.200" style="s2">all up against this craziness where</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.770" end="00:19:42.040" style="s2">human labor and human intelligence human</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.200" end="00:19:44.580" style="s2">care is too expensive because endemic to</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.040" end="00:19:47.830" style="s2">the economy has been subsidizing</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.580" end="00:19:50.200" style="s2">regulating and supporting every</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.830" end="00:19:52.330" style="s2">individual institution even government</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.200" end="00:19:55.510" style="s2">institution across the board we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.330" end="00:19:57.850" style="s2">being pushed to always choose technology</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.510" end="00:20:01.290" style="s2">over employing people what would you say</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.850" end="00:20:05.830" style="s2">about that Daniel yet for me that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.290" end="00:20:12.070" style="s2">increasingly and I&#39;m sort of noticing</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.830" end="00:20:14.560" style="s2">how I&#39;ve personally never been that</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.070" end="00:20:16.440" style="s2">comfortable with just jumping on new</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.560" end="00:20:20.350" style="s2">technologies just because they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.440" end="00:20:23.290" style="s2">and I&#39;ve actively even in my life so for</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.350" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">example I don&#39;t use Watsa because I just</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.290" end="00:20:28.570" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have that technology in my</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">life and how it then shapes my life I</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.570" end="00:20:34.540" style="s2">keep thinking of buckminster fuller&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:36.850" style="s2">statement that if you want to change the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.540" end="00:20:38.500" style="s2">way people think give them a tool the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.850" end="00:20:40.360" style="s2">use of which will change how they think</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.500" end="00:20:42.760" style="s2">rather than telling them what to think</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.360" end="00:20:47.320" style="s2">and to some extent I&#39;m realizing how</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.760" end="00:20:50.050" style="s2">much our our minds have been</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.320" end="00:20:52.270" style="s2">I learned this you would recently ban</p>

<p begin="00:20:52.270" end="00:21:01.180" style="s2">have been Columbus they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.450" end="00:21:03.580" style="s2">colonized by the technologies we use and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.180" end="00:21:06.820" style="s2">even the benefits like we&#39;re talking on</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.580" end="00:21:10.660" style="s2">Zoom now but and increasingly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.820" end="00:21:14.820" style="s2">this that so many well-meaning people</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.660" end="00:21:20.940" style="s2">out there trying to use technology</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.820" end="00:21:20.940" style="s2">blockchain holo chain you name it to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.540" end="00:21:26.140" style="s2">take more money out of the degenerative</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.340" end="00:21:28.390" style="s2">economy and fun let&#39;s towards</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.140" end="00:21:30.720" style="s2">regenerative practices but in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.390" end="00:21:36.130" style="s2">process we are also setting up</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.720" end="00:21:37.990" style="s2">mechanisms that would ultimately only</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.130" end="00:21:39.910" style="s2">the local farmers who are willing to use</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.990" end="00:21:41.740" style="s2">a smartphone and senses and all that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.910" end="00:21:44.740" style="s2">kind of stuff will be able to access it</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.740" end="00:21:46.690" style="s2">and for me that that is a real warning</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.740" end="00:21:50.520" style="s2">light because if we really want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.690" end="00:21:54.010" style="s2">celebrate diversity I think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.520" end="00:21:56.830" style="s2">explore how we can create enabling</p>

<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:31.870" style="s2">valuable human diversity that that if we</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.160" end="00:22:33.880" style="s2">if we only allow people to be part of</p>

<p begin="00:22:33.880" end="00:22:39.550" style="s2">technology then then we&#39;re actually</p>

<p begin="00:22:39.550" end="00:22:46.540" style="s2">and that I&#39;m increasingly concerned</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.190" end="00:22:48.820" style="s2">about it&#39;s very interesting that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.540" end="00:22:52.000" style="s2">even mention the farm is owned by Orca</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.820" end="00:22:55.420" style="s2">because this is our experience that even</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.289" end="00:23:20.809" style="s2">we look at the vital importance of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.750" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">smaller scale diversified farming to</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.610" end="00:23:40.250" style="s2">ever can and that we need MBR I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.899" end="00:23:42.080" style="s2">you should say well ok good say that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.250" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">go ahead and say that because I&#39;m happy</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.080" end="00:23:47.210" style="s2">to do it you say that but yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:49.669" style="s2">mean if you really look at the figures</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.210" end="00:23:52.340" style="s2">and there&#39;s still more food being</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.669" end="00:23:54.639" style="s2">produced by peasant farmers who are</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.340" end="00:23:58.549" style="s2">predominantly women all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.639" end="00:24:00.380" style="s2">rather than by large green agribusiness</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.549" end="00:24:03.559" style="s2">or long green agribusiness this whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.380" end="00:24:07.039" style="s2">lyre of the Green Revolution has fed</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.559" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">millions of people and it transferred</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.039" end="00:24:12.830" style="s2">fossil fuel into food that killed people</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:15.250" style="s2">rather than then fed them in the long</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.830" end="00:24:19.789" style="s2">term and changed dietary habits and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.250" end="00:24:21.380" style="s2">rolled it biodiversity so and ok very</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.789" end="00:24:25.130" style="s2">importantly we need to say it also</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.380" end="00:24:28.519" style="s2">killed the soil and even in the early</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.130" end="00:24:31.519" style="s2">stages it was never producing more per</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.519" end="00:24:33.799" style="s2">acre of land or unit of water what the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.519" end="00:24:36.679" style="s2">great efficiency was was that it could</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.799" end="00:24:39.740" style="s2">produce more food and fewer people so at</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.679" end="00:24:41.630" style="s2">the same time that it killed the health</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.740" end="00:24:44.539" style="s2">of the soil and affected our health</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.630" end="00:24:47.559" style="s2">negatively and destroyed productivity it</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.539" end="00:24:51.260" style="s2">destroyed jobs and now you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.559" end="00:24:55.519" style="s2">communities and oak yeah and you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.260" end="00:24:59.630" style="s2">also you know ice you&#39;ve seen too as you</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.519" end="00:25:02.389" style="s2">destroy those jobs and you try to move</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.630" end="00:25:05.419" style="s2">try to arguing the dominant sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.389" end="00:25:07.220" style="s2">narrative that this is a tragedy then</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.419" end="00:25:10.159" style="s2">the argument is also people don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.220" end="00:25:12.649" style="s2">the farm but you&#39;re as familiar as I am</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.159" end="00:25:14.510" style="s2">with this micro-trend of young people</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.649" end="00:25:17.299" style="s2">who do want to farm</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.510" end="00:25:19.820" style="s2">in permaculture and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.299" end="00:25:25.000" style="s2">it in Germany as much as in seen it on</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.820" end="00:25:28.610" style="s2">my okay I mean I think we are still for</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.000" end="00:25:30.169" style="s2">the movement of people wanting to find</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.610" end="00:25:31.730" style="s2">more balance in their life and more</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.169" end="00:25:36.260" style="s2">meaning and more connection and more</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.730" end="00:25:38.419" style="s2">community and but also having grown used</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.260" end="00:25:41.000" style="s2">to these communications technology and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.419" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">having developed other skills and so on</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.000" end="00:25:46.610" style="s2">that that they would also like to play</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:49.820" style="s2">they like the creating new models by</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.610" end="00:25:52.040" style="s2">which people can spend some of that time</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.820" end="00:25:54.669" style="s2">funding and some of that time working in</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.040" end="00:25:57.140" style="s2">other creative industries and in</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.669" end="00:25:58.850" style="s2">enabling this balance I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.140" end="00:26:02.720" style="s2">still on the journey of that like he&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.850" end="00:26:04.669" style="s2">personally this has been my my in terms</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.720" end="00:26:07.190" style="s2">of lifestyle design for myself I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.669" end="00:26:08.690" style="s2">always said like I remember when we</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.190" end="00:26:11.059" style="s2">moved to the Abu Huraira in southern</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.690" end="00:26:13.190" style="s2">Spain in 1999 Alice and I trying to set</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.059" end="00:26:16.160" style="s2">up an eco village and environmental</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.190" end="00:26:20.059" style="s2">education center I said I dream of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.160" end="00:26:21.830" style="s2">time where I can spend five six hours on</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.059" end="00:26:24.770" style="s2">the fields and working with people on</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.830" end="00:26:27.230" style="s2">the land and then come home have a meal</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.770" end="00:26:29.919" style="s2">and then spend four or five hours doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.230" end="00:26:33.020" style="s2">my writing and reading and and and my</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.919" end="00:26:35.380" style="s2">thought work so to speak and finding</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.020" end="00:26:39.410" style="s2">that regular balance in everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.380" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">but I even in in Finland living like I</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.410" end="00:26:43.610" style="s2">thought that moving to Finland I could</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:46.549" style="s2">somehow design my my life in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.610" end="00:26:48.080" style="s2">balance but what I noticed is that even</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.549" end="00:26:49.910" style="s2">if you know what what happened</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.080" end="00:26:51.470" style="s2">unfortunately is that then you get the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.910" end="00:26:52.940" style="s2">people who work in Cologne gardens or in</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.470" end="00:26:56.270" style="s2">the farm and then you get the people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.940" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">work in the offices and and and we we</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.270" end="00:27:02.090" style="s2">seem to separate yet again into either</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:04.580" style="s2">you do that or that rather than really</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.090" end="00:27:07.880" style="s2">enable structures that that allow both</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.580" end="00:27:10.070" style="s2">and you know this is exactly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.880" end="00:27:13.190" style="s2">been the dream of all of us in local</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.070" end="00:27:15.500" style="s2">futures and we we ever since living in</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.190" end="00:27:18.799" style="s2">Ladakh this was exactly a dream it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.500" end="00:27:22.100" style="s2">as you said precisely about half the day</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.799" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">on the land in community and using our</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.100" end="00:27:28.370" style="s2">bodies and moving and not you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:30.710" style="s2">sitting in a chair and we have ended up</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.370" end="00:27:34.670" style="s2">spending far too much more time in front</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.710" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">of a computer and for me</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.670" end="00:27:42.350" style="s2">when I when I look at it I basically see</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:45.860" style="s2">that it takes an entire village not just</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.350" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">to raise a child but to raise a crop to</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.860" end="00:27:53.240" style="s2">raise a barn and I see it as a function</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:54.830" style="s2">are not enough vision not enough big</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.240" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">picture vision to realize that we need</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.830" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">to build up the numbers because once we</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:05.090" style="s2">have a bigger and I&#39;m talking about what</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:08.210" style="s2">what the minimum would be I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.090" end="00:28:10.760" style="s2">but in order to build up the momentum so</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.210" end="00:28:13.940" style="s2">there between us we could actually have</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.760" end="00:28:17.360" style="s2">a new economy that would really so value</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.940" end="00:28:19.670" style="s2">this lifestyle and the ability to do the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.360" end="00:28:23.210" style="s2">words with our hands to use our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.670" end="00:28:26.360" style="s2">and their word so value the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.210" end="00:28:29.900" style="s2">be productive engaged with the</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.080" end="00:28:42.740" style="s2">up that potential for a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.190" end="00:28:45.830" style="s2">to demonstrate that we would need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.740" end="00:28:48.380" style="s2">work far less than we believed we would</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.830" end="00:28:50.000" style="s2">need to United Synod in indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.380" end="00:28:52.880" style="s2">culture but I have yet to see it</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:56.300" style="s2">properly in the new experimentation and</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.880" end="00:28:58.910" style="s2">for me then in the new experiments like</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.300" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">eco villages and other communities there</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.910" end="00:29:05.000" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been I think enough attention to</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.480" end="00:29:10.070" style="s2">numbers that we actually need more</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.000" end="00:29:12.950" style="s2">people not all in in one institution by</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.070" end="00:29:16.760" style="s2">any means but with enough of a support</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.950" end="00:29:20.179" style="s2">network and trade and connection to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.760" end="00:29:23.059" style="s2">able to step out of what has been fossil</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.179" end="00:29:25.340" style="s2">fuel-based for hundreds of years and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.059" end="00:29:28.160" style="s2">from you know from the very beginning</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.340" end="00:29:30.650" style="s2">slavery and so on was a process of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.160" end="00:29:34.250" style="s2">extracting wealth for the few you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.650" end="00:29:36.590" style="s2">and destroying the ability for people to</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.250" end="00:29:39.640" style="s2">live off natural resources and provide</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.590" end="00:29:42.490" style="s2">for themselves and to do it in a humane</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.640" end="00:29:45.390" style="s2">deeply ecological way so to risk to</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.490" end="00:29:47.920" style="s2">regenerate that to restore that I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.390" end="00:29:51.100" style="s2">again why I saw emphasize big-picture</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.920" end="00:29:53.530" style="s2">activism is to build up the numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.100" end="00:29:56.559" style="s2">to try to encourage also that there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.530" end="00:29:59.410" style="s2">certain what we call localization hubs</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.559" end="00:30:01.900" style="s2">which are already emerging all around</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.410" end="00:30:03.850" style="s2">the world and in fact I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.900" end="00:30:06.670" style="s2">thousands and you know one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.850" end="00:30:09.940" style="s2">exciting is some Nissan in South Korea</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.670" end="00:30:12.340" style="s2">in Seoul where there are 20,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.940" end="00:30:14.049" style="s2">that have been collaborating to build up</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.340" end="00:30:16.780" style="s2">an alternative and we including an</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.049" end="00:30:18.790" style="s2">alternative school and now some of them</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.780" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">are moving out and they have you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.790" end="00:30:24.580" style="s2">farm school they also have many small</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:27.970" style="s2">businesses in this part of Seoul so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.580" end="00:30:30.100" style="s2">think that&#39;s a key it&#39;s not thinking we</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.970" end="00:30:32.559" style="s2">can go out you know a handful of us on</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.100" end="00:30:34.900" style="s2">the land and suddenly create this</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.559" end="00:30:36.850" style="s2">different lifestyle which is also white</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.900" end="00:30:39.640" style="s2">very exciting when things start</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.850" end="00:30:42.910" style="s2">happening at the level of a region or a</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.640" end="00:30:44.799" style="s2">town where we see now in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.910" end="00:30:47.500" style="s2">localization movement we see awareness</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.799" end="00:30:50.919" style="s2">trickling upwards as you were saying my</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.500" end="00:30:52.900" style="s2">orc supporting solar energy and in many</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.919" end="00:30:55.929" style="s2">areas the support for local food</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.900" end="00:30:58.299" style="s2">economies so once we can start working</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.929" end="00:31:01.510" style="s2">also with local government but it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.299" end="00:31:04.630" style="s2">to be everything I&#39;m saying if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.510" end="00:31:07.630" style="s2">got to be through civic society pressure</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.630" end="00:31:09.370" style="s2">to change government government and as</p>

<p begin="00:35:31.069" end="00:35:34.940" style="s2">start around the world it&#39;s been that</p>

<p begin="00:35:37.250" end="00:35:43.220" style="s2">the producers and the consumers so once</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.490" end="00:35:45.310" style="s2">you start getting the awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.220" end="00:35:48.319" style="s2">need to build something that is more</p>

<p begin="00:35:48.319" end="00:35:53.290" style="s2">that scale and you&#39;re actually creating</p>

<p begin="00:36:20.150" end="00:36:24.680" style="s2">start getting</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.260" end="00:36:27.700" style="s2">a structural move in the direction of</p>

<p begin="00:36:27.700" end="00:36:34.370" style="s2">accountable and healthy so I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.770" end="00:36:36.530" style="s2">think sometimes by talking about turning</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.370" end="00:36:40.460" style="s2">business away from profit and just</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.530" end="00:36:42.860" style="s2">towards a non profit I think I would I</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.460" end="00:36:45.890" style="s2">worry that we&#39;re trying to invent things</p>

<p begin="00:39:38.030" end="00:39:43.280" style="s2">so much as we doing it I am seeing</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.990" end="00:39:45.290" style="s2">people that were pushed off the land</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.280" end="00:39:47.510" style="s2">because I&#39;m seeing it right now in China</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.290" end="00:39:50.030" style="s2">and India and of course in Ladakh and</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.510" end="00:39:53.210" style="s2">Bhutan and when I say pushed I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.030" end="00:39:55.640" style="s2">through psychological warfare that makes</p>

<p begin="00:40:25.790" end="00:40:32.930" style="s2">to this extractive mechanistic view and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.690" end="00:40:35.000" style="s2">this extractive system enabled it to</p>

<p begin="00:40:49.480" end="00:40:57.050" style="s2">anonymous that we then become you know</p>

<p begin="00:41:50.570" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">between that that are kind of not maybe</p>

<p begin="00:42:01.280" end="00:42:06.560" style="s2">useful of this this little map is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.980" end="00:42:08.690" style="s2">the old system doesn&#39;t completely die</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:10.160" style="s2">away that the red line still goes on</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.690" end="00:42:13.550" style="s2">into the future but in a much smaller</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.160" end="00:42:17.510" style="s2">way and it speaks of what is the baby in</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.580" end="00:42:27.560" style="s2">want to keep certain things like for</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:29.690" style="s2">example and how in this hyper localized</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.560" end="00:42:33.290" style="s2">world like I know that the experiments</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.690" end="00:42:36.500" style="s2">with with open source ecology and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.290" end="00:42:40.250" style="s2">and local maker labs and so how will we</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.500" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">create maybe not for everybody but</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.250" end="00:42:45.290" style="s2">publicly accessible this kind of</p>

<p begin="00:42:53.290" end="00:43:00.619" style="s2">beautifully and how do you see that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.170" end="00:43:01.610" style="s2">balance of still maintaining some things</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.619" end="00:43:05.330" style="s2">like</p>

<p begin="00:44:38.900" end="00:44:46.010" style="s2">need certain tools possibly the drones</p>

<p begin="00:44:55.220" end="00:45:02.630" style="s2">and really start doing the numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.940" end="00:45:04.840" style="s2">see how much of those technologies how</p>

<p begin="00:45:28.620" end="00:45:33.450" style="s2">back and look at what are the tools that</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.960" end="00:45:36.840" style="s2">really do service and we have to look</p>

<p begin="00:46:02.250" end="00:46:08.370" style="s2">that most people would prefer where</p>

<p begin="00:50:17.689" end="00:50:23.399" style="s2">what I&#39;m seeing is that there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:50:23.399" end="00:50:30.089" style="s2">these more localized communities and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.279" end="00:50:31.979" style="s2">economies very interestingly a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:50:36.809" end="00:50:42.929" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m sort of my conclusion is that by</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.589" end="00:50:44.819" style="s2">living in different cultures people are</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.929" end="00:50:47.839" style="s2">started becoming more aware of a</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.839" end="00:50:55.469" style="s2">towards the consumer culture empty life</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.999" end="00:50:57.539" style="s2">and then also those generally the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.469" end="00:51:00.539" style="s2">leaders have also had a bit of a taste</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.539" end="00:51:03.089" style="s2">of something a bit more earth-based a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.539" end="00:51:08.429" style="s2">bit more community-based a bit slower a</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.089" end="00:51:11.579" style="s2">bit also more rich in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:51:11.579" end="00:51:16.709" style="s2">understand that the monoculture you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.119" end="00:51:19.769" style="s2">in terms of age groups and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.709" end="00:51:23.009" style="s2">alienation the speed of the typical</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.769" end="00:51:24.959" style="s2">urban modern sort of peak experience</p>

<p begin="00:51:24.959" end="00:51:28.829" style="s2">empty so it comes out of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.789" end="00:51:31.649" style="s2">consciousness which by the way I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.829" end="00:51:33.539" style="s2">this huge curve back where we bring</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.649" end="00:51:36.869" style="s2">something with us into the future</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.539" end="00:51:39.329" style="s2">a lot of that is the experience of both</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.869" end="00:51:41.819" style="s2">sides of this equation which makes</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.329" end="00:51:44.489" style="s2">people much more committed to doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.819" end="00:51:47.549" style="s2">things differently to want actively to</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.489" end="00:51:51.529" style="s2">get closer to the earth to develop an</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.549" end="00:51:53.579" style="s2">appetite for being closer to animals for</p>

<p begin="00:51:55.360" end="00:52:01.000" style="s2">only spiritual and psychological wealth</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.780" end="00:52:03.370" style="s2">that we recover when we move in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.000" end="00:52:04.960" style="s2">direction but so what I&#39;m seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.370" end="00:52:07.750" style="s2">around the world that there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.960" end="00:52:09.370" style="s2">groups that are taking leadership and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.750" end="00:52:11.680" style="s2">there are certain hubs in the world are</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.370" end="00:52:14.470" style="s2">beginning through a lot of pain and</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.680" end="00:52:17.620" style="s2">discussion you know whether it be in eco</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.470" end="00:52:20.970" style="s2">villages or in what&#39;s sometimes called</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.620" end="00:52:24.520" style="s2">transition towns and and many similar</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.970" end="00:52:27.360" style="s2">what I would call localization hubs you</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.520" end="00:52:29.410" style="s2">see that people are managing despite</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.360" end="00:52:31.810" style="s2">enormous pressures in the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.410" end="00:52:35.010" style="s2">direction to start to come together</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.810" end="00:52:38.890" style="s2">because of that deep commitment I</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.010" end="00:52:44.050" style="s2">believe that what&#39;s needed there still</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.890" end="00:52:46.210" style="s2">is a deeper and broader knowledge to</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.050" end="00:52:48.760" style="s2">have greater clarity about what to say</p>

<p begin="00:52:51.730" end="00:52:58.450" style="s2">fork in the road is do we unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.540" end="00:53:02.020" style="s2">want to support and link into the arms</p>

<p begin="00:54:06.700" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">relationship so</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.270" end="00:54:15.350" style="s2">I see it happening and I just think with</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:19.620" style="s2">more clarity so that we put more</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.350" end="00:54:22.110" style="s2">essentially money and support behind</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.620" end="00:54:24.210" style="s2">that path back home back home to</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.110" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">community and the earth I think then</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.210" end="00:54:29.340" style="s2">we&#39;ll find that actually so many of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:32.640" style="s2">problems that you&#39;ve seen that I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.340" end="00:54:36.870" style="s2">in eco villages so much of it will fall</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.640" end="00:54:43.190" style="s2">away because we&#39;re not aware how much of</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.870" end="00:54:45.260" style="s2">that of that dispute and those you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.190" end="00:54:48.270" style="s2">controversies and arguments actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.260" end="00:54:50.850" style="s2">emanate from trying to swim in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.270" end="00:54:53.460" style="s2">system when literally every law and</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.850" end="00:54:57.540" style="s2">regulation every subsidy every dollar</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.460" end="00:55:01.380" style="s2">that comes into the area is born of and</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.540" end="00:55:03.780" style="s2">from that teenaged boy system that</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.380" end="00:55:06.330" style="s2">mechanistic system - all the time</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.780" end="00:55:09.210" style="s2">fighting against the tide and you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.330" end="00:55:11.280" style="s2">know the speed of it all and you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.210" end="00:55:13.410" style="s2">this is another thing that was so</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.280" end="00:55:17.010" style="s2">fascinating to me living in an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.410" end="00:55:20.430" style="s2">culture like like that I realized oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.010" end="00:55:24.330" style="s2">they are so lucky because every decision</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.430" end="00:55:26.100" style="s2">they take is not some great discussion</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.330" end="00:55:28.410" style="s2">about are we going to be this way or</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.100" end="00:55:31.980" style="s2">that way or that they were so lucky they</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.410" end="00:55:34.410" style="s2">inherited a way that worked for nature</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.980" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">that worked for people and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.410" end="00:55:39.170" style="s2">modifications they made over their</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.480" end="00:55:42.270" style="s2">journey happened over a longer period</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.170" end="00:55:44.970" style="s2">you know the experimentation and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.270" end="00:55:47.850" style="s2">you know so they were under so much less</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.970" end="00:55:52.110" style="s2">pressure than we are now as we move</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.850" end="00:55:55.830" style="s2">forward I just I want us to be kinder</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.110" end="00:55:57.900" style="s2">and gentler with ourselves you know be</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.830" end="00:56:01.530" style="s2">more aware that we are swimming in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.900" end="00:56:04.530" style="s2">incredibly difficult system it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.530" end="00:56:07.440" style="s2">because we&#39;re so bloody selfish or</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.530" end="00:56:11.490" style="s2">egotistical by nature we&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.440" end="00:56:14.870" style="s2">imprisoned and I think yeah again this I</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.490" end="00:56:18.500" style="s2">live that in my own life like sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.870" end="00:56:20.800" style="s2">in order to pay the bills for my family</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.500" end="00:56:23.550" style="s2">unnecessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.800" end="00:56:25.960" style="s2">the decisions that if I if I had a</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.550" end="00:56:29.020" style="s2">universal basic income and could could</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.960" end="00:56:30.790" style="s2">fully follow my bliss and my passion and</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.020" end="00:56:34.540" style="s2">my desire to be of service</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.790" end="00:56:36.820" style="s2">I&#39;d put their emphasis a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.540" end="00:56:39.040" style="s2">somewhere else like I some some some</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.820" end="00:56:42.490" style="s2">jobs I mean I&#39;m lucky enough that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.040" end="00:56:44.440" style="s2">been always working in the economy of</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.490" end="00:56:47.080" style="s2">meaning more than the economy of money</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.440" end="00:56:50.320" style="s2">enough rather choose not to earn so much</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.080" end="00:56:53.680" style="s2">and have less but do something that</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.320" end="00:56:55.690" style="s2">fulfills me but sometimes when I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.680" end="00:56:57.640" style="s2">this situation when I have to use well</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.690" end="00:57:00.040" style="s2">this is quite fulfilling and it pays and</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.640" end="00:57:01.900" style="s2">this is really fulfilling but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.040" end="00:57:04.200" style="s2">pay and right now I need a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.900" end="00:57:07.000" style="s2">income so I&#39;m going to choose this one</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.200" end="00:57:09.160" style="s2">by the way that I so agree you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.000" end="00:57:11.050" style="s2">earlier you said about not being purist</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.160" end="00:57:13.990" style="s2">and I think this is a perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.050" end="00:57:16.150" style="s2">where I would just love people I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.990" end="00:57:17.890" style="s2">with that deeper broader awareness as I</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.150" end="00:57:20.110" style="s2">said they could be a bit kinder to</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.890" end="00:57:21.550" style="s2">themselves and they could more willingly</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.110" end="00:57:23.860" style="s2">accept that they have to make a</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.550" end="00:57:25.720" style="s2">compromise and so I&#39;m you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.860" end="00:57:28.450" style="s2">saying to so many people who might still</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.720" end="00:57:30.370" style="s2">be working in a corporate job as long as</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.450" end="00:57:33.930" style="s2">they&#39;re not involved in selling weapons</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.370" end="00:57:37.330" style="s2">or you know truly toxic chemicals</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.930" end="00:57:40.450" style="s2">perhaps it&#39;s fine to stay there and earn</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.330" end="00:57:44.470" style="s2">a bit of money to save maybe go</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.450" end="00:57:47.380" style="s2">part-time but don&#39;t think that we can as</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.470" end="00:57:47.980" style="s2">individuals be the change we want to see</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.380" end="00:57:51.460" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.980" end="00:57:54.670" style="s2">I love Gandhi but I think that slogan</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.460" end="00:57:58.090" style="s2">does not help us to change the eye to a</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.670" end="00:57:59.220" style="s2">we so the way that we create is</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.090" end="00:58:01.330" style="s2">something that&#39;s going to take</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.220" end="00:58:05.820" style="s2">collaboration it&#39;s going to take time</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.330" end="00:58:07.990" style="s2">and we cannot do it as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.820" end="00:58:10.570" style="s2">anyways that&#39;s the answer to my question</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.990" end="00:58:13.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the journey that we go on</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.570" end="00:58:16.540" style="s2">together that will actually educate us</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.480" end="00:58:19.510" style="s2">to do things differently and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.540" end="00:58:21.790" style="s2">noticing more more in there sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.510" end="00:58:23.650" style="s2">is awareness it&#39;s a transformational</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.790" end="00:58:27.370" style="s2">journey that probably already started</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.650" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">decades ago and is only building speed</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.370" end="00:58:32.800" style="s2">and and potential for real</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:34.490" style="s2">transformation to occur now and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.800" end="00:58:37.640" style="s2">we&#39;re probably going to be in it phone</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.490" end="00:58:40.270" style="s2">a few decades if we make it and and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.640" end="00:58:43.100" style="s2">the process will do a lot of learning I</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.270" end="00:58:45.560" style="s2">would love to I know that we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.100" end="00:58:56.840" style="s2">using a dual function for this call yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.560" end="00:58:58.970" style="s2">yes localization day and is it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.840" end="00:59:01.850" style="s2">local futures project and how does it</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.970" end="00:59:05.350" style="s2">has it come together yeah well basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.850" end="00:59:07.700" style="s2">you know local futures for 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.350" end="00:59:10.570" style="s2">really has been about raising awareness</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.700" end="00:59:13.480" style="s2">about the destructive nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.570" end="00:59:15.430" style="s2">globalizing path of the economy and</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.480" end="00:59:17.780" style="s2">promoting we&#39;ve been promoting</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.430" end="00:59:21.230" style="s2">decentralization and localization for</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.780" end="00:59:23.900" style="s2">that time and it came out of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.230" end="00:59:27.950" style="s2">with indigenous culture and a conviction</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.900" end="00:59:31.250" style="s2">that we need to reconnect deeply to life</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.950" end="00:59:33.430" style="s2">and that meant we could choose a part</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.250" end="00:59:38.060" style="s2">that meant both human and ecological</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.430" end="00:59:40.970" style="s2">healing simultaneously in the last Oh</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.060" end="00:59:42.470" style="s2">what is it now ten years or so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.970" end="00:59:44.780" style="s2">been organizing international</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.470" end="00:59:48.080" style="s2">conferences around the world and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.780" end="00:59:49.790" style="s2">know this was sometimes particularly in</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.080" end="00:59:52.790" style="s2">recent years people were questioning</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.790" end="00:59:55.910" style="s2">whether it&#39;s meaningful to be traveling</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.790" end="00:59:58.119" style="s2">but we as I said early we really believe</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.910" end="01:00:01.040" style="s2">in the need for deeper communication</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.119" end="01:00:03.980" style="s2">deeper exchange particularly between the</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:06.530" style="s2">so called third world and the first</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.980" end="01:00:08.630" style="s2">world less industrial as more industrial</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.530" end="01:00:11.980" style="s2">urgently needed because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.630" end="01:00:14.060" style="s2">misinformation both ways so these</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.980" end="01:00:17.330" style="s2">conferences were very meaningful for</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.060" end="01:00:19.609" style="s2">many people and we brought in some of</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.330" end="01:00:22.310" style="s2">our network of speakers who were very</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.609" end="01:00:24.190" style="s2">clear about how the global trade</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.310" end="01:00:27.830" style="s2">treaties were destroying democracy</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.190" end="01:00:30.859" style="s2">driving uh permissions etc and had</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.830" end="01:00:32.480" style="s2">experience of localization Michael</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.859" end="01:00:36.470" style="s2">Shuman for instance he&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.480" end="01:00:37.970" style="s2">world experts on locally financed for</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.470" end="01:00:39.680" style="s2">local business and building local</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.970" end="01:00:42.410" style="s2">economies to us</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.680" end="01:00:46.700" style="s2">Eisenstein who philosophically and in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.410" end="01:00:47.480" style="s2">holistic way embraces all this so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.700" end="01:00:49.730" style="s2">been doing this</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.480" end="01:00:52.010" style="s2">to national conferences and this year we</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.730" end="01:00:53.450" style="s2">were planning to do more including</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.010" end="01:00:55.730" style="s2">working with the new government in</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.450" end="01:01:00.380" style="s2">Mexico we were very excited about and</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.730" end="01:01:03.260" style="s2">then go bid hit and so oh it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.380" end="01:01:06.950" style="s2">recently but a little over a month ago</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.260" end="01:01:09.650" style="s2">we decided in local futures were a small</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.950" end="01:01:13.310" style="s2">international group to try to put these</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.650" end="01:01:16.790" style="s2">conferences on the web instead and we</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.310" end="01:01:21.230" style="s2">could see that really you know this</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.790" end="01:01:24.770" style="s2">pandemic had open eyes in a way that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.230" end="01:01:28.880" style="s2">felt the time was right to try to claim</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.770" end="01:01:32.510" style="s2">this as were localization day we so want</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.880" end="01:01:34.790" style="s2">to show that these millions of people</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.510" end="01:01:38.109" style="s2">around the world both in more</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.790" end="01:01:41.300" style="s2">traditional and in the new local are</p>

<p begin="01:01:41.300" end="01:01:46.460" style="s2">forward doesn&#39;t mean that the endpoint</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.490" end="01:01:48.920" style="s2">is everything is produced locally what</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.460" end="01:01:51.140" style="s2">does local mean it&#39;s a relative term but</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.920" end="01:01:53.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a process of shortening distances</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.140" end="01:01:55.520" style="s2">it&#39;s fundamentally about diversifying I</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.119" end="01:01:58.880" style="s2">mean anything about slowing down because</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.520" end="01:02:02.480" style="s2">to love to care to nurture takes time</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.880" end="01:02:04.430" style="s2">and that we need to nurture life back to</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.480" end="01:02:06.290" style="s2">life whether it&#39;s the plants or our own</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.430" end="01:02:08.290" style="s2">children or own Souls</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.290" end="01:02:11.090" style="s2">you know we desperately need that</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.290" end="01:02:13.460" style="s2">possibility to scale down and slow down</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.090" end="01:02:17.030" style="s2">so that&#39;s what localization is about</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.460" end="01:02:20.210" style="s2">it&#39;s happening and there are so many</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.030" end="01:02:23.210" style="s2">beautiful examples of how it can work</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.210" end="01:02:26.869" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to gather as much of</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.210" end="01:02:31.310" style="s2">that as we can on this one day we will</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.869" end="01:02:34.190" style="s2">have an online program and we&#39;ve been so</p>

<p begin="01:02:47.720" end="01:02:54.310" style="s2">economy so we have a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.320" end="01:02:57.710" style="s2">blend of people from left to right and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.310" end="01:03:00.530" style="s2">we&#39;re particularly keen to reach the</p>

<p begin="01:03:07.220" end="01:03:13.220" style="s2">this global economic interdependence was</p>

<p begin="01:03:13.220" end="01:03:20.000" style="s2">creating genuine collaboration and so we</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.270" end="01:03:24.230" style="s2">want to reach them with the diversity of</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.000" end="01:03:28.670" style="s2">voices and to try as much as possible in</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.230" end="01:03:33.410" style="s2">about a four hour program to to show</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.670" end="01:03:35.770" style="s2">that there is a very very important fork</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.410" end="01:03:38.240" style="s2">in the road and it is about this</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.770" end="01:03:41.360" style="s2">fundamental things are we moving towards</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.240" end="01:03:44.630" style="s2">the earth and towards reconstituting</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.360" end="01:03:47.600" style="s2">community and with that reconstituting</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.630" end="01:03:50.480" style="s2">what it means to be human or are we</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.600" end="01:03:53.390" style="s2">actually buying into the propaganda for</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.480" end="01:03:56.840" style="s2">robots and believing that they can be</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.390" end="01:03:58.610" style="s2">more kind and wise than humans and going</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.840" end="01:04:00.890" style="s2">down in line that this mean resource</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.610" end="01:04:04.160" style="s2">intensive energy intensive and means</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.890" end="01:04:06.230" style="s2">that we will be running after technology</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.160" end="01:04:08.990" style="s2">and becoming more and more dehumanized</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.230" end="01:04:11.270" style="s2">with so on people to think about how it</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.990" end="01:04:13.310" style="s2">feels when they pick up the phone they</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.270" end="01:04:16.550" style="s2">want to talk to a human being on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.310" end="01:04:18.170" style="s2">other side and they get a robot or they</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.550" end="01:04:20.290" style="s2">get maybe someone on the other side of</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.170" end="01:04:24.080" style="s2">the world who knows nothing about their</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.290" end="01:04:29.450" style="s2">context so I&#39;m so glad that you could</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.080" end="01:04:31.460" style="s2">join it Daniel and will it be here so</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.450" end="01:04:33.740" style="s2">it&#39;s its life broadcast for four hours</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.460" end="01:04:35.750" style="s2">but then all the things are recorded and</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.740" end="01:04:38.000" style="s2">streamable afterwards so people like it</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.750" end="01:04:40.910" style="s2">so it becomes a resource for people in</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.000" end="01:04:42.560" style="s2">not just on that day absolutely it will</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.910" end="01:04:47.390" style="s2">be a resource for people it will be a</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.560" end="01:04:49.430" style="s2">sort of repository everything local and</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.390" end="01:04:51.620" style="s2">and of course we have a lot on our</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.430" end="01:04:54.440" style="s2">website local futures anyway</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.620" end="01:04:56.390" style="s2">I&#39;m amazed myself when I try to look for</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.440" end="01:04:59.540" style="s2">things and there&#39;s so much there in</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.390" end="01:05:05.120" style="s2">terms of books and films and past talks</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.540" end="01:05:07.880" style="s2">and but I think also what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.120" end="01:05:08.560" style="s2">be doing is we&#39;ll be screening at 6</p>

<p begin="01:13:04.040" end="01:13:09.530" style="s2">earth again and don&#39;t forget about</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.860" end="01:13:11.150" style="s2">community because this is where our work</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.530" end="01:13:13.100" style="s2">has been a bit different I spoke to</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.150" end="01:13:16.940" style="s2">Joanna the other day she&#39;s a dear dear</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.100" end="01:13:19.880" style="s2">friend but within the West somehow well</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.940" end="01:13:22.239" style="s2">I think I know how but you know the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.880" end="01:13:25.250" style="s2">vital importance of intergenerational</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.239" end="01:13:27.950" style="s2">community which humans as a way of</p>

<p begin="01:13:27.950" end="01:13:32.980" style="s2">sense of self not such a frightened</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.080" end="01:13:39.310" style="s2">little being that then is so hungry and</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.980" end="01:13:45.530" style="s2">becomes so vulnerable and yeah oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.310" end="01:13:48.410" style="s2">ancestry is a consensus process but</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.530" end="01:13:50.719" style="s2">would often happen you know with with</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.410" end="01:13:53.090" style="s2">this whole view of people holding the</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.719" end="01:13:57.380" style="s2">earth in their hands and very much a</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.090" end="01:13:59.390" style="s2">type of managed environmentalism we lost</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.380" end="01:14:02.060" style="s2">sight of that the fact that is the earth</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.390" end="01:14:02.670" style="s2">that holds us in her hands and that that</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.060" end="01:14:06.239" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.670" end="01:14:08.520" style="s2">based existence is necessary and by</p>

<p begin="01:14:08.520" end="01:14:14.130" style="s2">face-to-face real ongoing community it</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.270" end="01:14:17.489" style="s2">becomes easier to become part of this</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.130" end="01:14:19.290" style="s2">yes is global one earth we all you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.489" end="01:14:22.230" style="s2">we all love each other we all love the</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.290" end="01:14:25.590" style="s2">trees and I increasingly believe that</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.230" end="01:14:29.370" style="s2">the one fundamental change where we sort</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.590" end="01:14:32.600" style="s2">of veered off the road is because we</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.370" end="01:14:36.179" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the cultural traditions</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.600" end="01:14:38.460" style="s2">intact that reminded us that we belong</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.179" end="01:14:40.739" style="s2">to the earth and I expressions of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.460" end="01:14:43.199" style="s2">earth rather than the us belonging to us</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.739" end="01:14:48.330" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s where all went wrong</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.199" end="01:14:51.560" style="s2">like if we if we can re-create cultural</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.330" end="01:14:54.780" style="s2">narratives that remind us that the only</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.560" end="01:14:57.870" style="s2">enlightened way to work for your</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.780" end="01:15:00.929" style="s2">self-interest in terms of the ego is to</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.870" end="01:15:03.480" style="s2">actually work in service to our life and</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.929" end="01:15:05.010" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s and that&#39;s why I sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.480" end="01:15:07.530" style="s2">also get a little bit annoyed with this</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.010" end="01:15:10.020" style="s2">framing that we&#39;re moving from ego to</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.530" end="01:15:16.530" style="s2">eco like I think the the synthesis will</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.020" end="01:15:19.500" style="s2">be an expressing self ego in as a</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.530" end="01:15:21.540" style="s2">relational being to community and</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.500" end="01:15:23.370" style="s2">community there&#39;s the human community</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.540" end="01:15:25.380" style="s2">all the way through our ancestry and</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.370" end="01:15:26.790" style="s2">into the future and it is also the wider</p>
