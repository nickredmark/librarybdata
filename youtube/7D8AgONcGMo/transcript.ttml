<p begin="00:00:07.990" end="00:00:12.940" style="s2">interview that we put out earlier in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.269" end="00:00:15.400" style="s2">summer called a Zen master talks about</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.940" end="00:00:17.350" style="s2">Jordan Peterson in the shadow has become</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.400" end="00:00:18.940" style="s2">one of the most viewed things on our</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.350" end="00:00:19.840" style="s2">channel certainly the most viewed thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.940" end="00:00:22.450" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t actually have Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.840" end="00:00:25.660" style="s2">Pederson in it and some really</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.450" end="00:00:29.320" style="s2">interesting really polarized reactions</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.660" end="00:00:31.150" style="s2">so I&#39;d love to explore that with you now</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.320" end="00:00:34.030" style="s2">kind of why it was so successful and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.150" end="00:00:34.660" style="s2">also why people seem to either love it</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.030" end="00:00:37.329" style="s2">or hate it</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.660" end="00:00:44.050" style="s2">you&#39;re a Zen master we are back once</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.329" end="00:00:46.030" style="s2">again with the renegade master I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.050" end="00:00:48.489" style="s2">of myself more as a troublemaker</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.030" end="00:00:50.469" style="s2">renegade work so we were just speaking</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.489" end="00:00:54.399" style="s2">before and you said that it has already</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.469" end="00:00:57.519" style="s2">kind of affected your life in a way well</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.399" end="00:00:59.409" style="s2">it has certainly increased the number of</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.519" end="00:01:03.670" style="s2">people subscribing to our YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.409" end="00:01:05.379" style="s2">channel exponentially I might add so</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.670" end="00:01:09.969" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting we&#39;ve had to create a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.379" end="00:01:13.360" style="s2">little more content the polarization</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.969" end="00:01:17.380" style="s2">that happened on the interview was very</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.360" end="00:01:20.380" style="s2">interesting to me and I&#39;d like to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.380" end="00:01:24.399" style="s2">about it a little because I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.380" end="00:01:29.619" style="s2">it&#39;s informative there&#39;s so much that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.399" end="00:01:34.450" style="s2">can be learned from polarization when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.619" end="00:01:38.770" style="s2">read the comments I noticed just a rough</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.450" end="00:01:42.850" style="s2">glance about 40% of them thought I I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.770" end="00:01:46.270" style="s2">I sucked and about 40% of them thought I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.850" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">walked on water and about 20% of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.270" end="00:01:54.939" style="s2">thought I was just weird so to me I</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:57.749" style="s2">really pay attention to what Byron Katie</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.939" end="00:02:01.600" style="s2">says it&#39;s congruent with my experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.749" end="00:02:04.630" style="s2">she says we don&#39;t talk to each other we</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.600" end="00:02:11.190" style="s2">talked to each other&#39;s projections but</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.630" end="00:02:13.740" style="s2">only 98% of the time so what I saw was</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:16.170" style="s2">all of that that I was reading were</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:18.740" style="s2">projections they were projections of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.170" end="00:02:24.960" style="s2">shadows some golden shadows and some</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.740" end="00:02:29.370" style="s2">ugly shadows but for me personally it</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.960" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">was a gold mine because I know that even</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.370" end="00:02:35.010" style="s2">though their shadows and I shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:38.190" style="s2">take it literally every time somebody</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.010" end="00:02:40.740" style="s2">projects something on me there&#39;s a hook</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.190" end="00:02:44.220" style="s2">inside me that that projection can hang</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.740" end="00:02:47.850" style="s2">on so it was a gold mine in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.220" end="00:02:51.000" style="s2">that those those those comments were</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.850" end="00:02:53.460" style="s2">mirrors that enabled me to see some</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.000" end="00:02:55.800" style="s2">things about myself that were</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.460" end="00:02:57.510" style="s2">fascinating so I want to thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.800" end="00:03:02.160" style="s2">that say more about what were those</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.510" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">things well I I did notice that the one</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.160" end="00:03:09.270" style="s2">of the things that really upset some</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:10.740" style="s2">people not all everyone and again half</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.270" end="00:03:15.239" style="s2">the people that delighted half the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.740" end="00:03:20.040" style="s2">people it it troubled them was my</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.239" end="00:03:23.550" style="s2">laughter and to me that is just it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.040" end="00:03:26.070" style="s2">practice that we consciously do we call</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.550" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">it sacred laughter I had a quick look</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.070" end="00:03:30.330" style="s2">back through the comments just before</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:31.980" style="s2">this interview and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.330" end="00:03:35.370" style="s2">that a lot of people seem to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.980" end="00:03:36.570" style="s2">was they found parts of maybe the laughs</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.370" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve already talked about but</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.570" end="00:03:41.580" style="s2">inauthentic fake or inauthentic what do</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:49.320" style="s2">you what do you make of that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.580" end="00:03:52.769" style="s2">that that fascinated me if you talked to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.320" end="00:03:55.260" style="s2">any of my students and you asked them</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.769" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">what is the most important thing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.260" end="00:04:01.230" style="s2">they&#39;re here you know what they say and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:04.739" style="s2">you can ask these two if you like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.230" end="00:04:08.130" style="s2">my authenticity my integrity so that one</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.739" end="00:04:10.590" style="s2">really it really puzzled me I didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.130" end="00:04:13.440" style="s2">their there must be something in the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.590" end="00:04:17.030" style="s2">that I&#39;m using emotions because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.440" end="00:04:21.269" style="s2">playing with emotions you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.030" end="00:04:25.050" style="s2">we create emotions I mean actors create</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.269" end="00:04:27.150" style="s2">emotions for an impact and I know that</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.050" end="00:04:30.539" style="s2">that&#39;s something that I consciously do I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.150" end="00:04:33.419" style="s2">must not do it very well as all I could</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.539" end="00:04:35.370" style="s2">think of because alle my colleague was</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.419" end="00:04:36.990" style="s2">talking about the woods and he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.370" end="00:04:41.400" style="s2">saying how perfect the reaction was</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.990" end="00:04:43.819" style="s2">because the art of of R in zazen is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.400" end="00:04:46.199" style="s2">trickster archetype it&#39;s the renegade</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.819" end="00:04:47.699" style="s2">archetype so the fact that it was so</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.199" end="00:04:50.039" style="s2">polarizing the fact that people have</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.699" end="00:04:52.020" style="s2">such a mixed reaction to it was in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.039" end="00:04:54.210" style="s2">sense a perfectly Zen reaction to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.020" end="00:04:55.919" style="s2">interview and that is conscious that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.210" end="00:05:00.389" style="s2">a conscious intention that I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.919" end="00:05:02.370" style="s2">deliberately doing the the the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.389" end="00:05:05.310" style="s2">thing I want to accomplish is I want you</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.370" end="00:05:08.129" style="s2">to be uncomfortable because that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.310" end="00:05:11.819" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna grow safety is the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.129" end="00:05:14.610" style="s2">unsafe spiritual path you can take it</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.819" end="00:05:19.500" style="s2">leaves you frozen in fear unable to take</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.610" end="00:05:21.319" style="s2">risks unable to learn and grow and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.500" end="00:05:24.180" style="s2">is something I deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.319" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">intentionally do you can ask anybody in</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.180" end="00:05:29.759" style="s2">the Sangha that as well this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:32.159" style="s2">integrals in you know if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:34.469" style="s2">willing to be uncomfortable you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.159" end="00:05:36.650" style="s2">the wrong Sangha go find another one and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.469" end="00:05:38.370" style="s2">we tell you that right up front</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.650" end="00:05:42.120" style="s2">something came up when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.370" end="00:05:43.889" style="s2">about the reading the comments and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.120" end="00:05:46.409" style="s2">quite exposing like putting stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.889" end="00:05:48.509" style="s2">there and then reading what people think</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.409" end="00:05:50.250" style="s2">of it what I hear you saying about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.509" end="00:05:51.569" style="s2">is extremely valuable information it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.250" end="00:05:52.949" style="s2">really valuable to have all of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.569" end="00:05:53.460" style="s2">people sort of reflecting back what</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.949" end="00:05:56.069" style="s2">they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.460" end="00:06:00.779" style="s2">yes it&#39;s valuable to reflect on that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.069" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">in internally look at where the hooks</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.779" end="00:06:08.099" style="s2">are so the laughter was one example the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:10.259" style="s2">collective shadows were another example</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.099" end="00:06:11.909" style="s2">you know I happen to think a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.259" end="00:06:14.580" style="s2">of Jordan Peterson I think he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.909" end="00:06:16.379" style="s2">amazing guy he&#39;s brilliant and I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.580" end="00:06:19.699" style="s2">fascinated just because I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.379" end="00:06:23.610" style="s2">criticizing one little thing people</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.699" end="00:06:25.399" style="s2">projected a devil on me that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.610" end="00:06:27.690" style="s2">fascinating that&#39;s a collective shadow</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.399" end="00:06:30.060" style="s2">that&#39;s if you don&#39;t agree with me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.690" end="00:06:30.610" style="s2">going to attack you it&#39;s not a very high</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.060" end="00:06:35.040" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.610" end="00:06:40.660" style="s2">collective shadow it it is so important</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.040" end="00:06:44.020" style="s2">in integrals in to let everything inform</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.660" end="00:06:47.350" style="s2">you we let the body inform us we let the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.020" end="00:06:50.440" style="s2">nature inform us we let dreams inform us</p>

<p begin="00:07:05.470" end="00:07:10.300" style="s2">teachings and this is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.710" end="00:07:12.520" style="s2">think a lot of people don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.300" end="00:07:15.250" style="s2">about spirituality or true spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.520" end="00:07:17.530" style="s2">which is it&#39;s not supposed to be a</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.480" end="00:12:31.870" style="s2">join an organization and you find that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.540" end="00:12:37.070" style="s2">isn&#39;t in place make note take heed</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.870" end="00:12:38.390" style="s2">because it will go badly especially with</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.070" end="00:12:40.279" style="s2">someone who say and they have no I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:12:47.660" end="00:12:51.050" style="s2">have no shadows do you run a mile should</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.520" end="00:12:52.610" style="s2">you run a mile no I don&#39;t run but I</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.050" end="00:12:55.670" style="s2">challenge the shit out of them</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.610" end="00:12:58.339" style="s2">I laugh in their face and I&#39;ll challenge</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.670" end="00:13:01.209" style="s2">them because if as Roger Walsh said</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.339" end="00:13:03.260" style="s2">brilliantly I don&#39;t care who you are</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.520" end="00:13:22.010" style="s2">surely not brexit right so I think this</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:24.920" style="s2">is really an important thing to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.010" end="00:13:27.650" style="s2">and it applies not just to spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.920" end="00:13:31.310" style="s2">teachers it applies to workship shop</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.310" end="00:13:35.540" style="s2">doing rebel wisdom workshops you need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.740" end="00:13:38.060" style="s2">have the same kind of mechanisms in</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.540" end="00:13:40.250" style="s2">place and if you don&#39;t it&#39;s you need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.060" end="00:13:42.290" style="s2">get some yeah and I&#39;ll be happy to help</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.250" end="00:13:45.200" style="s2">you with that we&#39;ve learned we&#39;d made</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.290" end="00:13:48.410" style="s2">lots of mistakes in coming to the place</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.200" end="00:13:50.600" style="s2">where we have and what I always ask is</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.410" end="00:13:53.930" style="s2">not do you have shadows that&#39;s a given</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.600" end="00:13:56.600" style="s2">do you know what your shadows are that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.930" end="00:13:58.490" style="s2">a more pertinent question and if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.600" end="00:14:01.610" style="s2">can&#39;t answer that question and tell me</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.490" end="00:14:04.090" style="s2">what your shadows are then I walk away</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.610" end="00:14:07.130" style="s2">mmm that&#39;s actually the very first</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.090" end="00:14:09.290" style="s2">whenever we do any collaborative project</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.130" end="00:14:12.350" style="s2">that&#39;s the first process that we do is</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.290" end="00:14:14.360" style="s2">going round and we use the format if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.350" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">worked with me you would learn and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.360" end="00:14:20.350" style="s2">you would learn that I don&#39;t take advice</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:23.960" style="s2">very well I always think I&#39;m right that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.350" end="00:14:27.320" style="s2">and that is the oh that is invariably</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.960" end="00:14:29.390" style="s2">the thing that deepens the field and if</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.320" end="00:14:31.340" style="s2">you don&#39;t I think if you don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.390" end="00:14:32.690" style="s2">then you&#39;re whatever organisation or</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.340" end="00:14:35.150" style="s2">whatever collaboration you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.690" end="00:14:36.740" style="s2">going to have unspoken stuff under the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.150" end="00:14:39.020" style="s2">surface that&#39;s going to take you down at</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.740" end="00:14:41.900" style="s2">some point so it feels like a process</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.020" end="00:14:43.250" style="s2">that needs to happen I bow to that mmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.900" end="00:14:45.110" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.250" end="00:14:47.630" style="s2">thanks I&#39;m happy to hear that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.110" end="00:14:49.940" style="s2">suspected as much just getting to seeing</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.630" end="00:14:52.730" style="s2">the twinkle in your eye when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.940" end="00:14:56.360" style="s2">about shadows and spirituality yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.730" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">I I think shadow work is the what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.360" end="00:15:00.290" style="s2">really interesting I think shadow work</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">is the key work for right now but also</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.290" end="00:15:05.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a real upsurge of interest in it</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:07.010" style="s2">as well this is something that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.540" end="00:15:08.420" style="s2">seen in our workshops people are now</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.010" end="00:15:10.280" style="s2">coming with a concept of the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.420" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">which they would probably not have had</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.280" end="00:15:15.310" style="s2">even quite recently which I think partly</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:17.180" style="s2">that could be Jordan Pederson</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.310" end="00:15:19.230" style="s2">popularizing the union idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.180" end="00:15:20.850" style="s2">shadow but just generally</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.230" end="00:15:22.440" style="s2">does feel like the time of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.850" end="00:15:25.020" style="s2">integration of the shadow yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.440" end="00:15:26.100" style="s2">certainly had an impact on that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.020" end="00:15:33.180" style="s2">no question about it and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.100" end="00:15:35.250" style="s2">delighted to see that shadows are</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.180" end="00:15:37.980" style="s2">something that I have been studying for</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.250" end="00:15:40.110" style="s2">quite a while in fact a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.980" end="00:15:42.090" style="s2">students affectionately call me and some</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.110" end="00:15:48.450" style="s2">not so affectionately the shadow Roshi</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.090" end="00:15:50.370" style="s2">and I I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because I do</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.450" end="00:15:55.260" style="s2">so much work with shadows or I have so</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.370" end="00:15:57.660" style="s2">many shadows maybe a combination I will</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.260" end="00:16:00.090" style="s2">have to ask them could you give a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.660" end="00:16:01.620" style="s2">concrete example of what this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.090" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">something that we&#39;re often people often</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.620" end="00:16:05.850" style="s2">ask us how do you work on the shadow we</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:08.250" style="s2">talk about the shadow a lot can you give</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.850" end="00:16:12.300" style="s2">a practical example of how to work on</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.250" end="00:16:14.910" style="s2">the shadow yes so one of the surefire</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.300" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">ways and I&#39;ve heard you talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.910" end="00:16:20.970" style="s2">especially when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:24.900" style="s2">the interview and people&#39;s comments when</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.970" end="00:16:30.060" style="s2">you two were talking if something</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.900" end="00:16:34.710" style="s2">bothers you about somebody like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.060" end="00:16:39.950" style="s2">take Trump for example Trump bothers me</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.710" end="00:16:42.990" style="s2">because he&#39;s so arrogant and he&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.950" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">contracted and unwilling he just attacks</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.990" end="00:16:49.800" style="s2">when anybody criticizes he attacks them</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:54.450" style="s2">now if that bothers me and you see my</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.800" end="00:16:56.310" style="s2">energy coming up my emotion which is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.450" end="00:16:58.710" style="s2">acting right now because it really</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.310" end="00:17:00.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t bother me because I&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.710" end="00:17:03.480" style="s2">shadow in myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.650" end="00:17:05.310" style="s2">I&#39;m manufacturing that emotion for</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.480" end="00:17:07.140" style="s2">effect so some people will probably say</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.310" end="00:17:11.250" style="s2">that&#39;s inauthentic and it&#39;ll bother them</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.140" end="00:17:11.940" style="s2">and what does that tell us but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.250" end="00:17:18.450" style="s2">inauthentic</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.940" end="00:17:21.720" style="s2">exactly exactly but if it bothered me</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.450" end="00:17:25.830" style="s2">that Trump was attacking every time he</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.720" end="00:17:28.590" style="s2">was criticized then that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.830" end="00:17:31.360" style="s2">automatic indication that I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.590" end="00:17:33.909" style="s2">defensive and that&#39;s exactly what I</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:37.990" style="s2">and that would be an example of me</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.909" end="00:17:40.840" style="s2">projecting my shadow onto him now he has</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.990" end="00:17:42.730" style="s2">a hook that my projection will fall on</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.840" end="00:17:47.620" style="s2">because he is like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.730" end="00:17:50.409" style="s2">he&#39;s extremely attacking ruthlessly</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.620" end="00:17:53.500" style="s2">attacking when anybody criticizes him</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.409" end="00:17:56.529" style="s2">he&#39;s hypersensitive to it so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.500" end="00:17:59.169" style="s2">hook this big dang my projection on him</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.529" end="00:18:02.049" style="s2">but if I&#39;d look at him and I just see</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.169" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">it&#39;s factual you know he&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.049" end="00:18:07.149" style="s2">that and I can&#39;t believe that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:09.309" style="s2">President of the United States and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.149" end="00:18:13.299" style="s2">really see the harm that that causes</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.309" end="00:18:17.070" style="s2">everywhere I look but it doesn&#39;t bother</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.299" end="00:18:20.799" style="s2">me with that level of personalized</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.070" end="00:18:24.070" style="s2">emotion now it bothers me because I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.799" end="00:18:27.250" style="s2">American and it&#39;s embarrassing you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.070" end="00:18:29.610" style="s2">for the rest of the world but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.250" end="00:18:32.049" style="s2">that&#39;s just showing the American shadow</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.610" end="00:18:34.659" style="s2">you Britt surely can see that pretty</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.049" end="00:18:37.690" style="s2">clearly Trump is a great example because</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.659" end="00:18:41.110" style="s2">on some level he is holding a projection</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.690" end="00:18:43.630" style="s2">and also the sense is for me at least</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.110" end="00:18:46.890" style="s2">that he is the perfect trigger for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.630" end="00:18:50.740" style="s2">liberal projections the liberal shadow</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.890" end="00:18:54.039" style="s2">but my concern is that at the moment the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.740" end="00:18:56.700" style="s2">necessary self-examination that Trump</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.039" end="00:18:58.990" style="s2">has won the election the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.700" end="00:19:01.539" style="s2">worldview has been decisively rejected</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.990" end="00:19:04.779" style="s2">or rejected in the in the election by a</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.539" end="00:19:06.220" style="s2">lot of people who don&#39;t share it there</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.779" end="00:19:08.710" style="s2">is not there&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.220" end="00:19:11.710" style="s2">self-reflection going on from what I see</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.710" end="00:19:14.320" style="s2">in liberal America there&#39;s none they are</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.710" end="00:19:17.110" style="s2">in shadow and they need to do some</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:20.440" style="s2">shadow work you know the the book that</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.110" end="00:19:24.640" style="s2">Wilbur wrote on Trump really articulates</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.440" end="00:19:27.789" style="s2">that clearly it just nails that the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.640" end="00:19:34.210" style="s2">fact that the Liberals can&#39;t see how</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.789" end="00:19:38.670" style="s2">much Trump bothers them is even scarier</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.210" end="00:19:41.460" style="s2">than Trump to me the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.670" end="00:19:45.510" style="s2">that that whole thing is in shadow and</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.460" end="00:19:48.180" style="s2">disowned makes them more dangerous than</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.510" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">Trump more dangerous only because</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.180" end="00:19:54.780" style="s2">they&#39;re more evolved and what they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:56.940" style="s2">shadow with is hidden they&#39;re much more</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.780" end="00:19:59.910" style="s2">skillful at hiding their shadow than</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.940" end="00:20:02.610" style="s2">Trump is he can&#39;t hide his shadow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.910" end="00:20:05.130" style="s2">blatantly obvious which makes it less</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.610" end="00:20:07.860" style="s2">dangerous to me so what is the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.130" end="00:20:10.890" style="s2">that&#39;s hidden and that&#39;s context</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.860" end="00:20:14.280" style="s2">Erica&#39;s liberal arrogance liberal</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.890" end="00:20:18.950" style="s2">arrogance and passive-aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.280" end="00:20:23.640" style="s2">violence that&#39;s been repressed it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.950" end="00:20:25.740" style="s2">it&#39;s so likely to explode out I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.640" end="00:20:29.000" style="s2">we last interview we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.740" end="00:20:35.010" style="s2">culture wars that&#39;s two shadows</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.000" end="00:20:38.430" style="s2">conflicting right if if you and I were</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.010" end="00:20:39.810" style="s2">in that position where we polarized to</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.430" end="00:20:42.300" style="s2">the point that the liberals and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.810" end="00:20:46.740" style="s2">conservatives had then we would be that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.300" end="00:20:51.360" style="s2">far from coming to blows this is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.740" end="00:20:54.900" style="s2">explode in a very ugly way I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.360" end="00:20:57.330" style="s2">anything to make it better I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.900" end="00:21:01.140" style="s2">anything happening to stop the deadlock</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.330" end="00:21:04.260" style="s2">and that&#39;s frightening that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.140" end="00:21:06.630" style="s2">frightening I think I agree because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.260" end="00:21:09.900" style="s2">idea of even a mediator between the two</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.630" end="00:21:12.120" style="s2">sides just seems like a non-starter at</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.900" end="00:21:13.380" style="s2">the moment like I don&#39;t see that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.120" end="00:21:15.390" style="s2">going to be one of my questions</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.380" end="00:21:17.130" style="s2">is there a way for America to pull out</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.390" end="00:21:18.660" style="s2">of the sort of spiral of polarization</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.130" end="00:21:19.370" style="s2">that it&#39;s in at the moment I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.660" end="00:21:24.890" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.370" end="00:21:24.890" style="s2">short of a disaster so what do you say</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.920" end="00:21:28.710" style="s2">you asked me that question before you</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.540" end="00:21:34.680" style="s2">can ask it again</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.710" end="00:21:37.950" style="s2">I see disaster that&#39;s what I see and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.680" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">don&#39;t see a specific disaster I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.950" end="00:21:44.250" style="s2">prophesies anything but I see the only</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:48.650" style="s2">thing that&#39;s going to shock us out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.250" end="00:21:51.450" style="s2">this culture war that we&#39;re in is</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.650" end="00:21:53.789" style="s2">something so severe</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.450" end="00:21:56.070" style="s2">that it creates a problem that&#39;s bigger</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.789" end="00:22:00.149" style="s2">than the one we&#39;re projecting on each</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.149" end="00:22:06.980" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to have a bigger enemy</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.950" end="00:22:14.039" style="s2">than each other to unite us into a new</p>
