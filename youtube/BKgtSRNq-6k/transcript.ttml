<p begin="00:01:03.769" end="00:01:08.760" style="s2">one is that people don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:11.280" style="s2">resources people are in poverty people</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.760" end="00:01:13.260" style="s2">are living paycheck to paycheck and you</p>

<p begin="00:01:25.409" end="00:01:28.920" style="s2">and so even even consciously you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.540" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">gonna think this thing is less and less</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.920" end="00:01:32.280" style="s2">of a big deal than it is because you</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:34.140" style="s2">can&#39;t allow it to be as big of a deal as</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.280" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">it is for you in the economy and your</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.979" end="00:02:14.430" style="s2">and we understandably don&#39;t trust the 1%</p>

<p begin="00:02:14.430" end="00:02:19.019" style="s2">don&#39;t trust our elected officials who</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.129" end="00:02:24.060" style="s2">constantly are shown to lie and have no</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.019" end="00:02:26.970" style="s2">no ramifications for it we need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.060" end="00:02:31.080" style="s2">create a system that we trust that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.970" end="00:02:33.239" style="s2">can go to for information and then it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.080" end="00:02:35.569" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter what the media does we</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.239" end="00:02:37.890" style="s2">need to be able to to create a</p>

<p begin="00:02:56.700" end="00:03:04.140" style="s2">scared and disconnected and during this</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.060" end="00:03:07.530" style="s2">pandemic it becomes even more showcase</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.140" end="00:03:09.810" style="s2">because you&#39;re basically locked inside</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.530" end="00:03:11.579" style="s2">with your immediate family right with</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.810" end="00:03:13.620" style="s2">the people that you live with and so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.579" end="00:03:17.489" style="s2">might live alone and that becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.620" end="00:03:19.170" style="s2">of a more apparent you might be in a bad</p>

<p begin="00:03:22.139" end="00:03:27.780" style="s2">family and still all of the fractures</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.359" end="00:03:28.829" style="s2">are going are going to show like anyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.780" end="00:03:31.079" style="s2">who gets through this like yelling at</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.829" end="00:03:32.850" style="s2">each other please tell the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.079" end="00:03:34.739" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been doing this for six</p>

<p begin="00:03:42.810" end="00:03:48.030" style="s2">more capacity for patience and an</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.329" end="00:03:49.950" style="s2">understanding as I allow it to be what</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.030" end="00:03:52.290" style="s2">it currently is but the fact that we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.950" end="00:03:53.730" style="s2">disconnected and lonely is the reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.290" end="00:03:55.079" style="s2">people one or like well I&#39;m healthy I</p>

<p begin="00:04:32.550" end="00:04:36.840" style="s2">together to get problem solved</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:39.330" style="s2">I&#39;m hosting conversations on how to do</p>
