<p begin="00:02:14.840" end="00:02:20.670" style="s2">derived together years ago and one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.940" end="00:02:23.819" style="s2">our first workshops and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.670" end="00:02:27.420" style="s2">sense of what are the elephants in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.819" end="00:02:29.849" style="s2">room what are the monstrous stories that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.420" end="00:02:32.269" style="s2">people are telling offline that did</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.849" end="00:02:35.480" style="s2">never make it online or into your groups</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.269" end="00:02:38.579" style="s2">what are the sacred cows you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.480" end="00:02:40.980" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve been watching really</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.579" end="00:02:44.280" style="s2">closely on my Facebook page as I curate</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.980" end="00:02:46.920" style="s2">a lot of information around coalbed and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.280" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">also in the different venues I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.920" end="00:02:51.629" style="s2">in is there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s implicit</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:53.790" style="s2">rules of where you can go in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.629" end="00:02:56.670" style="s2">information ecology there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.790" end="00:02:59.850" style="s2">social sanctioning going on all the time</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.670" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">and so I&#39;m not sure if people are are</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.850" end="00:03:04.200" style="s2">sensitive to that but even on these</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:07.760" style="s2">channels like the stoah and rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.200" end="00:03:11.100" style="s2">and you can you you see that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.760" end="00:03:13.350" style="s2">invisible boundaries of where were where</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.100" end="00:03:17.810" style="s2">we&#39;re not allowed to think right so this</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.350" end="00:03:22.069" style="s2">is the notion of sacred cows or</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.810" end="00:03:25.980" style="s2">elephants in the room and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.069" end="00:03:28.620" style="s2">when if you if you&#39;ve been in this kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.980" end="00:03:32.250" style="s2">of work long enough you see there&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.620" end="00:03:34.200" style="s2">of a rhythm where new intelligence will</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.250" end="00:03:37.620" style="s2">breakthrough new ideas will breakthrough</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.200" end="00:03:40.380" style="s2">and then they get kind of fashionable</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.620" end="00:03:42.510" style="s2">become attractors then they start to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.380" end="00:03:45.989" style="s2">popular on the media and then they</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.510" end="00:03:48.540" style="s2">become somewhat of a performance kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.989" end="00:03:51.900" style="s2">attractor and the boundaries of what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.540" end="00:03:54.870" style="s2">talked about is is contained and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.900" end="00:03:57.540" style="s2">constrained and like integral theory and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.870" end="00:03:59.850" style="s2">then then there&#39;s a private language and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.540" end="00:04:03.140" style="s2">then there are penalties for going</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.850" end="00:04:07.220" style="s2">outside that private language in in any</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.140" end="00:04:10.850" style="s2">and I think that as we experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.220" end="00:04:13.970" style="s2">new technologies and a lot of us are</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.850" end="00:04:15.440" style="s2">spending time having more transparent</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.970" end="00:04:20.830" style="s2">conversation I think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.440" end="00:04:26.480" style="s2">important that we also to knock our</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.830" end="00:04:29.150" style="s2">sensitivity toward when we are looking</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.480" end="00:04:31.130" style="s2">for cohesion let&#39;s say not coherence so</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.150" end="00:04:33.550" style="s2">Peter will say the Stowe is a place</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.130" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">where we Co here around dialog and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.550" end="00:04:38.780" style="s2">coherence means that all the diverse</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:41.150" style="s2">opinions and all the perspectives make</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.780" end="00:04:44.180" style="s2">it into the information ecology not</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.150" end="00:04:48.260" style="s2">cohesion where we all kind of implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.180" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">agree to these boundaries of beyond</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.260" end="00:04:59.300" style="s2">which we&#39;re not allowed to talk about my</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:05:03.320" style="s2">current I example or exemplar of someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.300" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">who is very good at continually surfing</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.320" end="00:05:07.910" style="s2">those edges as Charles Eisenstein I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:10.520" style="s2">Charles Eisenstein if you watched him</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.910" end="00:05:14.090" style="s2">through his whole career he started kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.520" end="00:05:15.950" style="s2">of like you thought he was kind of New</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.090" end="00:05:18.260" style="s2">Age environmentalist and they keep</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.950" end="00:05:20.890" style="s2">asking questions keep asking questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.260" end="00:05:24.680" style="s2">keep vigilant that he&#39;s not sucked into</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.890" end="00:05:28.070" style="s2">some kind of popular fiction popular</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.680" end="00:05:30.320" style="s2">fiction is really when when we live in</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.070" end="00:05:32.600" style="s2">turbulent times it&#39;s very you know like</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.320" end="00:05:35.960" style="s2">our bodies are starving for popular</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.600" end="00:05:40.010" style="s2">fiction for new mythology for a new way</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.960" end="00:05:42.470" style="s2">to pretend and I think that you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.010" end="00:05:45.170" style="s2">series on elephants of the room and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.470" end="00:05:49.160" style="s2">sacred cows is probably could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.170" end="00:05:51.860" style="s2">important into this ecology so just</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.160" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">start it off you know I have some</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.860" end="00:05:59.330" style="s2">bullets I want to do but I also would</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:06:04.940" style="s2">like to invite you all to throw out what</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.330" end="00:06:12.290" style="s2">you think is you know is sanctioned out</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.940" end="00:06:14.390" style="s2">from the conversation and and we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.290" end="00:06:16.260" style="s2">address them as we go but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.390" end="00:06:20.700" style="s2">things that I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.260" end="00:06:28.350" style="s2">is that anything that is understood</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.700" end="00:06:31.110" style="s2">broadly is poorly seen so anything that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.350" end="00:06:35.490" style="s2">can be captured by a broad</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.110" end="00:06:38.310" style="s2">generalization means that the people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.490" end="00:06:40.740" style="s2">not seeing the actual reality you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.310" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">actually seeing what actually happens so</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.740" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">for example the broad understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:50.190" style="s2">Kovac 19 sanctions the anecdotal</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:53.670" style="s2">evidence is what a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.190" end="00:06:59.060" style="s2">actually seeing so we one of the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.670" end="00:07:05.250" style="s2">which to address this conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.060" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">how can we coordinate broad</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.250" end="00:07:12.510" style="s2">understanding and preserve and perfect</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:19.470" style="s2">what is actually seen and these this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.510" end="00:07:24.980" style="s2">a real tightrope to walk and it happens</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.470" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">in very ordinary daily experience also</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.980" end="00:07:30.930" style="s2">so I like to say it took me 30 years to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:35.070" style="s2">know what a horse is to actually see a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.930" end="00:07:37.860" style="s2">horse because so much of the time when I</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.070" end="00:07:40.260" style="s2">was young I participated with Disney our</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.860" end="00:07:43.080" style="s2">idea of the horse and then when I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.260" end="00:07:47.100" style="s2">competitive rider I had this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.080" end="00:07:49.380" style="s2">the horses excellence carrier of sports</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.100" end="00:07:52.230" style="s2">and then I got when I got very sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.380" end="00:07:53.900" style="s2">about animal cruelty and learned about</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.230" end="00:07:56.790" style="s2">how they work with horses you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.900" end="00:08:00.450" style="s2">constantly moving from one broad</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.790" end="00:08:02.310" style="s2">understanding to the other and realizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.450" end="00:08:04.980" style="s2">that literally even though I had worked</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.080" end="00:08:13.470" style="s2">stallions that really started like</p>

<p begin="00:08:13.470" end="00:08:18.120" style="s2">actually was not aware of what was right</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.600" end="00:08:23.100" style="s2">in front of my face and so this notion</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.120" end="00:08:27.270" style="s2">of anything that is understood broadly</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.100" end="00:08:29.430" style="s2">is seen poorly is something that I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.270" end="00:08:31.560" style="s2">we need to bring into the sense make</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.430" end="00:08:33.810" style="s2">space because you get these people</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.560" end="00:08:35.670" style="s2">coming on and you know this phrase war</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.810" end="00:08:37.530" style="s2">on sense-making and then all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.670" end="00:08:41.070" style="s2">people we have a war on sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.530" end="00:08:44.760" style="s2">it&#39;s very popular right so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.070" end="00:08:49.530" style="s2">broadly understood but there&#39;s not a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.760" end="00:08:50.760" style="s2">of actual participation in what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.530" end="00:08:52.920" style="s2">actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.760" end="00:08:55.380" style="s2">there&#39;s not a lot of perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.920" end="00:08:56.850" style="s2">information coming in there you have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.380" end="00:08:58.650" style="s2">lot of theories you have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.850" end="00:09:01.380" style="s2">psychological theories and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.650" end="00:09:03.720" style="s2">conspiracy theories and you have all</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.380" end="00:09:08.180" style="s2">these things but like what does that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.720" end="00:09:12.420" style="s2">actually mean and I did this I did this</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.180" end="00:09:15.380" style="s2">interesting poll on the meta modern list</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.420" end="00:09:20.280" style="s2">when the war on sense-making got really</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.380" end="00:09:22.380" style="s2">big so I asked people to rate their</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.280" end="00:09:25.080" style="s2">sense-making and their meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.380" end="00:09:29.910" style="s2">from a scale of one to ten ten being</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.080" end="00:09:31.800" style="s2">high since making we defined as being</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.910" end="00:09:33.870" style="s2">able to make a sense with other people</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.800" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">in the public sphere and meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.870" end="00:09:40.380" style="s2">is you know your own personal meaning</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:42.870" style="s2">and it was like Lake Wobegon everybody</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.380" end="00:09:45.540" style="s2">rate rated their sense-making and meet</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.870" end="00:09:50.070" style="s2">in meeting maker making higher than</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.540" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">average right so you guys are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.070" end="00:09:55.650" style="s2">prophets of the war on sense-making and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.800" end="00:09:58.020" style="s2">you rate your own experience six - seven</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.650" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">- eight some people were like nine and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.020" end="00:10:02.790" style="s2">ten so it was like oh look we have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:05.250" style="s2">crisis in sense making</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.790" end="00:10:07.080" style="s2">this is the prophets of sense-making but</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.250" end="00:10:09.060" style="s2">the same people when we reflect them</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.080" end="00:10:11.250" style="s2">their own experience we&#39;re not rating</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.060" end="00:10:13.920" style="s2">them very low with the exception of one</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.250" end="00:10:15.870" style="s2">or two but in general this was not the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.920" end="00:10:18.210" style="s2">case so there&#39;s like a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.870" end="00:10:22.770" style="s2">going on all the time and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.210" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">we&#39;re very vulnerable to you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.770" end="00:10:29.090" style="s2">at a crossroads because the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:32.100" style="s2">where there were sacred cows there were</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.090" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">generalized information that we all kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.100" end="00:10:39.680" style="s2">of assembled around that world is kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.000" end="00:10:42.960" style="s2">of over and so we&#39;re very vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:45.860" style="s2">whatever can capture our imagination</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.960" end="00:10:48.210" style="s2">and then go with that that whole hog so</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.860" end="00:10:52.350" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what we want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.210" end="00:11:00.180" style="s2">about today and see if we can get down</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.350" end="00:11:01.680" style="s2">into some particulars yeah this if</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.180" end="00:11:04.320" style="s2">people are having the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.680" end="00:11:07.790" style="s2">experience and how are they themselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.320" end="00:11:07.790" style="s2">trying to negotiate that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.230" end="00:11:13.830" style="s2">so I&#39;ll warm up when you deal with a few</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.420" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">questions but if you have any questions</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.830" end="00:11:19.290" style="s2">just throw it in the chat box so my</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:27.090" style="s2">first question is how are you</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.290" end="00:11:31.860" style="s2">negotiating that in a cup there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.090" end="00:11:34.980" style="s2">couple of different ways one is and some</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.860" end="00:11:37.290" style="s2">of you took a couple of practice</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.980" end="00:11:40.350" style="s2">workouts one is this notion of what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.290" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">call still hunting and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.350" end="00:11:48.090" style="s2">still hunting social media like you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:50.820" style="s2">you can let a lot of information in</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.090" end="00:11:53.880" style="s2">without trying to organize it into like</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.820" end="00:11:55.980" style="s2">some final answer right you just it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.880" end="00:11:57.780" style="s2">if you&#39;re watching Birds and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.980" end="00:12:00.630" style="s2">there&#39;s more Cardinals over here there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.780" end="00:12:04.200" style="s2">more this over there there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.630" end="00:12:10.110" style="s2">stuff going on it&#39;s not there for you to</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.200" end="00:12:12.060" style="s2">collect and adjudicate and create some</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.110" end="00:12:15.270" style="s2">kind of conclusion to it that&#39;s not how</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.060" end="00:12:17.190" style="s2">collective intelligence works collective</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.270" end="00:12:22.070" style="s2">intelligence works like your brain does</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.650" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">you know some of them say there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.520" end="00:12:35.610" style="s2">kinds of things going on there&#39;s maybe a</p>

<p begin="00:12:46.980" end="00:12:53.700" style="s2">around I can mine all these little kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.950" end="00:12:55.379" style="s2">of sub thresholds expectations and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.700" end="00:12:57.449" style="s2">that are in my awareness</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.449" end="00:13:04.169" style="s2">is sub-threshold</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.739" end="00:13:07.649" style="s2">and the end product is a threshold event</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.169" end="00:13:11.579" style="s2">that comes out of all of those and our</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.649" end="00:13:14.669" style="s2">tendency on social media is to that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.579" end="00:13:18.179" style="s2">anecdotal like we have this notion that</p>

<p begin="00:13:20.549" end="00:13:25.289" style="s2">information we have this notion that the</p>

<p begin="00:13:25.289" end="00:13:31.139" style="s2">is more real than anecdotal information</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.369" end="00:13:32.970" style="s2">we have this notion that I mean it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.139" end="00:13:35.129" style="s2">true that BOTS create a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.970" end="00:13:37.199" style="s2">conspiracy theories of the algorithms do</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.199" end="00:13:43.589" style="s2">that&#39;s very hard to honest us out but</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.669" end="00:13:46.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s you taking the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.589" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">information and you notice like you</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.079" end="00:13:52.079" style="s2">notice for example that the New England</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:53.699" style="s2">of journalists of science and the New</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.079" end="00:14:00.109" style="s2">England Journal of Medicine I think</p>

<p begin="00:14:09.209" end="00:14:14.100" style="s2">months later there&#39;s another article</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.729" end="00:14:16.589" style="s2">that says that&#39;s a false study but</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.100" end="00:14:18.799" style="s2">instead of shifting to like oh my god I</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.589" end="00:14:22.499" style="s2">believe this oh my god I believe this</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.799" end="00:14:26.359" style="s2">you realize that both of those are part</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.359" end="00:14:31.470" style="s2">partially truths they&#39;re both they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.589" end="00:14:33.769" style="s2">not maybe weighted the same way but you</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.470" end="00:14:37.619" style="s2">need to let them in you need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.769" end="00:14:41.399" style="s2">understand now not understand you need</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.619" end="00:14:44.609" style="s2">to be in relationship with all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.399" end="00:14:50.279" style="s2">sub-threshold information and then that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.609" end="00:14:51.989" style="s2">changes your behavior you may not be</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.279" end="00:14:55.979" style="s2">able to come up with some kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.989" end="00:14:59.459" style="s2">systemic download that adjudicates all</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.979" end="00:15:03.659" style="s2">that but if that all that lives in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.459" end="00:15:06.449" style="s2">system then you&#39;re primed positionally</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.659" end="00:15:08.940" style="s2">to move with how the information moves</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.449" end="00:15:12.540" style="s2">right and that you don&#39;t try to go</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.940" end="00:15:16.890" style="s2">for quick closure so that&#39;s one way to</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.540" end="00:15:19.650" style="s2">work with the information ecology is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.890" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">understand that you want to be in</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.650" end="00:15:25.740" style="s2">relation with many many sub-threshold</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:28.080" style="s2">like micro states collective</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.740" end="00:15:30.270" style="s2">intelligence works across people like in</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.080" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">your in your brain you want all this</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.270" end="00:15:39.810" style="s2">information to be part of your awareness</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:41.970" style="s2">and not struggle to create some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.810" end="00:15:43.230" style="s2">like final synthesis because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.970" end="00:15:45.000" style="s2">working with collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.230" end="00:15:49.470" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same as collecting</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.000" end="00:15:51.840" style="s2">intelligence so what is your tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.470" end="00:15:53.580" style="s2">for example there is a term called your</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.840" end="00:15:55.080" style="s2">dispositional state what is your</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.580" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">tolerance for saying oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.080" end="00:16:00.690" style="s2">interesting it doesn&#39;t prove this person</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:04.650" style="s2">wrong it proves ah there&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.690" end="00:16:07.080" style="s2">interesting also so how many how many</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.669" end="00:18:38.580" style="s2">on it to see if it works and I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.570" end="00:18:40.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of like things in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.580" end="00:18:43.380" style="s2">middle there all right so just any</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.950" end="00:18:45.390" style="s2">advice on that project how to proceed</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.380" end="00:18:47.850" style="s2">and maybe what to look out for or what</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.390" end="00:18:52.710" style="s2">type of practice is in order to get the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.850" end="00:18:55.080" style="s2">skill set unlock yeah I think you know a</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.710" end="00:18:57.780" style="s2">little bit when we first talked and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.080" end="00:18:59.400" style="s2">is this notion of trying to stay away</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.780" end="00:19:02.429" style="s2">from programming you know like</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.400" end="00:19:07.730" style="s2">controlling a lot of these initiatives</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.429" end="00:19:10.470" style="s2">start with a lot of variation but then</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.730" end="00:19:14.960" style="s2">the word also this uses audience</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.470" end="00:19:17.580" style="s2">captured you start to let the popularity</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.960" end="00:19:18.990" style="s2">create a narrative arc you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.580" end="00:19:21.809" style="s2">all of a sudden you ago that&#39;s what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.990" end="00:19:23.400" style="s2">doing there&#39;s like under self-reflective</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.809" end="00:19:26.910" style="s2">now and he thinks this though is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.400" end="00:19:29.610" style="s2">and you can feel this design happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.910" end="00:19:31.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s okay I mean if if that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.610" end="00:19:33.450" style="s2">you&#39;re doing you know that&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.380" end="00:19:36.840" style="s2">more traditional broadcast journalism</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.450" end="00:19:38.940" style="s2">for example you know to go too far</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.840" end="00:19:41.190" style="s2">for one thing and to go to this for that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.940" end="00:19:43.650" style="s2">thing and it&#39;s also going to naturally</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.190" end="00:19:45.480" style="s2">happen you know you are going at some</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.650" end="00:19:51.230" style="s2">point be a strange attractor that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.480" end="00:19:51.230" style="s2">wobbles around a certain a certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.039" end="00:20:01.620" style="s2">themes or something&#39;s or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.590" end="00:20:06.529" style="s2">moving off out of that is is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.620" end="00:20:11.370" style="s2">challenging so that&#39;s one thing but also</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.529" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">understanding that I mean I&#39;m just going</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.370" end="00:20:15.870" style="s2">to be very provocative here right so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:18.750" style="s2">see that social section but also</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.870" end="00:20:21.330" style="s2">understanding that when we are in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.750" end="00:20:24.870" style="s2">business we are just part of also that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.330" end="00:20:27.960" style="s2">collective intelligence and if we look</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.870" end="00:20:30.630" style="s2">at what&#39;s happening you know in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.960" end="00:20:35.279" style="s2">the environmental crisis the political</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.630" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">crisis financial crisis there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.279" end="00:20:45.149" style="s2">chance that we are not we meaning the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:47.220" style="s2">people that you will attract or not the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.149" end="00:20:49.320" style="s2">people who are going to fix it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.220" end="00:20:52.679" style="s2">good chance that the Western world isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.320" end="00:20:55.620" style="s2">it&#39;s not our time so this is an</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.679" end="00:20:57.299" style="s2">interesting conversation to have what do</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.620" end="00:21:00.029" style="s2">you what does it feel like to be in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.299" end="00:21:03.570" style="s2">game where you&#39;re like yeah this is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.029" end="00:21:05.610" style="s2">our time this is not ours to fix this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.570" end="00:21:07.970" style="s2">not the capacity we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.610" end="00:21:11.370" style="s2">capacity the competency we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.970" end="00:21:13.860" style="s2">especially situated to fix it this time</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.370" end="00:21:16.350" style="s2">so you start to realize that all that</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.860" end="00:21:19.350" style="s2">itself is kind of malware right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.350" end="00:21:21.390" style="s2">in us that&#39;s like oh yeah you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.350" end="00:21:24.779" style="s2">gonna fix this we got this we got this</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.390" end="00:21:28.380" style="s2">world if you look at it clearly chances</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.779" end="00:21:30.590" style="s2">are we&#39;re not especially suited for it</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.380" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">this time so then the question becomes</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.590" end="00:21:38.340" style="s2">again in terms of trusting trusting the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">whole if we&#39;re not suited for that then</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.340" end="00:21:44.130" style="s2">how do we allow ourselves if you know if</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:46.110" style="s2">you go down this rabbit hole and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.130" end="00:21:47.870" style="s2">start to really feel into that and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.110" end="00:21:50.250" style="s2">said we&#39;re not really suited for that</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.870" end="00:21:52.350" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna trust that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.250" end="00:21:56.370" style="s2">marginalized cultures marginalized</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.350" end="00:21:58.020" style="s2">people Africa perhaps you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.370" end="00:22:01.559" style="s2">thirteen-year-old girls in Africa that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.020" end="00:22:03.690" style="s2">have created engines that run on pee if</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.559" end="00:22:06.030" style="s2">you watch Sugata Mitra is</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.690" end="00:22:08.429" style="s2">hole-in-the-wall school there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.030" end="00:22:09.870" style="s2">children who can&#39;t speak English who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.429" end="00:22:12.960" style="s2">never been to school and he puts a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.870" end="00:22:15.150" style="s2">computer in their village and they learn</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.960" end="00:22:18.690" style="s2">about recombinant DNA because their</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.150" end="00:22:21.030" style="s2">social structure is intact so they have</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.690" end="00:22:24.059" style="s2">all these ways of really harnessing</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.030" end="00:22:29.429" style="s2">collective intelligence it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.059" end="00:22:34.260" style="s2">that this is our our competency right</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.429" end="00:22:37.140" style="s2">now so if you entertain that as part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.260" end="00:22:39.809" style="s2">your understanding of what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.140" end="00:22:41.970" style="s2">I think that releases something it opens</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.809" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">a lot more opportunity you know it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.970" end="00:22:46.710" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re gonna go and take</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:49.169" style="s2">a camera and go into the hood in LA</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.710" end="00:22:51.809" style="s2">that&#39;s not yours to do either it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.169" end="00:22:53.100" style="s2">like this is maybe not ours to do so</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.809" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">then what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.100" end="00:22:58.770" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a leapfrog what if we</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:23:01.260" style="s2">started to do things that in that war</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.770" end="00:23:03.809" style="s2">ideas on the other side on the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.260" end="00:23:05.909" style="s2">side of the transition maybe we could</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.809" end="00:23:10.169" style="s2">bring something then so these are the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.909" end="00:23:12.299" style="s2">kinds of opportunities for understanding</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.169" end="00:23:15.960" style="s2">the time that are much broader than you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.299" end="00:23:21.990" style="s2">hear in your everyday podcast or on</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.960" end="00:23:23.520" style="s2">these channels and so so and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.990" end="00:23:27.150" style="s2">throwing out a couple of them in case</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.520" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">these these communities can can practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.150" end="00:23:32.909" style="s2">people that I spend a lot of time with</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:36.809" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.909" end="00:23:39.049" style="s2">more of that kind of questioning going</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.809" end="00:23:41.820" style="s2">on and I see a lot of people you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.049" end="00:23:44.100" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s true but I see a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.820" end="00:23:49.230" style="s2">of people going yeah the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.100" end="00:23:51.179" style="s2">maybe Western people are not suited that</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.230" end="00:23:52.950" style="s2">sits in your intuition as a very real</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.179" end="00:23:55.740" style="s2">possibility right there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.950" end="00:23:58.980" style="s2">about it I&#39;m not downing us I&#39;m not but</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.740" end="00:24:03.059" style="s2">but the collective intelligence is like</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.980" end="00:24:03.960" style="s2">the whole kit and caboodle here and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.059" end="00:24:06.690" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.960" end="00:24:11.220" style="s2">we&#39;re on social media talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.690" end="00:24:13.830" style="s2">politics is that should live in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.220" end="00:24:16.230" style="s2">much larger appreciation for the human</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.830" end="00:24:19.920" style="s2">species it could be the humans are not</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.230" end="00:24:21.990" style="s2">even you know it&#39;s not even humans time</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.920" end="00:24:26.460" style="s2">what we won&#39;t go into that you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.990" end="00:24:28.830" style="s2">could be like that but in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.460" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">collective human intelligence you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.830" end="00:24:35.910" style="s2">all of these if you if you really allow</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:38.190" style="s2">your mind to create a wider perspective</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.910" end="00:24:41.100" style="s2">like what is really going on here</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.190" end="00:24:44.580" style="s2">then you start to see there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.100" end="00:24:48.030" style="s2">space in this sense making space there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.580" end="00:24:52.920" style="s2">actually always a lot of space a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.030" end="00:24:56.310" style="s2">space to to perceive and and sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.920" end="00:25:00.150" style="s2">making is about sensing sensing and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.310" end="00:25:03.540" style="s2">feeling and getting to know this person</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.150" end="00:25:06.780" style="s2">who where is this conspiracy coming from</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.540" end="00:25:08.850" style="s2">you know what is what is what is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.780" end="00:25:10.860" style="s2">lived experience of that person and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.850" end="00:25:13.470" style="s2">oh god you know don&#39;t put that up on</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.860" end="00:25:16.290" style="s2">Facebook that&#39;s a conspiracy like like</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.470" end="00:25:18.360" style="s2">the more were triggered and vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.290" end="00:25:20.970" style="s2">to jumping down the throat of all these</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.360" end="00:25:23.390" style="s2">information the more we sanction things</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.970" end="00:25:27.020" style="s2">that actually has valuable information</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.390" end="00:25:29.340" style="s2">why does our information ecology have</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.020" end="00:25:31.830" style="s2">conspiracy theories you know Charles</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.340" end="00:25:34.170" style="s2">Eisenstein rather I think you did a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.830" end="00:25:39.000" style="s2">podcast or no wrote a long thing about</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.170" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">it so yeah they don&#39;t just get sucked</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.000" end="00:25:46.760" style="s2">into the content is sensing to the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:49.710" style="s2">rhythms and the dynamics of the broader</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.760" end="00:25:51.900" style="s2">collective intelligence ya know I love</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.710" end="00:25:53.720" style="s2">that resonates a lot that&#39;s where sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.900" end="00:25:56.760" style="s2">of the fuller and I had tension with my</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.720" end="00:25:59.100" style="s2">performative agnostic piece cuz I really</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.760" end="00:26:01.020" style="s2">I like exercising the muscle of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.100" end="00:26:02.280" style="s2">understanding someone&#39;s reality tunnel</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.020" end="00:26:04.320" style="s2">and the propositional sense so you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.280" end="00:26:05.940" style="s2">pass their ideological turning test but</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.320" end="00:26:06.810" style="s2">actually sink into the felt sense when</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.940" end="00:26:08.850" style="s2">they believe what they believe to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.810" end="00:26:10.050" style="s2">true and feel it and that way you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.850" end="00:26:11.700" style="s2">kind of really communicate with them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.050" end="00:26:15.630" style="s2">instead of just shaming them or judging</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.700" end="00:26:17.490" style="s2">them away and I have problems with on</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.630" end="00:26:23.309" style="s2">the internet with Bernie support</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.490" end="00:26:27.210" style="s2">right because I&#39;ve been called your</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.309" end="00:26:29.790" style="s2">pseudo neutral whatever non</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.210" end="00:26:31.650" style="s2">Alliance thing and it&#39;s not that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.790" end="00:26:34.140" style="s2">alive it&#39;s not that at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.650" end="00:26:36.480" style="s2">day I&#39;m not gonna I&#39;m gonna not support</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.140" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">one person or the other or make a choice</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.480" end="00:26:44.940" style="s2">it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t live inside this</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:47.190" style="s2">totalizing narrative it&#39;s not healthy</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.940" end="00:26:49.080" style="s2">for anyone that I would vote for it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.190" end="00:26:53.910" style="s2">just not healthy right</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.080" end="00:26:56.309" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s like it&#39;s like people are</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.910" end="00:26:58.350" style="s2">like only read books would have read</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.309" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">book covers don&#39;t read the blue book</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.350" end="00:27:12.750" style="s2">covers it&#39;s kind of like that silly</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:18.260" style="s2">really yeah so so even as we try to open</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.750" end="00:27:18.260" style="s2">up these spaces there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.440" end="00:27:25.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which we</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.640" end="00:27:30.720" style="s2">simultaneously close our audience&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.490" end="00:27:32.700" style="s2">and we need to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.720" end="00:27:34.140" style="s2">precariousness of that you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.700" end="00:27:41.370" style="s2">ethics for people who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.140" end="00:27:43.559" style="s2">broadcasting so yeah so there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.370" end="00:27:48.690" style="s2">of a phrase in the spiritual community</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.559" end="00:27:51.470" style="s2">that if you it&#39;s kind of a paradox for a</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.690" end="00:27:56.309" style="s2">teacher because if you make an object</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.470" end="00:27:58.980" style="s2">for the discursive mind out of the out</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.309" end="00:28:01.980" style="s2">of the teaching then the lesson becomes</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.980" end="00:28:03.900" style="s2">the poisoned hmm so how can we turn more</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.980" end="00:28:06.230" style="s2">and this is why I love your wisdom Jim</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.900" end="00:28:08.850" style="s2">it&#39;s more just pointing out instructions</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.230" end="00:28:10.620" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not these hold out if I</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.850" end="00:28:13.290" style="s2">can give you a capacity to ask a</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.620" end="00:28:16.920" style="s2">question then I don&#39;t really want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.290" end="00:28:21.140" style="s2">supply the answer right so something</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.920" end="00:28:24.660" style="s2">like that so this feeling of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.140" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">something like that yeah so I&#39;ll pivot</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.660" end="00:28:28.169" style="s2">in the question questions I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:29.820" style="s2">if you I just before I do I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.169" end="00:28:31.290" style="s2">if you saw that I won&#39;t name his name</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.820" end="00:28:34.460" style="s2">but he&#39;s a Bernie supporter</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.290" end="00:28:39.600" style="s2">sort of you know our space and he called</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.460" end="00:28:43.380" style="s2">you and I integral reactionaries so</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.600" end="00:28:46.890" style="s2">that&#39;s our that&#39;s our title penita no I</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.380" end="00:28:52.050" style="s2">mean you can see how if people don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.890" end="00:28:53.750" style="s2">it they would think you&#39;re just trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.050" end="00:28:57.150" style="s2">to surf like</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.750" end="00:29:04.110" style="s2">not non-attachment or some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.150" end="00:29:08.250" style="s2">whatever I get it I yeah I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.110" end="00:29:11.460" style="s2">it&#39;s it in that sense it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.250" end="00:29:13.050" style="s2">understandable assessment yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.460" end="00:29:15.030" style="s2">interesting how like you know rubs not</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.050" end="00:29:17.100" style="s2">reactionaries but just that title like</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.030" end="00:29:23.310" style="s2">that weaponization of that title yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.100" end="00:29:39.750" style="s2">sticks on you yeah all right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.310" end="00:29:44.270" style="s2">unsinkable the early human so rain you</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.750" end="00:29:47.310" style="s2">have a question they do my question is</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.270" end="00:29:50.430" style="s2">where does dogmatism fit in are you</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.310" end="00:29:54.630" style="s2">describing dogmatism and if not what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.430" end="00:29:56.130" style="s2">the difference yeah so I think it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.630" end="00:30:00.840" style="s2">think it is about</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.130" end="00:30:04.680" style="s2">dogmatism ideology but what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.840" end="00:30:08.700" style="s2">about are people that can spot dogmatism</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.680" end="00:30:11.820" style="s2">and ideology there&#39;s always a more</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.700" end="00:30:20.670" style="s2">subtle level this is the trick when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.820" end="00:30:24.150" style="s2">it&#39;s you get snookered by yeah it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.670" end="00:30:26.010" style="s2">a performative contradiction sub</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.150" end="00:30:27.990" style="s2">dogmatism i don&#39;t want to call it meta</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.010" end="00:30:31.160" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually like deeper right</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.990" end="00:30:34.490" style="s2">but it&#39;s a it&#39;s about first of all</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.160" end="00:30:39.540" style="s2">noticing that language and discourse and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.490" end="00:30:42.120" style="s2">inter and relating conversationally will</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.540" end="00:30:44.620" style="s2">create this right great stick it creates</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.120" end="00:30:49.180" style="s2">it and then always trying to sense where</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.620" end="00:30:54.880" style="s2">that creation is and be interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.180" end="00:30:56.950" style="s2">and you know dogmatism is okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.880" end="00:31:02.440" style="s2">people that I have strong and have</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.950" end="00:31:04.210" style="s2">strong opinions but I don&#39;t someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.440" end="00:31:06.280" style="s2">attacks them I think it&#39;s kind of funny</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.210" end="00:31:09.700" style="s2">I might play with them or I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.280" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">doubt I understand myself as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.700" end="00:31:13.540" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:20.470" style="s2">I&#39;m very parochial I see the parochial</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.540" end="00:31:28.260" style="s2">miss of my own strong opinions and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.470" end="00:31:33.040" style="s2">so and I also experience my inability to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.260" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">encounter or inhabit the strong opinions</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.040" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">of other people I have to use them you</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:43.210" style="s2">know I&#39;ve to use my my decoder ring and</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.600" end="00:31:44.620" style="s2">then I lose some signal there so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.210" end="00:31:48.570" style="s2">these these are all these are all</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.620" end="00:31:51.520" style="s2">pertain to conversational engagements</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.570" end="00:31:54.309" style="s2">more than embodied engagement so tends</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.520" end="00:31:56.980" style="s2">to be more well you wouldn&#39;t you could</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.309" end="00:31:58.750" style="s2">have a dogmatic body like someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.980" end="00:32:01.840" style="s2">teaching some kind of martial arts of</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.750" end="00:32:08.410" style="s2">movement arts and teaches more from a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.840" end="00:32:10.059" style="s2">dogmatic dogmatic kind of mind but in</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.410" end="00:32:11.559" style="s2">general I&#39;m talking when I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.059" end="00:32:13.540" style="s2">this is more like conversational you</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.559" end="00:32:17.920" style="s2">know like what we do on these podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.540" end="00:32:22.960" style="s2">and stuff yeah strong opinions loosely</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.920" end="00:32:24.760" style="s2">held which is better than a loose</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.960" end="00:32:29.770" style="s2">opinion here&#39;s the postmodern a loose</p>

<p begin="00:33:18.950" end="00:33:29.120" style="s2">long time since Magellan courses we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.010" end="00:33:32.090" style="s2">come a long way I really I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:33:32.090" end="00:33:37.040" style="s2">really fascinated by it I have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.370" end="00:33:39.169" style="s2">question about magical thinking which a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.040" end="00:33:41.450" style="s2">lot of people I&#39;ve noticed in this</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.169" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">community and other communities have</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.450" end="00:33:47.330" style="s2">expressed enormous contempt for so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:52.220" style="s2">think that&#39;s something that I would like</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.330" end="00:33:53.179" style="s2">to address because I identify with being</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.220" end="00:33:58.090" style="s2">a storyteller</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.179" end="00:34:01.549" style="s2">I come from the gay movement and in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.090" end="00:34:05.390" style="s2">other big pandemic which was the AIDS</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.549" end="00:34:11.210" style="s2">epidemic in the gay community in the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.390" end="00:34:13.490" style="s2">um we had to think magically to survive</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.210" end="00:34:15.379" style="s2">we had to create stories that were</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.490" end="00:34:18.260" style="s2">compelling we had to create stories that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.379" end="00:34:22.940" style="s2">could change stories that we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.260" end="00:34:25.580" style="s2">told so I identify as a storyteller and</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.940" end="00:34:29.260" style="s2">when I am storytelling at my best I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.580" end="00:34:33.169" style="s2">whistle blower and blowing a whistle</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.260" end="00:34:36.619" style="s2">gets attention fast it starts and</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.169" end="00:34:41.270" style="s2">finishes a game it creates good</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.619" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">boundaries and I also want to blow the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.270" end="00:34:50.090" style="s2">whistle mindfully so that I don&#39;t create</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:53.090" style="s2">false alarms so we don&#39;t have a often</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.090" end="00:34:57.560" style="s2">the circumstances that life creates for</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.090" end="00:35:00.260" style="s2">us the conditions do not we have to use</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.560" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">our imaginations in healthy ways either</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.260" end="00:35:04.609" style="s2">than destructive ways and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:08.600" style="s2">is something that you bring attention to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.609" end="00:35:11.660" style="s2">with your emphasis upon going underneath</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.600" end="00:35:14.180" style="s2">the story to the energetics</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.660" end="00:35:16.789" style="s2">but I also think it&#39;s important that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.180" end="00:35:18.770" style="s2">go beneath the story to the energetics</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.789" end="00:35:20.809" style="s2">and go back to another story</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.770" end="00:35:23.450" style="s2">that is compelling that creates momentum</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.809" end="00:35:26.510" style="s2">that grabs attention that can move us</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.450" end="00:35:28.910" style="s2">towards something different and better</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.510" end="00:35:31.339" style="s2">than there&#39;s no guarantee by the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.910" end="00:35:35.180" style="s2">this is extremely messy but I think we</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.339" end="00:35:37.119" style="s2">need to be more friendly to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.180" end="00:35:41.619" style="s2">narrative and the meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.119" end="00:35:44.140" style="s2">capacities that we all share and</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.619" end="00:35:47.089" style="s2">recognizing absolutely the path</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.140" end="00:35:48.589" style="s2">sometimes pathological stories that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.089" end="00:35:50.869" style="s2">tell so we want to tell stories that</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.589" end="00:35:53.180" style="s2">don&#39;t reach Ramat Isis I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.869" end="00:35:57.230" style="s2">this is I think one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.180" end="00:35:59.510" style="s2">is I share with you so so people do</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.230" end="00:36:02.569" style="s2">getting trapped into stores that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.510" end="00:36:04.910" style="s2">pathological and crazy making it just an</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.569" end="00:36:07.940" style="s2">impoverished thank you for this</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.910" end="00:36:13.490" style="s2">opportunity to rehearse no it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.940" end="00:36:15.559" style="s2">okay so my answer is gonna seem kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.490" end="00:36:18.260" style="s2">odd to some people don&#39;t know me but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.559" end="00:36:21.849" style="s2">feel called because you asked me to go</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.260" end="00:36:24.410" style="s2">there so in my course I teach something</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.849" end="00:36:26.779" style="s2">that toward the end of the two years</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.410" end="00:36:31.970" style="s2">called magic little reality</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.779" end="00:36:34.250" style="s2">magic reality it&#39;s a trans rational form</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.970" end="00:36:37.010" style="s2">of magical thinking all right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.250" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">why and it has a que and talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.010" end="00:36:43.430" style="s2">it&#39;s French so I mean you obviously if</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">you can name magical thinking in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.430" end="00:36:51.109" style="s2">context you&#39;re more doing magical</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:54.130" style="s2">reality a brief very brief description</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.109" end="00:36:57.819" style="s2">of it is that if you think of a matrix</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.130" end="00:37:00.260" style="s2">up here you have what is specifiable</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.819" end="00:37:06.500" style="s2">down here what you have what is not</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.260" end="00:37:09.799" style="s2">specifiable and what here you have what</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.500" end="00:37:14.119" style="s2">is true and over here you have what is</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.799" end="00:37:16.940" style="s2">real so these are kind of they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.119" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">polar opposites it&#39;s just a landscape</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.940" end="00:37:21.529" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.680" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">so what&#39;s specifiable and true are</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.529" end="00:37:30.170" style="s2">things like theories the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:33.270" style="s2">they&#39;re true not real right what is</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.170" end="00:37:40.410" style="s2">specifiable and real are certain types</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.270" end="00:37:42.690" style="s2">of stories but they&#39;re not true and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.410" end="00:37:46.410" style="s2">down here you have what is not specified</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.690" end="00:37:51.630" style="s2">and true and over here we have those are</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.410" end="00:37:53.820" style="s2">that&#39;s more like perception and over</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.630" end="00:37:56.609" style="s2">here you have what&#39;s real and not</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.820" end="00:37:59.070" style="s2">specifiable and that gets into things</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.609" end="00:38:04.080" style="s2">like Aletha cubes and stuff like that so</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.070" end="00:38:07.530" style="s2">this is a way to really understand or</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.080" end="00:38:09.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a label it&#39;s just a matrix so we</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.530" end="00:38:10.950" style="s2">can have placeholders for talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.630" end="00:38:13.050" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.950" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">I think territory that you&#39;re surfing</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.050" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">called and we call it magic reality and</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.910" end="00:38:25.770" style="s2">you get comfortable being able to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.869" end="00:38:30.210" style="s2">understand those are all parts of your</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.770" end="00:38:32.310" style="s2">experience and what&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.210" end="00:38:34.500" style="s2">they&#39;re parts of its does it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.310" end="00:38:37.730" style="s2">developmental lens because children</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.500" end="00:38:39.990" style="s2">early on have all those four areas also</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.730" end="00:38:42.410" style="s2">something more we hold it more like</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.990" end="00:38:48.080" style="s2">ontological II you know if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.410" end="00:38:53.060" style="s2">smell of it so that&#39;s the deep the deep</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.080" end="00:38:56.490" style="s2">response in terms of stories I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.060" end="00:38:59.490" style="s2">this is my opinion I&#39;ve read some of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.490" end="00:39:03.150" style="s2">your fantastic posts and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.490" end="00:39:06.119" style="s2">would agree that there are stories that</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.150" end="00:39:11.490" style="s2">we would say have narrative arcs and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.119" end="00:39:14.580" style="s2">then there are stories that say our</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.490" end="00:39:19.260" style="s2">experiences and because there we are to</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.580" end="00:39:23.430" style="s2">the particular the more universal is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.260" end="00:39:26.400" style="s2">message and I know some of your journal</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.430" end="00:39:28.260" style="s2">writings on your experience I think not</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.400" end="00:39:31.050" style="s2">in nursing homes but with hospice or</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.260" end="00:39:33.540" style="s2">something close to that always come with</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.050" end="00:39:36.359" style="s2">this kind of universal but you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.540" end="00:39:38.760" style="s2">just saying what&#39;s what your experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.359" end="00:39:40.920" style="s2">is so you could call those</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.760" end="00:39:42.330" style="s2">you know you could call that a story but</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.920" end="00:39:45.060" style="s2">this is certain kind of story</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.330" end="00:39:48.150" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have a narrative arc you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.060" end="00:39:50.369" style="s2">very good at for example you get there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.150" end="00:39:53.010" style="s2">so much beauty usually around two-thirds</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.369" end="00:39:54.450" style="s2">what when you used to write 2/3 down</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.010" end="00:39:56.670" style="s2">into your story there&#39;s so much beauty</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.450" end="00:39:59.220" style="s2">and as a reader you would think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.670" end="00:40:01.830" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking it&#39;s gonna have this</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.220" end="00:40:04.050" style="s2">conclusion and they all went out into</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.830" end="00:40:05.940" style="s2">the sunset and you never deliver that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.050" end="00:40:08.150" style="s2">because that would be inauthentic to</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.940" end="00:40:13.920" style="s2">experience so I&#39;ll always remember that</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.150" end="00:40:17.990" style="s2">that tension that&#39;s more real right then</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.920" end="00:40:21.090" style="s2">true it doesn&#39;t tell a story that way so</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.990" end="00:40:23.550" style="s2">just happy to look like that back to you</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.090" end="00:40:29.220" style="s2">nice to see you again</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.550" end="00:40:35.970" style="s2">cool Phil you had a question oh man can</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.220" end="00:40:39.810" style="s2">you okay so yeah I like this probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.970" end="00:40:42.060" style="s2">opinions loosely held and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.810" end="00:40:46.110" style="s2">wanted to one step above that in terms</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.060" end="00:40:49.230" style="s2">like a perception level like I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.110" end="00:40:50.900" style="s2">afraid right now that like I am reading</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.230" end="00:40:52.940" style="s2">a whole bunch of stuff and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.900" end="00:40:55.320" style="s2">discounting a whole bunch of other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.940" end="00:40:57.540" style="s2">are the personal level I didn&#39;t like for</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.320" end="00:40:59.820" style="s2">example everyone here on this the stoah</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.540" end="00:41:01.380" style="s2">is all like really listening to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.820" end="00:41:03.510" style="s2">certain amount of thinkers and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.380" end="00:41:07.200" style="s2">kind of getting really really deep into</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.510" end="00:41:08.730" style="s2">a few people and I&#39;m trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.200" end="00:41:11.100" style="s2">about like how important is like</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.730" end="00:41:16.560" style="s2">diversity have to be sure that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.100" end="00:41:20.850" style="s2">diverse like sense-making I guess so</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.560" end="00:41:25.170" style="s2">that we can actually create these types</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.850" end="00:41:29.790" style="s2">of understanding that includes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.170" end="00:41:32.760" style="s2">more diversity and specifically also</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.790" end="00:41:34.200" style="s2">like how do you make sure that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.760" end="00:41:38.940" style="s2">not just listening to the people with</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.200" end="00:41:44.070" style="s2">the loudest voice in terms of your sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.940" end="00:41:46.020" style="s2">making yeah I think because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.070" end="00:41:47.700" style="s2">noticed that about yourself your prop</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.020" end="00:41:51.840" style="s2">you know you&#39;re probably in good shape I</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.700" end="00:41:53.310" style="s2">mean taking a deep dive is good you</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.840" end="00:41:55.230" style="s2">start to see now there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.310" end="00:41:58.980" style="s2">actually encouraging about the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.230" end="00:42:01.470" style="s2">phase because the other than Joe Rogan I</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.980" end="00:42:04.170" style="s2">have to give it to him a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.470" end="00:42:06.359" style="s2">podcast spaces seem to have a half-life</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.170" end="00:42:08.700" style="s2">that turns quite quickly like the ivw</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.359" end="00:42:15.180" style="s2">got really boring really fast you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.700" end="00:42:16.650" style="s2">so Rueben report you know so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.180" end="00:42:20.670" style="s2">things that&#39;s good is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.650" end="00:42:25.290" style="s2">there&#39;s we tend to binge and then then</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.670" end="00:42:26.850" style="s2">this something&#39;s lost so so I&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.290" end="00:42:29.900" style="s2">that you probably have noticed it too</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.850" end="00:42:29.900" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.200" end="00:42:35.640" style="s2">you know there&#39;s so many people like</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.450" end="00:42:37.260" style="s2">really exotic characters like contra</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.640" end="00:42:41.160" style="s2">points are self</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.260" end="00:42:43.320" style="s2">but I just went like wow all of this but</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.160" end="00:42:45.300" style="s2">there&#39;s something that there&#39;s some need</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.320" end="00:42:49.400" style="s2">and then there&#39;s something that it gets</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.300" end="00:42:56.400" style="s2">exhausted it&#39;s you know you move on so</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.400" end="00:42:58.050" style="s2">so so that&#39;s really it&#39;s encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.400" end="00:43:05.250" style="s2">right I think there&#39;s something working</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.050" end="00:43:10.410" style="s2">there in terms of reading one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.250" end="00:43:11.910" style="s2">best ways to and it&#39;s hateful I just you</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.410" end="00:43:15.840" style="s2">know John is a really good writer but</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.910" end="00:43:20.550" style="s2">one of the hardest things for me is when</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.840" end="00:43:22.859" style="s2">I street a lot then I got so you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.550" end="00:43:24.900" style="s2">I&#39;m a really really fast reader it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.859" end="00:43:27.090" style="s2">ridiculous how many books I have but</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.900" end="00:43:31.380" style="s2">then I got to where I started writing</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.090" end="00:43:34.109" style="s2">for integral view and then my masters</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.380" end="00:43:36.240" style="s2">and these are the academic journals this</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.109" end="00:43:39.390" style="s2">will send you where you need to read</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.240" end="00:43:40.650" style="s2">next if you try to write because when</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.390" end="00:43:43.590" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to write you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.650" end="00:43:45.000" style="s2">really when this comes to a point where</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.590" end="00:43:47.070" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get from this spot to</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.000" end="00:43:49.590" style="s2">that thought and you realize there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.070" end="00:43:53.480" style="s2">this gap because when we hear people</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.590" end="00:43:55.950" style="s2">talk really fast and they&#39;re very good</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.480" end="00:43:57.990" style="s2">articulating like you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.950" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">things small and dark I can say I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.990" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">the stuff he&#39;s covering and it just</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:04.830" style="s2">seems like wow it&#39;s really solid if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:07.320" style="s2">start sat down and tried to write just</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.830" end="00:44:09.690" style="s2">between this sentence and the next that</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.320" end="00:44:12.420" style="s2">seems so logically one follows the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.690" end="00:44:14.550" style="s2">you&#39;ll realize is a huge gap there and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.420" end="00:44:17.820" style="s2">that you really don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.550" end="00:44:19.470" style="s2">right so now I think smiling burger</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.820" end="00:44:21.510" style="s2">knows you know if you had a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.470" end="00:44:23.010" style="s2">with him he could parse all those things</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.510" end="00:44:25.950" style="s2">that&#39;s it what I&#39;m saying but you</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.010" end="00:44:28.170" style="s2">yourself were realized that you had a</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.950" end="00:44:30.060" style="s2">conversation the whole thing seems</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.170" end="00:44:34.859" style="s2">really tidy but if you tried to write</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.060" end="00:44:38.910" style="s2">and then you start to look like the fact</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.859" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">that I right now makes me luck most me</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.910" end="00:44:43.100" style="s2">to like the things that I need to read</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:47.010" style="s2">next and they come from different places</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.100" end="00:44:49.230" style="s2">because they show what I haven&#39;t they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.010" end="00:44:51.030" style="s2">holes they&#39;re holes in my my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.230" end="00:44:58.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.030" end="00:45:00.180" style="s2">all areas that I haven&#39;t one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.200" end="00:45:03.960" style="s2">think you&#39;d like we need to sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.180" end="00:45:05.550" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing with the stoa so raven and i</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.960" end="00:45:07.440" style="s2">and a few other people we&#39;re getting a</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.550" end="00:45:09.120" style="s2">lot of people in the store from all</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:10.830" style="s2">across the political spectrum and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.120" end="00:45:12.990" style="s2">they&#39;re coming in sort like doing these</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.830" end="00:45:14.370" style="s2">QAS a sense maker nodes but i imagine</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.990" end="00:45:15.780" style="s2">like the bacon switch is gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.370" end="00:45:17.640" style="s2">eventually especially if the wisdom jim</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.780" end="00:45:19.890" style="s2">gets more robust in the questioning and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.640" end="00:45:21.690" style="s2">the coherence and what not is that it</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.890" end="00:45:23.130" style="s2">might seem like a sermon at first but it</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.690" end="00:45:25.080" style="s2">might be a reverse sermon eventually</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.130" end="00:45:33.780" style="s2">especially at the koalas are really</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.080" end="00:45:40.680" style="s2">tight also is to give people permission</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.780" end="00:45:43.680" style="s2">to bite you know like yeah give your</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.680" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">dogs permission to bite you know the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.680" end="00:45:48.540" style="s2">talks call you take your dogs to the dog</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:53.130" style="s2">park and then the fight breaks out over</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.540" end="00:45:54.930" style="s2">there they don&#39;t like they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.130" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">get into the fight you know and so we</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.930" end="00:46:02.310" style="s2">have this notion of transparent</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.640" end="00:46:05.910" style="s2">communication we yes but we need also</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.310" end="00:46:07.740" style="s2">permission to bite like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.910" end="00:46:13.200" style="s2">someone just put noble beasts in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.740" end="00:46:15.900" style="s2">chat box yes noble beasts bite no now</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.200" end="00:46:18.960" style="s2">the normal beasts don&#39;t bite no too</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.900" end="00:46:20.420" style="s2">noble tyson i&#39;m gonna take you and i</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:24.360" style="s2">think you have a statement or a question</p>

<p begin="00:46:24.360" end="00:46:28.290" style="s2">your question and Benina your response</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.040" end="00:46:29.910" style="s2">it just was bringing out from yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.290" end="00:46:32.100" style="s2">sometimes these conversations when I</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.910" end="00:46:35.670" style="s2">feel I&#39;m having insights and it feels</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.100" end="00:46:37.530" style="s2">really generative and I&#39;m excited I find</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.670" end="00:46:40.790" style="s2">myself like feeling sympathetic to those</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.530" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">that identify as lightworkers or like</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.790" end="00:46:45.750" style="s2">shaman&#39;s of indigenous tribes or people</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:46.860" style="s2">that claim the channel aliens or like</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.750" end="00:46:49.230" style="s2">experiences I&#39;ve had with young children</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.860" end="00:46:52.140" style="s2">that I&#39;ve like freestyled and made music</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.230" end="00:46:54.750" style="s2">way from there saying these ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.140" end="00:46:57.030" style="s2">it is beyond explanation when they would</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.750" end="00:47:00.630" style="s2">have got them and their parents like and</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.030" end="00:47:02.250" style="s2">so there&#39;s like this I guess there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.630" end="00:47:05.100" style="s2">part of me that&#39;s sympathetic and has</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.250" end="00:47:07.830" style="s2">this appreciation and identifies with</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.100" end="00:47:09.480" style="s2">the magician and magical thinking and at</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.830" end="00:47:11.640" style="s2">times I find myself with this curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.480" end="00:47:13.740" style="s2">of how to and I think it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.640" end="00:47:16.740" style="s2">bridging the worlds within me of like my</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.740" end="00:47:20.010" style="s2">kind they had the magical imaginary side</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.740" end="00:47:22.430" style="s2">and then the very critical intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.010" end="00:47:26.910" style="s2">side and I find myself</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.430" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">yeah just like wanting and to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.910" end="00:47:32.580" style="s2">bridge these tribes more effectively and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:34.550" style="s2">I just for the even just for the joy of</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.580" end="00:47:37.380" style="s2">seeing more of these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.550" end="00:47:39.510" style="s2">happen and seeing them go back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.380" end="00:47:42.810" style="s2">so that&#39;s for something that&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.510" end="00:47:45.870" style="s2">for me yeah so it reminds me up and John</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.810" end="00:47:47.430" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get when I first started</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.870" end="00:47:51.360" style="s2">teaching the Masters course in</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.430" end="00:47:54.540" style="s2">consciousness studies you know I had an</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.360" end="00:47:56.040" style="s2">allergy well the course has changed a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.540" end="00:47:58.380" style="s2">lot I could give a lot more people like</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.040" end="00:48:00.480" style="s2">who that&#39;s on this on this thing and at</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.380" end="00:48:06.060" style="s2">the time the school had attracted a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.480" end="00:48:08.250" style="s2">of women who had who&#39;s you know recently</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.060" end="00:48:14.160" style="s2">divorced women whose children are grown</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.250" end="00:48:21.210" style="s2">up we&#39;re taking a lot of yoga and kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:23.700" style="s2">of New Age like New Age thinking I do</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.210" end="00:48:25.800" style="s2">you know what I do my work it can be</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.700" end="00:48:27.420" style="s2">very academic it took me a long time to</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.800" end="00:48:31.080" style="s2">get a degree because I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.420" end="00:48:34.200" style="s2">academics themselves but and so I had an</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.080" end="00:48:39.270" style="s2">allergy to a lot of New Age thinking you</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.200" end="00:48:43.010" style="s2">know and but then something happened and</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.270" end="00:48:46.230" style="s2">the quality of person was changing like</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.010" end="00:48:48.210" style="s2">and I noticed that another is on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.230" end="00:48:52.500" style="s2">other side that I was actually not</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.210" end="00:48:53.700" style="s2">letting in some you know people come to</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.500" end="00:48:56.010" style="s2">the course they don&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.700" end="00:48:58.910" style="s2">language you know mostly I help them get</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.010" end="00:49:02.190" style="s2">language for making these distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.910" end="00:49:06.420" style="s2">so and we still get some people need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.190" end="00:49:10.080" style="s2">be disabused of their faulty thinking or</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.420" end="00:49:11.730" style="s2">loose you know sloppy thinking but</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.080" end="00:49:15.090" style="s2">something started to switch and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.730" end="00:49:17.950" style="s2">started to switch because again the kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.090" end="00:49:20.500" style="s2">of irritation I had was different my</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.950" end="00:49:21.220" style="s2">I was overreacting and was like really</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.500" end="00:49:24.520" style="s2">bothering me</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.220" end="00:49:27.190" style="s2">and I and and so I pay attention cuz</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.520" end="00:49:29.950" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know all of a sudden I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.190" end="00:49:31.450" style="s2">really bothered it was because I had to</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.950" end="00:49:33.760" style="s2">really examine that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.450" end="00:49:37.920" style="s2">something&#39;s changed and what was changed</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.760" end="00:49:41.290" style="s2">was actually an opportunity to notice</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.920" end="00:49:43.470" style="s2">that what was what was they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.290" end="00:49:45.910" style="s2">communicate wasn&#39;t what I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.470" end="00:49:47.740" style="s2">that&#39;s worth actually the magically I</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.910" end="00:49:49.960" style="s2">would say came in it came in my</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.740" end="00:49:52.150" style="s2">imagination during this two years where</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.960" end="00:49:54.220" style="s2">I&#39;m like what is like what is going on</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.150" end="00:49:56.920" style="s2">and then when I put it up people</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.220" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">completely could surf the notion that a</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.920" end="00:50:01.240" style="s2">theory was true but not real and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:06.690" style="s2">thought oh my god this these people have</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.240" end="00:50:06.690" style="s2">metacognition and cognitive skills that</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.750" end="00:50:11.589" style="s2">developmental stage theory says they</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:14.980" style="s2">don&#39;t they&#39;re just not articulate you</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.589" end="00:50:17.410" style="s2">know so it&#39;s all about noticing noticing</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.980" end="00:50:22.810" style="s2">what&#39;s in the child noticing and</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.410" end="00:50:25.210" style="s2">noticing a different way and and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.810" end="00:50:27.880" style="s2">being the you know and bridging that</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.210" end="00:50:32.020" style="s2">into a wisdom skill because the child</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.880" end="00:50:34.750" style="s2">can&#39;t then you know notice themselves</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.020" end="00:50:36.940" style="s2">and then you start to see oh my god and</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.750" end="00:50:39.849" style="s2">I started to realize that the role of</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.940" end="00:50:43.480" style="s2">the teacher in this kind of space is</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.849" end="00:50:45.609" style="s2">only to listen and notice when something</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.480" end="00:50:48.970" style="s2">brilliant is trying and then reflect</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.609" end="00:50:50.530" style="s2">that back that&#39;s all so that&#39;s all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.970" end="00:50:52.810" style="s2">actually and then the rest is just blah</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.530" end="00:50:56.140" style="s2">blah oh I have to do content and we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.810" end="00:50:58.180" style="s2">funds oh and people will say there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.140" end="00:51:00.819" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of students students of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.180" end="00:51:02.230" style="s2">mine here and they can confirm this</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.819" end="00:51:03.420" style="s2">sometimes people will be trying to work</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.230" end="00:51:06.760" style="s2">something out and they&#39;ll say something</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.420" end="00:51:08.740" style="s2">and they&#39;ll just keep going I&#39;m like no</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.760" end="00:51:09.730" style="s2">no what did you just say just like you</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.740" end="00:51:12.849" style="s2">said with the kids</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.730" end="00:51:15.550" style="s2">that&#39;s a brilliant insight and we just</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.849" end="00:51:19.180" style="s2">stop and say what you just said just</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.550" end="00:51:21.550" style="s2">slow down like that is a huge insight</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.180" end="00:51:24.369" style="s2">let&#39;s suspend some time with that so you</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.550" end="00:51:27.540" style="s2">start to it&#39;s very I call it Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.369" end="00:51:31.450" style="s2">with words you start to see all these</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.540" end="00:51:33.610" style="s2">these gifts start percolating months ago</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.450" end="00:51:35.740" style="s2">or it gets tight then it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.610" end="00:51:36.370" style="s2">amazing but yeah I think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.740" end="00:51:39.130" style="s2">you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.370" end="00:51:41.740" style="s2">like like read and all this stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.130" end="00:51:45.970" style="s2">then notice what to notice when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.740" end="00:51:48.820" style="s2">start to notice whoa right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.970" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">a big part that never makes it into the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.820" end="00:51:54.940" style="s2">information ecology it&#39;s the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:58.030" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not broadly understood but</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.940" end="00:52:02.080" style="s2">it&#39;s precisely seen right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.030" end="00:52:04.540" style="s2">beautiful thank you great so this would</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.080" end="00:52:06.480" style="s2">probably be our last question maybe gray</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.540" end="00:52:10.020" style="s2">you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.480" end="00:52:12.940" style="s2">um yeah one of the things that I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.020" end="00:52:15.220" style="s2">creates a lot of like murkiness in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.940" end="00:52:18.300" style="s2">information ecology is our broad</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.220" end="00:52:21.630" style="s2">understanding of emotionality as like</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.300" end="00:52:23.920" style="s2">these things that were kind of passively</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.630" end="00:52:26.350" style="s2">surrendering to that are triggered by</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.920" end="00:52:28.690" style="s2">circumstances and we have to defend that</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.350" end="00:52:30.790" style="s2">they are reasonably and justifiably</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.690" end="00:52:33.430" style="s2">triggered by those circumstances and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.790" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">think that that kind of broad</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.430" end="00:52:38.170" style="s2">understanding and all of that more</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:41.650" style="s2">precise stuff that glosses over creates</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.170" end="00:52:44.410" style="s2">a lot of the identitarian issues that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.650" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">run into with like reading their mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.410" end="00:52:48.070" style="s2">status so I just wondered if you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:50.650" style="s2">talk to like what kind of group norms we</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.070" end="00:52:54.340" style="s2">could set to like bring that mirror</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.650" end="00:52:56.020" style="s2">energy into a spaces so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.340" end="00:52:59.260" style="s2">start to understand our emotions better</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.020" end="00:53:01.170" style="s2">and like see them as like opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.260" end="00:53:03.700" style="s2">to communicate with ourselves instead of</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.170" end="00:53:06.940" style="s2">things where helplessly like</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.700" end="00:53:14.680" style="s2">circumstantially is suffering yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.940" end="00:53:17.020" style="s2">a very good question the playground</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.680" end="00:53:23.350" style="s2">again it&#39;s about making distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.020" end="00:53:26.980" style="s2">based on emotion is a bodily sensation</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.350" end="00:53:30.670" style="s2">plus a story so what you want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.980" end="00:53:33.520" style="s2">lose the story and process the live</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.670" end="00:53:36.940" style="s2">lived experience of the body it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.520" end="00:53:38.590" style="s2">hard cuz then you start to realize like</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.940" end="00:53:40.420" style="s2">you actually want the drama and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.590" end="00:53:42.099" style="s2">story so then you have to come to terms</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.420" end="00:53:44.200" style="s2">with that right</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.099" end="00:53:47.170" style="s2">now there&#39;s a fun way to get around that</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.200" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">because you know sometimes here in like</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.170" end="00:53:52.450" style="s2">a bar you&#39;re in a social situation and</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:54.160" style="s2">your allies you&#39;re actually playing with</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.450" end="00:53:56.259" style="s2">the drama and the sky it&#39;s things we</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.160" end="00:53:59.440" style="s2">like to do but if it&#39;s a crucial moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.259" end="00:54:01.630" style="s2">and you&#39;re suffering you&#39;ll still see</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:03.789" style="s2">that you&#39;re actually attached to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.630" end="00:54:05.890" style="s2">story that makes you suffer to think and</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.789" end="00:54:09.160" style="s2">then you start to say what is it about</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.890" end="00:54:11.229" style="s2">the story or maybe you&#39;re addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.160" end="00:54:14.259" style="s2">the way your body feels or something and</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.229" end="00:54:16.960" style="s2">you start to realize the microstates of</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.259" end="00:54:20.769" style="s2">how the story&#39;s attached and becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.960" end="00:54:24.339" style="s2">emotion and so the more you can work</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.769" end="00:54:28.539" style="s2">with it just like what your body&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.339" end="00:54:29.319" style="s2">and effects which are you know what your</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.539" end="00:54:30.849" style="s2">body&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.319" end="00:54:32.890" style="s2">they&#39;re like everything else they come</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.849" end="00:54:35.200" style="s2">and go and they take the time they take</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.890" end="00:54:38.799" style="s2">and so well they&#39;re here they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:41.170" style="s2">honored but you know and when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.799" end="00:54:45.700" style="s2">gone you know they need to be released</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.170" end="00:54:47.739" style="s2">and yeah so just try to be and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.700" end="00:54:50.640" style="s2">about it you might check out the video</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.739" end="00:54:54.069" style="s2">because we talked about how there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.640" end="00:54:57.190" style="s2">Care is an expanded form of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.069" end="00:54:59.049" style="s2">and the contracted form is panic when</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.190" end="00:55:01.210" style="s2">you&#39;re afraid to lose what you care for</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.049" end="00:55:04.119" style="s2">and you start to see your energy</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.210" end="00:55:07.119" style="s2">signature a little toggle between Karen</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.119" end="00:55:09.609" style="s2">panic play and anger and seeking</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.119" end="00:55:11.769" style="s2">curiosity and fear and you start to see</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.609" end="00:55:14.799" style="s2">really that other than lost which we</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.769" end="00:55:17.319" style="s2">want to get to next time there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.799" end="00:55:19.329" style="s2">all you&#39;re really working with and</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.319" end="00:55:21.819" style="s2">everything else is because we like the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.329" end="00:55:23.859" style="s2">story you know we like to play the story</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.819" end="00:55:26.319" style="s2">it&#39;s a good thing it&#39;s a bad thing it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.859" end="00:55:31.269" style="s2">what it is that&#39;s a good question thank</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.319" end="00:55:32.950" style="s2">you very cool so that brings us almost</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.269" end="00:55:34.509" style="s2">of the hour banette did you have any</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.950" end="00:55:39.609" style="s2">closing thoughts you&#39;d like to leave us</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.509" end="00:55:41.440" style="s2">with no I mean these were all really</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.609" end="00:55:44.289" style="s2">good questions it&#39;s a it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.440" end="00:55:46.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more that obviously I&#39;m</p>
