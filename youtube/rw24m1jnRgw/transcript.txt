I'm here in the UK at Penguin which I love because
 I think Penguin is the best publisher in the world
 and England is the center of the English language.
 And that's quite a bit because
 England has brought a tradition to the world
 of truth-finding and clarification
 and illuminated it in various ways
 and I hope this book
 that takes English tradition a step further
 as befits a good settler.
 So
 I hope you read it
 and I hope it helps put your life in order.
 I think people like the things I've said
 very helpful in that area
 and I have tried to clear them
 and expand with this book
 to deepen them.
 So hopefully you will find out when you read it.
