<p begin="00:02:35.180" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">be really dumb because these systems are</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.800" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">all designed so badly I mean everything</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.230" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">because you know I there&#39;s only child</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.570" end="00:07:56.420" style="s2">who you know became this weird</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:57.860" style="s2">antisocial person because I just wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.420" end="00:07:59.720" style="s2">impressed with society and spent a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.860" end="00:08:01.220" style="s2">of time on the computers and there was</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.720" end="00:08:03.169" style="s2">none like me at that time you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.220" end="00:08:05.570" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of these kids nowadays we</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.169" end="00:08:07.220" style="s2">have each other at least it could be hit</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.570" end="00:08:11.840" style="s2">I searched at least be antisocial</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.220" end="00:08:13.220" style="s2">socially you know but so anyway it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.840" end="00:08:16.900" style="s2">just a very interesting version of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.220" end="00:08:19.700" style="s2">world but did well pop and career when I</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.900" end="00:08:20.990" style="s2">couldn&#39;t maintain them eventually moved</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.700" end="00:08:22.910" style="s2">out to New Mexico where I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.990" end="00:08:27.050" style="s2">could be just get away from people more</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.910" end="00:08:28.820" style="s2">and and I just you know had to find a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.050" end="00:08:31.040" style="s2">way to make money there and found the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.820" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">very easiest way to turn on a system and</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.040" end="00:08:33.410" style="s2">have money just roll into my bank</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:35.840" style="s2">account which was multilevel marketing</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.410" end="00:08:37.370" style="s2">software development so I helped people</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.840" end="00:08:39.229" style="s2">launch these multi-level marketing</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.370" end="00:08:42.200" style="s2">companies that turned out to be very</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.229" end="00:08:44.270" style="s2">lucrative and what it&#39;s a it&#39;s a game a</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.200" end="00:08:46.070" style="s2">win right the easiest possible way to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.270" end="00:08:47.300" style="s2">just siphon in money from all the flows</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.070" end="00:08:51.350" style="s2">and just have it come into my bank</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.300" end="00:08:52.550" style="s2">account and so I got to be powerful in</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.350" end="00:08:56.570" style="s2">the world and experience what that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.550" end="00:08:57.980" style="s2">like with money and realized that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.570" end="00:08:59.650" style="s2">wasn&#39;t actually the answer to happiness</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.980" end="00:09:05.330" style="s2">or anything it&#39;s worse at this time</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.650" end="00:09:07.340" style="s2">and I met a woman and we when the money</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.330" end="00:09:08.690" style="s2">started running out she ran out but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.340" end="00:09:12.380" style="s2">think the day we signed her divorce</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.690" end="00:09:14.690" style="s2">papers we probably also conceived their</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.380" end="00:09:18.440" style="s2">first daughter so it&#39;s kind of how that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.690" end="00:09:19.940" style="s2">way to more over the span of about ten</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.440" end="00:09:22.040" style="s2">years so I have three daughters now and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.940" end="00:09:26.270" style="s2">as I was moving into this but nothing</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.040" end="00:09:29.090" style="s2">was permanent with her and as I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.270" end="00:09:32.750" style="s2">moving into fatherhood in these things</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.090" end="00:09:33.890" style="s2">and as the relationship was falling</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.750" end="00:09:36.770" style="s2">apart I&#39;m realizing money&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.890" end="00:09:38.060" style="s2">answer and I&#39;m realizing things are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.770" end="00:09:39.350" style="s2">what I thought I had the world figured</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.060" end="00:09:40.940" style="s2">out and apparently I know right right</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.350" end="00:09:44.450" style="s2">about that time Ron Paul was running for</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.940" end="00:09:45.650" style="s2">president in 2007 and he was talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.450" end="00:09:47.750" style="s2">about the money system in the Federal</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.650" end="00:09:49.430" style="s2">Reserve and how we can do everything we</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.750" end="00:09:50.930" style="s2">want with you know electing different</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.430" end="00:09:52.520" style="s2">politicians to office but if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.930" end="00:09:54.650" style="s2">actually look at the underlying power</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.520" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">structure that fuels this whole machine</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.650" end="00:10:01.490" style="s2">and so I went down the rabbit hole you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:03.890" style="s2">know and ended up starting a radio</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.490" end="00:10:05.810" style="s2">station online radio station and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.890" end="00:10:08.930" style="s2">organizing a March and about 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.810" end="00:10:11.810" style="s2">people showed up in Washington DC and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.930" end="00:10:13.160" style="s2">marched from Washington Monument down to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.810" end="00:10:15.860" style="s2">the Capitol lawn where we rallied all</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.160" end="00:10:18.140" style="s2">day and had a great time Ron Paul spoke</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.860" end="00:10:20.870" style="s2">and Amy wolf spoke and so another win</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.140" end="00:10:22.130" style="s2">felt like a huge win this is we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.870" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">change the world the revolution has</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.130" end="00:10:26.630" style="s2">begun no is just a drop in the bucket</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:29.720" style="s2">nobody actually cared that end dozen</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.630" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">people showed up in DC it&#39;s like another</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.720" end="00:10:35.470" style="s2">eye-opening discovery process so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:39.020" style="s2">started going more internal around</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.470" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">2009-10 let go some of the anger realize</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.020" end="00:10:42.830" style="s2">that changing the world happens by</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:44.270" style="s2">changing myself eventually over the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.830" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">years doing some more transformational</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.270" end="00:10:47.780" style="s2">work being taking full responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:48.980" style="s2">for everything in my reality including</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.780" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">all the things that was angry about</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.980" end="00:10:53.600" style="s2">recognizing the oneness of all things</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:55.430" style="s2">recognizing the things I&#39;m angry about</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:10:57.500" style="s2">and other people are just the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.430" end="00:11:00.500" style="s2">parts of myself and all that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.500" end="00:11:02.360" style="s2">work and really getting into what it</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.500" end="00:11:04.730" style="s2">takes to be an intentional community and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.360" end="00:11:07.340" style="s2">what it takes that actually get along to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.730" end="00:11:09.110" style="s2">do work together in the world started</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.340" end="00:11:10.280" style="s2">really taking an analytical look so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.110" end="00:11:12.350" style="s2">learning in other words I&#39;m learning to</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.280" end="00:11:13.340" style="s2">be social from a very engineering</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.350" end="00:11:16.120" style="s2">standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.340" end="00:11:18.530" style="s2">you could say learning to be human right</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.120" end="00:11:20.450" style="s2">you know capital might own emotionals</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.530" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">and emotions and feel of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.450" end="00:11:23.990" style="s2">emotions and actually relate and things</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:26.420" style="s2">like this and so you know as you as we</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.990" end="00:11:28.190" style="s2">speak today I&#39;m 15 years into even</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.420" end="00:11:30.170" style="s2">beginning this so I&#39;m like I&#39;m like a 15</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.190" end="00:11:34.730" style="s2">year old and it&#39;s social sense in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.170" end="00:11:36.650" style="s2">of ways and like so that&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.730" end="00:11:38.540" style="s2">interesting part is that you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.650" end="00:11:41.660" style="s2">proposing solutions for people but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.540" end="00:11:45.230" style="s2">not actually like a people person but</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.660" end="00:11:47.990" style="s2">you know it like but I want to be and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.230" end="00:11:51.020" style="s2">feels good to be it&#39;s just I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.990" end="00:11:53.120" style="s2">really behind most people&#39;s development</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.020" end="00:11:54.680" style="s2">and understanding complex social</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:11:56.870" style="s2">patterns but as I do learn a my day I</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.680" end="00:11:59.030" style="s2">write write about them and I look I put</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.870" end="00:12:00.710" style="s2">them you know I identify the power</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.030" end="00:12:02.180" style="s2">especially the power and money struggles</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.710" end="00:12:03.950" style="s2">that people have and how we can avoid</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.180" end="00:12:09.860" style="s2">those things that&#39;s really what spurred</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.950" end="00:12:12.380" style="s2">me on to all this work so eventually I</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.860" end="00:12:13.550" style="s2">Furion came along in 2016 I started</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.380" end="00:12:14.900" style="s2">playing with that and I really was</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.550" end="00:12:19.150" style="s2">excited that this could be the answer</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.900" end="00:12:21.170" style="s2">I&#39;ve been looking for you know and</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.150" end="00:12:23.840" style="s2">started right is lodging some smart</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.170" end="00:12:25.370" style="s2">contracts and noticed that we had the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.840" end="00:12:26.990" style="s2">scalability issues right away it took me</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.370" end="00:12:29.030" style="s2">like a month to actually get a full node</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.990" end="00:12:30.740" style="s2">running to download the whole etherion</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.030" end="00:12:32.180" style="s2">blockchain because not only do you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.740" end="00:12:34.070" style="s2">to download the whole ledger you also</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.180" end="00:12:35.300" style="s2">have to execute every smart contract</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.070" end="00:12:37.820" style="s2">transaction that happened since the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.300" end="00:12:39.380" style="s2">inception of the blockchain so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.820" end="00:12:41.300" style="s2">really slow process to run a full node</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.380" end="00:12:43.850" style="s2">and that was four years ago I can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.300" end="00:12:45.440" style="s2">imagine what it is now and so and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.850" end="00:12:47.840" style="s2">the coding language solidity was just</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.440" end="00:12:50.180" style="s2">kind of clunky and old-fashioned and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.840" end="00:12:52.520" style="s2">just you know just not I knew this was</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.180" end="00:12:55.610" style="s2">not the way and so looked around and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.520" end="00:12:57.140" style="s2">found holo chain and I said this this I</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.610" end="00:12:58.610" style="s2">can build on this this is what I need</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.140" end="00:13:00.530" style="s2">whatever these guys are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.610" end="00:13:03.110" style="s2">and I mean no yet so I got on a call</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.530" end="00:13:05.540" style="s2">with art-rock and some other people and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.110" end="00:13:08.540" style="s2">they ultimately invited me to come to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.540" end="00:13:12.350" style="s2">their summer house program running in</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.540" end="00:13:14.300" style="s2">San Francisco I had my kids I had them</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.350" end="00:13:17.930" style="s2">half a year six months on six months off</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.300" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">so I my final six months I was actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.930" end="00:13:23.110" style="s2">living we were living in the desert near</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:24.490" style="s2">Palm Springs mostly outdoors and</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.490" end="00:13:28.899" style="s2">money I had been on a subconscious about</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.220" end="00:13:31.240" style="s2">poverty for about ten years apparently</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.899" end="00:13:32.649" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t know like I was angry about</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.240" end="00:13:33.820" style="s2">everything and didn&#39;t want money and</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.649" end="00:13:35.290" style="s2">didn&#39;t wanna be part of any of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.820" end="00:13:37.450" style="s2">anybody I had three daughters to raise</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.290" end="00:13:39.220" style="s2">and I was finding community and but</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.450" end="00:13:41.520" style="s2">anyhow I just came the state came that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.220" end="00:13:44.320" style="s2">we were we were living that way and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.520" end="00:13:46.120" style="s2">realized I had everything I need I kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.320" end="00:13:49.570" style="s2">of came to peace for the first time with</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.120" end="00:13:51.550" style="s2">money like where I wasn&#39;t trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.570" end="00:13:53.800" style="s2">lots of it and I wasn&#39;t angry about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.550" end="00:13:56.620" style="s2">whole system and just kind of was in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.800" end="00:13:57.790" style="s2">new state of release and they went back</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.620" end="00:13:59.500" style="s2">with their mom shortly thereafter I</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.790" end="00:14:01.300" style="s2">joined the whole attain team they</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.500" end="00:14:02.770" style="s2">ultimately invited me to join the core</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.300" end="00:14:04.899" style="s2">dev team and go with them to Europe to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.770" end="00:14:08.529" style="s2">launch the ICL they needed kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.899" end="00:14:10.540" style="s2">hack squad of people that were just</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.529" end="00:14:12.970" style="s2">willing to throw everything into this</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.540" end="00:14:14.529" style="s2">project and I certainly in that and was</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.970" end="00:14:17.140" style="s2">super honored to have that opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.529" end="00:14:19.839" style="s2">and yeah within six months of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.140" end="00:14:22.779" style="s2">moment of peace with money um you know I</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.839" end="00:14:25.720" style="s2">could be ICL when I looked at my net</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.779" end="00:14:28.990" style="s2">worth on papers is amazing how quickly</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.720" end="00:14:30.700" style="s2">like just the release of knack on that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.990" end="00:14:32.620" style="s2">story where as soon as you release and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.700" end="00:14:35.230" style="s2">you fully be exist in a state of</p>

<p begin="00:14:44.860" end="00:14:48.700" style="s2">it and then have the University thank</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.700" end="00:14:54.760" style="s2">abundance to flow so that&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.060" end="00:14:57.970" style="s2">key to what what I&#39;m what&#39;s motivating</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.760" end="00:15:00.220" style="s2">me at a core factor of leaving this</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.970" end="00:15:03.310" style="s2">opportunity because I certainly you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.220" end="00:15:06.100" style="s2">dance this line if I don&#39;t want more for</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.310" end="00:15:09.850" style="s2">myself than anybody else has and yet I</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.100" end="00:15:12.760" style="s2">recognize the need for people people to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.850" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">have a a game field of playing on which</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.760" end="00:15:17.290" style="s2">the more they can help other people the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.560" end="00:15:19.209" style="s2">more they can win the game right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.290" end="00:15:20.920" style="s2">like you know equality doesn&#39;t work but</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.209" end="00:15:22.420" style="s2">equal opportunity does kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.920" end="00:15:23.620" style="s2">right and if we can create equal</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.420" end="00:15:25.240" style="s2">opportunity percent everybody to find</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.620" end="00:15:27.070" style="s2">their passion their joy and contribute</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.240" end="00:15:29.110" style="s2">to the world in the way then everybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.070" end="00:15:31.660" style="s2">should have opportunity to the more you</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.110" end="00:15:33.759" style="s2">can help other people the more you win</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.660" end="00:15:38.739" style="s2">the game and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.759" end="00:15:41.949" style="s2">yeah that leads me to a pasta men</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.739" end="00:15:44.709" style="s2">retreat I did over the over the new</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.949" end="00:15:46.419" style="s2">decade over Chrisman days of entering</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.709" end="00:15:49.649" style="s2">the new decade where was just a whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.419" end="00:15:52.899" style="s2">new level of transformation for me and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.649" end="00:15:55.660" style="s2">personally knowing when you up a piece</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.899" end="00:15:58.600" style="s2">that I had never ever experienced before</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.660" end="00:16:00.369" style="s2">nothing remotely like it and being</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.600" end="00:16:03.819" style="s2">actually held in loving kindness was</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.369" end="00:16:05.499" style="s2">that something familiar in my life</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.819" end="00:16:07.709" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen in a young age didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.499" end="00:16:11.499" style="s2">really ever happen because of that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.709" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">anyway so so yeah it&#39;s like you know I</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.499" end="00:16:14.980" style="s2">can only dirty out loud is part of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:15.970" style="s2">I&#39;m offering to the world and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.980" end="00:16:19.149" style="s2">just fine with me</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.970" end="00:16:22.230" style="s2">is it very but as a very personal you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.149" end="00:16:24.819" style="s2">know very deeply personal thing that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.230" end="00:16:26.470" style="s2">moving through interpersonally and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.819" end="00:16:28.689" style="s2">feel like the species is moving through</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.470" end="00:16:30.819" style="s2">as well and I&#39;m just you know one little</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.689" end="00:16:33.879" style="s2">chart of the out of the mirror that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.819" end="00:16:37.209" style="s2">all hope to each other and so here we</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.879" end="00:16:39.939" style="s2">are I wrote that article and then named</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.209" end="00:16:42.759" style="s2">my work protocol that love because</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.939" end="00:16:44.049" style="s2">ultimately you know you got yes from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.759" end="00:16:45.579" style="s2">article that there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.049" end="00:16:48.669" style="s2">dichotomy between loving control is</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.579" end="00:16:50.470" style="s2">really the fundamental pattern that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.669" end="00:16:53.259" style="s2">been I&#39;ve been fighting against control</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.470" end="00:16:53.799" style="s2">and in doing so trying to control my</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.259" end="00:16:58.839" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.799" end="00:17:02.319" style="s2">so really fighting against those who</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.839" end="00:17:03.999" style="s2">would want to have control that&#39;s my own</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.319" end="00:17:05.829" style="s2">version of trying to have control and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.999" end="00:17:09.750" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s some weird dichotomy in</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.829" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">there but some weird some weird way of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.750" end="00:17:18.159" style="s2">letting wall paradox some weird paradox</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">what that is but anyway so yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.159" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">really exciting to meet you because</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.020" end="00:17:25.530" style="s2">it seems like a lot of whatever however</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.910" end="00:17:28.550" style="s2">you got there which I&#39;d love to get more</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.530" end="00:17:33.330" style="s2">about you&#39;d like a very compatible</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.550" end="00:17:37.320" style="s2">vision and alignment and no protocol not</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.330" end="00:17:38.970" style="s2">love is a technical protocol at least in</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.320" end="00:17:40.650" style="s2">terms of where I&#39;ve put my work it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.970" end="00:17:42.720" style="s2">technical at the digital protocol</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.650" end="00:17:44.460" style="s2">specification I&#39;ve also done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:46.440" style="s2">work over the years and what&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.460" end="00:17:47.700" style="s2">much my specialty but which is super</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.440" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">important is the actual human</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.700" end="00:17:53.070" style="s2">interaction of protocol part you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:55.260" style="s2">really really bringing in perhaps more</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.070" end="00:17:56.580" style="s2">more you know feminine energy around</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.260" end="00:18:01.170" style="s2">that part of the work as we&#39;re team</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.580" end="00:18:02.970" style="s2">building is exciting to me and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.170" end="00:18:05.910" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole thing so it was great</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.970" end="00:18:08.370" style="s2">to pop in the game be and see going on</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.910" end="00:18:10.230" style="s2">and the level of conversation and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.370" end="00:18:11.580" style="s2">then just kind of the the energy the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.230" end="00:18:13.370" style="s2">interaction you guys are having and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.580" end="00:18:16.380" style="s2">transparency you choose to have is all</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.370" end="00:18:18.900" style="s2">really really exciting thank you for all</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.380" end="00:18:21.030" style="s2">that and thank you for holding space for</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.900" end="00:18:23.760" style="s2">me to wander my way in there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.030" end="00:18:30.150" style="s2">absolutely happy that you were able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.760" end="00:18:31.680" style="s2">come Saturday right yeah there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.150" end="00:18:33.390" style="s2">that we have that&#39;s definitely in</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.680" end="00:18:35.670" style="s2">alignment even listen to your story it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.390" end="00:18:38.250" style="s2">funny the parallels that are both and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.670" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">this paradox and dichotomy I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.250" end="00:18:41.610" style="s2">that&#39;s basically my life like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">holding both sides of the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.610" end="00:18:45.360" style="s2">holding the paradox holding the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:46.650" style="s2">dichotomy and see because you can hold</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:48.390" style="s2">both of the dichotomy everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.650" end="00:18:51.090" style="s2">one or the other and I&#39;m like I&#39;m either</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.390" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">end o both end</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.090" end="00:18:56.520" style="s2">I mean your childhood talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:18:58.500" style="s2">you could see systems and they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.520" end="00:18:59.610" style="s2">so they must be dumb I actually came to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.500" end="00:19:01.830" style="s2">the opposite conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.610" end="00:19:04.470" style="s2">I could see systems and like how</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.830" end="00:19:06.360" style="s2">ridiculous this is but I must not</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.470" end="00:19:09.210" style="s2">understand it like I need morning for me</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.360" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">yeah yeah hasn&#39;t quite make sense and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.210" end="00:19:14.190" style="s2">then it didn&#39;t it took me into probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:16.890" style="s2">my 30s uh-huh it was like gradual like</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.190" end="00:19:18.180" style="s2">Christianity falling away was like oh my</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.890" end="00:19:19.230" style="s2">parents and the clergy you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.180" end="00:19:21.630" style="s2">actually know what the they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.230" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">talking about and even then like getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.630" end="00:19:25.170" style="s2">into science and logic and then like</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:28.050" style="s2">actually science and logic doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.170" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">what the markets about and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.050" end="00:19:33.030" style="s2">getting there of like okay now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:34.630" style="s2">have complied didn&#39;t and still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.030" end="00:19:36.580" style="s2">have complete confidence that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.630" end="00:19:39.880" style="s2">everything I need to know and at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.580" end="00:19:41.740" style="s2">same time like once because I got I had</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.880" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">to I first needed knowledge then I got</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.740" end="00:19:44.560" style="s2">to the point where I couldn&#39;t put in new</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:47.380" style="s2">information and I realized how</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.560" end="00:19:49.960" style="s2">intelligent I was at the same time as</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.380" end="00:19:52.390" style="s2">realizing how unintelligent the world is</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.960" end="00:19:53.980" style="s2">like individuals are intelligent but</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.390" end="00:19:55.270" style="s2">collectively it&#39;s like we give our power</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.980" end="00:19:56.650" style="s2">up to governments they don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.270" end="00:19:59.680" style="s2">going on any more than my parents did</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.650" end="00:20:01.330" style="s2">when I was kid like this visit and like</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.680" end="00:20:02.950" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t actually matter how much I</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.330" end="00:20:06.040" style="s2">know is I&#39;m just gonna be more miserable</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.950" end="00:20:09.160" style="s2">in my knowledge rather it&#39;s about like</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.040" end="00:20:11.110" style="s2">how like there&#39;s even if I knew all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.160" end="00:20:13.180" style="s2">human knowledge if the person I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.110" end="00:20:15.880" style="s2">talking to doesn&#39;t it&#39;s actually not</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.180" end="00:20:17.230" style="s2">helpful like it&#39;s it just makes me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.880" end="00:20:19.780" style="s2">like do your research well what does</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.230" end="00:20:23.140" style="s2">that mean what does that actually what</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.780" end="00:20:25.450" style="s2">Ken so I came to a lot of my stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.140" end="00:20:27.670" style="s2">then your technology background opposite</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.450" end="00:20:30.760" style="s2">spare don&#39;t technology doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.670" end="00:20:34.090" style="s2">sense to me but I can see the potential</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.760" end="00:20:35.980" style="s2">in the systems of Technology and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.090" end="00:20:38.380" style="s2">we&#39;re very much as human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.980" end="00:20:40.390" style="s2">individuals our purpose on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.380" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">is a combination of what we&#39;re amazing</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.390" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">at that we don&#39;t even know how amazing</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:47.200" style="s2">we&#39;re at it because it&#39;s a it&#39;s easy for</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">us and what is hard for us that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.200" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">for everyone else and so it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:53.530" style="s2">combination of like like you&#39;re here to</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:54.910" style="s2">connect people but you have trouble with</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.530" end="00:20:57.250" style="s2">people right I&#39;m here to like actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.910" end="00:20:59.020" style="s2">create technology that&#39;s usable when I</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.250" end="00:21:00.700" style="s2">don&#39;t I only just got a discord</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.020" end="00:21:02.650" style="s2">yesterday after Nick posted and gave me</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.700" end="00:21:04.360" style="s2">it was like fine because I have so many</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.650" end="00:21:05.950" style="s2">discord accounts and that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.360" end="00:21:08.680" style="s2">broken pieces that it won&#39;t let you on</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.950" end="00:21:11.050" style="s2">and I figured it out because I could get</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.680" end="00:21:12.640" style="s2">into a complaining about discord but</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.050" end="00:21:14.620" style="s2">that&#39;s felt important this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.640" end="00:21:17.490" style="s2">was like okay I already died on my end</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.620" end="00:21:20.050" style="s2">I&#39;m here I&#39;m in with my original account</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.490" end="00:21:24.580" style="s2">we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see if anything comes of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.050" end="00:21:25.350" style="s2">it right my story is very much going</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.580" end="00:21:28.510" style="s2">through science</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.350" end="00:21:30.550" style="s2">Ed&#39;s that&#39;s my actual background is in</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.510" end="00:21:32.890" style="s2">science biology ecology genetics and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.550" end="00:21:35.560" style="s2">well I was in university I got diagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.890" end="00:21:38.560" style="s2">with brain tumors which put me on a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.560" end="00:21:40.570" style="s2">completely different course of realizing</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.560" end="00:21:42.040" style="s2">what science and health care can&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.570" end="00:21:43.930" style="s2">you like they don&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.040" end="00:21:45.730" style="s2">solutions they&#39;re not actually there to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.930" end="00:21:48.250" style="s2">heal you they don&#39;t even care about why</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.730" end="00:21:51.250" style="s2">things happen and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.250" end="00:21:52.540" style="s2">but as a science student looking to make</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.250" end="00:21:54.280" style="s2">sense of the world and then having that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.540" end="00:21:55.900" style="s2">happen now with hindsight of life all</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.280" end="00:21:57.610" style="s2">that was exactly was supposed to happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.900" end="00:21:58.990" style="s2">and then my brain thinking I could cram</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.610" end="00:22:01.180" style="s2">enough information I could solve the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.990" end="00:22:02.650" style="s2">world&#39;s problems I can no longer cram it</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.180" end="00:22:04.360" style="s2">in now I&#39;m very much a piece with</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.650" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">everything I need to know I already know</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.360" end="00:22:09.970" style="s2">and what can I do from this point with</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:11.620" style="s2">what I have working within my</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.970" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">limitations that&#39;s why before we started</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.620" end="00:22:14.650" style="s2">the recording I talked about that video</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:16.120" style="s2">I saw that someone had posted about like</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.650" end="00:22:19.690" style="s2">begging for people to come and then I</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.120" end="00:22:21.130" style="s2">just found game B and in there I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.690" end="00:22:23.680" style="s2">like all I can do is have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.130" end="00:22:25.030" style="s2">you can&#39;t cheat but like I need the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.680" end="00:22:26.740" style="s2">other people to do the executive</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.740" end="00:22:32.140" style="s2">like to some degree nothing&#39;s changed in</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.590" end="00:22:33.550" style="s2">the last eight months I don&#39;t have what</p>

<p begin="00:23:00.760" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">obsessed with other lemons I actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.230" end="00:23:06.070" style="s2">really like like the math of them like I</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.530" style="s2">want to see I love sitting I&#39;m never</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.070" end="00:23:10.450" style="s2">gonna buy them but I used to can I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.530" end="00:23:12.460" style="s2">used to like I&#39;ve started MLMs I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.450" end="00:23:14.470" style="s2">started businesses I&#39;ve never made a</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.460" end="00:23:17.110" style="s2">dollar at any of them because of my</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.470" end="00:23:18.790" style="s2">battle of poverty my subconscious now</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.110" end="00:23:20.770" style="s2">now it&#39;s more of a conscious vow and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.790" end="00:23:21.970" style="s2">like you know what I&#39;m not I have a bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.770" end="00:23:23.770" style="s2">of a problem here saying there at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.970" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">end about like your abundance finds you</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.770" end="00:23:27.850" style="s2">in the self-help community that happens</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:29.320" style="s2">that that wording right like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.850" end="00:23:30.760" style="s2">doing it right you&#39;ll find health and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.320" end="00:23:32.290" style="s2">wealth and if you&#39;re doing it wrong in</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.760" end="00:23:33.910" style="s2">whatever way it&#39;s going and it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.290" end="00:23:36.990" style="s2">say what you said that&#39;s right into it</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.910" end="00:23:39.370" style="s2">it goes the other way and for me I</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.990" end="00:23:41.680" style="s2">haven&#39;t found health and I haven&#39;t found</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.370" end="00:23:43.150" style="s2">wealth and I&#39;m okay with it cuz I&#39;m okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.680" end="00:23:45.280" style="s2">not finding health and wealth until we</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.150" end="00:23:46.300" style="s2">all find health and wealth and I still a</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.280" end="00:23:48.550" style="s2">hundred percent less than what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.300" end="00:23:49.900" style="s2">saying not we don&#39;t need everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.550" end="00:23:51.850" style="s2">take a vow of poverty that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.900" end="00:23:54.430" style="s2">actually what we need we need people</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.850" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">with resources to put them into Gabey</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.430" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">but I also fundamentally think that if</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:24:01.290" style="s2">game a works for you you actually can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:01.290" style="s2">quite conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.570" end="00:24:09.580" style="s2">very much until you have some kind of we</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.600" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">hit a wall somewhere in your life and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.580" end="00:24:14.799" style="s2">may not be financial if you&#39;re well if</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:16.059" style="s2">you&#39;re a good game a player and but but</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.799" end="00:24:17.850" style="s2">then what happens is you can buy your</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.059" end="00:24:20.260" style="s2">way out of it you hit a wall and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.850" end="00:24:23.140" style="s2">your way through it all your all your</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.260" end="00:24:24.490" style="s2">shadow and all your everything you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.140" end="00:24:28.120" style="s2">to do the processes you can just make</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.490" end="00:24:29.380" style="s2">your will happen in the world and in any</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.120" end="00:24:33.210" style="s2">way yeah I didn&#39;t mean to cut you out</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.380" end="00:24:35.350" style="s2">there at the same time like when I first</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.210" end="00:24:38.620" style="s2">wasn&#39;t able to go back to work after my</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.350" end="00:24:39.909" style="s2">maternity leave and had to go on like to</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.620" end="00:24:41.679" style="s2">the food bank and do all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.909" end="00:24:44.679" style="s2">that I wasn&#39;t wasn&#39;t not planning on</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.679" end="00:24:46.390" style="s2">doing we&#39;re doing money kept finding me</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.679" end="00:24:48.070" style="s2">like what I was seeking it when I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.390" end="00:24:49.480" style="s2">doing the MLM I got in such debt because</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.070" end="00:24:51.610" style="s2">there was this idea that in the future I</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.480" end="00:24:53.169" style="s2">would have money and so it&#39;s like well I</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.610" end="00:24:54.220" style="s2">can spend 2,000 now because I&#39;ll look</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.169" end="00:24:56.289" style="s2">out all this money I&#39;ll have in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.220" end="00:24:58.840" style="s2">future I can pay it off with whereas</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.289" end="00:24:59.890" style="s2">when that flipped when I knew I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.840" end="00:25:01.570" style="s2">know if I&#39;m ever gonna be able to work</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.890" end="00:25:03.760" style="s2">for a paycheck again I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.570" end="00:25:05.590" style="s2">that&#39;s ever gonna happen all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.760" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">all the money I had like my savings is</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.590" end="00:25:09.970" style="s2">my savings I was like no and money kept</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:11.710" style="s2">finding me like I got this very minor</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.970" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">traffic accident all I wanted was</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.710" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">chiropractic help that&#39;s all I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.520" end="00:25:18.970" style="s2">but they ended up sending me like twenty</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:20.230" style="s2">five hundred in compensation after all</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.970" end="00:25:22.179" style="s2">of that now it was like it was very</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.230" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">minor I really only wanted chiropractic</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.179" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">but I was like oh and then I got like</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:28.419" style="s2">all these tax returns that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:30.340" style="s2">one it&#39;s the one thing that the ministry</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.419" end="00:25:31.690" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take off of your money and so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.340" end="00:25:34.030" style="s2">was like and then when you are on</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.690" end="00:25:35.770" style="s2">disability and you apply for CPP you get</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.030" end="00:25:37.659" style="s2">this lump sum of money and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.770" end="00:25:39.070" style="s2">treat and so it&#39;s like this money founds</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.659" end="00:25:40.630" style="s2">me you know it&#39;s like weird when I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.070" end="00:25:42.070" style="s2">seeking it it ran away and now that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.630" end="00:25:43.809" style="s2">like run away I don&#39;t need you and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.070" end="00:25:47.500" style="s2">actually fed on to me it&#39;s like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.809" end="00:25:50.710" style="s2">know i-i&#39;ve just in like I get all of</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.500" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">the abundance I need from society in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.710" end="00:25:53.860" style="s2">very real way that usually isn&#39;t money</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:56.860" style="s2">it&#39;s usually people offering things for</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.860" end="00:25:58.870" style="s2">free and I that is what it&#39;s mine like</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.860" end="00:26:00.580" style="s2">what if something costs a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.870" end="00:26:02.289" style="s2">and I can&#39;t afford it usual thing as all</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.580" end="00:26:04.299" style="s2">you&#39;ll find the money if you meant for</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.289" end="00:26:06.100" style="s2">you I&#39;m like you know so how it&#39;ll work</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.299" end="00:26:07.600" style="s2">out if it was meant for me I&#39;ll ask for</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.100" end="00:26:08.350" style="s2">it for free right and sometimes that</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.600" end="00:26:09.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.350" end="00:26:10.900" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s somebody&#39;s time and energy and</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.730" end="00:26:12.730" style="s2">sometimes it does because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.900" end="00:26:14.390" style="s2">technology thing or it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.730" end="00:26:16.550" style="s2">people are willing to give up</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.390" end="00:26:18.530" style="s2">and I got a long time ago for both my</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.550" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">health and wells unless it&#39;s free and</p>

<p begin="00:27:17.060" end="00:27:21.290" style="s2">same time it&#39;s like life-changing it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.400" end="00:27:23.300" style="s2">where I kind of figured out I was gender</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.730" end="00:27:43.670" style="s2">like well why can&#39;t this technology</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.320" end="00:27:45.560" style="s2">exist in the world and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.670" end="00:27:47.570" style="s2">dealing with the underlying structure of</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.560" end="00:27:49.490" style="s2">the technology it&#39;s like that that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.570" end="00:27:50.780" style="s2">risky to create technology well I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:28:06.680" end="00:28:10.940" style="s2">school and doing all of this it was like</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.390" end="00:28:12.650" style="s2">a technology cooperative that we all own</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.940" end="00:28:14.960" style="s2">and operate together with complete</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.650" end="00:28:17.090" style="s2">transparency is the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.960" end="00:28:19.040" style="s2">everything it&#39;s like because it&#39;s it</p>

<p begin="00:28:25.520" end="00:28:30.140" style="s2">B it was like how we dismantle cap</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.010" end="00:28:31.610" style="s2">is by creating a parallel system of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.140" end="00:28:33.890" style="s2">cooperation next to it that easily</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.610" end="00:28:35.570" style="s2">outcompetes it with the vulnerable</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.410" end="00:28:49.790" style="s2">information we do have if we have access</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.750" end="00:28:52.370" style="s2">to information we can trust and use and</p>

<p begin="00:29:09.740" end="00:29:14.210" style="s2">more that we force it and the more that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.150" end="00:29:16.550" style="s2">we try to control it the harder it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.210" end="00:29:18.530" style="s2">and it&#39;s funny because I&#39;m a very I am a</p>

<p begin="00:29:52.970" end="00:29:57.530" style="s2">conversations and so over between that</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.120" end="00:30:00.110" style="s2">conversation and that&#39;s three minute</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.530" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">video of a sorry video that I did in</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.110" end="00:30:06.050" style="s2">September that I watched today and now I</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.760" end="00:30:08.270" style="s2">think I must&#39;ve been right after that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.050" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">launched the idea cafe which was like an</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.270" end="00:30:13.190" style="s2">hour-long conversation on its its own</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:14.750" style="s2">YouTube channel the idea was that it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.190" end="00:30:16.670" style="s2">going to be formatted off from the World</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.750" end="00:30:18.800" style="s2">Cafe everyone takes a turn answering the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.670" end="00:30:20.030" style="s2">question and you switch tables so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.800" end="00:30:21.260" style="s2">you&#39;re having a bigger conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.030" end="00:30:23.300" style="s2">the whole but it never really gained</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.260" end="00:30:25.700" style="s2">traction like people like people love</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.300" end="00:30:27.080" style="s2">participating in them but not</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.700" end="00:30:28.970" style="s2">necessarily watching them so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.080" end="00:30:31.040" style="s2">work in a game a world to gain an</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.970" end="00:30:32.210" style="s2">audience and and I didn&#39;t follow through</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.040" end="00:30:33.650" style="s2">that in the same way I did I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.210" end="00:30:35.270" style="s2">reaching out to influencers and we it</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.650" end="00:30:37.910" style="s2">was like my dashboard for what would be</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.270" end="00:30:39.230" style="s2">my social media but I lost interest cuz</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.910" end="00:30:41.020" style="s2">I found game B and I&#39;m like there&#39;s all</p>

<p begin="00:30:41.020" end="00:30:44.890" style="s2">created game B in my head in my bedroom</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.820" end="00:30:47.650" style="s2">all by myself before I ever knew what</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.890" end="00:30:49.420" style="s2">game B was no and then even before I</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.650" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">found game B I knew that was broken I</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.420" end="00:30:54.460" style="s2">was like oh if I create it even if it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:02.020" end="00:31:06.280" style="s2">actually what we naturally go to when</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.510" end="00:31:09.520" style="s2">there&#39;s transparency and openness so we</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.280" end="00:31:12.250" style="s2">can write it together mm-hmm and so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.520" end="00:31:14.440" style="s2">idea Cafe and then I tried to do this</p>

<p begin="00:31:49.900" end="00:31:53.290" style="s2">really came to fruition so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.370" end="00:31:55.000" style="s2">if it would actually work but having</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.290" end="00:31:57.550" style="s2">people come to a zoom meeting breaking</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.000" end="00:31:59.680" style="s2">up into small groups and have it happen</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.550" end="00:32:00.910" style="s2">every four to six hours right and so for</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.680" end="00:32:02.500" style="s2">couple days you&#39;re answering the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.910" end="00:32:04.420" style="s2">question then you have people harvest</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.500" end="00:32:05.740" style="s2">that question to say I Principate all</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.420" end="00:32:07.660" style="s2">these conversations here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.740" end="00:32:08.890" style="s2">learned and not everyone has to harvest</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.660" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">it only people who want to harvest it</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.890" end="00:32:13.480" style="s2">and finding a way to collect that</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:14.500" style="s2">information but it was hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.480" end="00:32:17.290" style="s2">people at the meetings</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.500" end="00:32:20.110" style="s2">I can&#39;t facilitate every in every time</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.290" end="00:32:22.000" style="s2">zone right so even every six hours I</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.110" end="00:32:26.190" style="s2">can&#39;t do one every for every six hours</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.000" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">and so it when it coming out of that was</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.190" end="00:32:31.150" style="s2">finding Bentley who we started together</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:33.640" style="s2">tech was already the name I had going</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.150" end="00:32:35.320" style="s2">but like a technology cooperative and my</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.640" end="00:32:37.710" style="s2">brother came on board long after after</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.320" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">we did mushrooms my 40th birthday yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.710" end="00:32:41.290" style="s2">he&#39;s starting to see a bit of the vision</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:42.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about for years and</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.290" end="00:32:45.850" style="s2">years he still has his own very</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.940" end="00:32:47.410" style="s2">capitalistic spin on it but like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.850" end="00:32:50.860" style="s2">more into it now than he understands</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.410" end="00:32:52.060" style="s2">game B but to be able to say okay here</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.860" end="00:32:54.230" style="s2">is the technology cooperative at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.060" end="00:32:57.830" style="s2">same time were very project</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.230" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">guest so out of that is 100 and nowhen</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.830" end="00:33:01.730" style="s2">october/november Bentley had the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:03.380" style="s2">for a project raising where we praise</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.730" end="00:33:05.450" style="s2">someone comes with their project and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.380" end="00:33:07.220" style="s2">they&#39;re in the hot seat and we focus on</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.450" end="00:33:09.169" style="s2">their project they give the intentions</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.220" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">and we crowdsource it make perfect that</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.169" end="00:33:12.290" style="s2">sounds great and they were great but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:14.390" style="s2">was much easier finding people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.290" end="00:33:15.770" style="s2">wanted a project raising then who wanted</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.390" end="00:33:17.929" style="s2">to participate in somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.770" end="00:33:19.220" style="s2">project right right was basically a</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.929" end="00:33:22.070" style="s2">troll Bentley and I appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.220" end="00:33:24.350" style="s2">everybody&#39;s project but like yes fine</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.070" end="00:33:25.880" style="s2">but like we want the meta project we</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.350" end="00:33:27.669" style="s2">raised like how do we on the win</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.880" end="00:33:30.530" style="s2">solutions for all of our projects and</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.669" end="00:33:32.120" style="s2">somewhere in that we Alya was like from</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.530" end="00:33:34.370" style="s2">Bentley newest project raising I was</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.120" end="00:33:36.020" style="s2">like Oh a solution raising we can do and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.370" end="00:33:38.900" style="s2">so designing that hour-long conversation</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.020" end="00:33:40.250" style="s2">in like here&#39;s what currently happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.900" end="00:33:43.160" style="s2">here&#39;s what could happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.250" end="00:33:44.330" style="s2">beautiful future of mine even if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.160" end="00:33:46.100" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with it right they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.330" end="00:33:47.809" style="s2">need to match and then like what could</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.100" end="00:33:50.330" style="s2">we actually do at ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.809" end="00:33:52.850" style="s2">$100,000 because I know that when people</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.330" end="00:33:58.220" style="s2">see that vision then it&#39;s like wait why</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.850" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">are we doing this exactly like once we</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.220" end="00:34:01.190" style="s2">have the one for education and</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:02.750" style="s2">infectious disease and transportation</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.190" end="00:34:04.790" style="s2">and a few of these things it&#39;s like any</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.750" end="00:34:07.220" style="s2">of these of the world changing imagine</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.790" end="00:34:08.810" style="s2">if we had all of them right and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.220" end="00:34:10.340" style="s2">not it&#39;s not a brand new education</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.810" end="00:34:12.560" style="s2">system it&#39;s like what could we do right</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.340" end="00:34:15.260" style="s2">now that would improve education for my</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.560" end="00:34:17.240" style="s2">kid or for me right and and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.260" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">like okay so now I am about how do I</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.240" end="00:34:22.159" style="s2">find 10,000 be one less interesting I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:23.810" style="s2">more interested in finding us longer</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.159" end="00:34:26.810" style="s2">than people to work through a process</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.810" end="00:34:28.760" style="s2">and what could is a contest a something</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.810" end="00:34:30.859" style="s2">looked like but 10,000 people they the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.760" end="00:34:32.750" style="s2">10,000 people got what they wanted out</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.859" end="00:34:34.429" style="s2">of it they felt connected they felt like</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.750" end="00:34:37.970" style="s2">they were part of it at whatever level</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.429" end="00:34:39.700" style="s2">they wanted to be part of it yes and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.970" end="00:34:42.290" style="s2">allowing that process to be done</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.700" end="00:34:44.240" style="s2">transparently and openly including like</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.290" end="00:34:46.399" style="s2">oh that didn&#39;t work that&#39;s falling apart</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.240" end="00:34:47.629" style="s2">that&#39;s not quite working because the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.399" end="00:34:49.940" style="s2">more transparent you are the more</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.629" end="00:34:52.609" style="s2">honestly put like space you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.940" end="00:34:54.470" style="s2">mistakes because it&#39;s all of our mistake</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.609" end="00:34:56.780" style="s2">like you also could have foreseen this</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.470" end="00:34:58.340" style="s2">and helped with it you didn&#39;t right we</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.780" end="00:35:00.050" style="s2">spent too much money well you could have</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.340" end="00:35:01.880" style="s2">told us that this was actually on sale</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.050" end="00:35:04.070" style="s2">for 75% off somewhere else you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.880" end="00:35:06.290" style="s2">come hindsight and tell us I already</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.070" end="00:35:07.530" style="s2">spent that money right but we it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.290" end="00:35:08.790" style="s2">easier then go back and be like</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.530" end="00:35:10.650" style="s2">look here&#39;s what we spent it on we had</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.790" end="00:35:12.270" style="s2">too much when you knew $10 from everyone</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.650" end="00:35:13.800" style="s2">right and if you&#39;re not willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.270" end="00:35:17.180" style="s2">that that&#39;s fine like of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.800" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">okay it was our beginning like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.180" end="00:35:22.230" style="s2">transparency makes everything better and</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:26.580" style="s2">animate so I made some notes because I</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.230" end="00:35:30.300" style="s2">did look through the stuff from the what</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.580" end="00:35:32.040" style="s2">the one you sent me gonk oh come go go</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.300" end="00:35:37.050" style="s2">go got that yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.040" end="00:35:39.660" style="s2">yeah and a few of the other ones and one</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.050" end="00:35:45.210" style="s2">of which is anyway would you like to go</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.660" end="00:35:47.550" style="s2">through those sure yeah so during one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.210" end="00:35:50.190" style="s2">the sections on one of the things it</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.550" end="00:35:52.860" style="s2">talks about this this normal same that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.190" end="00:35:54.270" style="s2">think is rather common in in socialism</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.860" end="00:35:55.590" style="s2">communism right from each according to</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.270" end="00:35:57.270" style="s2">their ability to each according to their</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.590" end="00:35:58.950" style="s2">needs which is not it was like a slight</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.270" end="00:36:01.500" style="s2">difference which is for each according</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.950" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">to their ability to each according to</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.500" end="00:36:07.500" style="s2">their ability to serve the greater whole</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.920" end="00:36:09.300" style="s2">and I like that because it does say like</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.500" end="00:36:11.670" style="s2">like if I&#39;m getting someone to clean my</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.300" end="00:36:14.700" style="s2">house it&#39;s not because I&#39;m better than</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.670" end="00:36:16.260" style="s2">everyone else it&#39;s because I&#39;m you seem</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.700" end="00:36:18.420" style="s2">in energy to help serve the greater good</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.260" end="00:36:19.620" style="s2">right and person cleaning my house is</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.420" end="00:36:21.990" style="s2">using their energy to help serve the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.620" end="00:36:24.210" style="s2">greater good like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s in that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.990" end="00:36:29.340" style="s2">instead of I&#39;m richer so I get it at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.210" end="00:36:31.320" style="s2">same time there&#39;s a lot of ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.340" end="00:36:33.270" style="s2">have no idea how somebody contributes</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.320" end="00:36:34.890" style="s2">right all of the parenting which</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.270" end="00:36:36.690" style="s2">generally falls on the women and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.890" end="00:36:38.580" style="s2">don&#39;t have enough other to give it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.690" end="00:36:40.770" style="s2">like right so and although like</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.580" end="00:36:42.570" style="s2">secondary and tertiary giving right like</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.770" end="00:36:44.340" style="s2">if you write a song and that inspires me</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.570" end="00:36:47.100" style="s2">and then I go out and create the next</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.340" end="00:36:48.450" style="s2">Facebook am i giving any money to the to</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.100" end="00:36:50.610" style="s2">the writer you don&#39;t I mean like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.450" end="00:36:52.530" style="s2">ways that we&#39;re connected and inspired</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.610" end="00:36:55.860" style="s2">and contribute that never really go back</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.530" end="00:37:01.410" style="s2">to it to a currency to uh yeah Tolkien</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.860" end="00:37:03.810" style="s2">yet right how does it end and beyond</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.410" end="00:37:08.100" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of bias that comes in</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.810" end="00:37:10.830" style="s2">in who we give credit to who we think</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.100" end="00:37:13.020" style="s2">helps and who actually helped like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.830" end="00:37:15.810" style="s2">person who takes the most right I did</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.020" end="00:37:18.780" style="s2">all the good like I have this that most</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.810" end="00:37:19.540" style="s2">people do but I&#39;m we have people saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.780" end="00:37:21.790" style="s2">that we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.540" end="00:37:23.530" style="s2">of course right yeah yeah but we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.790" end="00:37:25.660" style="s2">oh we have there&#39;s over estimators and</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.530" end="00:37:27.670" style="s2">under estimators like the Trump is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.660" end="00:37:29.800" style="s2">epitome of an over estimator right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.670" end="00:37:31.780" style="s2">the best at everything believe me and</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.800" end="00:37:33.880" style="s2">the issue isn&#39;t that there&#39;s over an</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.780" end="00:37:36.250" style="s2">under estimators it&#39;s that we kind of</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.250" end="00:37:39.880" style="s2">when you get somebody like me that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.690" end="00:37:41.800" style="s2">underestimate err you like you already</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.880" end="00:37:44.770" style="s2">mean divide but what I&#39;ve said by 75</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.800" end="00:37:46.570" style="s2">instead of timesing it by 10 right so</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.770" end="00:37:48.850" style="s2">when I say I know a solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.570" end="00:37:52.090" style="s2">world and I&#39;m coming as an underestimate</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.850" end="00:37:53.500" style="s2">err you better believe me in a different</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.090" end="00:37:55.720" style="s2">way than you should believe Trump but</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.500" end="00:37:58.570" style="s2">you&#39;re never gonna know that and under</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.720" end="00:38:00.790" style="s2">estimators like historically give more</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.570" end="00:38:02.800" style="s2">because we think less of ourselves right</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.790" end="00:38:05.800" style="s2">oh I can&#39;t cook so you put on 20 course</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.800" end="00:38:07.510" style="s2">meal it&#39;s like a gourmet right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.800" end="00:38:10.180" style="s2">you&#39;re like I can&#39;t do this so you do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.510" end="00:38:12.550" style="s2">much more I you know my sister who is an</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.180" end="00:38:13.870" style="s2">overestimate her for sure her one place</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.550" end="00:38:15.070" style="s2">she was maybe an estimator which he</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.870" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">applied for film school</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.070" end="00:38:20.740" style="s2">and didn&#39;t get in and so she did her own</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:22.120" style="s2">small video and like won awards and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.740" end="00:38:23.350" style="s2">Australia and stuff because she didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.120" end="00:38:25.420" style="s2">know how shitty she was supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.350" end="00:38:27.460" style="s2">on it as a first year right like should</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.420" end="00:38:29.140" style="s2">be it was like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.460" end="00:38:31.210" style="s2">oh it just never appears to compare</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.140" end="00:38:32.710" style="s2">herself to so it was above and beyond</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.210" end="00:38:34.360" style="s2">what they would have done and I know</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.710" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">that happens in my life like when I cook</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.360" end="00:38:37.600" style="s2">for people or when I throw a party or</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.160" end="00:38:40.060" style="s2">when I do things because I think I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.600" end="00:38:43.530" style="s2">bad at it then I overcompensate it ends</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.060" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">up being beyond I love that analysis</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.530" end="00:38:49.270" style="s2">yeah but yeah totally so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:51.640" style="s2">things I guess isn&#39;t crystal clear in</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.270" end="00:38:53.050" style="s2">any of the stuff you read is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.640" end="00:38:56.980" style="s2">this is all based on the meta currency</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.050" end="00:38:58.300" style="s2">project which which was exactly that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.980" end="00:39:02.050" style="s2">was exactly the idea that we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.300" end="00:39:03.610" style="s2">to do to represent all of the value flow</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.050" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">all the things people value in the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.610" end="00:39:07.570" style="s2">all the contributions that people are</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:09.940" style="s2">making in the world through one metric</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.570" end="00:39:12.610" style="s2">called money and if that fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.940" end="00:39:14.100" style="s2">just not going to work and of course you</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.610" end="00:39:16.390" style="s2">know because the other part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.100" end="00:39:17.710" style="s2">game a aspect that we&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.390" end="00:39:19.690" style="s2">more and more and more of it all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.710" end="00:39:23.440" style="s2">time and the whole system but which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.690" end="00:39:24.610" style="s2">created so the meta currency project</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.440" end="00:39:26.260" style="s2">says that of each individual in each</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.610" end="00:39:28.270" style="s2">community has the ability to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.260" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">the things that they value and to create</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.270" end="00:39:33.220" style="s2">a currency around the things they value</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:37.810" style="s2">that we can create</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.220" end="00:39:39.580" style="s2">the kind of records we need to do proper</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.810" end="00:39:40.840" style="s2">analysis on all of the things in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.580" end="00:39:44.859" style="s2">world not just the things that can</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.840" end="00:39:46.180" style="s2">funnel through money you know and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.859" end="00:39:48.099" style="s2">definitely includes like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.180" end="00:39:49.900" style="s2">primary examples I always use is whose</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.099" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">track whose where&#39;s the metrics for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.900" end="00:39:53.980" style="s2">people raising the children I have three</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:56.410" style="s2">girls I raised but then you know if I</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.980" end="00:39:58.210" style="s2">can&#39;t show up in the way I need to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.410" end="00:39:59.800" style="s2">business projects or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.210" end="00:40:01.540" style="s2">because I&#39;m raising my kids nobody cares</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.800" end="00:40:03.160" style="s2">they&#39;re just like oh well you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.540" end="00:40:05.050" style="s2">show up it doesn&#39;t matter that it</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.160" end="00:40:07.780" style="s2">because I&#39;m a dad I have three kids half</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.050" end="00:40:09.550" style="s2">the year um so yeah I mean I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.780" end="00:40:11.730" style="s2">totally feeling that as well and which</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.550" end="00:40:13.869" style="s2">but there&#39;s all kinds of different ways</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.730" end="00:40:15.940" style="s2">of providing value in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.869" end="00:40:18.280" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily relate directly to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.940" end="00:40:20.410" style="s2">monetary transaction unless we have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.280" end="00:40:21.970" style="s2">capacity to start bringing bringing</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.410" end="00:40:23.410" style="s2">awareness to those things that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.970" end="00:40:26.500" style="s2">happening we&#39;re not gonna be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.410" end="00:40:29.140" style="s2">scale collectively intelligently but we</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.500" end="00:40:31.420" style="s2">need to and so that is certainly a major</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.140" end="00:40:33.130" style="s2">component I love the overestimate or</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.420" end="00:40:38.589" style="s2">underestimate or thing you know analysis</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.130" end="00:40:40.869" style="s2">I think one time I read that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.589" end="00:40:43.540" style="s2">Western culture we are vastly</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.869" end="00:40:46.180" style="s2">overestimated we are very immodest in</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.540" end="00:40:47.890" style="s2">our capacities and in in Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.180" end="00:40:51.700" style="s2">cultures they are much more modest they</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.890" end="00:40:53.349" style="s2">are much more less think think less of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.700" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">themselves and more of the collective</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.349" end="00:40:58.300" style="s2">and he is also a masculine trait to</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.599" end="00:40:59.770" style="s2">overestimate even though I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.300" end="00:41:01.570" style="s2">like masculine feminine because it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.770" end="00:41:03.490" style="s2">kind of that category of like all these</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.570" end="00:41:05.349" style="s2">other categories we&#39;ve decided to put</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.490" end="00:41:07.690" style="s2">into a dichotomy which is like their own</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.349" end="00:41:09.339" style="s2">dichotomy but that&#39;s all leather I end</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.690" end="00:41:11.500" style="s2">up using it quite a bit the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.339" end="00:41:13.900" style="s2">feminine dichotomy stuff um I think it</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.500" end="00:41:15.490" style="s2">is it seems very prevalent to me and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.900" end="00:41:17.050" style="s2">many things and I think it really is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.490" end="00:41:18.910" style="s2">fundamental right so I end up using it a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.050" end="00:41:20.619" style="s2">lot and because it does throw people</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.910" end="00:41:22.810" style="s2">sometimes for sure because I could say</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.619" end="00:41:24.220" style="s2">Yin or yang because well a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.810" end="00:41:25.630" style="s2">people if I&#39;m saying masculine or</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.220" end="00:41:26.800" style="s2">feminine they think I mean male or</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.630" end="00:41:29.140" style="s2">female they think I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.800" end="00:41:33.160" style="s2">gender and Ike throws me off sometimes I</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.140" end="00:41:34.330" style="s2">never am you know if you if you happen</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.160" end="00:41:36.670" style="s2">to be in a female body and you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.330" end="00:41:39.010" style="s2">total masculine embodiment then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.670" end="00:41:43.080" style="s2">great mm-hm makes no difference to me</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.010" end="00:41:43.080" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna make friends it&#39;s to anybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.630" end="00:41:48.610" style="s2">but it</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.870" end="00:41:51.790" style="s2">is like it is it&#39;s very there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.610" end="00:41:53.080" style="s2">things we can see in the approaches to</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.790" end="00:41:55.390" style="s2">where you need that balance obviously</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.080" end="00:41:57.700" style="s2">you need the masculine going out and</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.390" end="00:41:59.740" style="s2">trying things out of cocky arrogance but</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.700" end="00:42:01.960" style="s2">yet it&#39;s some kind of discovery process</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.740" end="00:42:03.820" style="s2">right ya know and it&#39;s it&#39;s not you do</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.960" end="00:42:05.980" style="s2">we need the diversity in the balance and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.820" end="00:42:07.720" style="s2">everything yeah and we don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.980" end="00:42:10.150" style="s2">like right now under this Cove at 19</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.720" end="00:42:11.590" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing how in order to start a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.150" end="00:42:14.500" style="s2">business you have to be an overestimate</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.590" end="00:42:17.200" style="s2">er for sure and you have to have a high</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.500" end="00:42:19.150" style="s2">risk tolerance and oh my god micro no</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.200" end="00:42:20.410" style="s2">scene and it just kicked in in a way it</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.150" end="00:42:24.820" style="s2">normally doesn&#39;t but that&#39;s double</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.410" end="00:42:26.920" style="s2">weather like it kid like my micro nosy</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.820" end="00:42:31.600" style="s2">and stuff I&#39;ll write you later oh no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.920" end="00:42:34.060" style="s2">saying online but anyway I use less to</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.600" end="00:42:35.860" style="s2">you that I normally do it was just like</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.060" end="00:42:37.120" style="s2">usually it does it there isn&#39;t a kick in</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.860" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">moment and that moment I&#39;m like wait</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.120" end="00:42:40.180" style="s2">let&#39;s go that&#39;s what&#39;s going on you just</p>

<p begin="00:43:04.390" end="00:43:08.590" style="s2">the unequal amount of hours in a day</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.040" end="00:43:11.050" style="s2">right we have 24 hours in a day and that</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.590" end="00:43:12.700" style="s2">it&#39;s fundamentally not true yes we have</p>

<p begin="00:43:21.160" end="00:43:26.260" style="s2">different personal needs and we have</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.890" end="00:43:27.880" style="s2">different societal needs that bring that</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.260" end="00:43:29.980" style="s2">down so that we all have very</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.880" end="00:43:32.050" style="s2">fundamentally very different amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.980" end="00:43:33.580" style="s2">time we have very much different energy</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.050" end="00:43:35.170" style="s2">we treat us like we have the same amount</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.580" end="00:43:36.610" style="s2">of energy we think everyone should be</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.170" end="00:43:38.830" style="s2">able to work a 40-hour workweek if</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.610" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">you&#39;re not able to you&#39;re a disabled if</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.830" end="00:43:42.070" style="s2">you can work more than that you just get</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:43.630" style="s2">all that surplus right there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.070" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">who work 80 hours a week no problem on</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.630" end="00:43:46.810" style="s2">marathons I don&#39;t think they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:51.160" style="s2">working 80 hours a week but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.810" end="00:43:53.590" style="s2">enough for me</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.160" end="00:43:55.350" style="s2">anytime you tokenize them anytime you</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.590" end="00:43:58.510" style="s2">add a currency to it you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.350" end="00:43:59.740" style="s2">wrong incentives then it becomes then</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.510" end="00:44:00.190" style="s2">you have this game theory and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.740" end="00:44:02.170" style="s2">finally agreed</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.190" end="00:44:05.079" style="s2">your article on medium or you talked</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.170" end="00:44:10.060" style="s2">about the computer it&#39;s game theory</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.079" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">right it&#39;s like if you if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.060" end="00:44:14.109" style="s2">you&#39;re playing and a dichotomous game</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:16.720" style="s2">and you can either you know do good or</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.109" end="00:44:18.730" style="s2">bad and all of those are always done if</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.720" end="00:44:20.020" style="s2">you both do good you&#39;re okay if one of</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.730" end="00:44:22.060" style="s2">you does bad and one of you does good</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.020" end="00:44:23.740" style="s2">the bad player gets the winning and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.060" end="00:44:25.480" style="s2">if you both do bad either you get it it</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.740" end="00:44:28.119" style="s2">plays on all the time in game theory and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.480" end="00:44:32.410" style="s2">I&#39;m like why don&#39;t we ever and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.119" end="00:44:35.170" style="s2">actually do sometimes but that&#39;s game a</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.410" end="00:44:38.349" style="s2">right we incentivize sociopath we</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.170" end="00:44:40.990" style="s2">incentivize bad actors but those games</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.349" end="00:44:43.510" style="s2">are never done in a way that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.990" end="00:44:46.060" style="s2">right actually a game B can incentivize</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.510" end="00:44:47.470" style="s2">the good winners the players and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.060" end="00:44:49.420" style="s2">you actually don&#39;t need to play out game</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.470" end="00:44:52.119" style="s2">theory because it&#39;s it&#39;s already in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.420" end="00:44:54.220" style="s2">system right if when you when you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.119" end="00:44:56.740" style="s2">bad and good actors and the good actors</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.220" end="00:44:59.140" style="s2">win it doesn&#39;t actually matter what</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.740" end="00:45:01.660" style="s2">about actors do right right the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.140" end="00:45:03.010" style="s2">sociopaths win right it&#39;s that when</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.660" end="00:45:05.140" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to cheat when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.010" end="00:45:07.630" style="s2">willing to lie gives you an advantage in</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.140" end="00:45:09.220" style="s2">the game right as opposed to we there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.630" end="00:45:10.599" style="s2">no cheating and there is no lying</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.220" end="00:45:13.690" style="s2">because we can fully see what</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.599" end="00:45:15.130" style="s2">transparency what you&#39;re doing then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.690" end="00:45:16.450" style="s2">the good actor is it takeover and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.130" end="00:45:18.910" style="s2">therefore it doesn&#39;t matter whether</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.450" end="00:45:20.770" style="s2">you&#39;re someone who like cuz this is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.910" end="00:45:22.270" style="s2">idea that if you could work 80 hours a</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.770" end="00:45:24.609" style="s2">week and you&#39;re choosing to only work</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.270" end="00:45:26.740" style="s2">ten you&#39;re being lazy and you should be</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.609" end="00:45:28.839" style="s2">penalized for that the issue is who that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.740" end="00:45:30.880" style="s2">actually penalizes are all the people</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.839" end="00:45:33.730" style="s2">who actually can only work ten hours a</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.880" end="00:45:35.020" style="s2">week right who like how do I prove I can</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.730" end="00:45:36.130" style="s2">only work ten hours a week I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.020" end="00:45:38.890" style="s2">I don&#39;t even gotta prove that&#39;s myself</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.130" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">well into the world right what is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.890" end="00:45:43.960" style="s2">point so my metric instead of having a</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:45.190" style="s2">currency I know follow chain and a</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.960" end="00:45:48.490" style="s2">theory even savart go in and change</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.190" end="00:45:49.720" style="s2">their ways but is that it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.490" end="00:45:51.160" style="s2">the energy you put it and it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.720" end="00:45:53.920" style="s2">the hours you put in it&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.160" end="00:45:57.190" style="s2">about what moment does it stop bringing</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.920" end="00:45:59.710" style="s2">joy to you if you stop feeling joy your</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.190" end="00:46:01.630" style="s2">tenth hour stop working if you stop it</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.710" end="00:46:04.060" style="s2">at 80 hours stop working that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.630" end="00:46:05.710" style="s2">about what anyone else is doing how much</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.060" end="00:46:07.869" style="s2">work do you want to put into this</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.710" end="00:46:09.670" style="s2">without worrying about what anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.869" end="00:46:11.290" style="s2">is doing and that&#39;s the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.670" end="00:46:14.230" style="s2">that&#39;s actually fair because whether</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.290" end="00:46:15.820" style="s2">you&#39;re fully able-bodied or not the joy</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.230" end="00:46:17.410" style="s2">is the difference right yes I would love</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.820" end="00:46:20.170" style="s2">to put in 40 hours a week making</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.410" end="00:46:23.109" style="s2">together Tec I can&#39;t but I but yet I do</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.170" end="00:46:24.609" style="s2">hundred percent of me 24/7 is doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.109" end="00:46:26.619" style="s2">together tech and at the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.609" end="00:46:28.660" style="s2">actual putting the spreadsheets doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.619" end="00:46:32.320" style="s2">that is a much smaller smaller amount of</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.660" end="00:46:33.849" style="s2">time I guess yes just your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.320" end="00:46:36.160" style="s2">that like having a token and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.849" end="00:46:38.320" style="s2">incentivization in it well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:40.480" style="s2">nothing in holo chain it talks about</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.320" end="00:46:42.579" style="s2">tokens it&#39;s all current sees which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.480" end="00:46:43.869" style="s2">fundamentally different in that while</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.579" end="00:46:46.240" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do is look at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.869" end="00:46:49.329" style="s2">actually happening and see the current</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.240" end="00:46:51.579" style="s2">in those flows of exchange currency see</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.329" end="00:46:53.230" style="s2">the current and so yeah there is this</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.579" end="00:46:54.310" style="s2">element of tokenization for sure where</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.230" end="00:46:55.660" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to take something very</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.310" end="00:46:57.310" style="s2">natural you have to do this extra step</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.660" end="00:46:59.530" style="s2">where you have to put a metric on it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.310" end="00:47:02.290" style="s2">then record that metric vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.530" end="00:47:03.369" style="s2">transparency does indeed take extra work</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.290" end="00:47:06.430" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.369" end="00:47:08.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s always a choice and so that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.430" end="00:47:12.579" style="s2">an interesting you know challenge with</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.920" end="00:47:15.460" style="s2">the whole thing for sure right but I</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.579" end="00:47:16.780" style="s2">think that if if we kind of do get to a</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.460" end="00:47:18.339" style="s2">point where there is a lot of vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.780" end="00:47:20.050" style="s2">transparency happening it should be</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.339" end="00:47:22.780" style="s2">again like the people choosing not to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.050" end="00:47:24.490" style="s2">it that would probably stick out say Oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.780" end="00:47:25.810" style="s2">what not in there I&#39;d like the guy you</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.490" end="00:47:27.300" style="s2">have an interesting conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.810" end="00:47:31.569" style="s2">Matt shooty who&#39;s one of the original</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.300" end="00:47:32.920" style="s2">Medicare NC team who you know I&#39;m four</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.569" end="00:47:34.869" style="s2">I&#39;m just 100% for vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.920" end="00:47:36.130" style="s2">transparency he&#39;s like you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.869" end="00:47:37.900" style="s2">know there&#39;s chameleons in nature</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.130" end="00:47:39.310" style="s2">chameleons exist you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.900" end="00:47:41.349" style="s2">there&#39;s certain need for certain things</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.310" end="00:47:43.180" style="s2">to be kept closer to that I said okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.349" end="00:47:44.460" style="s2">great that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.180" end="00:47:46.240" style="s2">we are following by a mimicking</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.460" end="00:47:48.790" style="s2">biomimicry if we were working with</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.240" end="00:47:52.060" style="s2">biomimicry and we are mimicking natural</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.790" end="00:47:53.650" style="s2">patterns then yes there can be be so</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.060" end="00:47:55.300" style="s2">that so this allows for that though so</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.650" end="00:47:58.510" style="s2">my answer eventually was after thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.300" end="00:47:59.950" style="s2">about that for a while was yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.510" end="00:48:02.800" style="s2">can be you can choose not to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.950" end="00:48:05.680" style="s2">transparent but there&#39;s some evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.800" end="00:48:07.210" style="s2">the existence view and/or your work so</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.680" end="00:48:08.589" style="s2">we will see that you exist just like we</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.210" end="00:48:11.349" style="s2">can catch a chameleon out of the corner</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.589" end="00:48:13.720" style="s2">of your eye let&#39;s just saw something</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.349" end="00:48:14.619" style="s2">over there I&#39;m gonna when I look right</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.720" end="00:48:16.270" style="s2">at it I can&#39;t see it but I know</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.619" end="00:48:18.400" style="s2">something was there so now you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.270" end="00:48:20.319" style="s2">expect closer because you know something</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.400" end="00:48:21.520" style="s2">seems to be hidden over there so now</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.319" end="00:48:23.260" style="s2">you&#39;re actually gonna inspect look so if</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.520" end="00:48:24.880" style="s2">you want to try not vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.260" end="00:48:26.560" style="s2">transparency I suspect the natural</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.880" end="00:48:27.910" style="s2">pattern roll you will have more people</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.560" end="00:48:31.690" style="s2">looking at you</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.910" end="00:48:33.730" style="s2">mm-hmm and it won&#39;t work even with</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.690" end="00:48:36.750" style="s2">honorable transparency and a baby I</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.730" end="00:48:39.099" style="s2">don&#39;t like I&#39;m not 100% sure on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.750" end="00:48:40.539" style="s2">protocol that it is I didn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.099" end="00:48:42.099" style="s2">through it and I understood a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.539" end="00:48:45.430" style="s2">what what is shown and what isn&#39;t shown</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.099" end="00:48:48.250" style="s2">but if I&#39;m an a player in this game and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.430" end="00:48:50.799" style="s2">I&#39;m putting in the time I&#39;m working it</p>

<p begin="00:49:33.099" end="00:49:36.819" style="s2">accountability at the Academy so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.509" end="00:49:38.980" style="s2">have a factor of the difficulty and</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.819" end="00:49:42.130" style="s2">experience level necessary and an time</p>

<p begin="00:49:57.609" end="00:50:00.759" style="s2">the key it doesn&#39;t matter how much you</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.900" end="00:50:02.710" style="s2">do right this is that was the point of</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.759" end="00:50:04.690" style="s2">the adjustment and Marx quote it really</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.710" end="00:50:06.700" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter how much work you</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.690" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">supposedly do it matters whether you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:50:15.579" end="00:50:20.680" style="s2">critical piece and so and what is</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.950" end="00:50:22.180" style="s2">helping life in a positive way even that</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.680" end="00:50:25.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t define the second we try to</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.180" end="00:50:26.859" style="s2">were China we&#39;re telling people how they</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.000" end="00:50:28.359" style="s2">have to ask the act in your social score</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.859" end="00:50:30.190" style="s2">or else you don&#39;t get to fly on planes</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.359" end="00:50:32.440" style="s2">or whatever because you didn&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.190" end="00:50:37.390" style="s2">you went outside with the runny nose or</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.440" end="00:50:40.420" style="s2">whatever it is so so punitive central</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.390" end="00:50:41.420" style="s2">determination of what is good acting and</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.420" end="00:50:43.490" style="s2">what is not is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.420" end="00:50:45.170" style="s2">is just as problematic so if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.490" end="00:50:46.369" style="s2">remember in there you might have read</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.170" end="00:50:48.020" style="s2">somewhere in the document I don&#39;t maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.369" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t but I do have something called an</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.020" end="00:50:53.030" style="s2">impact currency there&#39;s there&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:54.950" style="s2">categories of exchange flows that</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.030" end="00:50:57.170" style="s2">identify being critical one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.950" end="00:51:01.339" style="s2">impact and that is the ability for</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.170" end="00:51:03.500" style="s2">anybody to recognize what you or a group</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.339" end="00:51:08.049" style="s2">of people a collective is doing and</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.500" end="00:51:10.069" style="s2">assign an impact currency to them so the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.049" end="00:51:11.480" style="s2">common example is you have the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.069" end="00:51:13.010" style="s2">factory who&#39;s making widgets that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.480" end="00:51:14.450" style="s2">whole world loves and the world is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.010" end="00:51:17.089" style="s2">better place because of the widget so</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.450" end="00:51:19.490" style="s2">everybody loves the widgets but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.089" end="00:51:21.650" style="s2">polluting the stream and the people</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.490" end="00:51:23.180" style="s2">downstream or it&#39;s not the widths are</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.650" end="00:51:24.680" style="s2">not better for them in the in the net</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.180" end="00:51:26.450" style="s2">right so they have the ability to create</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.680" end="00:51:27.890" style="s2">an impact currency on that collective</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.450" end="00:51:29.270" style="s2">and start coming up and they come up</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.890" end="00:51:31.130" style="s2">with a metric of them out of sludge</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.270" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">that&#39;s going into the creek or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.130" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">and they can just assign that metric now</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:36.859" style="s2">if they&#39;re the only ones in the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:38.900" style="s2">who care about that it won&#39;t mean much</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.859" end="00:51:40.430" style="s2">that&#39;s a fact but it will be there and</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.900" end="00:51:42.109" style="s2">as more and more people start to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.430" end="00:51:43.849" style="s2">identify hey what lay I&#39;m gonna look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.109" end="00:51:45.680" style="s2">the impact currency oh look at this</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.849" end="00:51:48.109" style="s2">negative six million four hundred</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.680" end="00:51:50.119" style="s2">billion or whatever that they have that</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.109" end="00:51:52.309" style="s2">they&#39;ve that their account is holding</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.119" end="00:51:53.690" style="s2">from this community somebody can look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.309" end="00:51:54.980" style="s2">that and if that becomes important and</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.690" end="00:51:56.299" style="s2">that catches on that becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.980" end="00:51:59.510" style="s2">important metric that people want to pay</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.299" end="00:52:01.609" style="s2">attention to now it means something yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.510" end="00:52:03.710" style="s2">right so it&#39;s all interpersonal meaning</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.609" end="00:52:05.359" style="s2">we don&#39;t get no one person or no one</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.710" end="00:52:07.549" style="s2">central bodies should in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.359" end="00:52:10.069" style="s2">determine what is impactful and what is</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.549" end="00:52:11.930" style="s2">good for life every actor in the system</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.069" end="00:52:13.460" style="s2">gets to play and then of course we need</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.930" end="00:52:14.930" style="s2">we need the people who will speak for</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.460" end="00:52:16.280" style="s2">the trees and speak for the creeks and</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.930" end="00:52:19.010" style="s2">speak for the mountains and speak for</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.280" end="00:52:21.380" style="s2">the birds and you know the Lorax we need</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.010" end="00:52:24.170" style="s2">all the Lorax among us to also</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.380" end="00:52:25.849" style="s2">participate and there&#39;s probably a role</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.170" end="00:52:27.680" style="s2">just for them and doing that in doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.849" end="00:52:29.869" style="s2">the best and of course the science can</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.680" end="00:52:31.609" style="s2">be involved actual data collection on</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.869" end="00:52:34.190" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t human experience</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.609" end="00:52:36.859" style="s2">related feedback mechanisms we can have</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.190" end="00:52:41.410" style="s2">data collection mechanisms you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.859" end="00:52:41.410" style="s2">people who are play those roles and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.750" end="00:52:48.710" style="s2">the what I would also say is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.150" end="00:52:51.740" style="s2">everything all the contributions you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.710" end="00:52:54.140" style="s2">making all of the all of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.740" end="00:52:55.160" style="s2">just there isn&#39;t there isn&#39;t a type of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.140" end="00:52:56.840" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.160" end="00:52:59.810" style="s2">that gets recorded in a type that</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.840" end="00:53:01.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t anything you want to record</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.810" end="00:53:02.990" style="s2">should be recorded that means if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.160" end="00:53:04.370" style="s2">want to record you know how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.990" end="00:53:08.270" style="s2">performing some kind of accountability</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.370" end="00:53:12.110" style="s2">for the world or or whatever it for 24</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.270" end="00:53:13.520" style="s2">hours a day that includes raising your</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.110" end="00:53:16.660" style="s2">children that includes being mom that</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.520" end="00:53:19.400" style="s2">includes all the things you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.660" end="00:53:21.020" style="s2">and and that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.400" end="00:53:24.550" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s more vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.020" end="00:53:26.660" style="s2">transparent than not doing it right so</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.550" end="00:53:28.520" style="s2">yeah the issue is a lot of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.660" end="00:53:30.500" style="s2">can&#39;t actually I can tell you what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.520" end="00:53:32.390" style="s2">doing for 24 hours</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.500" end="00:53:33.980" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look productive right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.390" end="00:53:35.330" style="s2">spending quality time with my kid for an</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.980" end="00:53:37.550" style="s2">hour oh wait what are you doing together</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.330" end="00:53:39.890" style="s2">23 hours right well I&#39;m sleeping for 12</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.550" end="00:53:41.210" style="s2">of those hours I&#39;m you know down time</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.890" end="00:53:42.890" style="s2">watching television because my brain</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.210" end="00:53:44.990" style="s2">can&#39;t you know like there&#39;s a lot that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.890" end="00:53:46.940" style="s2">looks like unproductive time and it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.990" end="00:53:48.830" style="s2">unproductive time but it allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.940" end="00:53:51.260" style="s2">have the productive time right other</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.830" end="00:53:53.540" style="s2">people and that ratio is completely</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.260" end="00:53:58.280" style="s2">different right they can rotate week I</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.540" end="00:54:00.080" style="s2">can&#39;t assign hours very common in game a</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.280" end="00:54:02.240" style="s2">is the judgment about what we you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.080" end="00:54:04.130" style="s2">you just lose that we can lose the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.240" end="00:54:07.610" style="s2">judgment we all know that we&#39;re all just</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.130" end="00:54:08.690" style="s2">doing what we can yeah and that&#39;s who we</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.610" end="00:54:10.880" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.690" end="00:54:12.410" style="s2">and of course basic needs do need to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.880" end="00:54:13.970" style="s2">met ultimately anything that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.410" end="00:54:15.230" style="s2">anyway we&#39;re gonna be able to shift into</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.970" end="00:54:17.330" style="s2">this is gonna support people in their</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.230" end="00:54:19.760" style="s2">basic needs no matter what like you hear</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.330" end="00:54:20.960" style="s2">you play and that&#39;s what we try to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.760" end="00:54:22.640" style="s2">through programs like welfare but</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.960" end="00:54:24.980" style="s2">there&#39;s very much a social judgement</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.640" end="00:54:27.170" style="s2">about all that so you&#39;re on welfare so</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.980" end="00:54:29.630" style="s2">now you&#39;re not a productive like lose</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.170" end="00:54:32.150" style="s2">all that because it&#39;s it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.630" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">know it&#39;s just it&#39;s just okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.150" end="00:54:36.820" style="s2">you have to try really hard to not be</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:39.290" style="s2">giving anything to the world actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.820" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">like what if you choose to smoke pot and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.290" end="00:54:43.010" style="s2">sit around play video games all day I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">like I&#39;m literally smoking pot and</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.010" end="00:54:46.490" style="s2">playing video games or watching TV all</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:46.790" style="s2">day and I figure out how to save the</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.490" end="00:54:49.040" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.790" end="00:54:50.630" style="s2">so you can&#39;t really discount that like</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.040" end="00:54:52.730" style="s2">you really you&#39;re having conversations</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.630" end="00:54:54.650" style="s2">you&#39;re part of the world you&#39;re still</p>

<p begin="00:55:34.280" end="00:55:38.300" style="s2">know if there&#39;s more than one runs the</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.540" end="00:55:39.530" style="s2">endgame be thanked and common planning</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.300" end="00:55:41.510" style="s2">he&#39;s the one who actually introduced me</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.530" end="00:55:43.160" style="s2">to gain B I found him we put each other</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.510" end="00:55:44.690" style="s2">on Twitter and we talked like a year in</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.160" end="00:55:47.300" style="s2">a bit ago and then he interested you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.690" end="00:55:49.730" style="s2">be in September but I really like their</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.300" end="00:55:51.860" style="s2">currency there they came up with it for</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.730" end="00:55:53.120" style="s2">like a resource-based economy but not</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.860" end="00:55:55.240" style="s2">they can actually get to a</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.120" end="00:55:57.800" style="s2">resource-based economy so the basic</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.240" end="00:56:01.190" style="s2">understand gets a universal basic income</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.800" end="00:56:03.770" style="s2">just for existing but how currency is</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.190" end="00:56:05.510" style="s2">generated is by working and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.770" end="00:56:09.170" style="s2">spent and it goes into the ether it</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.510" end="00:56:10.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t circulate so if I if I think my</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.170" end="00:56:12.620" style="s2">neighbor needs their house cleaned and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.760" end="00:56:14.750" style="s2">offer that to them and I go and clean</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.620" end="00:56:15.860" style="s2">their house for them I&#39;m getting paid to</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.750" end="00:56:19.970" style="s2">clean their house that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.860" end="00:56:21.490" style="s2">paying me right it&#39;s like I can choose</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.970" end="00:56:23.480" style="s2">where my Labor&#39;s most needed</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.490" end="00:56:25.010" style="s2">meaning it&#39;s probably going to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.480" end="00:56:26.990" style="s2">currencies generated in that way I have</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.010" end="00:56:28.670" style="s2">a whole other issues I&#39;m like awake then</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.990" end="00:56:30.110" style="s2">why would I ever clean my house my</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.670" end="00:56:31.640" style="s2">neighbor cleans my house and I clean</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.110" end="00:56:35.270" style="s2">their house and we generate an income</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.640" end="00:56:37.460" style="s2">perfect and other other things like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.270" end="00:56:38.810" style="s2">but I like I like that idea for currency</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.460" end="00:56:41.990" style="s2">if there&#39;s gonna be a currency for</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.810" end="00:56:46.420" style="s2">together tech my vision not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.990" end="00:56:49.280" style="s2">our vision is that you first look for</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.420" end="00:56:50.720" style="s2">the incentives that are internal that</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.280" end="00:56:52.820" style="s2">don&#39;t need to be paid and then when</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.720" end="00:56:54.620" style="s2">things aren&#39;t done under that under that</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.820" end="00:56:57.050" style="s2">umbrella then you start looking for its</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.620" end="00:57:00.320" style="s2">turtle incentives and so because I have</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.050" end="00:57:01.580" style="s2">this three circle Venn diagram it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.320" end="00:57:02.780" style="s2">always around me somewhere because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.580" end="00:57:04.430" style="s2">written it out so many times it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.780" end="00:57:07.100" style="s2">for anything to get down in our economy</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.430" end="00:57:08.810" style="s2">you need one person to have the skill to</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.100" end="00:57:10.550" style="s2">do the tasks to be aware of the task</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.810" end="00:57:12.530" style="s2">needs to get down and to want to do the</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.550" end="00:57:14.420" style="s2">task and there&#39;s a way to compensate for</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.530" end="00:57:15.740" style="s2">all of that our current economy is only</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.420" end="00:57:17.600" style="s2">about compensating for people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.740" end="00:57:19.130" style="s2">want to do the tasks and we just pay and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.600" end="00:57:21.019" style="s2">you&#39;ve never actually got the internal</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.130" end="00:57:24.019" style="s2">incentivization Wow</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.019" end="00:57:27.019" style="s2">you can create a system of information</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.019" end="00:57:28.519" style="s2">so people who are trained and wants to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.019" end="00:57:30.739" style="s2">do the task know the task needs to get</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.519" end="00:57:32.509" style="s2">done and in education systems you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.739" end="00:57:33.709" style="s2">train people who want to do the task and</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.509" end="00:57:36.169" style="s2">are aware of it but just don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.709" end="00:57:38.390" style="s2">then that other piece figures itself out</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.169" end="00:57:39.890" style="s2">mostly and the things that don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.390" end="00:57:42.469" style="s2">get done if it&#39;s just glaringly obvious</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.890" end="00:57:44.509" style="s2">they&#39;re not done right like potholes</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.469" end="00:57:46.039" style="s2">aren&#39;t filled and you just know potholes</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.509" end="00:57:47.539" style="s2">aren&#39;t filled then we keep asking what</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.039" end="00:57:48.469" style="s2">would get us to fill the potholes right</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.539" end="00:57:50.899" style="s2">is it that there aren&#39;t enough people</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.469" end="00:57:52.309" style="s2">trained do people not want to okay what</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.899" end="00:57:54.469" style="s2">what if there was music what if it was a</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.309" end="00:57:55.969" style="s2">fun festival to fill the potholes like</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.469" end="00:57:57.679" style="s2">what would get us to actually do it</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.969" end="00:57:59.359" style="s2">that&#39;s not just about great can we pay</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.679" end="00:58:05.539" style="s2">you 25 bucks an hour to fill them yeah</p>

<p begin="00:59:11.269" end="00:59:15.169" style="s2">wanted was like your your version of</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.279" end="00:59:17.299" style="s2">transparency so if I don&#39;t remember it</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.169" end="00:59:19.729" style="s2">like that because I love the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.299" end="00:59:23.059" style="s2">opting into transparency and there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.729" end="00:59:24.829" style="s2">also organizations that I&#39;m not willing</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.059" end="00:59:26.719" style="s2">to let them opt-in to transparency like</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.829" end="00:59:28.249" style="s2">government existing corporations I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.719" end="00:59:31.880" style="s2">like nope we&#39;re going to be transparent</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.249" end="00:59:33.990" style="s2">for you we&#39;re gonna write and we expect</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.880" end="00:59:35.400" style="s2">a politician to opt in to transparent</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.990" end="00:59:37.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like you opted into it when you</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.400" end="00:59:41.220" style="s2">joined politics like that was you opting</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.890" end="00:59:42.720" style="s2">in and we can we can record right if the</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.220" end="00:59:45.119" style="s2">informations there it just isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.720" end="00:59:47.190" style="s2">organized and we can organize it so that</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.119" end="00:59:50.100" style="s2">that is them opt into it in a way but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.190" end="00:59:52.710" style="s2">don&#39;t want your thoughts on yeah great</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.100" end="00:59:56.760" style="s2">one and you know the short answer is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.710" end="00:59:58.380" style="s2">moment we start judging the other</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.760" end="01:00:00.750" style="s2">because they&#39;re less transparent and</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.380" end="01:00:03.540" style="s2">remote we&#39;re getting into rivalry</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.750" end="01:00:04.560" style="s2">so we&#39;re saying now I&#39;m rivals with you</p>
