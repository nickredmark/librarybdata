<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:05.339" style="s2">fit I like my sense was that you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.510" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">locked on to the same idea that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.339" end="00:01:10.470" style="s2">been very interested in and to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:12.630" style="s2">like I haven&#39;t found that many other</p>

<p begin="00:01:12.630" end="00:01:17.420" style="s2">to that idea and I&#39;ve been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">sharing it when I&#39;ve had opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.420" end="00:01:23.720" style="s2">sharing ideas around that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:27.509" style="s2">concept in some of these kind of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.720" end="00:01:28.920" style="s2">change-making communities and even in</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.509" end="00:01:31.070" style="s2">those communities I found that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.920" end="00:01:33.299" style="s2">been you know a huge amount of interest</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.070" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">or there&#39;s been a little bit of interest</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.299" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t seem like large numbers</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:40.170" style="s2">of people have kind of got on board with</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">that with that kind of concept so yeah</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:50.070" style="s2">kind of philosophy and the ideas you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.689" end="00:01:52.950" style="s2">presenting it very much like in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.070" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">resonance with where I&#39;m coming from so</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.950" end="00:01:57.140" style="s2">I just thought it&#39;d be interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:01:57.140" style="s2">have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.040" end="00:02:05.600" style="s2">Haizi yes I also find talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.450" end="00:02:07.979" style="s2">global cooperative for a few years and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.600" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">even switch handshake okay fine global</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.979" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">tech cooperative like you can get behind</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">the tech part right like we all own</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:13.829" style="s2">Google we</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:16.260" style="s2">Facebook that&#39;s a piece you can get</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.829" end="00:02:19.319" style="s2">behind and no people don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.260" end="00:02:21.720" style="s2">vision they either kind of want no</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.319" end="00:02:23.189" style="s2">technology like Facebook and Google or</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.720" end="00:02:25.140" style="s2">the devil and we need to get rid of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.189" end="00:02:27.659" style="s2">completely and like what and go back to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.140" end="00:02:31.260" style="s2">what like no internet that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.659" end="00:02:32.790" style="s2">happening or they&#39;re like right create</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:34.230" style="s2">it and then we&#39;ll come onboard I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.790" end="00:02:35.939" style="s2">that&#39;s not the vision the vision is we</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.230" end="00:02:37.709" style="s2">have to create it together otherwise it</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.939" end="00:02:39.299" style="s2">has all the same pitfalls as everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.709" end="00:02:40.980" style="s2">else like it&#39;s like a week if I have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.299" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">create it themself or so I can&#39;t I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.980" end="00:02:45.060" style="s2">code and I don&#39;t have the money to go to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:46.590" style="s2">it but even if I could if I won the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.060" end="00:02:47.940" style="s2">lottery and did that then I have to sell</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.590" end="00:02:49.349" style="s2">it to you then you don&#39;t get to decide</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.940" end="00:02:51.810" style="s2">what&#39;s in it the point is to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.349" end="00:02:54.690" style="s2">technology that we own together and can</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.810" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">improve together and technology can give</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.690" end="00:02:58.799" style="s2">us it&#39;s not the end-all be-all it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:00.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t create utopia but creates the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.799" end="00:03:02.790" style="s2">infrastructure for us to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.840" end="00:03:04.379" style="s2">things at every level individually it</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.790" end="00:03:06.120" style="s2">can improve our lives in our collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.379" end="00:03:08.519" style="s2">that can improve our lives and globally</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.120" end="00:03:09.870" style="s2">it can definitely improve our lives for</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.519" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">able to have that data and information</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.870" end="00:03:17.069" style="s2">so yes it is nice to talk to someone who</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">shares that that vision so if you like</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.069" end="00:03:20.579" style="s2">how many have you found many other</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">people that you feel like have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.579" end="00:03:24.319" style="s2">got that same concept and they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.849" style="s2">interested in it or do you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.319" end="00:03:28.049" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of still on your own like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.849" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s a lot of people that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.049" end="00:03:31.260" style="s2">you&#39;re talking with who I guess are</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:35.190" style="s2">interested in kind of similar kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.260" end="00:03:37.409" style="s2">things I know for me like I was he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.190" end="00:03:39.510" style="s2">probably back in I think it was like at</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.409" end="00:03:41.430" style="s2">the end of 2011 which seems like</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.510" end="00:03:45.389" style="s2">absolutely ages ago now that I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.430" end="00:03:47.699" style="s2">the I first kind of got that idea and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.389" end="00:03:50.040" style="s2">came after years and years of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.699" end="00:03:52.379" style="s2">searching and trying to understand like</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.040" end="00:03:54.269" style="s2">what was coming next in human history</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.379" end="00:03:57.359" style="s2">and looking at all these different areas</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.269" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">like economics and politics and social</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.359" end="00:04:02.310" style="s2">networks when the idea kind of came</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">together that you could have this you</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.310" end="00:04:05.790" style="s2">know for me like I feel like it would it</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:08.250" style="s2">would start with like a social network</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.790" end="00:04:10.260" style="s2">because I feel like there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.250" end="00:04:13.620" style="s2">stuff about a social network this unique</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.260" end="00:04:15.269" style="s2">compared to other types of companies you</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.620" end="00:04:17.269" style="s2">know like the ability to kind of harness</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.269" end="00:04:19.530" style="s2">the input of lots of different people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.269" end="00:04:21.029" style="s2">enable them to coordinate to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.530" end="00:04:23.219" style="s2">decisions and to kind of harness</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.029" end="00:04:24.930" style="s2">collective intelligence but once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.219" end="00:04:26.110" style="s2">got that capacity that you could then</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.930" end="00:04:29.560" style="s2">actually start as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.110" end="00:04:31.449" style="s2">company expand and kind of start funding</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.560" end="00:04:33.750" style="s2">ventures in different kinds of markets</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.449" end="00:04:36.879" style="s2">and gradually grow this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.750" end="00:04:38.740" style="s2">conglomerate system which as it gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.879" end="00:04:42.159" style="s2">larger and more powerful it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.740" end="00:04:43.599" style="s2">capable of expanding more and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.159" end="00:04:45.699" style="s2">you can increase the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.599" end="00:04:47.650" style="s2">experimentation around different types</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.699" end="00:04:49.810" style="s2">of governance and all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.650" end="00:04:52.210" style="s2">and I think yeah once that idea like</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.810" end="00:04:53.710" style="s2">dawned on me it was just like Isis for</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.210" end="00:04:55.479" style="s2">me it felt like that was what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.710" end="00:04:57.699" style="s2">looking for for ages and I&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.479" end="00:04:59.800" style="s2">never ever since then that&#39;s just been</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.699" end="00:05:01.300" style="s2">in my mind like that&#39;s what it is you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.800" end="00:05:03.550" style="s2">know I still just got a very limited</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.300" end="00:05:05.650" style="s2">individuals perspective on it but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.550" end="00:05:08.729" style="s2">just certain that that is the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.650" end="00:05:08.729" style="s2">are the biggest problems were facing</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.849" end="00:05:16.539" style="s2">yeah so I had yeah wait like how did you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.729" end="00:05:18.699" style="s2">come to that conclusion that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.539" end="00:05:20.889" style="s2">even remember it feels like it was just</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.699" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">always there and also of course not</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.889" end="00:05:28.270" style="s2">because it&#39;s continually evolving as</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:30.099" style="s2">well I did a dislike hippie business</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.270" end="00:05:32.409" style="s2">course called groundswell here in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.099" end="00:05:33.849" style="s2">Vancouver which was amazing and every</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.409" end="00:05:35.889" style="s2">weekend is like you come up with like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.849" end="00:05:37.389" style="s2">social enterprise during it and every</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.659" end="00:05:45.849" style="s2">and everything was generally based on</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.759" end="00:05:52.300" style="s2">tech it was like an IMDB for politicians</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.849" end="00:05:53.830" style="s2">and a history thing Wow</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.300" end="00:05:57.159" style="s2">my brain is I&#39;ve been on zoom&#39; for way</p>

<p begin="00:08:27.909" end="00:08:32.020" style="s2">all of this like BS to get it out into</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.099" end="00:08:33.430" style="s2">the world and even then 9 out of 10 of</p>

<p begin="00:08:43.570" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">artists and teachers and if we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.730" end="00:08:49.870" style="s2">figure out how to get our basic needs</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:51.610" style="s2">met together then we don&#39;t need to have</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.870" end="00:08:52.960" style="s2">jobs outside right we don&#39;t need to have</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.700" end="00:09:00.910" style="s2">can actually and I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.170" end="00:09:03.460" style="s2">happens at all with a flip of a switch</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.910" end="00:09:04.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like incrementally we incrementally</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.460" end="00:09:07.240" style="s2">make people&#39;s lives better so they can</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.660" end="00:09:09.160" style="s2">show up more so that they can help make</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.240" end="00:09:12.280" style="s2">other people&#39;s lives better and ends</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.160" end="00:09:13.450" style="s2">dealing with the and so I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.280" end="00:09:15.550" style="s2">know if answered your question James</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.450" end="00:09:17.050" style="s2">that I came to it and it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.550" end="00:09:18.850" style="s2">evolving constantly because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.050" end="00:09:20.950" style="s2">all of these instrument pieces of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.850" end="00:09:24.340" style="s2">the tech and the people and the process</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.950" end="00:09:26.020" style="s2">and I&#39;m not it&#39;s not something that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.340" end="00:09:28.060" style="s2">can fail at because it&#39;s not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.020" end="00:09:30.340" style="s2">something that stops until it exists in</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.060" end="00:09:31.690" style="s2">the world like it&#39;s like okay does it</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.340" end="00:09:32.730" style="s2">matter how many times it breaks or how</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.690" end="00:09:34.720" style="s2">many times people don&#39;t show up</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.730" end="00:09:36.640" style="s2">whoever&#39;s there we&#39;re gonna figure it</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.720" end="00:09:39.310" style="s2">out and move forward and then break it</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:41.470" style="s2">and figure it out and move forward yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.310" end="00:09:43.750" style="s2">yeah and I think all of these little</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.470" end="00:09:45.850" style="s2">steps are you know that it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.750" end="00:09:48.940" style="s2">aggregate they&#39;re kind of accumulate to</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.850" end="00:09:50.470" style="s2">be the gradual transformation I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.940" end="00:09:52.570" style="s2">yeah we need all those kind of little</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.470" end="00:09:54.520" style="s2">experimentations and discussions around</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.570" end="00:09:56.440" style="s2">different things and it&#39;s impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.520" end="00:09:58.030" style="s2">know what the kind of the effects are</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.440" end="00:09:59.710" style="s2">but I think especially in the case like</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.030" end="00:10:02.560" style="s2">with you putting everything online as</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.710" end="00:10:04.060" style="s2">well you know those ideas are seeding</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.560" end="00:10:06.130" style="s2">out to different people and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.060" end="00:10:07.900" style="s2">guess you&#39;ll never know who will reach</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.130" end="00:10:09.340" style="s2">up until now where I&#39;ve kind of come on</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.900" end="00:10:10.420" style="s2">it like I&#39;ve been watching for a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.340" end="00:10:13.510" style="s2">while and I&#39;ve found it really</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.420" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">interesting and yeah I&#39;ve appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.510" end="00:10:17.620" style="s2">the ideas that you shared and other</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:19.210" style="s2">people shared on the on the channel but</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.620" end="00:10:20.590" style="s2">they&#39;ll never know that I appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.210" end="00:10:22.960" style="s2">that and that might have influenced some</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.590" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">of my ideas and yeah so it&#39;s yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.960" end="00:10:28.780" style="s2">think that&#39;s very important and you are</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">you interested like one aspect of of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.780" end="00:10:32.350" style="s2">this life been quite interesting for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:37.270" style="s2">while is like the concept of mapping</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.350" end="00:10:40.360" style="s2">ideas to kind of you think about how to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.270" end="00:10:43.330" style="s2">explain it like I guess with like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.360" end="00:10:45.460" style="s2">food thing for example you could ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.330" end="00:10:46.990" style="s2">could kind of like you might someone in</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.460" end="00:10:50.140" style="s2">the group might come up with an idea and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.990" end="00:10:51.670" style="s2">could put it out there but I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.140" end="00:10:53.050" style="s2">of times in these kind of Commerce in</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.670" end="00:10:55.030" style="s2">these communities like the game be</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.050" end="00:10:56.530" style="s2">community you see ideas popping up but</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.030" end="00:10:58.990" style="s2">then they kind of just because of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.530" end="00:11:01.240" style="s2">design they end up getting lost again</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.990" end="00:11:02.800" style="s2">they kind of sink down outside and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.240" end="00:11:03.940" style="s2">it&#39;s not that that was you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:05.710" style="s2">still valuable like it will have</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.940" end="00:11:06.460" style="s2">impacted certain people but I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.710" end="00:11:09.910" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.460" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">have we could develop tools or use</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.910" end="00:11:15.670" style="s2">existing tools to actually kind of start</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:19.690" style="s2">mapping those ideas onto something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.670" end="00:11:20.860" style="s2">can grow and evolve over time so like</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.690" end="00:11:23.800" style="s2">this there&#39;s an article ever written</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.860" end="00:11:26.529" style="s2">about the kind of a concept called I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.800" end="00:11:29.020" style="s2">called knowledge mapping which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.529" end="00:11:33.430" style="s2">enabling communities to or group to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.020" end="00:11:36.190" style="s2">people you know distributed to to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.430" end="00:11:37.810" style="s2">ideas and I think it&#39;s there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.190" end="00:11:39.940" style="s2">kind of like similar dynamics in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.810" end="00:11:41.940" style="s2">brain where you know if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.940" end="00:11:45.220" style="s2">like there&#39;s all these different neurons</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.940" end="00:11:46.510" style="s2">and each of them is kind of processing</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.220" end="00:11:50.200" style="s2">little bits of information but</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.510" end="00:11:53.170" style="s2">collaboratively they evolve you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.200" end="00:11:54.730" style="s2">complex models over time and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.170" end="00:11:56.860" style="s2">like one neuron isn&#39;t able to hold that</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.730" end="00:11:59.170" style="s2">whole mall but it might spark a process</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.860" end="00:12:03.670" style="s2">of thinking that then evolves a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.170" end="00:12:05.110" style="s2">a model and yeah so like one one thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.670" end="00:12:07.270" style="s2">that I&#39;m kind of interested in this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.110" end="00:12:08.800" style="s2">mapping this idea of a global tech</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.270" end="00:12:10.300" style="s2">cooperative like one of the different</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.800" end="00:12:13.150" style="s2">areas within that that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.300" end="00:12:17.560" style="s2">explored and that we need to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.150" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">evolve a more detailed resolution in our</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.560" end="00:12:23.800" style="s2">understanding of so like you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:25.420" style="s2">governance would be one area funding</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.800" end="00:12:28.180" style="s2">would be another area you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.420" end="00:12:29.500" style="s2">all these different areas but taking an</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.180" end="00:12:31.209" style="s2">approach of map and you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.500" end="00:12:32.860" style="s2">start off and just say okay governance</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.209" end="00:12:34.839" style="s2">is one thing you could make a little</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.860" end="00:12:36.700" style="s2">note for that or a little area for that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.839" end="00:12:38.800" style="s2">and then within that other people can go</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.700" end="00:12:39.910" style="s2">in and they can share little ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.800" end="00:12:41.410" style="s2">then other people can look at those</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.910" end="00:12:43.240" style="s2">ideas and they can add a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.410" end="00:12:45.670" style="s2">on and gradually at a time you get this</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.240" end="00:12:52.420" style="s2">kind of evolving map that increases in</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.670" end="00:12:54.820" style="s2">detail and and depth so yeah yeah no I</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.420" end="00:12:56.620" style="s2">mean I think both the visualization of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.820" end="00:12:57.970" style="s2">information is very important to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.620" end="00:13:00.700" style="s2">which is why I want all this stuff to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.970" end="00:13:02.709" style="s2">out there I have sat in my room and come</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.700" end="00:13:04.180" style="s2">up with the solute the solution for all</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.709" end="00:13:05.740" style="s2">of those things right the funding the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.180" end="00:13:08.260" style="s2">governance all of this stuff for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.740" end="00:13:10.029" style="s2">technology cooperative and then came to</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.260" end="00:13:12.790" style="s2">the realization over a year ago that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.029" end="00:13:14.230" style="s2">before I even encounter game B like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.790" end="00:13:15.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work because then I have to sell</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.230" end="00:13:17.079" style="s2">it to people and I actually can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.520" end="00:13:19.000" style="s2">communicate the whole picture so how</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.079" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">would I sell it to anyone so instead</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.000" end="00:13:21.559" style="s2">it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:23.269" style="s2">like bringing the people together to</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.559" end="00:13:25.429" style="s2">have those discussions right I have at</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.269" end="00:13:27.110" style="s2">least one option for governance and one</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.429" end="00:13:29.209" style="s2">option for funding right but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.110" end="00:13:30.980" style="s2">well there&#39;s pros and cons to everything</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.209" end="00:13:32.600" style="s2">so what would be the best and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.980" end="00:13:33.920" style="s2">also gonna be different based on do we</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.600" end="00:13:37.160" style="s2">have four people or do we have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.920" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">thousand people and mine most of my</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.160" end="00:13:40.790" style="s2">ideas are more designed for the ten</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:42.379" style="s2">thousand a thousand to ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.790" end="00:13:44.360" style="s2">people they&#39;re not designed for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.379" end="00:13:46.040" style="s2">floor but for it&#39;s not like that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.360" end="00:13:47.720" style="s2">yeah I mean like having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.040" end="00:13:50.240" style="s2">to come into a consensus with four</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.720" end="00:13:51.649" style="s2">people isn&#39;t rocket science even if</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:52.819" style="s2">there is still interpersonal dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.649" end="00:13:55.459" style="s2">and stuff that can make it a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.819" end="00:13:57.559" style="s2">difficult but having like the people</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.459" end="00:13:59.809" style="s2">come together to to do that but in order</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.559" end="00:14:00.949" style="s2">for that to happen I do think that needs</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.809" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">to be mapped out a little better right</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.949" end="00:14:04.369" style="s2">like these are the areas we need to talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:06.529" style="s2">about right the governance the finance</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.369" end="00:14:08.029" style="s2">and then having ways for people to have</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.529" end="00:14:09.980" style="s2">that conversation that isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.029" end="00:14:11.240" style="s2">currently is done which I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.980" end="00:14:13.129" style="s2">you&#39;re envisioning it to me but like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.240" end="00:14:14.600" style="s2">forum right like a forum to me just</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.129" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">isn&#39;t I don&#39;t want to participate in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.600" end="00:14:18.679" style="s2">forum I don&#39;t want to like come in and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:20.300" style="s2">add something and have to read everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.679" end="00:14:21.290" style="s2">else&#39;s stuff I can&#39;t even read it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.300" end="00:14:23.209" style="s2">of the reasons I didn&#39;t read all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.290" end="00:14:25.850" style="s2">other stuff is it doesn&#39;t stick in my</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.209" end="00:14:27.709" style="s2">brain like it used to and so what works</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.850" end="00:14:30.949" style="s2">for me is a conversation and so what</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.709" end="00:14:33.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve the idea cafe was supposed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.949" end="00:14:34.730" style="s2">platform that looked like the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.230" end="00:14:36.559" style="s2">channel does right we&#39;re forward for</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.730" end="00:14:38.149" style="s2">people come together spend a half an</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.559" end="00:14:39.290" style="s2">hour to an hour answering a question and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.149" end="00:14:41.209" style="s2">then you switch tables and either answer</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.290" end="00:14:43.910" style="s2">the same question or built-on question</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.209" end="00:14:45.290" style="s2">and it&#39;s creating different like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.910" end="00:14:46.850" style="s2">not even governance this governance is</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.290" end="00:14:49.429" style="s2">like how the tech company would be run</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.850" end="00:14:51.290" style="s2">right whereas how a decision making</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.429" end="00:14:54.879" style="s2">process happens right how we actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.290" end="00:14:57.799" style="s2">get an idea out into the world how we do</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.879" end="00:14:59.329" style="s2">project management right like how even</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.799" end="00:15:01.069" style="s2">if we have this thing we want to create</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.329" end="00:15:03.170" style="s2">how do we then actually create it how do</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.069" end="00:15:04.699" style="s2">we then decide and who gets paid for</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.170" end="00:15:07.399" style="s2">what and what is volunteer and what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.699" end="00:15:09.949" style="s2">isn&#39;t something that like one person can</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.399" end="00:15:11.509" style="s2">decide on and then and then dictate it</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.949" end="00:15:12.589" style="s2">to everyone else because then they have</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.509" end="00:15:14.540" style="s2">to dictate it to everyone else there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.589" end="00:15:16.309" style="s2">already that problem whereas if we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.540" end="00:15:18.230" style="s2">design that together right you like hey</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.309" end="00:15:19.759" style="s2">if you&#39;re putting in an hour a week no</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.230" end="00:15:21.649" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna pay for it but if</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.759" end="00:15:23.089" style="s2">you&#39;re putting in you know like six</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.649" end="00:15:24.980" style="s2">hours or this is your passion this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.089" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">like I mean for me it&#39;s weird because I</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.980" end="00:15:29.360" style="s2">don&#39;t I both feel like I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:31.189" style="s2">24/7 and I&#39;m not doing it at all like</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:32.629" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh this is when you find your</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.189" end="00:15:33.740" style="s2">genius in your passion you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.629" end="00:15:35.420" style="s2">get paid for it and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.740" end="00:15:37.790" style="s2">just do it naturally all day every day</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.420" end="00:15:39.290" style="s2">and so I don&#39;t even know how I would get</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.790" end="00:15:40.940" style="s2">paid for it because I&#39;m like what am i</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.290" end="00:15:44.810" style="s2">working what am I not working to see me</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.940" end="00:15:46.340" style="s2">as doing this but at the same time if</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.810" end="00:15:48.230" style="s2">everyone else was like no you need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.340" end="00:15:50.150" style="s2">actually Bank your time and I&#39;d figure</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.230" end="00:15:51.620" style="s2">it out I&#39;d be like okay when I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.150" end="00:15:53.240" style="s2">meeting maybe that counts or that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.620" end="00:15:54.710" style="s2">doesn&#39;t does this count right or it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.240" end="00:15:56.930" style="s2">only the board meeting count I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.710" end="00:15:58.250" style="s2">know I don&#39;t care that&#39;s game a I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.930" end="00:16:00.530" style="s2">care about getting money for my time I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.250" end="00:16:05.330" style="s2">care about creating a better world but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.530" end="00:16:07.850" style="s2">do need to eat yeah well one idea that</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.330" end="00:16:09.740" style="s2">I&#39;ve discussed with a few friends around</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.850" end="00:16:11.900" style="s2">this kind of subject of like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.740" end="00:16:14.030" style="s2">how do you allocate resources and like</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.900" end="00:16:16.910" style="s2">fun people to contribute to the building</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.030" end="00:16:18.920" style="s2">of this kind of a system and I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.910" end="00:16:20.450" style="s2">like I&#39;m really interested in the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.920" end="00:16:23.000" style="s2">of like giving people the tools such as</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.450" end="00:16:24.680" style="s2">very easily tip each other for you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.000" end="00:16:27.320" style="s2">any kind of contribution in a social</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.680" end="00:16:29.980" style="s2">network but another side of it is also</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.320" end="00:16:33.350" style="s2">creating like what I&#39;ve kind of called</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.980" end="00:16:35.240" style="s2">like crowdfunded bounty rewards so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.350" end="00:16:37.010" style="s2">kind of tended to imagine this in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.240" end="00:16:38.780" style="s2">context of web development like an</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.010" end="00:16:41.570" style="s2">open-source web development project</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.780" end="00:16:43.190" style="s2">where there&#39;s a user base that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.570" end="00:16:44.900" style="s2">large and there&#39;s there&#39;s lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.190" end="00:16:48.410" style="s2">who say for example want a new feature</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.900" end="00:16:50.060" style="s2">bill and they can you know anyone within</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.410" end="00:16:51.710" style="s2">that community can put forward an idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.060" end="00:16:54.050" style="s2">they could say hey we could be amazing</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.710" end="00:16:55.520" style="s2">if we had this feature and then other</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.050" end="00:16:57.440" style="s2">people can comment on that they can</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.520" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">start to kind of accumulate information</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.440" end="00:17:02.650" style="s2">around that maybe links to other</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.880" end="00:17:06.170" style="s2">relevant bits of information and then as</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.650" end="00:17:07.610" style="s2">as as it got enough support you could</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.170" end="00:17:09.500" style="s2">kind of have a almost like a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.610" end="00:17:11.630" style="s2">threshold depending on how large the</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.500" end="00:17:12.890" style="s2">community was but once a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.630" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">of people had showed that they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.890" end="00:17:17.720" style="s2">interested in that idea it could then go</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:19.760" style="s2">to some kind of like member vote and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.720" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">then if it was accepted by the members</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.760" end="00:17:24.100" style="s2">and it was like I&#39;ve kind of imagined</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:26.990" style="s2">this also involving a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.100" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">community Constitution a co-authored</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.990" end="00:17:31.400" style="s2">Constitution which would have certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:33.320" style="s2">boundaries but let&#39;s say that it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.400" end="00:17:35.330" style="s2">like across the threshold of being the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.320" end="00:17:38.180" style="s2">user base we&#39;re interested in it passes</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.330" end="00:17:40.460" style="s2">the criteria of the Constitution then it</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.180" end="00:17:42.020" style="s2">becomes like an official task and once</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.460" end="00:17:43.640" style="s2">it&#39;s there then you kind of all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.020" end="00:17:46.250" style="s2">information about the task is gathered</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.640" end="00:17:47.610" style="s2">in one place and people can start to</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.250" end="00:17:49.620" style="s2">then tip money to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.610" end="00:17:52.140" style="s2">ask it can almost like crowd fund money</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.620" end="00:17:54.000" style="s2">towards it the more money that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.140" end="00:17:56.820" style="s2">accumulate around the task the greater</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.000" end="00:17:58.410" style="s2">the incentive developers for example to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.820" end="00:18:00.179" style="s2">come in and say hey I&#39;ll do that task</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.410" end="00:18:02.429" style="s2">for that you know if I can get that</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.179" end="00:18:05.010" style="s2">bounty rewarded in return I&#39;ll take on</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.429" end="00:18:06.179" style="s2">that task I&#39;ll do it and if there was</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.010" end="00:18:09.059" style="s2">like you know if there&#39;s a really big</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.179" end="00:18:11.010" style="s2">task and if the money that had been</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.059" end="00:18:12.179" style="s2">raised for it was was significant than</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.010" end="00:18:14.580" style="s2">you would expect that there might even</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.179" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">be lots of developers and lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.580" end="00:18:19.170" style="s2">wanting to kind of compete to complete</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.799" end="00:18:21.900" style="s2">that task and then there could be</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.170" end="00:18:24.090" style="s2">processes where it&#39;s decided who&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.900" end="00:18:25.710" style="s2">suited to complete that and then it can</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.090" end="00:18:29.490" style="s2">be a kind of a process of review as it</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.710" end="00:18:31.830" style="s2">gets worked on but I think that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.490" end="00:18:34.200" style="s2">dynamic is really interesting to me like</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.830" end="00:18:36.299" style="s2">how communities can come up with ideas</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.200" end="00:18:39.809" style="s2">and they can create incentives and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.299" end="00:18:41.640" style="s2">can it&#39;s almost like to me like the you</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.809" end="00:18:43.169" style="s2">know the dynamics in capitalism where</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.640" end="00:18:44.760" style="s2">where there&#39;s like an interest for</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.169" end="00:18:46.380" style="s2">something and there&#39;s money available</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.760" end="00:18:48.090" style="s2">for it then you start getting people</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.380" end="00:18:50.910" style="s2">building companies around those things</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.090" end="00:18:52.679" style="s2">and evolving ways of providing services</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.910" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">to meet those but this is kind of a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.679" end="00:18:57.090" style="s2">that you can harness those dynamics but</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:19:00.540" style="s2">within a kind of open source community</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.090" end="00:19:01.950" style="s2">collaborative platform so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.540" end="00:19:03.030" style="s2">kind of thing will be awesome and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.950" end="00:19:05.160" style="s2">know like the kind of stuff that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.030" end="00:19:06.809" style="s2">doing at the moment I&#39;m sure would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.160" end="00:19:09.330" style="s2">seen as valuable and there would be you</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.809" end="00:19:11.850" style="s2">know people could tip that and yes I</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.330" end="00:19:14.820" style="s2">think that kind of a system is I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.850" end="00:19:16.470" style="s2">is very possible I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.820" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">things at the moment is just is just</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.470" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">getting the technology there so I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">feel like this is one of the steps at</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:24.270" style="s2">the moment it&#39;s just building that kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:27.240" style="s2">of like seed social network that&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.270" end="00:19:33.299" style="s2">enough of the features in play</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.240" end="00:19:34.470" style="s2">oh hello by myself oh no you popped out</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.299" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">but then when you popped in I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.470" end="00:19:38.580" style="s2">have to add you you were it was like</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:39.330" style="s2">close enough I guess that is just that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.580" end="00:19:43.980" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.330" end="00:19:45.419" style="s2">yeah I was here they um for me like I am</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.980" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">I come for a resource-based economy</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.419" end="00:19:49.710" style="s2">background like that&#39;s what my vision</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:51.510" style="s2">for the future is so a lot of what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.710" end="00:19:54.299" style="s2">designed is absolutely not designed</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.510" end="00:19:56.460" style="s2">around trading time for money or doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.299" end="00:19:59.309" style="s2">it in a way that paid for it</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.460" end="00:20:00.659" style="s2">but if that&#39;s what incentivizes most</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.309" end="00:20:01.980" style="s2">people that&#39;s what they need to be in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.659" end="00:20:04.710" style="s2">place in order for the work to get done</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.980" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">then I have zero problem not being the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.710" end="00:20:09.270" style="s2">thing that generates it my problem with</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:10.500" style="s2">something like tipping is that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.270" end="00:20:11.820" style="s2">know if anyone would see value in what</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.500" end="00:20:13.440" style="s2">I&#39;m doing and I don&#39;t be enough from an</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.820" end="00:20:16.020" style="s2">egotistical I need money give me money</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.440" end="00:20:18.210" style="s2">way but like it&#39;s very easy to be like</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.020" end="00:20:19.830" style="s2">oh you coded that thing right that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.210" end="00:20:22.020" style="s2">clearly is like I can see the tangible</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.830" end="00:20:24.120" style="s2">thing whereas like emotional support or</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.020" end="00:20:27.799" style="s2">other things like the artistic</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.120" end="00:20:27.799" style="s2">contributions things aren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.890" end="00:20:31.500" style="s2">marked like we don&#39;t necessarily think</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.909" end="00:20:33.480" style="s2">of them as I was monetizing them because</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.500" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">they&#39;re not seen as in the same way and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.480" end="00:20:37.830" style="s2">at the same time then were incentivized</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:39.380" style="s2">to pick the thing that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.830" end="00:20:42.690" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna give us the most money</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.380" end="00:20:44.159" style="s2">instead of what what do I want to do so</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.690" end="00:20:47.429" style="s2">my visions a little more on this side of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.159" end="00:20:49.380" style="s2">like doing volunteer work as much as</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.429" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">possible until stuff doesn&#39;t get done</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.380" end="00:20:52.080" style="s2">and then you stand centralized for it</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:54.210" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.080" end="00:20:56.580" style="s2">way just that like I for me like I said</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.210" end="00:20:58.679" style="s2">I do this for free right like I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.580" end="00:21:00.120" style="s2">this is I can&#39;t pay me not to do this</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.679" end="00:21:01.470" style="s2">think if Google was like awesome I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.120" end="00:21:02.730" style="s2">give you a million dollars don&#39;t create</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.470" end="00:21:05.130" style="s2">your tech cooperative and that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.730" end="00:21:07.950" style="s2">happen yeah you like I&#39;m like this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.130" end="00:21:09.299" style="s2">aimed in and of itself and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.950" end="00:21:11.610" style="s2">more were able to tap into that I have</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.299" end="00:21:13.350" style="s2">this paper somewhere that showcases like</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.610" end="00:21:17.250" style="s2">how to get a task done it&#39;s like well if</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.350" end="00:21:18.779" style="s2">one person knows about the task can do</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.250" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">the task they have the skills for and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.779" end="00:21:22.169" style="s2">wants to do the task then they&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:23.940" style="s2">sweet spot you don&#39;t need to pay them</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.169" end="00:21:25.470" style="s2">the issue is our entire economy is based</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.940" end="00:21:26.880" style="s2">on people who know how to do the tasks</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.470" end="00:21:28.350" style="s2">know the task needs to get done it</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.880" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to do the task so we pay</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.350" end="00:21:31.350" style="s2">them and the other one of course if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:34.380" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to do it you can get</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.350" end="00:21:36.419" style="s2">trained and the biggest loss piece is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.380" end="00:21:38.490" style="s2">all the people who know how to do the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.419" end="00:21:40.090" style="s2">task and want to do the task but in no</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.490" end="00:21:42.310" style="s2">way no it needs to get done</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.090" end="00:21:43.780" style="s2">that&#39;s just a database right I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.310" end="00:21:46.120" style="s2">hey this pothole needs to get filled</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.780" end="00:21:48.070" style="s2">this logo needs to get made and putting</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.120" end="00:21:50.380" style="s2">it out to the community with zero token</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.070" end="00:21:52.000" style="s2">zero you know like maybe you can see how</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.380" end="00:21:54.400" style="s2">much you&#39;ve contributed but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.000" end="00:21:55.720" style="s2">getting paid to contribute until late</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.400" end="00:21:57.910" style="s2">this logo has been here for three weeks</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.720" end="00:21:59.290" style="s2">and no one&#39;s done it right so why</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.910" end="00:22:00.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t this work getting done and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.290" end="00:22:02.050" style="s2">finding ways to incentivize it beyond</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.790" end="00:22:04.510" style="s2">money just because of the incentives</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.050" end="00:22:05.860" style="s2">that come with money in my mind is very</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.510" end="00:22:08.530" style="s2">gaming I don&#39;t know how to get around</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.860" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">that with the tokens but I like gamify</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.530" end="00:22:11.860" style="s2">and I like you like all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:13.510" style="s2">around that so if that is again what</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.860" end="00:22:15.040" style="s2">would work to get people on board to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.510" end="00:22:16.990" style="s2">it I like the idea of voting on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.040" end="00:22:20.760" style="s2">things that are most important the issue</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.990" end="00:22:23.230" style="s2">is then like my vision for like we</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.760" end="00:22:25.180" style="s2">brainstorm the like the features we</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.230" end="00:22:27.430" style="s2">would want in it kind of design the beta</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.180" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">together and then pay someone to make it</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.430" end="00:22:32.650" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s probably like a tech</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:33.910" style="s2">team the bids on it or or again they do</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.650" end="00:22:37.860" style="s2">it for free when they&#39;re like not</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.910" end="00:22:40.690" style="s2">necessarily the actual</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.860" end="00:22:42.400" style="s2">full-time work what they do for free but</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.690" end="00:22:43.930" style="s2">if you have dozens of tech teams</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.400" end="00:22:45.310" style="s2">competing for it where they&#39;re like hey</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.930" end="00:22:46.750" style="s2">here&#39;s what this would look like to us</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.310" end="00:22:48.550" style="s2">this is what it would look to us and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.750" end="00:22:50.530" style="s2">vote on which one we look the best who</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.550" end="00:22:52.450" style="s2">can do it for that price point and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.530" end="00:22:53.890" style="s2">both their staffs kept on that team</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.450" end="00:22:55.390" style="s2">where it&#39;s like wait you said you could</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.890" end="00:22:57.160" style="s2">do it for a hundred thousand and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.390" end="00:22:59.560" style="s2">at a million that&#39;s not within budget at</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.160" end="00:23:01.180" style="s2">all or we&#39;re just sorry you can only get</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.560" end="00:23:03.550" style="s2">a hundred thousand only if you you</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.180" end="00:23:05.080" style="s2">actually finish it but if I anyways like</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.550" end="00:23:06.700" style="s2">nothing is the end-all be-all</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.080" end="00:23:08.590" style="s2">right it&#39;s like finding ways to tweak it</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.700" end="00:23:10.870" style="s2">as we go like this is is the work</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.590" end="00:23:13.090" style="s2">getting done or the project good is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.870" end="00:23:15.850" style="s2">how do we have a pool of money like my</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.090" end="00:23:17.110" style="s2">vision was and again we&#39;re creating from</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.850" end="00:23:18.520" style="s2">the ground up so everyone gets to bring</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.110" end="00:23:20.260" style="s2">their ideas we get to figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.520" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">the what what are the pros and cons of</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.260" end="00:23:26.710" style="s2">each method was to have a catalog of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.720" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">apps that is worth and for people to put</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.710" end="00:23:31.570" style="s2">ten dollars a month into and and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:33.220" style="s2">have theoretically tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.570" end="00:23:35.350" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of members putting</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.220" end="00:23:37.780" style="s2">ten dollars a month into something that</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.350" end="00:23:39.460" style="s2">and the only reason when you had said</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.780" end="00:23:41.320" style="s2">about company is starting themselves</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.460" end="00:23:44.950" style="s2">right around that is like that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.320" end="00:23:46.870" style="s2">in my minds outcompetes game like like</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.950" end="00:23:49.170" style="s2">Google can out-compete that Facebook can</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.870" end="00:23:51.610" style="s2">open that but having an umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.170" end="00:23:53.050" style="s2">corporation where you don&#39;t have to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.610" end="00:23:55.720" style="s2">the HR you don&#39;t have to write</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.050" end="00:23:57.550" style="s2">company you can just run the idea right</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.720" end="00:23:59.830" style="s2">it&#39;s like I have the idea can I find a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.550" end="00:24:02.500" style="s2">team around it can i how do we continue</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.830" end="00:24:04.270" style="s2">forward with it how do we make the thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.500" end="00:24:06.280" style="s2">into the world that the most efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.270" end="00:24:08.260" style="s2">possible and some time might be from</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.280" end="00:24:10.660" style="s2">especially legal reasons in game a to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.260" end="00:24:12.220" style="s2">have its own company right and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.660" end="00:24:14.200" style="s2">other way like no this doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.220" end="00:24:17.080" style="s2">be a company yet or doesn&#39;t ever need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.200" end="00:24:18.490" style="s2">be a company and working through that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.080" end="00:24:22.030" style="s2">whole process is also a tech it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.490" end="00:24:25.090" style="s2">do we add on to like if I come up with</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.030" end="00:24:27.429" style="s2">an idea that is something that could be</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.090" end="00:24:29.140" style="s2">part of your app right and you own that</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.429" end="00:24:30.580" style="s2">up how do I get it to be part of yours</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.140" end="00:24:32.620" style="s2">because I don&#39;t want it like part of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.580" end="00:24:33.190" style="s2">this is as a user as someone who uses</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.620" end="00:24:35.890" style="s2">apps</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.190" end="00:24:37.660" style="s2">I don&#39;t want 50,000 apps on my phone and</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.890" end="00:24:40.570" style="s2">I want container communicate with each</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.660" end="00:24:42.429" style="s2">other and looking from that foundation</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.570" end="00:24:45.160" style="s2">of how do we make tech the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.429" end="00:24:47.580" style="s2">and the least risky and have people kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.160" end="00:24:50.020" style="s2">of there to support it as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.580" end="00:24:51.910" style="s2">although right now we are kind of down</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.020" end="00:24:54.760" style="s2">this path I don&#39;t necessarily care about</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.910" end="00:24:56.350" style="s2">getting a tech person&#39;s idea made into</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.760" end="00:24:57.640" style="s2">the world I care about the idea being in</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.350" end="00:24:59.050" style="s2">the world so the members can you so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.640" end="00:25:02.140" style="s2">users can use it right like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.050" end="00:25:03.850" style="s2">actually is that is the baby is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.140" end="00:25:06.309" style="s2">thing that changes the world that helps</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.850" end="00:25:08.440" style="s2">is the actual service that it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.309" end="00:25:10.540" style="s2">and so how can the best service out</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.440" end="00:25:13.530" style="s2">there for our members and right now that</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.540" end="00:25:15.610" style="s2">probably looks like buying them and or</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.530" end="00:25:17.230" style="s2">either creating them from scratch which</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.610" end="00:25:19.330" style="s2">is my vision or buying what already</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.230" end="00:25:21.429" style="s2">exists right which we have no money to</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.330" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">buy them but at the same time if 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.429" end="00:25:24.730" style="s2">people came together and put $10 into a</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:26.260" style="s2">pot we could buy it a out somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.730" end="00:25:27.220" style="s2">broader does know this I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.260" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">fee the ones that have already went</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.220" end="00:25:31.000" style="s2">bankrupt but they are still someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:32.950" style="s2">intellectual property right the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.000" end="00:25:36.400" style="s2">thing that got built again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.950" end="00:25:40.420" style="s2">again and then went under is anyway yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.400" end="00:25:42.280" style="s2">you know I totally agree and like going</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.420" end="00:25:43.510" style="s2">back to what you were saying earlier I I</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.280" end="00:25:46.900" style="s2">think it&#39;s I think you&#39;re right that</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.510" end="00:25:48.730" style="s2">like my kind of vision of an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.900" end="00:25:51.100" style="s2">society is not where everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.730" end="00:25:53.530" style="s2">motivated by money and I think this kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.100" end="00:25:55.780" style="s2">of like this creating incentives is</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.530" end="00:25:57.309" style="s2">useful but I think you want a society</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.780" end="00:25:59.800" style="s2">where there&#39;s enough abundance that</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.309" end="00:26:01.630" style="s2">people can basically be free to follow</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.800" end="00:26:02.980" style="s2">their passions and you know I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.630" end="00:26:04.450" style="s2">same boat where like I&#39;ve put an</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.980" end="00:26:06.140" style="s2">enormous amount of effort into this kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.450" end="00:26:07.910" style="s2">of stuff for years</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.140" end="00:26:09.590" style="s2">probably lost money overall or</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.910" end="00:26:12.620" style="s2">definitely have I&#39;ve not gained any</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.590" end="00:26:14.030" style="s2">money from it so but I love doing it you</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.620" end="00:26:15.710" style="s2">know it&#39;s like it&#39;s my passion so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.030" end="00:26:18.559" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m interested in as long as</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.710" end="00:26:20.600" style="s2">I&#39;m like getting by okay you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.559" end="00:26:23.330" style="s2">pretty content I&#39;m not after not half</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.600" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">the money but at the same time there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.330" end="00:26:27.049" style="s2">situations where there&#39;s like something</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:28.940" style="s2">that unloaded people really need done</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.049" end="00:26:30.530" style="s2">and maybe they haven&#39;t got the skills to</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.940" end="00:26:32.240" style="s2">do it and if there&#39;s a way that they can</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.530" end="00:26:34.610" style="s2">kind of like it could be coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.240" end="00:26:36.830" style="s2">through crowdfunding and there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.610" end="00:26:38.570" style="s2">like a process in place where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.830" end="00:26:40.460" style="s2">kind of a little battle of natural</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.570" end="00:26:43.250" style="s2">selection where the people who are most</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.460" end="00:26:45.830" style="s2">adapt for meeting that need are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.250" end="00:26:48.650" style="s2">selected and are then able to perform</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.830" end="00:26:50.169" style="s2">that function for the collective I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.650" end="00:26:54.500" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s really valuable as well</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.169" end="00:26:58.309" style="s2">and on one of your later points like I</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.500" end="00:27:00.350" style="s2">think I&#39;m quite interested in I my</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.309" end="00:27:01.820" style="s2">inclination is that I think we should I</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.350" end="00:27:03.410" style="s2">think we will need to actually build the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.820" end="00:27:06.669" style="s2">tech like I think the idea of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.410" end="00:27:09.290" style="s2">like buying other things other apps</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.669" end="00:27:11.630" style="s2">would come with certain disadvantages</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.290" end="00:27:13.610" style="s2">like I think if you if you build this</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.630" end="00:27:15.230" style="s2">platform from the ground up and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.610" end="00:27:17.120" style="s2">like if if people think through it</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.230" end="00:27:17.870" style="s2">really clearly like how the database is</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.120" end="00:27:20.059" style="s2">organized</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.870" end="00:27:21.770" style="s2">I think loads of these different apps</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.059" end="00:27:25.880" style="s2">like you&#39;re saying are actually really</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.770" end="00:27:27.890" style="s2">interoperable and you get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.880" end="00:27:30.740" style="s2">advantages by having them integrated</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.890" end="00:27:31.730" style="s2">within one system and you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.740" end="00:27:33.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people that are very</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.730" end="00:27:37.549" style="s2">afraid about that like this idea of kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.799" end="00:27:39.350" style="s2">of centralization and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.549" end="00:27:41.450" style="s2">companies like Google and Amazon and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.350" end="00:27:42.770" style="s2">stuff it&#39;s understandably I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.450" end="00:27:44.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a healthy fear about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.770" end="00:27:47.210" style="s2">because you get a huge amount of power</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.540" end="00:27:48.860" style="s2">with that centralization and if the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.210" end="00:27:50.840" style="s2">ownership structure is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.860" end="00:27:52.940" style="s2">dictatorial and opaque that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.840" end="00:27:54.890" style="s2">dangerous thing but if you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.940" end="00:27:57.020" style="s2">have that system and it&#39;s transparent</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.890" end="00:27:58.700" style="s2">and it&#39;s got you know distributed power</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.020" end="00:28:00.890" style="s2">and there&#39;s huge amount of participation</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.700" end="00:28:03.340" style="s2">involved you can kind of harness those</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.890" end="00:28:05.570" style="s2">advantages that come with centralization</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.340" end="00:28:08.059" style="s2">without with while avoiding the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.570" end="00:28:10.040" style="s2">disadvantages and I think it right like</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.059" end="00:28:13.280" style="s2">what we want is a kind of like a future</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.040" end="00:28:15.620" style="s2">like Facebook Google Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.280" end="00:28:17.090" style="s2">that&#39;s like owned by everyone and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.620" end="00:28:18.710" style="s2">got all the different features that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.090" end="00:28:19.850" style="s2">need and there&#39;s just a continuously</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.710" end="00:28:22.250" style="s2">evolving ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.850" end="00:28:26.419" style="s2">of different apps and tools that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.250" end="00:28:27.530" style="s2">evolving within it and yeah that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.419" end="00:28:29.840" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a huge amount of power</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.530" end="00:28:32.390" style="s2">that could that could be imation with</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.840" end="00:28:33.799" style="s2">that yeah absolutely and I agree that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.390" end="00:28:35.270" style="s2">think that designing them from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.799" end="00:28:36.650" style="s2">ground up together so they can</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.270" end="00:28:38.510" style="s2">interconnect with each other it makes</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.650" end="00:28:42.110" style="s2">more sense but where we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.510" end="00:28:44.210" style="s2">right now is that like the missions kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.110" end="00:28:46.309" style="s2">of like the Netflix of apps right so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.210" end="00:28:48.530" style="s2">customer is paying $10 to get it to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.309" end="00:28:50.450" style="s2">a catalog of apps which right now is</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.530" end="00:28:53.150" style="s2">each one is its own individual thing on</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.450" end="00:28:55.250" style="s2">your phone right so if instead of paying</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.150" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">$10 a month for your food one and $10</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.250" end="00:28:57.980" style="s2">one for your finance one and ten dollars</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:29:00.650" style="s2">a month for the one that&#39;s your personal</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.980" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">trainer we&#39;ve went and decided what are</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.650" end="00:29:04.789" style="s2">the best ones and hopefully we own the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:07.220" style="s2">best one and so for your $10 a month</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.789" end="00:29:08.510" style="s2">instead of $10 to each of them you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.220" end="00:29:10.490" style="s2">access to all of them</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.510" end="00:29:12.260" style="s2">the beauty about if that is the method</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.490" end="00:29:14.570" style="s2">that we choose to go forward with this</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.260" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">unlike Netflix and it does vote they</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.570" end="00:29:18.590" style="s2">have licensed content right which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:20.150" style="s2">most of their content then they have</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.590" end="00:29:21.770" style="s2">their own into the content that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.150" end="00:29:24.110" style="s2">created that&#39;s always going to be there</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.770" end="00:29:27.020" style="s2">like stranger things and stuff the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.110" end="00:29:29.590" style="s2">difference is Netflix can&#39;t knock off</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.020" end="00:29:30.860" style="s2">frozen right they can&#39;t knock off</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.590" end="00:29:32.450" style="s2">diehard</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.860" end="00:29:35.000" style="s2">no one&#39;s gonna watch the knockoff</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.450" end="00:29:36.980" style="s2">version it has to be the actual movie</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.000" end="00:29:39.650" style="s2">whereas we can write we can be like oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.980" end="00:29:41.690" style="s2">no one would sell us their app for a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.650" end="00:29:44.539" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars under the food</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.690" end="00:29:46.640" style="s2">umbrella so we&#39;re gonna create our own</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.539" end="00:29:49.070" style="s2">and it probably makes more sense to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.640" end="00:29:50.510" style="s2">create our own anyway but if we want a</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.070" end="00:29:52.039" style="s2">catalog we&#39;re not going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.510" end="00:29:53.240" style="s2">create everything all at once so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.039" end="00:29:54.289" style="s2">like okay well what&#39;s the best that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.240" end="00:29:56.179" style="s2">out there and what does it make the most</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.289" end="00:29:58.610" style="s2">sense to move on with next right what</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.179" end="00:30:01.039" style="s2">apps exist right because apps exist in</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.610" end="00:30:03.169" style="s2">all of these spaces mostly then are</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.039" end="00:30:04.309" style="s2">amazing and do help your life but</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.169" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">they&#39;re not interconnected with each</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.309" end="00:30:08.059" style="s2">other and you don&#39;t own them when we</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:09.409" style="s2">can&#39;t improve them and so having the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.059" end="00:30:10.490" style="s2">catalog but yeah with the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.409" end="00:30:12.289" style="s2">that one if you&#39;re not gonna sell it to</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.490" end="00:30:14.059" style="s2">us and we&#39;re not gonna own it so that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.289" end="00:30:15.020" style="s2">can talk if you have the data talk to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.059" end="00:30:16.280" style="s2">each other and then yeah we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.020" end="00:30:18.409" style="s2">gonna create one from the ground up we</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.280" end="00:30:21.679" style="s2">can recreate our frozen and our diehards</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.409" end="00:30:23.510" style="s2">and our Star Wars part of it it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.679" end="00:30:25.039" style="s2">Google and Facebook do right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.510" end="00:30:27.860" style="s2">oh we&#39;ll buy you oh we can&#39;t buy you</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.039" end="00:30:29.120" style="s2">great we&#39;ll just recreate a competing</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.860" end="00:30:31.490" style="s2">one and we got all the marketing and all</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.120" end="00:30:33.380" style="s2">people so we win we&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.490" end="00:30:35.720" style="s2">reverse it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.380" end="00:30:37.730" style="s2">sorry not sorry the people need people</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.720" end="00:30:39.170" style="s2">need food the people need education that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.730" end="00:30:41.990" style="s2">we believe and we can create the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.170" end="00:30:43.550" style="s2">technology that gives us yeah and is</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.990" end="00:30:46.370" style="s2">there&#39;s also like as I&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.550" end="00:30:48.470" style="s2">because up until about a year ago I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.370" end="00:30:49.940" style="s2">you know I was like invite like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.470" end="00:30:52.370" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve seen this this website we</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.940" end="00:30:54.140" style="s2">Co which is kind of it&#39;s like a an</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.370" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">open-source social network project that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.140" end="00:30:58.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve been involved in which has been my</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.480" end="00:31:02.180" style="s2">kind of like experimentation with these</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.430" end="00:31:04.160" style="s2">kinds of ideas and but I had been a</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.180" end="00:31:06.110" style="s2">coder myself up until about a year ago</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.160" end="00:31:07.670" style="s2">where I finally was just like I need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.110" end="00:31:10.340" style="s2">learn this stuff like I wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.670" end="00:31:11.960" style="s2">enjoying the job I was in so I&#39;ve in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.340" end="00:31:13.730" style="s2">last year I&#39;ve been like learning as</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.960" end="00:31:15.800" style="s2">much as I can and it&#39;s been really</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.730" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">rewarding and I feel like my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.800" end="00:31:20.360" style="s2">on like what needs to be done has</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:22.670" style="s2">developed quite a bit but there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.360" end="00:31:24.590" style="s2">amount of common common common ality</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.670" end="00:31:27.890" style="s2">between all the different apps that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.590" end="00:31:29.780" style="s2">see out there so like one thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.890" end="00:31:31.460" style="s2">be I could share with you after the call</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.780" end="00:31:33.740" style="s2">if you&#39;re interested is I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.460" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">creating a kind of like a database map</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.740" end="00:31:38.930" style="s2">of because I&#39;ve started kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.080" end="00:31:40.760" style="s2">recreating wiko myself now just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.930" end="00:31:43.580" style="s2">rebuilding it kind of as a learning</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.760" end="00:31:45.050" style="s2">experiment but it also it&#39;s in an old</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.580" end="00:31:47.810" style="s2">framework at the moment so it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.050" end="00:31:49.550" style="s2">needs rebuilding anyway but I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.810" end="00:31:52.100" style="s2">getting into now like the database</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.550" end="00:31:55.610" style="s2">design and creating like you know user</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.100" end="00:31:57.430" style="s2">databases and community databases and</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.610" end="00:31:59.480" style="s2">then linking them up and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.430" end="00:32:02.330" style="s2">visualizing the relationships between</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.480" end="00:32:03.740" style="s2">these different tables but yeah I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.330" end="00:32:05.510" style="s2">happy to share that with you because I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.740" end="00:32:07.940" style="s2">be interested in like what some of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.510" end="00:32:09.800" style="s2">different app ideas you have are and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.940" end="00:32:12.800" style="s2">like what would be required in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.800" end="00:32:15.380" style="s2">like the information in the database but</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.800" end="00:32:17.330" style="s2">yeah I think like we could you know you</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.380" end="00:32:19.880" style="s2">can have this this kind of transparent</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.330" end="00:32:24.230" style="s2">map so everyone can see exactly how data</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.880" end="00:32:25.490" style="s2">is being stored how its organized and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.230" end="00:32:27.290" style="s2">then also that would it would make it</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.490" end="00:32:29.600" style="s2">easier for other developers who wanted</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.290" end="00:32:31.040" style="s2">you know to develop a new tool instead</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.600" end="00:32:32.750" style="s2">of having to build the whole database</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.040" end="00:32:34.070" style="s2">and the user accounts and all these</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.750" end="00:32:35.510" style="s2">different things it&#39;s that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.070" end="00:32:38.030" style="s2">there all they need to do is the surface</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.510" end="00:32:40.370" style="s2">features yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.030" end="00:32:43.370" style="s2">I mean that is like a common data pool</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.370" end="00:32:45.350" style="s2">that&#39;s both like data data sorry like</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.370" end="00:32:46.610" style="s2">you know information on corporate on</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.350" end="00:32:48.650" style="s2">corporations information</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.610" end="00:32:50.210" style="s2">products information on scientific</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.650" end="00:32:52.460" style="s2">studies stuff that&#39;s already out there</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.210" end="00:32:54.350" style="s2">but not organized and then also our data</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.460" end="00:32:56.809" style="s2">right like what did I choose to buy</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.350" end="00:32:58.400" style="s2">where am I going MERS which I should own</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.809" end="00:33:00.710" style="s2">but I should also be empowered to use</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.400" end="00:33:03.110" style="s2">that for the collective good and so to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.710" end="00:33:05.330" style="s2">be able to have one data one database</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.110" end="00:33:06.500" style="s2">you can be centralized but like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.330" end="00:33:07.880" style="s2">you know I mean you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.500" end="00:33:09.380" style="s2">recreate the wheel you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.880" end="00:33:11.000" style="s2">read put in all the data for all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.380" end="00:33:12.500" style="s2">products because the products can be for</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.000" end="00:33:13.700" style="s2">the economics and you for politics and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.500" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">for the environment can be for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.700" end="00:33:16.820" style="s2">supply chain I mean there&#39;s a lot that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:19.370" style="s2">can come out of every piece of data and</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.820" end="00:33:21.650" style="s2">the interconnectedness and so yes having</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.370" end="00:33:23.570" style="s2">one common pool of data and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.650" end="00:33:25.040" style="s2">transparency on what that&#39;s used where</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.570" end="00:33:27.230" style="s2">it came from and what it&#39;s used for is</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.040" end="00:33:28.910" style="s2">important and then anyone can use that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.230" end="00:33:30.169" style="s2">mean that&#39;s a lot of what a lot of apps</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.910" end="00:33:32.210" style="s2">are built on but then they have to make</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.169" end="00:33:33.590" style="s2">their own right like how many recipe</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.210" end="00:33:35.990" style="s2">apps are there out there I don&#39;t well I</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.590" end="00:33:37.160" style="s2">know I want one place with recipes and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.990" end="00:33:38.990" style="s2">don&#39;t want to read your life story</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.160" end="00:33:40.820" style="s2">before I get to the recipe just want the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.990" end="00:33:42.290" style="s2">recipe and I want to be able to tweak it</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.820" end="00:33:44.000" style="s2">if I want to and be able to find other</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.290" end="00:33:46.160" style="s2">people and the taste buds like me and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.000" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">they even tried this recipe and said it</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.160" end="00:33:49.250" style="s2">was good and there&#39;s just like so much</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:51.770" style="s2">we can do when we&#39;re sharing information</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.250" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">with each other and creating I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.770" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">what the design is made like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:33:57.169" style="s2">what&#39;s hidden behind the scenes all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:33:59.870" style="s2">kind of back-end is actually made</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.169" end="00:34:01.910" style="s2">visible to to everyone on the surface</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.870" end="00:34:04.010" style="s2">and they&#39;re given the freedom to then</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.910" end="00:34:06.470" style="s2">work with it customize it and tweak it</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.010" end="00:34:08.270" style="s2">it just opens up so much possibility you</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.470" end="00:34:10.550" style="s2">know I&#39;m really interested in the idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.270" end="00:34:12.560" style="s2">of like you know looking at the game be</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.550" end="00:34:14.629" style="s2">community on Facebook it to me it just</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.560" end="00:34:16.220" style="s2">feels I think probably this is like you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.629" end="00:34:18.980" style="s2">know common feeling amongst most people</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.220" end="00:34:21.470" style="s2">that Facebook&#39;s framework and toolset</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.980" end="00:34:22.909" style="s2">feels very like restricting you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.470" end="00:34:24.740" style="s2">there&#39;s all these people there that have</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.909" end="00:34:26.060" style="s2">got really interesting perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.740" end="00:34:27.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge amount of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.060" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">and yeah we&#39;re kind of clashing against</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.950" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">each other and like a lot that could be</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:35.330" style="s2">done isn&#39;t getting done I think and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:37.159" style="s2">I think a lot of that&#39;s down to just the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.330" end="00:34:40.550" style="s2">limitations the framework but if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.159" end="00:34:42.260" style="s2">have this kind of open open system you</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.550" end="00:34:43.820" style="s2">know people like myself who were doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.260" end="00:34:46.040" style="s2">coding and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.820" end="00:34:47.750" style="s2">coders in that community to just start</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.040" end="00:34:50.119" style="s2">developing a new tool like a new way to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.750" end="00:34:52.340" style="s2">filter the the news feed or like a new</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.119" end="00:34:53.899" style="s2">polling tool or you know like something</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.340" end="00:34:55.639" style="s2">I&#39;m really interested in is data</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.899" end="00:34:58.160" style="s2">visualization you know like if you could</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.639" end="00:34:59.630" style="s2">just have access to the database of all</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.160" end="00:35:00.109" style="s2">the different data points that have been</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.630" end="00:35:02.119" style="s2">gathered</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.109" end="00:35:03.739" style="s2">by Facebook you know in the game be</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.119" end="00:35:05.989" style="s2">community and then you could visualize</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.739" end="00:35:09.009" style="s2">that in interesting ways and customize</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.989" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">that and so much creativity in so much</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.009" end="00:35:14.539" style="s2">information that could be made available</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:16.309" style="s2">and accessible so it&#39;s just a huge</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.539" end="00:35:18.319" style="s2">potential and I think it&#39;s inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.309" end="00:35:19.160" style="s2">that it&#39;s going to happen but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.319" end="00:35:19.759" style="s2">think it&#39;s going to happen through</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.160" end="00:35:21.920" style="s2">Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.759" end="00:35:23.630" style="s2">you know it&#39;d be amazing surprise if it</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.920" end="00:35:26.119" style="s2">did but I really don&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.630" end="00:35:28.730" style="s2">happening I mean Facebook isn&#39;t designed</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.119" end="00:35:30.650" style="s2">for for us to create game via and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.730" end="00:35:32.269" style="s2">just not it&#39;s designed for profit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.650" end="00:35:34.489" style="s2">designed for Zuckerberg and shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.269" end="00:35:37.190" style="s2">to make profit which means division and</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.489" end="00:35:40.039" style="s2">I mean half the tough stuff I pasted not</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.190" end="00:35:41.660" style="s2">post in facebook either in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.039" end="00:35:43.539" style="s2">individual groups or in the game B group</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.660" end="00:35:45.950" style="s2">itself or on even on my personal page</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.539" end="00:35:47.420" style="s2">most of its crickets most of it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.950" end="00:35:50.269" style="s2">like well how much of that is because</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.420" end="00:35:52.849" style="s2">Facebook doesn&#39;t maybe like me they they</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.269" end="00:35:54.559" style="s2">you know grey lists you or how much is</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.849" end="00:35:55.970" style="s2">just like what I&#39;m writing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.559" end="00:35:57.170" style="s2">resonating with people and so they see</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.970" end="00:35:59.329" style="s2">it but they don&#39;t understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.170" end="00:36:01.099" style="s2">going on or like how much they see it</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.329" end="00:36:02.900" style="s2">not connect with it or how much are they</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.099" end="00:36:04.279" style="s2">just not seeing it and then is it</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.900" end="00:36:06.710" style="s2">designed for them to do anything with</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.279" end="00:36:08.390" style="s2">anyway and so the more we can have those</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.710" end="00:36:09.710" style="s2">conversations of like here&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.390" end="00:36:11.569" style="s2">possible if a group of people get</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.710" end="00:36:13.880" style="s2">together what if we what if Facebook was</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.569" end="00:36:15.769" style="s2">designed for the collective good what if</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.880" end="00:36:18.739" style="s2">it was designed to help you find your</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.769" end="00:36:19.880" style="s2">people instead of getting in fights with</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.739" end="00:36:21.829" style="s2">your old high school friends and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.880" end="00:36:24.289" style="s2">extended family like if instead it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.829" end="00:36:25.579" style="s2">designed for you know not to be in that</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.289" end="00:36:27.380" style="s2">division because I guess them the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.579" end="00:36:29.839" style="s2">money with the algorithm but instead</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.380" end="00:36:31.190" style="s2">like oh here&#39;s more people who agree</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.839" end="00:36:32.329" style="s2">with you not so you can be in an echo</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.190" end="00:36:35.630" style="s2">chamber so you can actually create</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.329" end="00:36:37.130" style="s2">something together and yeah they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.630" end="00:36:38.839" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.130" end="00:36:40.519" style="s2">possibilities we can do a technology</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.839" end="00:36:42.799" style="s2">when it&#39;s created together because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.519" end="00:36:45.049" style="s2">if we have trust and we have funding and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.799" end="00:36:47.480" style="s2">we have the people it&#39;s all possible and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.049" end="00:36:49.220" style="s2">it&#39;s not like this is my one of my big</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.480" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">things about technology is most of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.220" end="00:36:53.450" style="s2">trade-offs that exist in regular</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:55.309" style="s2">business and regular life don&#39;t exist in</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.450" end="00:36:57.470" style="s2">technology or they can be mitigated in</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.309" end="00:36:59.089" style="s2">technology like the idea of like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.470" end="00:37:01.309" style="s2">individual in the group it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.089" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">you&#39;re born into a group and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.309" end="00:37:05.150" style="s2">either part of it or you&#39;re not right</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:06.289" style="s2">you&#39;re either like that thing and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.150" end="00:37:08.059" style="s2">fit in or you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.289" end="00:37:10.279" style="s2">whereas now with the Information Age and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.059" end="00:37:12.109" style="s2">that you can God find your people but</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.279" end="00:37:13.070" style="s2">it&#39;s not a given it&#39;s hard to find your</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.109" end="00:37:15.020" style="s2">people the more we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.070" end="00:37:16.280" style="s2">make that a possibility so if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.020" end="00:37:17.720" style="s2">need to choose between the individual in</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.280" end="00:37:19.430" style="s2">the group everyone can be an individual</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.720" end="00:37:21.890" style="s2">and find their group they resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.430" end="00:37:24.050" style="s2">I just can&#39;t dictate who your group is</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.890" end="00:37:25.940" style="s2">right I can&#39;t be like everyone has to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.050" end="00:37:27.560" style="s2">vegan everyone has to ride a bike</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.940" end="00:37:29.420" style="s2">everyone it&#39;s like you ride a bike you</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.560" end="00:37:31.970" style="s2">be vegan all you want and find your</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.420" end="00:37:34.370" style="s2">people that are also that like real</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.970" end="00:37:36.290" style="s2">world community or a book club or</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.370" end="00:37:38.780" style="s2">anything that you want to build yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.290" end="00:37:40.250" style="s2">yeah that made me think as well just</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.780" end="00:37:41.810" style="s2">like you know some of the recent</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.250" end="00:37:43.940" style="s2">conflicts that have happened in game be</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.810" end="00:37:45.320" style="s2">community and you know in loads of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.940" end="00:37:46.940" style="s2">communities you&#39;re seeing the same kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.320" end="00:37:49.940" style="s2">of thing happen and there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.940" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">really rigid moderation structure where</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.940" end="00:37:54.050" style="s2">basically you either in the group and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:56.210" style="s2">you can post everyone sees it or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.050" end="00:37:58.190" style="s2">out of the group no one can see you</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.210" end="00:37:59.920" style="s2">within that context so it&#39;s just this</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.190" end="00:38:02.990" style="s2">kind of black and white either in or out</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.920" end="00:38:04.700" style="s2">and yet it wouldn&#39;t it would be so easy</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.990" end="00:38:06.860" style="s2">to just build tools that enable of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.700" end="00:38:08.990" style="s2">customization where you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.860" end="00:38:10.640" style="s2">if you know people could flag stuff as</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.990" end="00:38:11.930" style="s2">being potentially offensive and if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.640" end="00:38:13.580" style="s2">were someone you didn&#39;t like offensive</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.930" end="00:38:15.410" style="s2">content you just go into your settings</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.580" end="00:38:16.850" style="s2">and you just choose to hide that if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.410" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">want to see it you can see it and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.850" end="00:38:22.100" style="s2">suddenly like those situations that lead</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:24.890" style="s2">to so much tension and kind of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.100" end="00:38:26.330" style="s2">like would just be able to unfold and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.890" end="00:38:29.090" style="s2">would you just wouldn&#39;t have nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.330" end="00:38:33.260" style="s2">many of the problems and there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.090" end="00:38:34.700" style="s2">different things like that yeah yeah one</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.260" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">of my friends it was I think it was two</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.700" end="00:38:37.550" style="s2">years ago on Mother&#39;s Day she just</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:39.410" style="s2">posted on Mother&#39;s Day it was like I</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.550" end="00:38:40.640" style="s2">really hate Mother&#39;s Day I really wish I</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.410" end="00:38:42.260" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to see it and was like well</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.640" end="00:38:44.270" style="s2">how dare you it&#39;s like she wasn&#39;t saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.260" end="00:38:45.950" style="s2">no one should celebrate it she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.270" end="00:38:47.900" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t want to see it and there</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.950" end="00:38:49.670" style="s2">should be a filter for that to be able</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.900" end="00:38:50.750" style="s2">to say listen for Christmas I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.670" end="00:38:52.250" style="s2">triggered I don&#39;t want to see Christmas</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.750" end="00:38:54.380" style="s2">stuff I don&#39;t want to see that because</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.250" end="00:38:55.790" style="s2">it&#39;s like the idea of trigger warnings</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.380" end="00:38:57.710" style="s2">is like yes they&#39;re good they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.790" end="00:38:59.270" style="s2">to help people at the same time there</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.710" end="00:39:00.890" style="s2">are a lot of Labor to put them in and</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.270" end="00:39:02.330" style="s2">they only deal with the overarching</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.890" end="00:39:04.790" style="s2">right like who&#39;s gonna put a trigger</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.330" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">warning on Mother&#39;s Day right like hey</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.790" end="00:39:07.760" style="s2">mom I love you I didn&#39;t just need a</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">trigger warning except for her it does</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.760" end="00:39:11.390" style="s2">it&#39;s like I have a really bad</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">relationship with my mom she abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.390" end="00:39:14.540" style="s2">me and I don&#39;t want to be reminded of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:16.790" style="s2">that right I don&#39;t want to go on if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.540" end="00:39:18.740" style="s2">having a bad day and so to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.790" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">put those filters in place that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.740" end="00:39:23.330" style="s2">your choice right to see things or not</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:25.820" style="s2">see things and to be able to opt in or</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.330" end="00:39:26.340" style="s2">opt out and yes the other people be like</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.820" end="00:39:28.050" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.340" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">we can just separate you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.050" end="00:39:30.420" style="s2">see you don&#39;t need to comment on</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:32.580" style="s2">everything you don&#39;t need to see the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.420" end="00:39:35.790" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s going to bring up all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.580" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">this gross emotion in you yeah okay how</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.790" end="00:39:42.120" style="s2">much about you get exposed and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.320" end="00:39:44.190" style="s2">actually reminds me it&#39;s not quite the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.120" end="00:39:46.230" style="s2">same but kind of a parallel in politics</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.190" end="00:39:48.780" style="s2">where you know the modern political</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.230" end="00:39:50.340" style="s2">system it&#39;s it&#39;s the two-party system</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.780" end="00:39:52.140" style="s2">where you end up like there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.340" end="00:39:54.780" style="s2">inevitably going to be two frontrunners</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.140" end="00:39:56.460" style="s2">and you know you end up basically being</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.780" end="00:39:58.350" style="s2">forced to pick between them and you you</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.460" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">might disagree with both of them on most</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.350" end="00:40:02.520" style="s2">things but you&#39;re kind of forced to pick</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:05.070" style="s2">one side and the other and it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.520" end="00:40:06.990" style="s2">pitting populations into kind of against</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.070" end="00:40:08.940" style="s2">each other into like two teams that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.990" end="00:40:11.070" style="s2">kind of battling even though under the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.940" end="00:40:12.810" style="s2">surface there&#39;s a huge amount of overlap</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.070" end="00:40:15.480" style="s2">in terms of their interests and their</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.810" end="00:40:17.430" style="s2">differences there&#39;s way more complex but</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.480" end="00:40:20.040" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s not being recognized in that</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.430" end="00:40:22.110" style="s2">system so you know I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.040" end="00:40:23.640" style="s2">huge potential for kind of like poll it</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.110" end="00:40:25.260" style="s2">like actually that was one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.640" end="00:40:26.280" style="s2">that initially got me into this I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.260" end="00:40:28.260" style="s2">research from that work was just</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.280" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">thinking about like you know what if</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.260" end="00:40:31.920" style="s2">there was like a global polling website</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:34.560" style="s2">where you could just find out a global</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.920" end="00:40:38.100" style="s2">opinion on any subject and you could</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:39.810" style="s2">pull your views on any subject and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.100" end="00:40:41.370" style="s2">know it&#39;d be fascinating and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.810" end="00:40:42.930" style="s2">people would actually feel more engaged</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.370" end="00:40:44.790" style="s2">because it&#39;s sort of just choosing</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.930" end="00:40:46.470" style="s2">between two rubbish options you could</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.790" end="00:40:47.370" style="s2">put forward your opinions on the things</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.470" end="00:40:49.230" style="s2">that you&#39;re passionate about and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.370" end="00:40:52.620" style="s2">interested in and it would count towards</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.230" end="00:40:54.150" style="s2">something so yeah I think there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.620" end="00:40:55.740" style="s2">loads of situations like that where</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.150" end="00:40:59.610" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of like we&#39;re in simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.740" end="00:41:00.930" style="s2">systems that like were you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.610" end="00:41:02.400" style="s2">that they you know they&#39;re there for a</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.930" end="00:41:04.080" style="s2">reason like they&#39;re you know for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.400" end="00:41:06.030" style="s2">the two-party system that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.080" end="00:41:08.790" style="s2">compared to a dictatorship where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.030" end="00:41:10.320" style="s2">just one one party but it&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.790" end="00:41:11.940" style="s2">terrible compared to a system where</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.320" end="00:41:14.910" style="s2">people could be putting all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.940" end="00:41:18.150" style="s2">different opinions and inputs into it so</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.910" end="00:41:20.670" style="s2">yeah at the governance thing I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.150" end="00:41:22.710" style="s2">because two parties doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.670" end="00:41:24.900" style="s2">multiple parties is almost even worse I</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.710" end="00:41:28.740" style="s2">think you&#39;re in a first-past-the-post as</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.900" end="00:41:30.360" style="s2">well right it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know which</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.740" end="00:41:32.970" style="s2">ones are both horrific but it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.360" end="00:41:35.330" style="s2">actually could govern a country or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.970" end="00:41:38.940" style="s2">it&#39;s village let&#39;s try with a village on</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.330" end="00:41:39.900" style="s2">liquid democracy and yet maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.940" end="00:41:43.079" style="s2">couldn&#39;t right because</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.900" end="00:41:44.609" style="s2">everyone&#39;s like oh I want no taxes and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.079" end="00:41:46.349" style="s2">want all the spending in the areas I</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.609" end="00:41:48.869" style="s2">want them to be in right I want</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.349" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">unlimited education for my children and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.869" end="00:41:52.319" style="s2">unlimited healthcare for my family but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:54.119" style="s2">don&#39;t want to pay for everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.319" end="00:41:55.890" style="s2">and I don&#39;t but it&#39;s like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.119" end="00:41:58.170" style="s2">actually voting on things it isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.890" end="00:42:00.690" style="s2">yes or no hopefully I mean in polling it</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.170" end="00:42:02.609" style="s2">would be but it&#39;s it&#39;s like right then</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.690" end="00:42:04.650" style="s2">we have a million dollars where are we</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.609" end="00:42:06.150" style="s2">spending it you can&#39;t take it from here</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.650" end="00:42:07.680" style="s2">without finding more of it right like</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.150" end="00:42:10.309" style="s2">you actually do need to have each</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.680" end="00:42:12.900" style="s2">individual sum what I&#39;m able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.309" end="00:42:15.510" style="s2">understand the the ripple effects right</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.900" end="00:42:17.849" style="s2">like you can&#39;t just say no taxes and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.510" end="00:42:19.559" style="s2">high spending that doesn&#39;t work oh but</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.849" end="00:42:21.210" style="s2">you can say hey let&#39;s all put in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.559" end="00:42:22.589" style="s2">little bit more for this of this tax so</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.210" end="00:42:25.230" style="s2">we can do this thing or be in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.589" end="00:42:27.630" style="s2">it and maybe and this is where I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.230" end="00:42:30.990" style="s2">government and politics is broken even</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.630" end="00:42:32.819" style="s2">though I get why it&#39;s there is that like</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.990" end="00:42:34.200" style="s2">if only the people who said yes to</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.819" end="00:42:35.640" style="s2">military were the ones funding the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.200" end="00:42:37.740" style="s2">military we wouldn&#39;t have military</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.640" end="00:42:39.180" style="s2">probably we wouldn&#39;t have and there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.740" end="00:42:40.650" style="s2">things that we need that people wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.180" end="00:42:42.270" style="s2">fund right I don&#39;t know if people with</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.650" end="00:42:44.190" style="s2">fund roads we need roads</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.270" end="00:42:46.020" style="s2">right like you might not fund education</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.190" end="00:42:48.839" style="s2">if your kid wasn&#39;t currently in</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.020" end="00:42:49.849" style="s2">education but so there are things that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.839" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">you need we need to kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.849" end="00:42:54.119" style="s2">prioritize and say yes everyone needs</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.079" end="00:42:55.710" style="s2">education everyone needs health care but</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.119" end="00:42:58.230" style="s2">to be able to say okay how do we solve</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.710" end="00:42:59.670" style="s2">healthcare education food anything for</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.230" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">the group of people who want to solve it</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.670" end="00:43:03.690" style="s2">then it&#39;s a voluntary tax right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:04.890" style="s2">like oh and funny minute acts like</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.690" end="00:43:07.109" style="s2">you&#39;re putting ten dollars into the pool</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.890" end="00:43:09.480" style="s2">to create this solution together you</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.109" end="00:43:11.339" style="s2">know we don&#39;t have to create solutions</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.480" end="00:43:13.109" style="s2">for everyone so we don&#39;t have to make</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.339" end="00:43:14.640" style="s2">everyone happy we don&#39;t even have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.109" end="00:43:16.529" style="s2">make everyone in this group happy there</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.640" end="00:43:18.650" style="s2">are there are autonomous individuals</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.529" end="00:43:21.599" style="s2">right they can come and bring them like</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.650" end="00:43:23.190" style="s2">kind of the worst of all worlds or we</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.599" end="00:43:25.829" style="s2">both like we don&#39;t have a say in our</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.190" end="00:43:27.779" style="s2">government beyond just voting and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.829" end="00:43:29.549" style="s2">also can&#39;t make everyone happy so they</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.779" end="00:43:30.990" style="s2">can&#39;t do anything and we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.549" end="00:43:33.210" style="s2">anything so nothing&#39;s getting done</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.990" end="00:43:35.339" style="s2">instead of like oh let&#39;s just bring a</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.210" end="00:43:37.289" style="s2">group of citizens together pull our</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.339" end="00:43:39.059" style="s2">money not all of our money but you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.289" end="00:43:40.740" style="s2">a tiny bit of our money and then create</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.059" end="00:43:43.200" style="s2">something together and then we can own</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.740" end="00:43:44.940" style="s2">it together and create real actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:48.089" style="s2">tangible solutions that bypass our</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.940" end="00:43:51.900" style="s2">government and make our lives better and</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.089" end="00:43:53.190" style="s2">then keep improving incremental II it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.900" end="00:43:53.490" style="s2">like you start with the beta I keep</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.190" end="00:43:55.619" style="s2">scared</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.490" end="00:43:57.360" style="s2">better and eventually you know competes</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.619" end="00:43:58.950" style="s2">Facebook and Google and eventually you</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.360" end="00:44:01.590" style="s2">don&#39;t need governments because what are</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.950" end="00:44:02.940" style="s2">they doing nothing because they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.590" end="00:44:07.730" style="s2">and the stuff they can do we could</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.940" end="00:44:10.410" style="s2">probably do better together so do you</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.730" end="00:44:12.300" style="s2">like because I&#39;m totally sold on this</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.410" end="00:44:13.980" style="s2">trajectory as well like I&#39;ve shared</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.300" end="00:44:16.110" style="s2">about it in communities before and like</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.980" end="00:44:17.910" style="s2">it&#39;s such a complicated thing you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.110" end="00:44:19.890" style="s2">only kind of loosely point at it and say</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.910" end="00:44:20.970" style="s2">like there&#39;s this kind of thing and but</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.890" end="00:44:22.650" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know it&#39;s like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.970" end="00:44:24.150" style="s2">describe a living cell or something</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.650" end="00:44:26.190" style="s2">there&#39;s just so many different aspects</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.150" end="00:44:28.260" style="s2">to it it&#39;s kind of organic as well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.190" end="00:44:30.090" style="s2">not like it&#39;s not even like the Machine</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.260" end="00:44:35.100" style="s2">you know a complicated machine it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.090" end="00:44:37.290" style="s2">so complex but do you think like like</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.100" end="00:44:39.570" style="s2">what what kind of scale use time scale</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.290" end="00:44:43.290" style="s2">are you thinking about like you and do</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.570" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">you think yeah I don&#39;t know like how how</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.290" end="00:44:46.290" style="s2">soon do you think that this could happen</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:48.030" style="s2">and do you think how do you reckon the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.290" end="00:44:49.410" style="s2">rest of the world would respond when</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.030" end="00:44:52.680" style="s2">something like this started to gain a</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.410" end="00:44:54.300" style="s2">bit of traction how the world responds</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.680" end="00:44:55.770" style="s2">is a whole other question because it</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.300" end="00:44:57.390" style="s2">could be that the media absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.770" end="00:44:58.830" style="s2">vilifies and people are like like</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.390" end="00:44:59.850" style="s2">constantly when I&#39;m talking about my</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.830" end="00:45:02.340" style="s2">vision people like that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.850" end="00:45:04.410" style="s2">socialism I&#39;m like so I don&#39;t care that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.340" end="00:45:06.560" style="s2">it sounds like socialism I&#39;m not against</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.410" end="00:45:09.390" style="s2">socialism but also it&#39;s involuntary</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.560" end="00:45:10.619" style="s2">socialism if it is right it&#39;s like so</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.390" end="00:45:13.680" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to come and participate</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.619" end="00:45:15.030" style="s2">so what is the problem but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.680" end="00:45:16.380" style="s2">mean they won&#39;t find one it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.030" end="00:45:17.609" style="s2">like we constantly care about what our</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.380" end="00:45:19.290" style="s2">neighbors are doing what other people</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.609" end="00:45:21.450" style="s2">are doing wouldn&#39;t we really should it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.290" end="00:45:23.160" style="s2">not affecting our lives but the time</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.450" end="00:45:25.080" style="s2">scale wise I mean that&#39;s part of what</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.160" end="00:45:26.730" style="s2">solution raising or we&#39;re coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.080" end="00:45:28.140" style="s2">a solution in an hour and showcasing</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.730" end="00:45:29.550" style="s2">what we could do with a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.140" end="00:45:31.530" style="s2">dollars and ten thousand people and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.550" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">having multiple ones so we can say hey</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.530" end="00:45:34.950" style="s2">imagine we have the food one the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:37.470" style="s2">education one you know they&#39;re all just</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.950" end="00:45:39.990" style="s2">adjacent possible they&#39;re not a utopian</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.470" end="00:45:41.790" style="s2">vision of the future it&#39;s like hey an</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.990" end="00:45:44.550" style="s2">online learning system that we can all</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.790" end="00:45:46.350" style="s2">use and contribute to a food system to</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.550" end="00:45:47.609" style="s2">know what&#39;s cheap and how to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.350" end="00:45:49.590" style="s2">with your neighbors whatever it is right</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.609" end="00:45:51.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like a little thing it&#39;s the tude</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.590" end="00:45:52.890" style="s2">still has a big impact but isn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.359" end="00:45:56.820" style="s2">know let&#39;s take down the entire</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.890" end="00:46:00.450" style="s2">government or something all of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.820" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">little projects are something a tech</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.450" end="00:46:03.570" style="s2">team can do and say it&#39;s six months</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:05.790" style="s2">under six months right especially one</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.570" end="00:46:06.930" style="s2">that had funding and $100,000 isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.790" end="00:46:09.210" style="s2">hard to do with ten thousand he</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.930" end="00:46:11.490" style="s2">again $10 per month you can have fun one</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.210" end="00:46:14.520" style="s2">per month and vote on which one we want</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.490" end="00:46:16.049" style="s2">to fund this beginning part where the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.520" end="00:46:17.670" style="s2">snowball is getting started and people</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.049" end="00:46:20.760" style="s2">can&#39;t see the vision right there like</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.670" end="00:46:22.559" style="s2">tech cooperative why it&#39;s slow and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.760" end="00:46:24.150" style="s2">arduous but once it starts rolling on</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.559" end="00:46:25.710" style="s2">its own right once there&#39;s that social</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.150" end="00:46:28.380" style="s2">media platform that anyone can come on</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.710" end="00:46:29.549" style="s2">and start giving an idea to and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.380" end="00:46:31.200" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t work cuz you can&#39;t have all</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.549" end="00:46:32.730" style="s2">ideas at once maybe you need to start</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.200" end="00:46:37.250" style="s2">with one idea and then work on that one</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.730" end="00:46:39.359" style="s2">until it&#39;s done but they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.250" end="00:46:40.470" style="s2">interconnected like you need you need</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.359" end="00:46:41.910" style="s2">your needs a minute able to concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.470" end="00:46:43.289" style="s2">on working you need to be able to find</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.910" end="00:46:44.670" style="s2">your people be able to make teams you</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.289" end="00:46:46.650" style="s2">need to be able to have the information</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.670" end="00:46:50.010" style="s2">and databases nerd field do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.650" end="00:46:52.710" style="s2">this stuff but also there&#39;s ways to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.010" end="00:46:55.230" style="s2">start from now like the idea cafe and</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.710" end="00:46:58.950" style="s2">the solutions cooperatives are Sochi and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.230" end="00:47:01.079" style="s2">racing and such where once it starts I</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.950" end="00:47:02.460" style="s2">have a completely different time frame</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.079" end="00:47:04.349" style="s2">than everyone else cuz I&#39;m like we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.460" end="00:47:06.779" style="s2">honestly be living in in what would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.349" end="00:47:09.660" style="s2">deemed utopia from this standpoint in</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.779" end="00:47:11.250" style="s2">ten years because like I mad like we</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.660" end="00:47:13.049" style="s2">look at technology from ten years ago</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.250" end="00:47:14.099" style="s2">right I&#39;m like all the phones that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.049" end="00:47:16.260" style="s2">what they look like we do you really</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.099" end="00:47:18.390" style="s2">have smartphones and and that was not</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.260" end="00:47:21.270" style="s2">organized right it was just dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.390" end="00:47:23.369" style="s2">capitalism and incentives and people</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.270" end="00:47:25.079" style="s2">like they have to make stuff and then do</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.369" end="00:47:27.270" style="s2">it in secret and sell it to us and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.079" end="00:47:28.950" style="s2">don&#39;t trust them and once we have that</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.270" end="00:47:30.450" style="s2">open system where people can see and</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.950" end="00:47:32.910" style="s2">everyone can come and be involved and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.450" end="00:47:34.319" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with like everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.910" end="00:47:35.849" style="s2">solve their own problems right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.319" end="00:47:37.319" style="s2">empowered to solve your own you can also</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.849" end="00:47:38.819" style="s2">leave it up to other people right like</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.319" end="00:47:40.529" style="s2">other people created a food app you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.819" end="00:47:42.180" style="s2">come and be part of it but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.529" end="00:47:43.529" style="s2">yell at them for creating something you</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.180" end="00:47:44.789" style="s2">didn&#39;t know they didn&#39;t know you needed</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.529" end="00:47:46.950" style="s2">because you weren&#39;t involved</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.789" end="00:47:48.630" style="s2">like it&#39;s like empowering people to</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.950" end="00:47:50.609" style="s2">solve their own problems together</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.630" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">means that all the problems get solved</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.609" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">simultaneously and so if it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.559" end="00:47:55.380" style="s2">solution for you what would make it a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.000" end="00:47:57.240" style="s2">solution for you what&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.380" end="00:47:59.160" style="s2">iteration how do we continually improve</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.240" end="00:48:01.529" style="s2">it how do they connect together then</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.160" end="00:48:03.960" style="s2">yeah ten years you have game be in ten</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.529" end="00:48:06.450" style="s2">years like I and I get that that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.960" end="00:48:09.109" style="s2">pie-in-the-sky but I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.450" end="00:48:11.789" style="s2">how we don&#39;t do that like it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.109" end="00:48:14.309" style="s2">that&#39;s why I can have hope that like</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.789" end="00:48:16.010" style="s2">this is there like generations from now</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.309" end="00:48:18.359" style="s2">like we don&#39;t need generations from now</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.010" end="00:48:19.980" style="s2">we don&#39;t have generations from now we</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.359" end="00:48:21.070" style="s2">don&#39;t need generations from now we need</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.980" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">the technology</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.070" end="00:48:24.460" style="s2">because a lot of what game B is right</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.200" end="00:48:27.190" style="s2">that we need the people to be conscious</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.460" end="00:48:28.030" style="s2">enough to do this stuff I think is</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.190" end="00:48:29.859" style="s2">backwards</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.030" end="00:48:31.330" style="s2">I would love those people to exist I</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.859" end="00:48:32.950" style="s2">want everyone to become more conscious</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.330" end="00:48:35.410" style="s2">and care about animals and people and</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.950" end="00:48:36.849" style="s2">but if we need them to do that first it</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.410" end="00:48:38.020" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work we have to meet people</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.849" end="00:48:39.400" style="s2">where they are so we have to give them</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.020" end="00:48:41.410" style="s2">solutions that are cheaper easier</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.400" end="00:48:44.710" style="s2">smarter than what they currently have</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.410" end="00:48:46.210" style="s2">and we can do that together right like</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.710" end="00:48:49.570" style="s2">we can create something much better than</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.210" end="00:48:51.070" style="s2">Facebook together and then the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.570" end="00:48:52.810" style="s2">part of the people who get the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.070" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a little evil but then eventually</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.810" end="00:48:55.510" style="s2">it&#39;s like why would you be on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:48:57.760" style="s2">when there&#39;s this thing we all home</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.510" end="00:48:59.619" style="s2">together that&#39;s like not only giving me</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.760" end="00:49:02.020" style="s2">a newsfeed but like helping me feed my</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.619" end="00:49:05.710" style="s2">family helping me find my passion</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.020" end="00:49:06.970" style="s2">projects helping me like do my just</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.710" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">everything right this is like my</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.970" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">personal assistant and I pay $10 a month</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:15.690" style="s2">for it yeah I can see it&#39;s saving me a</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:18.700" style="s2">thousand yeah I&#39;ll pay for it right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.690" end="00:49:22.000" style="s2">once we once it starts everything</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.700" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">explodes very rapidly yeah yeah I see</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.000" end="00:49:26.109" style="s2">the same way it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:29.230" style="s2">technology or something you know - you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.109" end="00:49:30.730" style="s2">get a very long gradual curve and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.230" end="00:49:33.940" style="s2">suddenly it reaches a certain threshold</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.730" end="00:49:35.710" style="s2">and then becomes very steep and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.940" end="00:49:37.720" style="s2">that&#39;s just there&#39;s all the ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.710" end="00:49:40.270" style="s2">are kind of like building and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.720" end="00:49:43.180" style="s2">just ready for a big change to happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.270" end="00:49:44.800" style="s2">but I think that&#39;s the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.180" end="00:49:46.900" style="s2">challenge that we&#39;ve got now is to just</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.800" end="00:49:48.910" style="s2">build those like solid foundations and</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.900" end="00:49:51.640" style="s2">create that kind of framework around</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.910" end="00:49:53.109" style="s2">which then once that energy you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.640" end="00:49:55.150" style="s2">once people recognize it that that</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.109" end="00:49:56.950" style="s2">energy can actually flow into it and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.150" end="00:49:59.800" style="s2">can kind of like survive and grow and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.950" end="00:50:03.900" style="s2">expand and handle that energy because I</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.800" end="00:50:06.520" style="s2">think the danger is like you know if say</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.900" end="00:50:08.500" style="s2">ten thousand or a million people right</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.520" end="00:50:10.510" style="s2">now came and we&#39;re just like you know we</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.500" end="00:50:11.890" style="s2">love your ideas like let&#39;s do it I feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.510" end="00:50:14.650" style="s2">like right now we&#39;re probably not quite</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.890" end="00:50:17.530" style="s2">prepared to coordinate would be very</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.650" end="00:50:19.060" style="s2">difficult but I think like you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.530" end="00:50:20.950" style="s2">there was someone was saying the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.060" end="00:50:22.780" style="s2">day in the game be community that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.950" end="00:50:24.490" style="s2">almost like you know there was this</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.780" end="00:50:27.369" style="s2">really long period before the first</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.490" end="00:50:29.170" style="s2">sales formed on earth where kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.369" end="00:50:31.540" style="s2">ingredients were just like bubbling and</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.170" end="00:50:33.190" style="s2">slowly coming into the right place but</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.540" end="00:50:34.210" style="s2">then as soon as you get an actual soul</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.190" end="00:50:35.950" style="s2">that can kind of reap</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.210" end="00:50:38.050" style="s2">juice and survived suddenly there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.950" end="00:50:40.690" style="s2">new process just like rapidly as</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.050" end="00:50:42.010" style="s2">triggered I feel I feel like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.690" end="00:50:44.080" style="s2">what&#39;s kind of happening and game be</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.010" end="00:50:46.060" style="s2">like I&#39;ve actually been really</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.080" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">interested in I mentioned this on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.060" end="00:50:49.030" style="s2">call the other day like they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:51.609" style="s2">sub communities that started forming</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.030" end="00:50:54.460" style="s2">within game B I think partly because</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.609" end="00:50:55.599" style="s2">like my the social network I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.460" end="00:50:57.790" style="s2">involved in week Oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.599" end="00:50:59.410" style="s2">like one of the unique features of it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.790" end="00:51:01.570" style="s2">the way that communities are organized</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.410" end="00:51:05.230" style="s2">into this kind of like holler key or</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.570" end="00:51:07.420" style="s2">this like fractal branching structure we</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.230" end="00:51:09.099" style="s2">have like you have a community or a</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.420" end="00:51:11.080" style="s2">subject like science and then within</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.099" end="00:51:14.099" style="s2">that you have like a nest nested sub</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.080" end="00:51:16.570" style="s2">communities like physics and chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.099" end="00:51:19.060" style="s2">because you can you can apply that kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.570" end="00:51:21.849" style="s2">of structure that framework to pretty</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.060" end="00:51:23.800" style="s2">much any conceptual domain you know like</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.849" end="00:51:26.950" style="s2">it works in all different areas so like</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.800" end="00:51:28.630" style="s2">you know you could have like I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.950" end="00:51:30.250" style="s2">came to this idea from reddit so for</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.630" end="00:51:33.160" style="s2">example like you know reddit there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.250" end="00:51:34.780" style="s2">like a subreddit for my City Bristol and</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.160" end="00:51:36.280" style="s2">they&#39;ll be you know subreddit for all</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.780" end="00:51:39.010" style="s2">these different categories but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.280" end="00:51:41.170" style="s2">just one level you know you&#39;ve just got</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.010" end="00:51:43.150" style="s2">a massive space for Bristol sharing and</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.170" end="00:51:44.410" style="s2">I thought you know it&#39;d be so awesome if</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.150" end="00:51:46.480" style="s2">you could within that you could have</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.410" end="00:51:48.339" style="s2">like Bristol artists and Bristol food</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.480" end="00:51:50.680" style="s2">you know people are interested food at</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.339" end="00:51:52.359" style="s2">Bristol garden and then within those you</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.680" end="00:51:54.550" style="s2">could have further subcategories that</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.359" end="00:51:58.089" style="s2">could be created by the users and they</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.550" end="00:51:59.890" style="s2">become kind of sharing spaces and so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.089" end="00:52:01.960" style="s2">think that kind of design is like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.890" end="00:52:03.310" style="s2">maybe why I&#39;ve been like particularly</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.960" end="00:52:05.589" style="s2">interested in seeing that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.310" end="00:52:07.599" style="s2">starting to happen and game B but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.589" end="00:52:09.580" style="s2">think that&#39;s yeah see having these kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.599" end="00:52:11.589" style="s2">of like areas for the different or</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.580" end="00:52:13.089" style="s2">different spaces for sharing around the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.589" end="00:52:15.010" style="s2">different subjects that we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.089" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">realizing our parts of this game B</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.010" end="00:52:21.070" style="s2">system that&#39;s really valuable and I just</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:23.650" style="s2">hope that over time the in each of those</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.070" end="00:52:26.890" style="s2">spaces we kind of developed more clear</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.650" end="00:52:28.300" style="s2">ideas so that as more people come in you</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.890" end="00:52:30.099" style="s2">know the ideas are mapped out clearer</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.300" end="00:52:32.770" style="s2">and there&#39;s more things that people can</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.099" end="00:52:34.270" style="s2">do and yeah yeah I mean that would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.770" end="00:52:36.490" style="s2">totally ideal it&#39;s what we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.270" end="00:52:38.380" style="s2">trying to do with the projects the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.490" end="00:52:39.760" style="s2">Gateway projects is bring people with</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.380" end="00:52:41.170" style="s2">projects together to have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.760" end="00:52:43.570" style="s2">conversation of like what needs to be in</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.170" end="00:52:46.119" style="s2">place to help our projects exist because</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.570" end="00:52:47.869" style="s2">a lot of that saying conversations</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.119" end="00:52:49.309" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.869" end="00:52:51.499" style="s2">under like the science umbrella where</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.309" end="00:52:52.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like physics and actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.499" end="00:52:55.069" style="s2">probably better to do the other one</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.460" end="00:52:58.069" style="s2">where like Bristol has its own Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.069" end="00:52:59.900" style="s2">has its own I find because not</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.069" end="00:53:02.599" style="s2">everything is in that structure right</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.900" end="00:53:04.099" style="s2">there&#39;s also like Vancouver food might</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.599" end="00:53:06.140" style="s2">want to talk to Bristol food especially</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.099" end="00:53:07.999" style="s2">if we&#39;re going traveling right and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.140" end="00:53:09.920" style="s2">like the interconnected circle like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.999" end="00:53:11.420" style="s2">one node and I have a lot of aspects</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.920" end="00:53:12.740" style="s2">right like I might want to talk to my</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.420" end="00:53:14.180" style="s2">career community I might want to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.740" end="00:53:16.640" style="s2">the disabled community I might want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.180" end="00:53:21.490" style="s2">talk to two single moms and I&#39;m like and</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.640" end="00:53:23.420" style="s2">so I&#39;m all of those things and my my um</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.490" end="00:53:25.099" style="s2">contribution to the world is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.420" end="00:53:26.569" style="s2">all of those things right I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.099" end="00:53:27.559" style="s2">connecting point to those and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.569" end="00:53:29.660" style="s2">other people would be the connecting</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.559" end="00:53:32.029" style="s2">point but basically no one&#39;s your exact</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.660" end="00:53:33.890" style="s2">connecting point and so there&#39;s places</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.029" end="00:53:35.089" style="s2">where that that someone hierarchy exists</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.890" end="00:53:36.799" style="s2">right of like science and then these</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.089" end="00:53:39.109" style="s2">things underneath but it&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.799" end="00:53:41.839" style="s2">right but we also need to bring in art</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.109" end="00:53:43.670" style="s2">to science right and and an economics</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.839" end="00:53:45.410" style="s2">and like all of the inter inter</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.670" end="00:53:47.509" style="s2">pollination but then you also kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.410" end="00:53:48.589" style="s2">want it like you want chemistry to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.509" end="00:53:49.880" style="s2">with chemistry so that if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.589" end="00:53:51.440" style="s2">understanding chemistry I don&#39;t need a</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.880" end="00:53:53.569" style="s2">background in history and linguistics</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.440" end="00:53:55.249" style="s2">and all this stuff but I could write</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.569" end="00:53:56.749" style="s2">like cuz cuz that&#39;s part of it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.249" end="00:53:59.180" style="s2">if you have a if you have history and</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.749" end="00:54:01.269" style="s2">chemistry awesome you bring those two</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.180" end="00:54:04.039" style="s2">together right so being able to find</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.269" end="00:54:05.630" style="s2">yeah just both like hierarchy and also</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.039" end="00:54:07.339" style="s2">the interconnectedness yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.630" end="00:54:08.960" style="s2">totally agree with that and that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.339" end="00:54:10.460" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a part of the design is</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.960" end="00:54:12.559" style="s2">that you can at least the one that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.460" end="00:54:14.900" style="s2">worked on is that you can have you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.559" end="00:54:16.700" style="s2">any branch can exist and I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.900" end="00:54:18.079" style="s2">wonder where the branch is now is like</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.700" end="00:54:19.910" style="s2">is actually the rep the best term</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.079" end="00:54:23.089" style="s2">because it does imply a more rigid</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.910" end="00:54:26.839" style="s2">framework where like nodes might be you</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.089" end="00:54:28.400" style="s2">know a better analogy but but with it</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.839" end="00:54:30.259" style="s2">like within the design that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.400" end="00:54:32.599" style="s2">developed you can you can make basically</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.259" end="00:54:35.450" style="s2">branches can exist in multiple locations</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.599" end="00:54:37.279" style="s2">simultaneously and so can post as well</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.450" end="00:54:39.739" style="s2">so when you create a post you could</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.279" end="00:54:41.269" style="s2">target with multiple branches but you</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.739" end="00:54:43.460" style="s2">could also like you said have a food</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.269" end="00:54:45.710" style="s2">community that&#39;s like nested within the</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.460" end="00:54:48.829" style="s2">city that exists in but also nested</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.710" end="00:54:50.980" style="s2">within a wider food community so it can</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.829" end="00:54:53.900" style="s2">be found within both of those locations</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.980" end="00:54:55.819" style="s2">and something that&#39;s like it gets kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.900" end="00:54:57.319" style="s2">of a bit abstract but like because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.819" end="00:54:59.710" style="s2">been in really interested in like</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.319" end="00:55:01.519" style="s2">neuroscience for quite a long time I</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.710" end="00:55:03.859" style="s2">actually think there&#39;s power</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.519" end="00:55:04.999" style="s2">to the way that our brain thinks and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.859" end="00:55:07.459" style="s2">way that information is actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.999" end="00:55:08.809" style="s2">organized within our brain you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.459" end="00:55:11.390" style="s2">because you could think about certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.809" end="00:55:13.909" style="s2">subject and then instantly your brain</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.390" end="00:55:15.349" style="s2">like you&#39;ll pull up different bits that</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.909" end="00:55:17.209" style="s2">are connected from different parts of</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.349" end="00:55:19.159" style="s2">your brain which you know and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.209" end="00:55:22.359" style="s2">that&#39;s actually the way that information</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.159" end="00:55:25.069" style="s2">seems to be organized within our brains</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.359" end="00:55:26.509" style="s2">and so yeah like I&#39;m kind of interested</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.069" end="00:55:29.059" style="s2">in the idea that like I actually think</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.509" end="00:55:32.089" style="s2">that as social networks evolve and as</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.059" end="00:55:33.289" style="s2">our capacity like the tools increase our</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.089" end="00:55:35.029" style="s2">capacity for collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.289" end="00:55:36.709" style="s2">that will actually move towards</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.029" end="00:55:39.549" style="s2">something that will be kind of seen as</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.709" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">almost like a global brain type system</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.549" end="00:55:44.839" style="s2">that&#39;s able to kind of coordinate and</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:47.089" style="s2">process information which can then guide</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.839" end="00:55:49.219" style="s2">the more kind of physical aspects of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.089" end="00:55:51.949" style="s2">super organism like the allocation of</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.219" end="00:55:54.679" style="s2">resources and all those kinds of more</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.949" end="00:55:57.349" style="s2">physical things yeah I like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.679" end="00:56:01.039" style="s2">leaving not leaving our resource</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.349" end="00:56:03.259" style="s2">allocation up to AI but mostly to leave</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.039" end="00:56:05.169" style="s2">it up to them like to some degree this</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.259" end="00:56:07.219" style="s2">idea like the not in my backyard</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.169" end="00:56:09.109" style="s2">principle right of like oh we need a</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.219" end="00:56:10.459" style="s2">cool processing plan but I want to like</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.109" end="00:56:11.630" style="s2">use that energy but I don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.459" end="00:56:13.639" style="s2">coal processing plants in my</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.630" end="00:56:17.089" style="s2">neighborhood and so to have people</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.639" end="00:56:18.799" style="s2">actually vote both on yes I want it and</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.089" end="00:56:21.380" style="s2">no I don&#39;t want it in my backyard right</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.799" end="00:56:23.179" style="s2">and so if you do actually get a group of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.380" end="00:56:24.859" style="s2">people who are concentrators say yes and</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.179" end="00:56:26.689" style="s2">yes then yeah of course you make it</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.859" end="00:56:27.949" style="s2">there but chances are you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.689" end="00:56:29.989" style="s2">people who don&#39;t want in their backyard</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.949" end="00:56:31.699" style="s2">but they do want it to exist and finding</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.989" end="00:56:33.409" style="s2">the algorithm it&#39;s like right we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.699" end="00:56:35.269" style="s2">saying yes to it so whoever it does</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.409" end="00:56:37.279" style="s2">whoever we decide it goes to for pros</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.269" end="00:56:39.709" style="s2">and cons of all the areas that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.279" end="00:56:42.499" style="s2">place it is right like it&#39;s not a judge</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.709" end="00:56:45.469" style="s2">who can be bought or so like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.499" end="00:56:46.789" style="s2">the data decided right algorithm of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.469" end="00:56:49.039" style="s2">data and we had a discussion on what</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.789" end="00:56:49.759" style="s2">that looks like we just didn&#39;t run it -</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.039" end="00:56:51.459" style="s2">no wait</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.759" end="00:56:54.079" style="s2">am i voting for it to be in my backyard</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.459" end="00:56:56.029" style="s2">yeah you know doing doing things like</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.079" end="00:56:58.669" style="s2">that well that that&#39;s definitely I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.029" end="00:57:00.709" style="s2">an interesting area of AI is kind of not</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.669" end="00:57:03.349" style="s2">actually having the AI kind of made the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.709" end="00:57:05.449" style="s2">decision but basically like taking ever</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.349" end="00:57:07.130" style="s2">all the input from all the humans around</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.449" end="00:57:09.889" style="s2">the world and then kind of like figuring</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.130" end="00:57:12.739" style="s2">out what what solution satisfies the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.889" end="00:57:14.299" style="s2">most people&#39;s needs by kind of crunching</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.739" end="00:57:18.349" style="s2">that data in a way that an</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.299" end="00:57:19.849" style="s2">human just could never do so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.349" end="00:57:23.239" style="s2">another area that&#39;s a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.849" end="00:57:24.859" style="s2">potential that it&#39;s just I mean when you</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.239" end="00:57:27.339" style="s2">realize how much information is out</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.859" end="00:57:29.630" style="s2">there and I don&#39;t know what point you</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.339" end="00:57:33.199" style="s2">surpassed the one human cannot know</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.630" end="00:57:34.489" style="s2">everything probably pretty soon as soon</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.199" end="00:57:37.249" style="s2">as we started interconnecting with other</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.489" end="00:57:38.509" style="s2">tribes we probably were there because</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.249" end="00:57:39.679" style="s2">you could hold the information for your</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.509" end="00:57:41.359" style="s2">tribe but you probably couldn&#39;t also</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.679" end="00:57:44.569" style="s2">hold the information for someone else is</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.359" end="00:57:45.709" style="s2">all history all science like every time</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.569" end="00:57:48.289" style="s2">we come up with something new how many</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.709" end="00:57:50.059" style="s2">papers are like there&#39;s millions of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.289" end="00:57:51.890" style="s2">hours of YouTube video uploaded every</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.059" end="00:57:53.900" style="s2">day right like you can&#39;t know everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.890" end="00:57:55.400" style="s2">when I was a kid you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.900" end="00:57:57.439" style="s2">potentially watch everything on</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.400" end="00:57:59.059" style="s2">television not really because things</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.439" end="00:58:00.679" style="s2">played at the same time but like there</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.059" end="00:58:03.199" style="s2">was a handful of shows out there you</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.679" end="00:58:05.900" style="s2">could watch them all um you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.199" end="00:58:07.339" style="s2">there&#39;s no way if there&#39;s not and have</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.900" end="00:58:10.249" style="s2">like you just can&#39;t there&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.339" end="00:58:13.249" style="s2">enough hours in the day and stay on top</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.249" end="00:58:15.439" style="s2">of them even like the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.249" end="00:58:18.170" style="s2">aired on television let alone all the</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.439" end="00:58:20.089" style="s2">YouTube while the Netflix and Hulu and</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.170" end="00:58:22.789" style="s2">all of that stuff and so to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.089" end="00:58:25.279" style="s2">create the system that honors that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.789" end="00:58:26.660" style="s2">is both like right not that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.279" end="00:58:27.829" style="s2">be watching television necessarily but</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.660" end="00:58:30.410" style="s2">like these are the shows that you would</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.829" end="00:58:31.969" style="s2">like and not to say we&#39;re so let&#39;s stop</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.410" end="00:58:35.119" style="s2">let&#39;s stop making them and only make the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.969" end="00:58:36.739" style="s2">number that everyone can watch no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.119" end="00:58:38.299" style="s2">like we have the plethora of information</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.739" end="00:58:39.619" style="s2">we have the plethora of silent science</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.299" end="00:58:42.019" style="s2">it&#39;s how do we organize it and make it</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.619" end="00:58:44.329" style="s2">accessible so that my doctor can</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.019" end="00:58:48.559" style="s2">actually know all of human chemistry and</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.329" end="00:58:50.029" style="s2">physics and biology and ecology in order</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.559" end="00:58:51.709" style="s2">to be able to help me get my health</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.029" end="00:58:53.179" style="s2">right which they don&#39;t have any of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.709" end="00:58:56.329" style="s2">and I know they don&#39;t have any of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.179" end="00:58:58.309" style="s2">you miss to hold them in a position of</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.329" end="00:59:02.079" style="s2">God when they have less information than</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.309" end="00:59:05.390" style="s2">I do like yeah no problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.079" end="00:59:07.249" style="s2">yeah see you know this is making me</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.390" end="00:59:08.359" style="s2">think of parallels again with like a bee</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.249" end="00:59:11.059" style="s2">in some of these online communities</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.359" end="00:59:13.099" style="s2">where you know in the early days it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.059" end="00:59:15.439" style="s2">possible to actually read like pretty</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.099" end="00:59:17.660" style="s2">old like check out all the posts and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.439" end="00:59:19.489" style="s2">read all the comments but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.660" end="00:59:20.839" style="s2">take too many people to where it gets</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.489" end="00:59:22.459" style="s2">the point where you just it&#39;s just it</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.839" end="00:59:24.319" style="s2">gradually becomes increasingly harder</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.459" end="00:59:26.179" style="s2">and harder to do that and then it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.319" end="00:59:27.500" style="s2">totally impossible because it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.179" end="00:59:30.770" style="s2">much fun</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.500" end="00:59:32.359" style="s2">and like the dynamics of like of</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.770" end="00:59:34.700" style="s2">collective intelligence and how you</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.359" end="00:59:37.549" style="s2">organize groups I think has to change</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.700" end="00:59:39.020" style="s2">are those different scales and I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.549" end="00:59:40.430" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the challenges that game B</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.020" end="00:59:42.980" style="s2">is facing right now is trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.430" end="00:59:44.599" style="s2">out like there&#39;s a desire for it to</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.980" end="00:59:46.250" style="s2">expand and I think everyone agrees that</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.599" end="00:59:48.829" style="s2">that&#39;s important yeah at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.250" end="00:59:50.900" style="s2">as it&#39;s expanding the old way that it</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.829" end="00:59:53.809" style="s2">was organized is no longer capable of</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.900" end="00:59:56.000" style="s2">coordinating this group and that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.809" end="00:59:58.069" style="s2">of like frightening and problematic</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.000" end="00:59:59.809" style="s2">because it&#39;s like the old thing is kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.069" end="01:00:02.240" style="s2">of cracking and breaking in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.809" end="01:00:05.170" style="s2">and yet there is potential for it to</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.240" end="01:00:09.079" style="s2">kind of like evolve to a new level of</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.170" end="01:00:10.609" style="s2">complexity and and I think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.079" end="01:00:12.349" style="s2">this kind of frame like this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.609" end="01:00:15.740" style="s2">fractal frame work becomes really useful</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.349" end="01:00:18.530" style="s2">because you know if you just have one</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.740" end="01:00:20.750" style="s2">space one container for an enormous</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.530" end="01:00:22.280" style="s2">amount of information how do you find</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.750" end="01:00:25.220" style="s2">your way through that content like how</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.280" end="01:00:27.319" style="s2">do you how do you navigate that and just</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.220" end="01:00:29.450" style="s2">typing text you know like searching by</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.319" end="01:00:31.130" style="s2">text is helpful but I think actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.450" end="01:00:33.410" style="s2">having some kind of structure where you</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.130" end="01:00:34.640" style="s2">can be like okay I mean I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.410" end="01:00:37.010" style="s2">in game B but I&#39;m particularly</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.640" end="01:00:38.480" style="s2">interested in like psychology or</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.010" end="01:00:41.180" style="s2">something or I&#39;m particularly interested</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.480" end="01:00:42.980" style="s2">in like high level systems change and</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.180" end="01:00:45.020" style="s2">you can just quickly find the section of</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.980" end="01:00:47.089" style="s2">gang v that&#39;s focused on that area and</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.020" end="01:00:48.770" style="s2">then you can navigate down to a more</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.089" end="01:00:50.420" style="s2">specific area and that you can zoom back</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.770" end="01:00:52.279" style="s2">out when you want to and you can kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.420" end="01:00:56.450" style="s2">just navigate through all this</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.279" end="01:00:58.640" style="s2">complexity and then again I also think</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.450" end="01:01:00.680" style="s2">just like new tools like instead of just</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.640" end="01:01:02.690" style="s2">being able to like stuff and being stuck</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.680" end="01:01:05.180" style="s2">with Facebook&#39;s algorithm as to how it</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.690" end="01:01:07.010" style="s2">ranks things you know having alternate</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.180" end="01:01:09.049" style="s2">ways of you know labeling things maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.010" end="01:01:10.670" style="s2">allowing communities come up with custom</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.049" end="01:01:12.289" style="s2">labels that they can apply in different</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.670" end="01:01:14.750" style="s2">ways and then sift stuff according to</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.289" end="01:01:17.210" style="s2">those labels or using like rating</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.750" end="01:01:18.440" style="s2">systems or different kinds of reputation</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.210" end="01:01:20.599" style="s2">systems and there&#39;s you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.440" end="01:01:22.670" style="s2">just so many different ways that I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.599" end="01:01:27.109" style="s2">we could navigate through this</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.670" end="01:01:28.910" style="s2">increasing amount of data as a community</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.109" end="01:01:32.390" style="s2">let&#39;s say the game be community we could</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.910" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">choose what topics have salience what</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.390" end="01:01:36.079" style="s2">people have salience right every time</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:37.910" style="s2">Jordan Hall posts even though he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:39.380" style="s2">there anymore I want to see his posts</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.910" end="01:01:40.579" style="s2">right I want to see maybe I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.380" end="01:01:41.270" style="s2">to see Jim Radford do you want to see</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.579" end="01:01:43.820" style="s2">Jim ruts like</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.270" end="01:01:46.070" style="s2">what what do I want to see and then but</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.820" end="01:01:47.810" style="s2">so that&#39;s like but also me right as an</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.070" end="01:01:49.400" style="s2">individual maybe I choose I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.810" end="01:01:52.610" style="s2">to see Jordan Hall and I wanted I want</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.400" end="01:01:54.470" style="s2">to see Knicks posts right so like both</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.610" end="01:01:56.990" style="s2">as a group so that we can give more</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.470" end="01:02:00.050" style="s2">salience to the ideas that are going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.990" end="01:02:01.820" style="s2">generate this forward and and like I put</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.050" end="01:02:03.770" style="s2">it put up a lot of ideas that are very</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.820" end="01:02:05.300" style="s2">like let&#39;s try this is an experiment and</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.770" end="01:02:07.490" style="s2">it puts up a lot of ones that are on</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.300" end="01:02:11.000" style="s2">poles that are about their amazing</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.490" end="01:02:13.190" style="s2">one-off little little tidbits and so but</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.000" end="01:02:15.350" style="s2">then again I also post some content that</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.190" end="01:02:17.150" style="s2">maybe isn&#39;t useful right so it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.350" end="01:02:19.070" style="s2">want to be able to say no this one is</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.150" end="01:02:20.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like I want people to come to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.070" end="01:02:22.130" style="s2">idea cafe that&#39;s actually pretty</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.660" end="01:02:23.480" style="s2">important especially new people who</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.130" end="01:02:26.090" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen it before like this is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.480" end="01:02:27.830" style="s2">place having one place where people can</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.090" end="01:02:29.780" style="s2">see here&#39;s what you can be involved in</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.830" end="01:02:31.910" style="s2">alright I think that is what makes my</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.780" end="01:02:34.670" style="s2">project different then many other</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.910" end="01:02:37.820" style="s2">projects out there is anyone can get</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.670" end="01:02:39.290" style="s2">involved like this isn&#39;t my baby and no</p>

<p begin="01:02:39.290" end="01:02:42.320" style="s2">participate in the idea cafe come</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.790" end="01:02:44.810" style="s2">participate the project raises and</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.320" end="01:02:47.180" style="s2">solutions everything eyes design is</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.810" end="01:02:49.040" style="s2">designed for the masses to get involved</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.180" end="01:02:50.780" style="s2">without it being capable like you said</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.040" end="01:02:53.390" style="s2">10,000 people knowing people coming on</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.780" end="01:02:55.610" style="s2">board isn&#39;t feasible but luckily it</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.390" end="01:02:57.430" style="s2">grows organically and if it doesn&#39;t part</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.610" end="01:03:00.260" style="s2">of it&#39;s owning that piece of it like if</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.430" end="01:03:01.520" style="s2">the four of us are on a board meeting</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.260" end="01:03:03.380" style="s2">you call them we happen to have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.520" end="01:03:05.330" style="s2">thousand people watching it isn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.380" end="01:03:06.680" style="s2">be very easy to have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.330" end="01:03:08.300" style="s2">them in the comments but then we</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.680" end="01:03:10.550" style="s2">introduce things like polls and things</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.300" end="01:03:12.170" style="s2">that are like hey someone asks a</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.550" end="01:03:13.820" style="s2">question and people upload it right like</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.170" end="01:03:15.680" style="s2">something that is that does bring that</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.820" end="01:03:17.330" style="s2">like yes 10,000 people can&#39;t be on a</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.680" end="01:03:19.460" style="s2">board of directors conversation right</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.330" end="01:03:21.290" style="s2">but there are ways to vote for the board</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.460" end="01:03:24.580" style="s2">of directors so you can empower me or</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.290" end="01:03:27.350" style="s2">empower Bentley or like there&#39;s ways to</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.580" end="01:03:29.270" style="s2">to create it together where it could be</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.350" end="01:03:30.860" style="s2">hey yes there&#39;s 10,000 people we honor</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.270" end="01:03:32.720" style="s2">they&#39;re not ever all 10,000 people are</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.860" end="01:03:33.980" style="s2">gonna be the ones deciding on things</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.720" end="01:03:36.830" style="s2">we&#39;re not there yet we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.980" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">infrastructure but also we don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.830" end="01:03:41.390" style="s2">let it fall away and be like well oops</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:42.800" style="s2">10,000 people right like it&#39;s we come up</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.390" end="01:03:45.920" style="s2">with solutions that could work for</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.800" end="01:03:47.390" style="s2">10,000 people and then is this working</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.920" end="01:03:49.010" style="s2">what would make it even better right so</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.390" end="01:03:50.510" style="s2">the people drop off because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.010" end="01:03:52.940" style="s2">feel like they&#39;re included and bones</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.510" end="01:03:54.290" style="s2">that&#39;s a problem but you as long as</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.940" end="01:03:54.470" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for the problems and try</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.290" end="01:03:57.380" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.470" end="01:03:59.540" style="s2">all of them and people are empowered to</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.380" end="01:04:01.520" style="s2">be part of the solution right like I</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.540" end="01:04:04.280" style="s2">want from those 10,000 people to know</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.520" end="01:04:06.230" style="s2">how do we had 10,000 people involved and</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.280" end="01:04:08.030" style="s2">I want the best ideas to come to the to</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.230" end="01:04:10.490" style="s2">come to the top I don&#39;t want to listen</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.030" end="01:04:12.470" style="s2">to 10,000 people&#39;s ideas mmm</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.490" end="01:04:13.609" style="s2">but I&#39;ll listen to five people&#39;s ideas</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.470" end="01:04:15.830" style="s2">and everyone could listen to five</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.609" end="01:04:19.280" style="s2">people&#39;s ideas and upload them right and</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.830" end="01:04:22.099" style="s2">I&#39;d do it in in ways that do that work</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.280" end="01:04:25.040" style="s2">ish and then looking for new and better</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.099" end="01:04:26.980" style="s2">ways to do governance and communication</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.040" end="01:04:29.000" style="s2">and the feeling that the individual gets</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.980" end="01:04:30.980" style="s2">how involved they are and whether</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.000" end="01:04:37.430" style="s2">they&#39;re being heard and their ideas</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.980" end="01:04:38.960" style="s2">listened to yeah yeah I mean it just</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.430" end="01:04:40.849" style="s2">reminded me that again I&#39;ve just you</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.960" end="01:04:42.290" style="s2">know like I was been interested in in</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.849" end="01:04:44.599" style="s2">reddit for quite a while just because</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.290" end="01:04:46.430" style="s2">it&#39;s this you get these different</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.599" end="01:04:48.680" style="s2">communities and sharing spaces for</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.430" end="01:04:50.810" style="s2">different subjects and there&#39;s this kind</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.680" end="01:04:52.520" style="s2">of filtering process within it where</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.810" end="01:04:54.470" style="s2">everyone can kind of contribute and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.520" end="01:04:56.330" style="s2">kind of filtering out to the surface the</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.470" end="01:04:58.430" style="s2">top of the stuff that&#39;s like deemed the</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.330" end="01:05:01.730" style="s2">most relevant to that communities it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.430" end="01:05:03.980" style="s2">not fixed to any specific metrics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.730" end="01:05:06.320" style="s2">just whatever is deemed most interesting</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.980" end="01:05:09.170" style="s2">by that community but I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.320" end="01:05:10.339" style="s2">yeah like I&#39;m I&#39;m fascinated and all</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.170" end="01:05:11.570" style="s2">that kind of thing like how are these</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.339" end="01:05:13.130" style="s2">different tools like what are the</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.570" end="01:05:15.380" style="s2">different tools what do they what</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.130" end="01:05:17.510" style="s2">advantages do they provide what scale</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.380" end="01:05:19.220" style="s2">they most appropriate and how does that</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.510" end="01:05:22.430" style="s2">fit into this larger kind of framework</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.220" end="01:05:24.680" style="s2">of collective intelligence but I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.430" end="01:05:26.390" style="s2">yeah having having feedback things as</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.680" end="01:05:27.890" style="s2">well so if people are watching and</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.390" end="01:05:30.260" style="s2">they&#39;re like I don&#39;t like this is there</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.890" end="01:05:32.089" style="s2">a way that they can put that across or</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.260" end="01:05:33.710" style="s2">if they&#39;ve got a new idea can they can</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.089" end="01:05:36.020" style="s2">they get that into the mix and then have</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.710" end="01:05:41.359" style="s2">that filtered up and it&#39;s just like this</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.020" end="01:05:42.859" style="s2">kind of dynamic system yeah exactly when</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.359" end="01:05:44.869" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for thing reasons it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.859" end="01:05:46.550" style="s2">breaking right it&#39;s also like I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.869" end="01:05:47.810" style="s2">like Reddit and I don&#39;t like reading I</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.550" end="01:05:50.440" style="s2">feel like whenever I put anything out</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.810" end="01:05:52.880" style="s2">there it&#39;s crickets ill there too like</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.440" end="01:05:54.320" style="s2">in the bigger ones you don&#39;t get seen</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.880" end="01:05:55.880" style="s2">and if the first few people don&#39;t upvote</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.320" end="01:05:57.680" style="s2">you then it&#39;s lost and you don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.880" end="01:05:59.270" style="s2">there&#39;s ways and it&#39;s okay because</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.680" end="01:06:01.130" style="s2">everyone&#39;s kind of in the same boat but</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.270" end="01:06:02.900" style="s2">it&#39;s like no bhaiyaji you can save the</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.130" end="01:06:04.220" style="s2">world like I want it to be uploaded</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.900" end="01:06:06.020" style="s2">right and there&#39;s a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.220" end="01:06:08.210" style="s2">aren&#39;t great at writing are great at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.020" end="01:06:11.270" style="s2">communication piece but the idea</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.210" end="01:06:13.760" style="s2">and I think mine is yours is very</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.270" end="01:06:15.710" style="s2">similar right like but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.760" end="01:06:17.420" style="s2">everyone thinks it is a new idea so</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.710" end="01:06:19.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t people don&#39;t see the beauty in</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.420" end="01:06:21.830" style="s2">it but like how do we those are the very</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.730" end="01:06:23.150" style="s2">ideas we need especially for people who</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.830" end="01:06:25.670" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to sell them and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.150" end="01:06:28.070" style="s2">know how to communicate them like I have</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.670" end="01:06:30.500" style="s2">a hypothesis that basically every</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.070" end="01:06:31.760" style="s2">solution exists already on this planet</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.500" end="01:06:35.030" style="s2">right we have a solution clean up the</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.760" end="01:06:36.830" style="s2">oceans to sequester carbon to do for</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.030" end="01:06:39.050" style="s2">unlimited and on Janee that&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.830" end="01:06:40.670" style="s2">cheap but the people who know how to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.050" end="01:06:42.950" style="s2">it I have to go through the marketplace</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.670" end="01:06:45.530" style="s2">to get it out there and it&#39;s broken like</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.950" end="01:06:47.119" style="s2">your your it takes a lot of work and a</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.530" end="01:06:49.670" style="s2">lot of ego killing to put yourself out</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.119" end="01:06:51.380" style="s2">there when people can like make your</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.670" end="01:06:53.240" style="s2">projects sound stupid or like you</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.380" end="01:06:55.220" style="s2">already sound stupid things like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.240" end="01:06:57.050" style="s2">hard I&#39;m willing to do it because my</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.220" end="01:06:58.910" style="s2">project I think is so important that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.050" end="01:07:00.410" style="s2">like I&#39;m willing to like do this again</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.910" end="01:07:02.869" style="s2">and again and again until it exists in</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.410" end="01:07:05.060" style="s2">the world but not everyone is right if</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.869" end="01:07:07.190" style="s2">my solution was only how to clean up the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.060" end="01:07:09.080" style="s2">ocean right like oh someone else will</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.190" end="01:07:10.310" style="s2">take that on right like you put it out</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.080" end="01:07:11.810" style="s2">there and you tell 100 people and</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.310" end="01:07:13.160" style="s2">everyone&#39;s like that&#39;s not gonna work</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.810" end="01:07:14.900" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna keep telling people</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.160" end="01:07:17.420" style="s2">right whereas if instead we could be</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.900" end="01:07:17.810" style="s2">like listen ocean needs to get cleaned</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.420" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.810" end="01:07:22.970" style="s2">who&#39;s got solutions and then how which</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:23.960" style="s2">one is the best right and maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.970" end="01:07:26.300" style="s2">didn&#39;t hear about that in the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.960" end="01:07:27.950" style="s2">so your solution comes on later but like</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.300" end="01:07:29.540" style="s2">who cares we have a dozen solutions on</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.950" end="01:07:30.859" style="s2">how to clean up the ocean here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.540" end="01:07:32.420" style="s2">best one we have so far</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.859" end="01:07:34.250" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the end all be all</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.420" end="01:07:36.530" style="s2">monopoly you clean it up if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.250" end="01:07:37.490" style="s2">new idea that&#39;s better we don&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.530" end="01:07:39.800" style="s2">with that because we&#39;ve already gotten</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.490" end="01:07:41.510" style="s2">so far on this one but like how do we</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.800" end="01:07:43.760" style="s2">incorporate yours into this how do we</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.510" end="01:07:45.560" style="s2">how do we actually get ideas into the</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:49.490" style="s2">world without needing the person to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.560" end="01:07:51.290" style="s2">the marketer the communicator yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.490" end="01:07:52.550" style="s2">that that to me like reminds me of like</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.290" end="01:07:54.560" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I explained it very well</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.550" end="01:07:56.720" style="s2">earlier but like the the idea of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.560" end="01:07:59.480" style="s2">using mapping within communities like</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.720" end="01:08:00.980" style="s2">gaming because I think is if that is one</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.480" end="01:08:03.109" style="s2">of the challenges with the tools that</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.980" end="01:08:04.910" style="s2">we&#39;ve got at the moment is that in</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.109" end="01:08:06.440" style="s2">amongst that community there&#39;s loads of</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.910" end="01:08:09.109" style="s2">people they&#39;ve got different ideas or</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.440" end="01:08:11.240" style="s2">little pieces of the puzzle but how do</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.109" end="01:08:12.980" style="s2">you find that in the community like at</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.240" end="01:08:15.320" style="s2">the moment there isn&#39;t a space I can go</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.980" end="01:08:17.600" style="s2">to to see like who&#39;s got ideas on how to</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.320" end="01:08:19.279" style="s2">fix problems with the ocean like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.600" end="01:08:21.210" style="s2">I feel like there should be a space for</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.279" end="01:08:24.270" style="s2">every idea every kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.210" end="01:08:26.339" style="s2">concept or space like that every domain</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.270" end="01:08:27.779" style="s2">like that so if you&#39;ve got an idea it</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.339" end="01:08:29.489" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter how developed it is it</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.779" end="01:08:30.810" style="s2">could just be you know just something</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.489" end="01:08:33.330" style="s2">off the top of your head you can put it</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.810" end="01:08:34.770" style="s2">in there and then other ideas can be put</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.330" end="01:08:36.839" style="s2">in there and they can accumulate over</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.770" end="01:08:38.219" style="s2">time and then other people looking at</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.839" end="01:08:39.810" style="s2">that space can go in and maybe they</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.219" end="01:08:41.219" style="s2">could just go through and like tag one</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.810" end="01:08:43.020" style="s2">be like oh that&#39;s a really good idea or</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.219" end="01:08:45.120" style="s2">that one wouldn&#39;t work for this reason</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.020" end="01:08:47.489" style="s2">and it&#39;s just adding bits of information</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.120" end="01:08:50.400" style="s2">of that space and over time that can</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.489" end="01:08:52.200" style="s2">accumulate and you know it reminds me a</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.400" end="01:08:54.000" style="s2">bit of kind of just the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.200" end="01:08:55.859" style="s2">enterprise you know that you&#39;ve got all</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.000" end="01:08:57.210" style="s2">these different branches of science and</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.859" end="01:08:58.890" style="s2">you have people going out and doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.210" end="01:09:01.020" style="s2">research and experiments on different</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.890" end="01:09:03.660" style="s2">areas but because it&#39;s actually being</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.020" end="01:09:06.960" style="s2">written up and kind of added to this</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.660" end="01:09:09.600" style="s2">accumulating library of information it</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.960" end="01:09:11.790" style="s2">means that you know ideas can evolve</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.600" end="01:09:13.049" style="s2">beyond individuals you know someone</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.790" end="01:09:14.700" style="s2">might contribute a little bit and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.049" end="01:09:16.230" style="s2">they die and then the next generation</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.700" end="01:09:18.750" style="s2">can come across that bit of information</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.230" end="01:09:20.489" style="s2">do some more experiments that add on it</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.750" end="01:09:21.900" style="s2">and then you know that that would be</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.489" end="01:09:23.670" style="s2">their contribution and then other people</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.900" end="01:09:25.109" style="s2">do stuff but then over generations and</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.670" end="01:09:26.910" style="s2">generations you see this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.109" end="01:09:30.060" style="s2">continuous evolution of all these</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.910" end="01:09:32.549" style="s2">different branches and I kind of I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.060" end="01:09:34.080" style="s2">that there&#39;s potential you know haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.549" end="01:09:35.520" style="s2">got it clearly in my head yet but I</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.080" end="01:09:37.859" style="s2">think there&#39;s tools that could be built</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.520" end="01:09:39.299" style="s2">like without too much difficulty that</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.859" end="01:09:44.250" style="s2">would actually enable that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.299" end="01:09:46.200" style="s2">to be experimented with already so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.250" end="01:09:48.029" style="s2">some like I&#39;ve written a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.200" end="01:09:50.009" style="s2">about it but it&#39;s it&#39;s a struggle to</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.029" end="01:09:52.380" style="s2">kind of communicate these ideas to two</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.009" end="01:09:53.819" style="s2">groups because like you said like some</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.380" end="01:09:55.530" style="s2">of these ideas like for me to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.819" end="01:09:57.900" style="s2">really put them into writing they end up</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.530" end="01:09:59.820" style="s2">being pretty long essays which take ages</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.900" end="01:10:01.170" style="s2">to do and then is really intimidating</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.820" end="01:10:03.900" style="s2">and most people don&#39;t want to read</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.170" end="01:10:10.200" style="s2">through all that kind of stuff but how</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.900" end="01:10:12.290" style="s2">do you communicate it and that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.200" end="01:10:14.750" style="s2">mean I think there&#39;s a handful of</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.290" end="01:10:18.810" style="s2">projects that if they existed already</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.750" end="01:10:21.450" style="s2">would be huge game changing overnight</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.810" end="01:10:22.800" style="s2">like having one social media platform</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.450" end="01:10:25.020" style="s2">that we owned together that even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.800" end="01:10:27.060" style="s2">in the most beta form if we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.020" end="01:10:29.040" style="s2">to improve it and create it better that</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.060" end="01:10:30.930" style="s2">is what we want we want something that</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.040" end="01:10:33.030" style="s2">is and then talking about databases at</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.930" end="01:10:34.780" style="s2">all that&#39;s like some where anyone can go</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.030" end="01:10:36.370" style="s2">and find a project and work on</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.780" end="01:10:37.720" style="s2">project right even if it&#39;s just now</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.370" end="01:10:39.520" style="s2">let&#39;s have a second conversation about</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.720" end="01:10:40.960" style="s2">what that actually looks like and it</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.520" end="01:10:43.330" style="s2">builds into that all the tools we need</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.960" end="01:10:45.730" style="s2">the scheduler the project management</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.330" end="01:10:47.560" style="s2">system right whatever we need organized</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.730" end="01:10:50.230" style="s2">whatever is gonna be the most bang for</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.560" end="01:10:52.150" style="s2">about to be in this and then one of</p>

<p begin="01:11:50.110" end="01:11:53.680" style="s2">do we share information how do we create</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.430" end="01:11:56.290" style="s2">these databases that are that we trust</p>

<p begin="01:12:00.820" end="01:12:04.630" style="s2">of the problems everything else does</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.200" end="01:12:06.250" style="s2">right design the Yelp for solutions are</p>

<p begin="01:12:09.760" end="01:12:13.990" style="s2">where like for me I&#39;m focused more on</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.620" end="01:12:14.980" style="s2">like bringing the community together but</p>

<p begin="01:16:12.640" end="01:16:16.030" style="s2">the person and also being the person</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.530" end="01:16:17.620" style="s2">who&#39;s like I need this right I want this</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.030" end="01:16:18.790" style="s2">task done it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.620" end="01:16:21.219" style="s2">done if you can&#39;t do it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.790" end="01:16:22.630" style="s2">necessarily gonna get done but it can</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.219" end="01:16:23.980" style="s2">get put it out into the universe and if</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.630" end="01:16:24.850" style="s2">it&#39;s catalogues correctly the right</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.980" end="01:16:26.920" style="s2">people will find it</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.850" end="01:16:29.350" style="s2">yeah well this this is actually one of</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.920" end="01:16:30.940" style="s2">the tools that I think would be I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.350" end="01:16:33.670" style="s2">know if it sounds like some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.940" end="01:16:35.260" style="s2">you thought of together tech might align</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.670" end="01:16:36.580" style="s2">with this but I think a tool that would</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.260" end="01:16:40.300" style="s2">be really useful for the game be</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.580" end="01:16:43.000" style="s2">community is something that would like I</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.300" end="01:16:48.100" style="s2">don&#39;t have you use something like Trello</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.000" end="01:16:49.870" style="s2">or yeah a little bit basically you can</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.100" end="01:16:51.100" style="s2">just create a little like note which is</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.870" end="01:16:52.900" style="s2">just like a task that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.100" end="01:16:54.340" style="s2">completed and then you can like move it</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.900" end="01:16:56.050" style="s2">through different stages so you could</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.340" end="01:16:57.969" style="s2">have it in the backlog you could be like</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.050" end="01:16:59.800" style="s2">an active task and then a completed task</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.969" end="01:17:02.260" style="s2">is just like a really basic way of</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.800" end="01:17:04.300" style="s2">organizing stuff and then you know like</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.260" end="01:17:06.370" style="s2">for in-game be it would be cool if like</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.300" end="01:17:07.390" style="s2">you know people could just create tasks</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.370" end="01:17:09.190" style="s2">that they&#39;re like you know it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.390" end="01:17:10.780" style="s2">awesome if someone did this and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.190" end="01:17:12.070" style="s2">other people just browse them and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.780" end="01:17:13.540" style="s2">if there&#39;s you know if you happen to</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.070" end="01:17:14.920" style="s2">have the skills or the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.540" end="01:17:17.080" style="s2">contribute to one of those</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.920" end="01:17:20.200" style="s2">you can get it get it complete and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.080" end="01:17:21.940" style="s2">you know they could like I think at</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.200" end="01:17:23.380" style="s2">least initially people would some people</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.940" end="01:17:25.030" style="s2">would still we motivate to do it even if</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.380" end="01:17:27.040" style="s2">there was no reward or incentive but</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.030" end="01:17:30.100" style="s2">there can also be ways of incentivizing</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.040" end="01:17:32.320" style="s2">that too and that might just help to</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.100" end="01:17:34.620" style="s2">coordinate things and help your</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.320" end="01:17:36.360" style="s2">community to kind of get things done</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.620" end="01:17:39.670" style="s2">more effectively</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.360" end="01:17:41.680" style="s2">you know project management and task</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.670" end="01:17:43.450" style="s2">management I mean there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.680" end="01:17:45.070" style="s2">really cool tools out there like Trello</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.450" end="01:17:46.450" style="s2">I&#39;m sure Monday comm all the ones they</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.070" end="01:17:50.830" style="s2">keep advertising me cuz I keep clicking</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.450" end="01:17:52.360" style="s2">on them but they&#39;re all astronomically</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.830" end="01:17:53.800" style="s2">expensive for someone who doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.360" end="01:17:55.390" style="s2">money and it&#39;s like because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.800" end="01:17:58.630" style="s2">five bucks a month per person per month</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.390" end="01:18:00.490" style="s2">I&#39;m like yeah so if I want 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.630" end="01:18:03.010" style="s2">you&#39;re like that&#39;s like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.490" end="01:18:04.750" style="s2">feasible and of course we&#39;re not there</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.010" end="01:18:06.550" style="s2">yet we don&#39;t have 10,000 but the point</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.750" end="01:18:07.900" style="s2">is like all of those things are the</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.550" end="01:18:09.400" style="s2">things we kind of need to recreate</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.900" end="01:18:11.110" style="s2">because once you gets even hundred</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.400" end="01:18:12.430" style="s2">people they start being astronomically</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.110" end="01:18:13.780" style="s2">expensive it&#39;s not just one tool you</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.430" end="01:18:17.890" style="s2">need all of these tools then how do they</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.780" end="01:18:18.910" style="s2">interconnect but when even Google comes</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.890" end="01:18:21.580" style="s2">out with something like that on the</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.910" end="01:18:24.880" style="s2">Google Drive for free or like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.580" end="01:18:26.800" style="s2">that will explode everything and so I</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.880" end="01:18:28.300" style="s2">just say we should create it like we</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.800" end="01:18:30.730" style="s2">should create the thing that is the task</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.300" end="01:18:33.910" style="s2">management and ideally that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.730" end="01:18:35.560" style="s2">project game B projects goes is we</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.910" end="01:18:37.720" style="s2">figure out our pain points that we all</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.560" end="01:18:39.970" style="s2">have our individual projects and we</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.720" end="01:18:44.170" style="s2">create the thing the task system that</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.970" end="01:18:46.150" style="s2">helps us do that and in turn in turn</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.170" end="01:18:48.430" style="s2">give each other gifts right like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.150" end="01:18:49.840" style="s2">like hey I know marketing Alex Jake I</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.430" end="01:18:52.060" style="s2">know finance I can sit with you and have</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.840" end="01:18:53.680" style="s2">that conversation I maybe know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.060" end="01:18:55.990" style="s2">necessarily have a skill set that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.680" end="01:18:57.250" style="s2">the best and any of those things but I</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.990" end="01:18:59.230" style="s2">can sit and have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.250" end="01:19:01.210" style="s2">anyone I can be part of a team to like</p>

<p begin="01:19:05.710" end="01:19:08.470" style="s2">but I can also think of solutions for</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.940" end="01:19:10.750" style="s2">other people&#39;s problems more easily they</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.470" end="01:19:12.430" style="s2">can pick up for my own and just work</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.750" end="01:19:13.900" style="s2">through like what what&#39;s stopping you</p>

<p begin="01:19:16.450" end="01:19:18.820" style="s2">lot of its like I don&#39;t have the people</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.560" end="01:19:19.930" style="s2">I don&#39;t have the skills to do this I</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.820" end="01:19:21.430" style="s2">don&#39;t have the money I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.930" end="01:19:23.200" style="s2">grade like as long as we can be Onis</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.430" end="01:19:25.180" style="s2">open and honest about those things that</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.200" end="01:19:27.160" style="s2">we can create solutions that are like</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.180" end="01:19:28.870" style="s2">all of them right like we all don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.160" end="01:19:30.700" style="s2">funding depends what</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.870" end="01:19:33.010" style="s2">mean if you mean you want $5,000 a month</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.700" end="01:19:35.050" style="s2">under the pool to pay your salary no</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.010" end="01:19:36.220" style="s2">we&#39;re not solving that yet but if we you</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.050" end="01:19:37.870" style="s2">know what I mean we&#39;re all using Trello</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.220" end="01:19:39.640" style="s2">and we won&#39;t you know name you know we</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.870" end="01:19:41.110" style="s2">want to like maybe fund that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.640" end="01:19:43.180" style="s2">difference right and it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.110" end="01:19:45.700" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna be finding how do we get the</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.180" end="01:19:47.560" style="s2">cheapest how do we get the best stuff</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.700" end="01:19:49.090" style="s2">for what we got in my brain I could feel</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.560" end="01:19:51.460" style="s2">it like shutting down probably go pretty</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.090" end="01:19:53.230" style="s2">stupid couldn&#39;t go up an app but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.460" end="01:19:55.780" style="s2">you know I probably aside I&#39;ve seen but</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.230" end="01:19:58.120" style="s2">yeah I think like just a last point is I</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.780" end="01:20:00.130" style="s2">think I see the the kind of one of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.120" end="01:20:02.290" style="s2">key next steps is getting that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.130" end="01:20:04.750" style="s2">like seed social networking place with</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.290" end="01:20:06.810" style="s2">the kind of the most basic functionality</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.750" end="01:20:09.370" style="s2">that would provide real use to people</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.810" end="01:20:12.190" style="s2">and that&#39;s something that I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.370" end="01:20:13.810" style="s2">working on in my free time and my free</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.190" end="01:20:16.000" style="s2">time is pretty limited at the moment but</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.810" end="01:20:19.570" style="s2">my goal at the moment is kind of by the</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.000" end="01:20:21.400" style="s2">end of the summer to have recreated most</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.570" end="01:20:23.470" style="s2">of the functionality that&#39;s on week at</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.400" end="01:20:24.900" style="s2">the moment I can send you a link to that</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.470" end="01:20:27.880" style="s2">if you&#39;re interested in checking it out</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.900" end="01:20:29.740" style="s2">but yeah I&#39;m really interested in like</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.880" end="01:20:31.420" style="s2">especially people like yourself you were</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.740" end="01:20:33.340" style="s2">thinking about these kinds of things in</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.420" end="01:20:34.990" style="s2">just figuring out like what would be</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.340" end="01:20:37.000" style="s2">those key features that you would need</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.990" end="01:20:41.470" style="s2">to make it really useful at that early</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.000" end="01:20:42.970" style="s2">stage so yeah I&#39;ll share up like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.470" end="01:20:44.350" style="s2">when I get a chance I&#39;ll send over a</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.970" end="01:20:46.150" style="s2">little bit more information about kind</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.350" end="01:20:48.130" style="s2">of the basics of what I&#39;m trying to put</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.150" end="01:20:49.990" style="s2">together but if you&#39;ve got ideas on like</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.130" end="01:20:51.640" style="s2">just some little features that would be</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.990" end="01:20:53.890" style="s2">really useful to you guys with together</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.640" end="01:20:55.990" style="s2">tech like yeah that would be helpful to</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.890" end="01:20:57.820" style="s2">me to know that Calista totally down</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.990" end="01:20:59.440" style="s2">with giving that information to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.820" end="01:21:01.630" style="s2">in anyone it&#39;s like you&#39;re Zoe needs</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.440" end="01:21:04.780" style="s2">yard to be able to work through and if</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.630" end="01:21:06.550" style="s2">we can even come up with it but like to</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.780" end="01:21:08.650" style="s2">me there&#39;s so many people in game B who</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.550" end="01:21:11.110" style="s2">are coming just in game B we&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.650" end="01:21:13.780" style="s2">up with collaboration platforms yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.110" end="01:21:15.910" style="s2">those are important but this and I think</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.780" end="01:21:18.310" style="s2">they are fundamental but the issue is</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.910" end="01:21:19.750" style="s2">because they&#39;re all fractured like all</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.310" end="01:21:22.150" style="s2">of them are kind of beta and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.750" end="01:21:23.920" style="s2">our beta right like it&#39;s like someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.150" end="01:21:26.410" style="s2">version that usually doesn&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.920" end="01:21:28.300" style="s2">time or enough money or enough user</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.410" end="01:21:29.740" style="s2">friendliness to actually like get to the</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.300" end="01:21:31.570" style="s2">next level it&#39;s like if we could come</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.740" end="01:21:34.570" style="s2">together instead of it being practice or</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.570" end="01:21:37.650" style="s2">ium or wiko or i can never remember what</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.570" end="01:21:40.180" style="s2">you know this one one is having it be</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.650" end="01:21:41.650" style="s2">like here are the features we all need</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.180" end="01:21:42.610" style="s2">it to be right and then if you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.650" end="01:21:44.110" style="s2">person knows how to code</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.610" end="01:21:47.260" style="s2">awesome how do we get you paid for that</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.110" end="01:21:49.180" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of work but like what is</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.260" end="01:21:50.620" style="s2">what would game be need for this right</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.180" end="01:21:52.930" style="s2">and there&#39;s only a thousand people in</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.620" end="01:21:55.060" style="s2">the Facebook group but so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.930" end="01:21:56.230" style="s2">too small to fund it because you know be</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.060" end="01:21:58.300" style="s2">like tens of thousands of dollars</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.230" end="01:22:00.220" style="s2">probably to create a decent one if not a</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.300" end="01:22:02.410" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars but especially</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.220" end="01:22:04.600" style="s2">if you can talk to other people you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.410" end="01:22:06.160" style="s2">in similar projects and have like what</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.600" end="01:22:06.790" style="s2">do we need one of the features we need</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.160" end="01:22:08.920" style="s2">to be able to work through our</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.790" end="01:22:10.840" style="s2">individual projects and that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.920" end="01:22:12.670" style="s2">meta project is more so if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.840" end="01:22:13.960" style="s2">bring your project to the matter project</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.670" end="01:22:15.550" style="s2">that might be a very powerful cuz you</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.960" end="01:22:17.920" style="s2">already working on it and if it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.550" end="01:22:19.300" style="s2">the thing that we can put our projects</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.920" end="01:22:21.880" style="s2">on and be able to work through our</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.300" end="01:22:23.590" style="s2">projects then that&#39;s the social media</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.880" end="01:22:25.150" style="s2">platform we need right to be able to say</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.590" end="01:22:26.890" style="s2">hey how do we find out maybe we can</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.150" end="01:22:28.330" style="s2">finance it through here but that might</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.890" end="01:22:31.990" style="s2">be the next generation right or how do</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.330" end="01:22:33.730" style="s2">we but for me for my opinion the person</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.990" end="01:22:35.410" style="s2">who will be the person who creates the</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.730" end="01:22:36.940" style="s2">the social media platform that we all</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.410" end="01:22:38.320" style="s2">kind of Qing can use will be someone</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.940" end="01:22:39.850" style="s2">who&#39;s willing to have it be a group</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.320" end="01:22:43.030" style="s2">project right willing to have other</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.850" end="01:22:44.440" style="s2">people that like they don&#39;t physically</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.030" end="01:22:46.180" style="s2">own it and finance but that&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.440" end="01:22:48.190" style="s2">important and like intellectually owning</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.180" end="01:22:49.840" style="s2">it right like and it&#39;s hard because you</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.190" end="01:22:51.370" style="s2">can&#39;t have people dictating to you what</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.840" end="01:22:52.780" style="s2">you&#39;re making either right like well</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.370" end="01:22:54.730" style="s2">this is what it needs to have it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.780" end="01:22:56.230" style="s2">that&#39;s passing off by I can&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.730" end="01:22:58.420" style="s2">though so I need other people to make it</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.230" end="01:23:01.390" style="s2">but if collectively can decide on the</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.420" end="01:23:03.280" style="s2">the all the features that could have</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.390" end="01:23:05.950" style="s2">right like the best feature is this is</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.280" end="01:23:08.410" style="s2">awesome this is like our utopian app and</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.950" end="01:23:09.850" style="s2">then figure out well how complex is each</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.410" end="01:23:11.650" style="s2">one how much money does each one cost</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.850" end="01:23:14.650" style="s2">and what&#39;s the priority of each one</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.650" end="01:23:16.870" style="s2">right and then how much can we fund with</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.650" end="01:23:19.030" style="s2">$10,000 right and can we get 10,000 lb</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.870" end="01:23:20.800" style="s2">like whatever that that is to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.030" end="01:23:23.470" style="s2">then create the beta that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.800" end="01:23:25.180" style="s2">willing to go into and try even though</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.470" end="01:23:27.490" style="s2">it might not work to be able to help</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.180" end="01:23:28.930" style="s2">make it better is I for me anyway the</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.490" end="01:23:30.970" style="s2">process that I want to go through</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.930" end="01:23:32.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s like then it&#39;s ours right</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.970" end="01:23:35.050" style="s2">and we can build on it you can get add</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.680" end="01:23:38.530" style="s2">to it and but yet right now with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.050" end="01:23:40.390" style="s2">projects it&#39;s very no one&#39;s giving up</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.530" end="01:23:41.830" style="s2">ownership of their project right like</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.390" end="01:23:43.390" style="s2">we&#39;re not at that stage we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.830" end="01:23:46.420" style="s2">happened like the more someone&#39;s willing</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.390" end="01:23:47.650" style="s2">to say here is when I&#39;m willing to write</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.420" end="01:23:50.080" style="s2">and don&#39;t hold me to that it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.650" end="01:23:52.750" style="s2">legal contract but like hey when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.080" end="01:23:55.120" style="s2">10,000 people on board and everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.750" end="01:23:56.239" style="s2">putting $10 in yes I&#39;m willing to that</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.120" end="01:24:00.380" style="s2">right or like whatever</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.239" end="01:24:01.849" style="s2">that that level is or when there&#39;s five</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.380" end="01:24:03.380" style="s2">people involved right Emily to share</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.849" end="01:24:05.239" style="s2">with those five people whatever that was</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.380" end="01:24:07.340" style="s2">those those kind of things are yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.239" end="01:24:09.199" style="s2">mean I think it can start right from the</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.340" end="01:24:10.969" style="s2">from the beginning level like you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.199" end="01:24:13.429" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the approach we&#39;ve had we</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.969" end="01:24:15.349" style="s2">chose that we you know it&#39;s we basically</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.429" end="01:24:17.960" style="s2">said anyone&#39;s welcome to become a member</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.349" end="01:24:19.489" style="s2">you know anyone could be a user for free</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.960" end="01:24:22.340" style="s2">if you want to become a member it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.489" end="01:24:23.630" style="s2">you know three dollars a month and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.340" end="01:24:26.420" style="s2">you can vote and you can put forward</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.630" end="01:24:29.059" style="s2">ideas and if it&#39;s if an idea is voted on</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.420" end="01:24:31.489" style="s2">by the majority of their members then it</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.059" end="01:24:33.050" style="s2">basically becomes the new priority for</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.489" end="01:24:35.239" style="s2">what&#39;s acted on</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.050" end="01:24:36.590" style="s2">yeah I think I agree with everything</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.239" end="01:24:38.300" style="s2">you&#39;re saying like I think there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.590" end="01:24:39.889" style="s2">watching a lot of these different</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.300" end="01:24:43.489" style="s2">projects that are kind of there in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.889" end="01:24:45.409" style="s2">game be space and I&#39;m pretty sure that</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.489" end="01:24:47.800" style="s2">like a little while ago I kind of made a</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.409" end="01:24:49.999" style="s2">suggestion and tagged a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.800" end="01:24:51.699" style="s2">who were in these different projects and</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.999" end="01:24:54.019" style="s2">saying like maybe what we need to do is</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.699" end="01:24:55.579" style="s2">is just get all these people together</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.019" end="01:24:57.679" style="s2">somehow like I don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.579" end="01:24:59.420" style="s2">format would be and try and have some</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.679" end="01:25:01.309" style="s2">kind of a public debate or discussion</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.420" end="01:25:03.949" style="s2">around like what are the key features</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.309" end="01:25:06.199" style="s2">that need it and how can we coordinate</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.949" end="01:25:09.019" style="s2">to do that but I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.199" end="01:25:10.579" style="s2">difficult to actually do that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.019" end="01:25:14.480" style="s2">get a huge amount response from that</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.579" end="01:25:16.010" style="s2">which is kind of like expect but quads I</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.480" end="01:25:17.840" style="s2">try to have a conversation about a</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.010" end="01:25:19.699" style="s2">conversation and nobody wants to come to</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.840" end="01:25:21.050" style="s2">a conversation about a conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.699" end="01:25:23.090" style="s2">it&#39;s like that one governance and</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.050" end="01:25:24.739" style="s2">everything as well but at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.090" end="01:25:26.119" style="s2">it has to happen like it&#39;s like if you</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.739" end="01:25:27.769" style="s2">have a project you want to get off the</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.119" end="01:25:29.630" style="s2">ground you have to be willing to have</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.769" end="01:25:31.579" style="s2">conversations about your project if</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.630" end="01:25:33.920" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to like intermix with</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.579" end="01:25:36.349" style="s2">other people and cross pollinate and</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.920" end="01:25:37.519" style="s2">find ways that what are the pain points</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.349" end="01:25:39.139" style="s2">if you&#39;re willing to be vulnerable and</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.519" end="01:25:41.570" style="s2">share what you don&#39;t know and share what</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.139" end="01:25:43.489" style="s2">what isn&#39;t happening for you so we can</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.570" end="01:25:46.460" style="s2">create an including things like hey</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.489" end="01:25:48.679" style="s2">we&#39;re across 24 time zones where you</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.460" end="01:25:51.199" style="s2">know geographically dispersed how do we</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.679" end="01:25:53.300" style="s2">create a conversation that happens I</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.199" end="01:25:55.550" style="s2">have solutions some solutions for that</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.300" end="01:25:58.429" style="s2">but even that gets crickets right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.550" end="01:25:59.989" style="s2">like oh well people don&#39;t want to come</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.429" end="01:26:01.670" style="s2">be part of a conversation that&#39;s a 24</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.989" end="01:26:03.559" style="s2">hours on zoom&#39; okay cool</p>

<p begin="01:26:03.559" end="01:26:07.519" style="s2">it though and that seems to be working</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.820" end="01:26:09.530" style="s2">that like there are ways to have a</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.519" end="01:26:11.449" style="s2">continual conversation one day</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.530" end="01:26:12.860" style="s2">we can have like six different time</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.449" end="01:26:14.210" style="s2">slots and hey come on have that</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.860" end="01:26:16.219" style="s2">conversation of your project and then we</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.210" end="01:26:18.770" style="s2">have one place to keep note so we can</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.219" end="01:26:22.969" style="s2">see what we all said was in common that</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.770" end="01:26:25.550" style="s2">we wanted in a social media project but</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.969" end="01:26:26.510" style="s2">even like today we had the idea cafe for</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.550" end="01:26:27.590" style="s2">projects and it was just me and my</p>

<p begin="01:28:00.110" end="01:28:05.059" style="s2">started I wasn&#39;t watching those videos</p>

<p begin="01:28:08.719" end="01:28:12.440" style="s2">following a lot of those thinkers anyway</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.369" end="01:28:15.199" style="s2">so yeah I&#39;m a really exact point I</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.440" end="01:28:16.670" style="s2">joined the Facebook group yeah September</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.199" end="01:28:18.469" style="s2">13th because it was also the same day</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.670" end="01:28:20.690" style="s2">was Friday that there&#39;s some temper xiii</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.469" end="01:28:21.949" style="s2">and there was like a big huge assume</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.690" end="01:28:22.550" style="s2">call and Remzi told me about it like</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.949" end="01:28:24.500" style="s2">five</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.550" end="01:28:27.110" style="s2">before it happened I jumped on board the</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.500" end="01:28:29.300" style="s2">first attack it was it was that there</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.110" end="01:28:31.820" style="s2">was like a zoom cafe that anyone could</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.300" end="01:28:33.230" style="s2">pop into it anytime and he&#39;d randomly go</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.820" end="01:28:35.210" style="s2">into but after about a week of that</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.230" end="01:28:38.210" style="s2">chance of running into somebody there</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.210" end="01:28:40.910" style="s2">was very small but it&#39;s like yeah anyway</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.210" end="01:28:44.270" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of potential for like we</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.910" end="01:28:46.160" style="s2">can coordinate video chat across time</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.270" end="01:28:47.870" style="s2">zones and have it be that like our</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.160" end="01:28:49.400" style="s2">conversation is into one off and you</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.870" end="01:28:50.780" style="s2">don&#39;t need to listen to it or watch it</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.400" end="01:28:53.210" style="s2">in order for the next person to be able</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.780" end="01:28:54.380" style="s2">to add on to it I I did have a vision</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.210" end="01:28:55.940" style="s2">for that which I can share with you</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.380" end="01:28:58.430" style="s2">another time because I think we both</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.940" end="01:28:59.960" style="s2">probably need to go but on how like it</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.430" end="01:29:01.820" style="s2">was it came on this citizen assembly</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.960" end="01:29:03.290" style="s2">from extinction rebellion I&#39;m like why</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.820" end="01:29:05.210" style="s2">don&#39;t we just do that but we just</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.290" end="01:29:07.640" style="s2">created like they&#39;re like no we have to</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.210" end="01:29:08.930" style="s2">go through our government I&#39;m like or we</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.640" end="01:29:11.000" style="s2">could just come together and start</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.930" end="01:29:13.400" style="s2">talking about climate change like how do</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.000" end="01:29:14.960" style="s2">we actually create solutions and not</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.400" end="01:29:17.540" style="s2">need to go through that process and so I</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.960" end="01:29:20.810" style="s2">developed a way of like every four hours</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.540" end="01:29:22.820" style="s2">so there were like six and in per day</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.810" end="01:29:25.250" style="s2">you&#39;d go on and answer a question and a</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.820" end="01:29:27.230" style="s2">group and then the next day if those who</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.250" end="01:29:28.820" style="s2">wanted to who participated come on and</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.230" end="01:29:29.900" style="s2">like harvest that conversation right</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.820" end="01:29:31.400" style="s2">because they would have participated in</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.900" end="01:29:33.530" style="s2">multiple ones over the course of the day</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.400" end="01:29:35.090" style="s2">could come on and say what they learnt</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.530" end="01:29:37.340" style="s2">and what happened and kind of</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.090" end="01:29:38.960" style="s2">consolidate the notes and then you do</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.340" end="01:29:41.210" style="s2">not like you just build on and build on</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.960" end="01:29:42.590" style="s2">right where every every week you have a</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.210" end="01:29:43.670" style="s2">couple questions you&#39;re answering and</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.590" end="01:29:46.490" style="s2">you get to show up and have a</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.670" end="01:29:48.230" style="s2">conversation with whoever&#39;s there and as</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.490" end="01:29:50.240" style="s2">a collective bigger group we&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.230" end="01:29:53.000" style="s2">bigger conversation and we&#39;re all like</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.240" end="01:29:54.860" style="s2">notes for that there has to be something</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.000" end="01:29:56.960" style="s2">that comes out of it like a project or</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.860" end="01:29:58.430" style="s2">no it&#39;s something that continues on and</p>
