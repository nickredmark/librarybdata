<p begin="00:00:07.429" end="00:00:11.880" style="s2">speak to me I know it&#39;s really late over</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.960" end="00:00:14.670" style="s2">there and we&#39;re going to do a follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.880" end="00:00:17.369" style="s2">to we did a situational assessment a</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.670" end="00:00:19.140" style="s2">little while ago about Co vid where</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.369" end="00:00:20.760" style="s2">we&#39;re at what the sort of second and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.140" end="00:00:22.830" style="s2">third order effects might be that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.760" end="00:00:24.300" style="s2">seeing and just to introduce you briefly</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.830" end="00:00:26.250" style="s2">to people who maybe are not familiar</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.300" end="00:00:28.500" style="s2">with you you&#39;ve been on the channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.250" end="00:00:31.170" style="s2">quite a bit with films like the war on</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.500" end="00:00:33.680" style="s2">sense-making you&#39;re really interested</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.170" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">and spend a long time studying</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.680" end="00:00:40.020" style="s2">catastrophic risk and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:41.879" style="s2">civilization design and I&#39;d love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:45.809" style="s2">from you like where do you think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.879" end="00:00:49.230" style="s2">at right now so probably a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.809" end="00:00:50.250" style="s2">viewers here have heard the term the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.230" end="00:00:52.860" style="s2">hammer and dance</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.250" end="00:00:54.570" style="s2">I think poyo kind of popularized I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.860" end="00:00:57.629" style="s2">know if he came up with it and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">there is an approach that most countries</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.629" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">have taken of some kind of strong</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:04.530" style="s2">quarantine for a while to stop the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">transmission and then a release of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.530" end="00:01:08.340" style="s2">quarantine but that doesn&#39;t mean back to</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:09.720" style="s2">life as normal instantly because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.340" end="00:01:14.520" style="s2">still going to be infected people and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:15.869" style="s2">then could re start if there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.520" end="00:01:19.220" style="s2">carefulness so there has to be some</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.869" end="00:01:22.950" style="s2">ongoing management it&#39;ll involve some</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.220" end="00:01:24.540" style="s2">social distancing and PPE and testing</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.950" end="00:01:25.890" style="s2">and contact tracing and all these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.540" end="00:01:29.369" style="s2">of things and some areas that have</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.890" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">already got the caseload down quite a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.369" end="00:01:32.490" style="s2">lot and started to open back up did</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">start to see up ticks in the number of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.490" end="00:01:35.610" style="s2">cases again so then you have to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">restrict again and that&#39;s the dance</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.610" end="00:01:44.420" style="s2">right and so most of principles that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:46.500" style="s2">share will be pretty universal to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.420" end="00:01:48.360" style="s2">anywhere because it&#39;s universal to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.500" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">public health and epidemiology in like</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.360" end="00:01:52.439" style="s2">that but I&#39;ll speak about them in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">context of the United States in</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.439" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">particular since a lot of viewers are</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">there and I know more about there than</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:06.770" style="s2">other places being based here so we</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:09.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t have nationwide shelter in place</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.770" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">in a way that some people were concerned</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.720" end="00:02:12.780" style="s2">about and some people really wanted but</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:14.330" style="s2">for whatever we didn&#39;t have that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.780" end="00:02:17.600" style="s2">Moorhead state based</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.330" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">approaches and but most of the states</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.600" end="00:02:23.990" style="s2">took some kind of measures to shelter in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:26.090" style="s2">place and only have a central workers</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.990" end="00:02:28.130" style="s2">out and things like that some states</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.090" end="00:02:30.040" style="s2">like California did a lot stronger</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.130" end="00:02:33.860" style="s2">measures earlier than other states and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.040" end="00:02:37.220" style="s2">resultantly we&#39;re able to have what</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.860" end="00:02:38.630" style="s2">looked like much better curves relative</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.220" end="00:02:43.160" style="s2">to the rest of the other metrics than</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.630" end="00:02:45.560" style="s2">what they could have we&#39;re seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.160" end="00:02:47.900" style="s2">looks like the beginning of a flattening</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.560" end="00:02:49.550" style="s2">but it&#39;s not long enough to really have</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.900" end="00:02:51.260" style="s2">a clear sense on that and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.550" end="00:02:53.180" style="s2">supposed to see a flattening as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.260" end="00:02:57.410" style="s2">meaning a decrease in the number of new</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.180" end="00:02:59.390" style="s2">cases as a result of those efforts but</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.410" end="00:03:01.580" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s we it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.390" end="00:03:03.140" style="s2">and you release the efforts and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.580" end="00:03:04.820" style="s2">gone right it means you release the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.140" end="00:03:06.290" style="s2">efforts of the your back to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.820" end="00:03:09.440" style="s2">situation where it was on an exponential</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.290" end="00:03:13.670" style="s2">curve before and because of the lag time</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.440" end="00:03:17.930" style="s2">and call it two weeks right a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.670" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">five-day doubling times or so you really</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.930" end="00:03:23.450" style="s2">have to see it turned down for a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:27.140" style="s2">while before you actually have a clearer</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.450" end="00:03:29.600" style="s2">sense of what has happened but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.140" end="00:03:31.700" style="s2">just kind of fast forward a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.600" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">and different countries are obviously at</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.700" end="00:03:35.140" style="s2">different places in their curve with</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:40.190" style="s2">regard to this and even within the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.140" end="00:03:41.570" style="s2">some states got heavy amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.190" end="00:03:44.690" style="s2">infections much earlier than other</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.570" end="00:03:47.390" style="s2">states and then some of them started</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.690" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">their shelter-in-place protocols earlier</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.390" end="00:03:51.350" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not a universal curve and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:53.090" style="s2">for that reason it&#39;s actually really</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.350" end="00:03:54.680" style="s2">good for individual cities and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.090" end="00:03:58.280" style="s2">individual states to be able to think</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.680" end="00:04:00.950" style="s2">about it in a way that is relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.280" end="00:04:03.860" style="s2">their case at the same time there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.950" end="00:04:05.690" style="s2">big limits there so let&#39;s say a state</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.860" end="00:04:09.019" style="s2">did a very good job of getting their</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.690" end="00:04:10.970" style="s2">case load down to almost nothing well</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.019" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">now they other states didn&#39;t they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.970" end="00:04:16.310" style="s2">to keep their borders totally closed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:17.570" style="s2">transport of goods into food into</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.310" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">whatever otherwise they lose it again</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.570" end="00:04:22.280" style="s2">and so there is a place where whether</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:24.140" style="s2">we&#39;re talking from a state by state or a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.280" end="00:04:25.389" style="s2">county by county or a country by country</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.140" end="00:04:29.710" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.389" end="00:04:32.069" style="s2">to reopen up the flow of traffic which</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.710" end="00:04:34.870" style="s2">is key for the economy and society</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.069" end="00:04:37.990" style="s2">everybody kind of has to get to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.870" end="00:04:40.779" style="s2">similar place so there-there are both</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.990" end="00:04:45.099" style="s2">benefits of regionalism and limits to it</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.779" end="00:04:50.110" style="s2">for a situation like this so with regard</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.099" end="00:04:52.419" style="s2">to looking ahead a little bit and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.110" end="00:04:54.550" style="s2">does the path of starting to release the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.419" end="00:04:57.990" style="s2">shelter in place or quarantine look like</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.550" end="00:05:01.270" style="s2">it will be effective at being able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.990" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">keep suppressing the virus keep that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.270" end="00:05:04.629" style="s2">from being a public health pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:05.830" style="s2">while being able to allow societal</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.629" end="00:05:08.439" style="s2">function in economy in everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.830" end="00:05:09.879" style="s2">returned I&#39;ll share some thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.439" end="00:05:11.199" style="s2">that some of which are obvious and are</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.879" end="00:05:13.629" style="s2">publicly talked about some of which are</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:15.789" style="s2">not as obvious and hopefully in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.629" end="00:05:19.449" style="s2">first bit sharing this all together will</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.789" end="00:05:23.830" style="s2">add some clarity this is the day after</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.449" end="00:05:25.300" style="s2">Easter and much of this might change by</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.830" end="00:05:26.860" style="s2">a week from now because it is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.300" end="00:05:31.270" style="s2">situation where a lot is still unknown</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.860" end="00:05:33.159" style="s2">and we&#39;re learning a lot quickly and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.270" end="00:05:38.500" style="s2">might be wrong about some things so take</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.159" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">it all with a grain of salt so the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.500" end="00:05:43.839" style="s2">thing is when do we actually start</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:45.909" style="s2">releasing the quarantine measures</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.839" end="00:05:49.149" style="s2">different states have very different</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.909" end="00:05:50.409" style="s2">perspectives on this and around the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.149" end="00:05:51.729" style="s2">country there&#39;s pretty different</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.409" end="00:05:55.270" style="s2">perspectives all the way from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.729" end="00:05:57.789" style="s2">beginning of you know say Sweden on one</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.270" end="00:06:03.460" style="s2">side to Hongkong on another in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.789" end="00:06:06.129" style="s2">how to approach this and you can really</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.460" end="00:06:08.169" style="s2">see a difference in CFR and things like</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.129" end="00:06:11.439" style="s2">that as a as a function of some of those</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.169" end="00:06:13.360" style="s2">approaches as soon as the curve starts</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.439" end="00:06:15.699" style="s2">to go down a little bit is not the time</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.360" end="00:06:16.779" style="s2">that you start to release the shelter in</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.699" end="00:06:18.310" style="s2">place which is the only thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.779" end="00:06:20.469" style="s2">keeping it down you actually need to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.310" end="00:06:22.210" style="s2">down to a relatively small number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.469" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">total cases within a region and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.210" end="00:06:27.969" style="s2">region means the area in which there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:31.130" style="s2">possibility for transmission so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.969" end="00:06:34.050" style="s2">say a city or a metropolitan area</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.130" end="00:06:36.330" style="s2">you want to get down to a low total</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.050" end="00:06:40.200" style="s2">number of cases in that area before you</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.200" end="00:06:44.130" style="s2">quarantine more otherwise you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.780" end="00:06:45.450" style="s2">to still get an uptick pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.130" end="00:06:48.710" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen this happen in a number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.450" end="00:06:54.300" style="s2">areas you also shouldn&#39;t think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.710" end="00:06:56.070" style="s2">releasing it universally meaning we</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.300" end="00:06:57.290" style="s2">already have a situation of essential</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.070" end="00:06:59.460" style="s2">workers who are done</p>

<p begin="00:06:59.460" end="00:07:03.870" style="s2">because for everyone else to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.340" end="00:07:06.240" style="s2">be at home the utilities still have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.870" end="00:07:09.200" style="s2">be on and farmers still have to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.240" end="00:07:13.670" style="s2">agricultural work and grocery stores and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.200" end="00:07:16.830" style="s2">frontline workers and all like that so</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.670" end="00:07:18.570" style="s2">there will be an increase in the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.830" end="00:07:19.740" style="s2">of essential services that can start to</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.570" end="00:07:21.780" style="s2">turn on while still being able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.740" end="00:07:24.570" style="s2">protect more vulnerable populations as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.780" end="00:07:26.940" style="s2">first step so the most vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.570" end="00:07:28.980" style="s2">populations call it in nursing homes and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.940" end="00:07:29.640" style="s2">elderly care facilities and places where</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.980" end="00:07:32.460" style="s2">there are people who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.640" end="00:07:34.260" style="s2">immunocompromised and those places</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.460" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">should stay on stricter protocols for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.260" end="00:07:38.610" style="s2">longer period of time and there are some</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:41.400" style="s2">people who have been calling anyways for</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.610" end="00:07:43.170" style="s2">let everybody who is younger and healthy</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.400" end="00:07:47.490" style="s2">not be on quarantine at all and just</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.170" end="00:07:50.100" style="s2">protect the vulnerable populations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.490" end="00:07:52.050" style="s2">not a good idea to do that I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.100" end="00:07:53.400" style="s2">suggest it&#39;s a good idea fifty percent</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.050" end="00:07:56.310" style="s2">of the people in Italy who are on</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.400" end="00:07:59.130" style="s2">ventilators were under 60 and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.310" end="00:08:00.780" style="s2">people get very serious cases definitely</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.130" end="00:08:03.450" style="s2">people die who are young and healthy</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.780" end="00:08:05.250" style="s2">people but even the people who don&#39;t die</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.450" end="00:08:08.850" style="s2">because a lot of the people who get</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.250" end="00:08:10.320" style="s2">severe illness right now who are younger</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.850" end="00:08:13.650" style="s2">don&#39;t die but that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.320" end="00:08:16.470" style="s2">there isn&#39;t lasting damage for them so</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.650" end="00:08:18.060" style="s2">there are signs of many of the people</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.470" end="00:08:21.380" style="s2">who got to severe illness who are coming</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.060" end="00:08:24.170" style="s2">out who have fibrosis in the lungs</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.380" end="00:08:28.620" style="s2">cardiomyopathy damage renal damage to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.170" end="00:08:31.590" style="s2">you know kidneys and so we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.620" end="00:08:32.900" style="s2">only be thinking about did they die or</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.590" end="00:08:36.060" style="s2">not we should also be thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.900" end="00:08:39.000" style="s2">obviously not just how bad two months</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.060" end="00:08:40.090" style="s2">was that for them in the hospital bills</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.000" end="00:08:42.190" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.090" end="00:08:43.840" style="s2">overwhelming I see use and all like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.190" end="00:08:46.990" style="s2">that&#39;s associated but also the lifelong</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.840" end="00:08:50.500" style="s2">consequences that can be had from</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.990" end="00:08:51.790" style="s2">getting into advanced age also it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.500" end="00:08:53.530" style="s2">harder to protect the vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.790" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">populations when much higher numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.530" end="00:09:02.350" style="s2">people have it because there is cross</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:09:03.910" style="s2">contamination so the first strategic</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.350" end="00:09:06.040" style="s2">objective and we talked about it last</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.910" end="00:09:08.050" style="s2">time was make sure that the total number</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.040" end="00:09:10.210" style="s2">of cases doesn&#39;t exceed the capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.050" end="00:09:11.860" style="s2">the ICUs in the various cities we saw</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.210" end="00:09:13.990" style="s2">what happened in Italy when the ICU</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.860" end="00:09:15.310" style="s2">capacity was exceeded and there weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.990" end="00:09:16.810" style="s2">enough ventilators and there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.310" end="00:09:19.120" style="s2">enough treatment options for people and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.810" end="00:09:22.060" style="s2">case fatality rate jumps very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.120" end="00:09:24.340" style="s2">sharply we still could have a situation</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.060" end="00:09:26.500" style="s2">where we mismanaged this and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.340" end="00:09:29.110" style="s2">happens but for the most part we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.500" end="00:09:31.750" style="s2">right at ICU capacity in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.110" end="00:09:34.540" style="s2">worst hit areas like New York and New</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.750" end="00:09:37.960" style="s2">Jersey but we haven&#39;t been in having to</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.540" end="00:09:45.430" style="s2">decide if we have ventilators or ICU</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.960" end="00:09:47.950" style="s2">beds as much so we do need to keep this</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.430" end="00:09:49.570" style="s2">situation of making sure that the total</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.950" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">number of cases is within the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.570" end="00:09:54.490" style="s2">of the icy use and also factoring the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:56.230" style="s2">fatigue of the frontline workers which</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.490" end="00:09:58.150" style="s2">is a really significant thing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.230" end="00:10:01.060" style="s2">probably everybody has watched plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.150" end="00:10:03.670" style="s2">videos of nurses and doctors now who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.060" end="00:10:06.210" style="s2">in some of the more intense fire zone</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.670" end="00:10:09.910" style="s2">areas talking about their experience but</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.210" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">yeah New York has something like 80% of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.910" end="00:10:13.810" style="s2">the people who get put on ventilators</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:16.390" style="s2">come off dead and we can talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.810" end="00:10:17.560" style="s2">because it I think there are treatment</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.390" end="00:10:23.260" style="s2">approaches that are much better than</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.560" end="00:10:25.570" style="s2">ventilators that should be explored but</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.260" end="00:10:27.220" style="s2">you can just imagine if you were nurse</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.570" end="00:10:28.630" style="s2">working in a place and doing all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.220" end="00:10:30.430" style="s2">work to ventilate someone in hope and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.630" end="00:10:32.140" style="s2">taking 80% of the people that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.430" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">putting on and caring for off dead and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.140" end="00:10:37.510" style="s2">just what that&#39;s like there&#39;s only so</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:40.420" style="s2">long that those people can do that also</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.510" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">as they have increased disease exposure</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.420" end="00:10:46.240" style="s2">themselves so when we think about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.320" end="00:10:47.430" style="s2">things that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:50.339" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.430" end="00:10:53.910" style="s2">that are relevant to mitigate the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.339" end="00:10:56.100" style="s2">disease let&#39;s think about the first part</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.910" end="00:10:58.680" style="s2">being how do we decrease the total</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.100" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">number of infections the second part</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.680" end="00:11:02.220" style="s2">being how do we decrease the percentage</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:04.020" style="s2">of the infections that become severe in</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.220" end="00:11:05.640" style="s2">the third part being how do we make sure</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.020" end="00:11:07.589" style="s2">that there is enough treatment and ICU</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.640" end="00:11:09.890" style="s2">capacity that wherever there are severe</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.589" end="00:11:12.480" style="s2">infections are able to be well treated</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.890" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">this last step is how is getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.480" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">increased PPE to the hospital&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">increased drugs and diagnostic tests and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.200" end="00:11:22.860" style="s2">things that have been rate limited to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:24.570" style="s2">some degree ventilators ICU beds</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.860" end="00:11:26.209" style="s2">whatever and so there&#39;s a lot of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.570" end="00:11:29.010" style="s2">logistics supply chain that has been</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.209" end="00:11:31.890" style="s2">both super inspiring and the goodness of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.010" end="00:11:33.810" style="s2">people&#39;s work and super disheartening in</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.890" end="00:11:36.089" style="s2">the poor Ness of the logistics</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.810" end="00:11:38.810" style="s2">especially you know federally sponsored</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.089" end="00:11:42.330" style="s2">supported logistics to get those things</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.810" end="00:11:44.040" style="s2">but that&#39;s coming along most of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.330" end="00:11:46.470" style="s2">focus is on the non-pharmaceutical</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.040" end="00:11:48.510" style="s2">interventions that can happen to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.470" end="00:11:52.050" style="s2">keep the transmission rate or the are</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.510" end="00:11:55.950" style="s2">not rates down and so I&#39;ll speak about</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.050" end="00:11:58.860" style="s2">that a little bit when the cases in an</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.950" end="00:12:04.890" style="s2">area are low enough to start releasing</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.860" end="00:12:07.830" style="s2">the shelter-in-place provisions one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.890" end="00:12:10.529" style="s2">the most important things is that when</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.830" end="00:12:12.750" style="s2">people are going back to work and daily</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.529" end="00:12:14.760" style="s2">activity that they continue social</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.750" end="00:12:17.730" style="s2">distancing for some period of time as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.760" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">general practice and specifically the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.730" end="00:12:23.240" style="s2">wearing of masks this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:27.480" style="s2">the Czech Republic got really exemplary</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.240" end="00:12:30.120" style="s2">and has had a very low CFR and a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.480" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">good overall curve that they attribute</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.120" end="00:12:37.740" style="s2">very much to the mask policy just to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:39.270" style="s2">clarify because there are still some</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.740" end="00:12:41.190" style="s2">people who have confusion about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.270" end="00:12:43.290" style="s2">effectiveness of wearing masks and some</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.190" end="00:12:45.240" style="s2">of the major health organizations put</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.290" end="00:12:48.110" style="s2">out information that&#39;s conflicting to</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.240" end="00:12:50.970" style="s2">what we know now early in the process</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.110" end="00:12:52.589" style="s2">the main reason to wear masks is not to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.970" end="00:12:55.380" style="s2">prevent you from getting the illness but</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.589" end="00:12:56.820" style="s2">to prevent you from spreading it and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.380" end="00:12:58.260" style="s2">main thing that keeps you from getting</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.820" end="00:13:00.300" style="s2">in as other people wearing the mask so</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.260" end="00:13:00.610" style="s2">that was the thing the Czech Republic</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.300" end="00:13:02.260" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.610" end="00:13:04.540" style="s2">this commercial in this whole kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.260" end="00:13:06.820" style="s2">memetic campaign of I protect you you</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.540" end="00:13:10.180" style="s2">protect me which is really nice kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.820" end="00:13:11.800" style="s2">campaign and that&#39;s because even if I</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.180" end="00:13:14.589" style="s2">have a crappy mask I&#39;ve got just a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.800" end="00:13:17.079" style="s2">t-shirt right if I sneeze that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.589" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">gonna block most of the droplets and</p>

<p begin="00:13:20.980" end="00:13:24.660" style="s2">the air getting on surfaces if I call if</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.750" end="00:13:27.640" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna stop them from doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.660" end="00:13:30.070" style="s2">so the main purpose of the mask wearing</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.640" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">is actually to keep the viral load in</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.070" end="00:13:34.149" style="s2">the air and on the surfaces very low so</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:36.760" style="s2">the space is safe for other people in</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.149" end="00:13:41.459" style="s2">surfaces space say for other people in</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.760" end="00:13:45.579" style="s2">the space now it is also true that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.459" end="00:13:48.160" style="s2">wearing PPE protects the wearer not</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.579" end="00:13:49.899" style="s2">perfectly if you want perfect protection</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:51.579" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to get in an Ebola suit and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.899" end="00:13:53.829" style="s2">in a bola suit used properly is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.579" end="00:13:56.740" style="s2">close to perfect protection and you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.829" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">think about like then you know a full</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.740" end="00:14:00.100" style="s2">face shield and personally powered</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:01.720" style="s2">respirator is not quite as good as in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.100" end="00:14:03.490" style="s2">bowl of soup but it&#39;s pretty pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.720" end="00:14:08.860" style="s2">and then even just a face shield and</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.490" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">gown and whatever is pretty good but we</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.860" end="00:14:13.209" style="s2">don&#39;t have exact stats on this because</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:14.709" style="s2">it&#39;s not really an ethical study to try</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.209" end="00:14:16.360" style="s2">and expose people with different types</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.709" end="00:14:19.540" style="s2">of masks to different levels of viral</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.360" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">load and see how much they get sick but</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.540" end="00:14:22.980" style="s2">the estimate is something in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.279" end="00:14:25.690" style="s2">vicinity of if someone&#39;s wearing an n95</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.980" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">they&#39;re about five times less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.690" end="00:14:30.190" style="s2">get sick from the same exposure as</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:31.779" style="s2">someone who&#39;s not wearing a mask that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.190" end="00:14:33.449" style="s2">pretty significant right a fifth of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.779" end="00:14:36.100" style="s2">likelihood is pretty significant and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.449" end="00:14:37.420" style="s2">even a surgical mass is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.100" end="00:14:40.089" style="s2">what an n95 is but it&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.420" end="00:14:42.370" style="s2">significant reduction especially if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.089" end="00:14:44.140" style="s2">know how to use it properly so going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.370" end="00:14:47.140" style="s2">YouTube and looking at how to use PPE</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.140" end="00:14:49.540" style="s2">videos is important because if a masks</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.140" end="00:14:51.910" style="s2">effective what it means effective for</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.540" end="00:14:54.820" style="s2">protecting you is that the outside of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.910" end="00:14:56.470" style="s2">might have viral particles on it so if</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.820" end="00:14:58.180" style="s2">you come inside and then touch it with</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.470" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">the outside the outside of it with your</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:03.730" style="s2">obviously you kind of violated the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.690" end="00:15:08.199" style="s2">process so there&#39;s a whole process for</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.730" end="00:15:11.470" style="s2">just understanding how to how to utilize</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.199" end="00:15:13.180" style="s2">gloves and masks and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.470" end="00:15:14.640" style="s2">how to sterilize the packages when they</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.180" end="00:15:18.930" style="s2">come to your house or when you bring</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.640" end="00:15:21.900" style="s2">food and groceries home all of that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.930" end="00:15:24.630" style="s2">called can be called aseptic method</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.900" end="00:15:26.250" style="s2">right or basically just kind of advanced</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.630" end="00:15:28.980" style="s2">hygiene everybody&#39;s giving some lessons</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.250" end="00:15:31.410" style="s2">in advanced hygiene right now somebody</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.980" end="00:15:32.910" style="s2">on one of the projects were working on</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.410" end="00:15:34.410" style="s2">just wrote up a good article on aseptic</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.910" end="00:15:35.850" style="s2">method and I can send it to you so you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.410" end="00:15:40.640" style="s2">can link it in here so anybody who wants</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.850" end="00:15:40.640" style="s2">to study it will have that as a resource</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.680" end="00:15:49.350" style="s2">and this is going to be a huge part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:54.210" style="s2">it is the mask wearing and the actual</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.350" end="00:15:56.250" style="s2">hygiene and aseptic practices which will</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.210" end="00:15:58.350" style="s2">keep viral load down tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.250" end="00:16:00.270" style="s2">relative and viral transmission down</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.350" end="00:16:01.830" style="s2">tremendously we should also have</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.270" end="00:16:03.510" style="s2">something of course that like wind</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.830" end="00:16:05.340" style="s2">stores start opening up besides</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.510" end="00:16:08.400" style="s2">requiring people to have masks to come</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.340" end="00:16:10.890" style="s2">in that hand sanitizers out front of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.400" end="00:16:13.710" style="s2">every place out front of banks out front</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.890" end="00:16:17.450" style="s2">of supermarkets etc and that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.710" end="00:16:19.890" style="s2">part of culture for some period of time</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.450" end="00:16:20.760" style="s2">because even if someone has a mask they</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.890" end="00:16:22.230" style="s2">might have been under the mask</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.760" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">scratching and then they&#39;re going in</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.230" end="00:16:27.870" style="s2">touching surfaces in the store so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:29.790" style="s2">the consciousness around that part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.870" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">aseptic technique is don&#39;t do that but</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.790" end="00:16:39.570" style="s2">also the sanitizer in addition to these</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:41.580" style="s2">things one of the areas that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.570" end="00:16:44.400" style="s2">going to be hugely important and as</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.580" end="00:16:46.590" style="s2">least well talked about is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.400" end="00:16:49.530" style="s2">industrial hygiene or the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.590" end="00:16:51.780" style="s2">technologies and this is how can we</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.530" end="00:16:55.080" style="s2">actually employ technologies and spaces</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.780" end="00:16:57.780" style="s2">that take virus out of the air and kill</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.080" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">it on surfaces or binded on surfaces so</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.780" end="00:17:02.070" style="s2">that even if there was the same amount</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:03.930" style="s2">of transmission going into the space</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.070" end="00:17:05.339" style="s2">there&#39;s less transmissibility happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.930" end="00:17:08.900" style="s2">in the space as a result of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.339" end="00:17:11.310" style="s2">technologies happening in the space so</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.900" end="00:17:13.770" style="s2">this is not stuff that we don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.310" end="00:17:15.480" style="s2">to do when you look at how a cleanroom</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.770" end="00:17:17.040" style="s2">works where you&#39;re experimenting with</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.480" end="00:17:19.800" style="s2">microbes you have to make sure that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.040" end="00:17:23.339" style="s2">say say a bioweapons laboratory for</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.800" end="00:17:25.140" style="s2">instance how to sterilize the space is</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.339" end="00:17:26.880" style="s2">something that is pretty well known and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.140" end="00:17:28.169" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of off-the-shelf kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:29.489" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.169" end="00:17:31.080" style="s2">and there are some things that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.489" end="00:17:32.340" style="s2">really cheap and easy some things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.080" end="00:17:35.399" style="s2">are a little bit more advanced but</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.340" end="00:17:37.109" style="s2">really cheap and easy is like when the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.399" end="00:17:38.369" style="s2">doctors wear a face shield the face</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.109" end="00:17:40.230" style="s2">shield makes a difference right because</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.369" end="00:17:44.279" style="s2">we&#39;re there&#39;s viral shedding in people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.230" end="00:17:46.980" style="s2">exhale and so the face shield just has a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.279" end="00:17:47.309" style="s2">literal physical barrier beyond just a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.980" end="00:17:49.070" style="s2">mask</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.309" end="00:17:52.409" style="s2">keeping it off their face off their eyes</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.070" end="00:17:53.879" style="s2">makes a difference so right now in</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.409" end="00:17:55.320" style="s2">grocery stores where people are still</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.879" end="00:17:58.230" style="s2">going to grocery stores in the grocery</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.320" end="00:18:00.379" style="s2">store workers have exposure to more</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.230" end="00:18:02.129" style="s2">people than almost anyone has right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.379" end="00:18:05.070" style="s2">there should just be a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.129" end="00:18:06.899" style="s2">plexiglass between the grocery store</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.070" end="00:18:08.279" style="s2">worker between the person at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.899" end="00:18:09.570" style="s2">checkout and everybody who&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.279" end="00:18:11.909" style="s2">through just like there is a bank</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.570" end="00:18:13.679" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s a really cheap easy</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.909" end="00:18:16.169" style="s2">solution that can be put in all those</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:18.179" style="s2">places with a few screws and in addition</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.169" end="00:18:20.419" style="s2">to the PPE on both sides you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.179" end="00:18:22.649" style="s2">sterilize that a number of times a day</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.419" end="00:18:24.659" style="s2">will decrease transmission pretty</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.649" end="00:18:26.159" style="s2">significantly so there&#39;s a lot of kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.659" end="00:18:29.700" style="s2">of pieces of environmental tech like</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.159" end="00:18:33.090" style="s2">that most people probably saw the videos</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.700" end="00:18:34.919" style="s2">of when Wuhan was on lockdown the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.090" end="00:18:36.809" style="s2">massive disinfectant spraying in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.919" end="00:18:38.549" style="s2">streets drones were spraying and these</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.809" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">huge trucks were spraying and like they</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.549" end="00:18:43.649" style="s2">were taking they were taking sanitizing</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:45.570" style="s2">the environment very seriously right we</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.649" end="00:18:47.009" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen a similar level of effort</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.570" end="00:18:48.779" style="s2">like that happen anywhere else but we</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.009" end="00:18:50.639" style="s2">also didn&#39;t see a curve come down as</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.779" end="00:18:53.369" style="s2">intensely anywhere else no that was for</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.639" end="00:18:55.409" style="s2">a number of reasons they they had a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.369" end="00:18:57.809" style="s2">big explosion at being at the epicenter</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.409" end="00:19:02.759" style="s2">of it but then they did very intensive</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.809" end="00:19:04.109" style="s2">methods to address it one research</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.759" end="00:19:07.730" style="s2">project that we brought together is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.109" end="00:19:09.989" style="s2">group of people who have background in</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.730" end="00:19:12.389" style="s2">chemical and physical engineering these</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.989" end="00:19:14.159" style="s2">types of topics who are looking in all</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.389" end="00:19:16.019" style="s2">the different air filtration methods so</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.159" end="00:19:17.369" style="s2">HEPA filters and Peko filters and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.019" end="00:19:20.609" style="s2">ionization and those types of things</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.369" end="00:19:22.379" style="s2">that can actually take the virus out of</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.609" end="00:19:27.419" style="s2">the air either break it down or bind it</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.379" end="00:19:30.210" style="s2">or both and then things like UV lights</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.419" end="00:19:32.220" style="s2">there are specific frequencies of even</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.210" end="00:19:37.139" style="s2">visible light that look effective in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.220" end="00:19:39.269" style="s2">blue range and microwave and acoustics</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.139" end="00:19:40.790" style="s2">that all kill the virus some of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.269" end="00:19:42.380" style="s2">are safe to do when you</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.790" end="00:19:44.390" style="s2">in the room some aren&#39;t they&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.380" end="00:19:46.010" style="s2">be done sanitizing in between there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.390" end="00:19:49.850" style="s2">obviously basic stuff like being able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.010" end="00:19:52.520" style="s2">sanitize and reuse PPE then sanitizing</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.850" end="00:19:54.770" style="s2">medical environments but also just lots</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.520" end="00:19:55.940" style="s2">of other environments like all of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.770" end="00:19:58.910" style="s2">fruits and vegetables that are being</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.940" end="00:20:01.070" style="s2">handled by all the workers what can we</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.910" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">do not just when someone brings at home</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.070" end="00:20:04.730" style="s2">to be able to clean them properly but</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:06.680" style="s2">what can we put in the grocery stores to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.730" end="00:20:10.310" style="s2">be able to decrease the transmission in</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.680" end="00:20:14.090" style="s2">grocery stores so for instance ozone gas</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.310" end="00:20:15.410" style="s2">happens to be very virus idle dissipates</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.090" end="00:20:18.710" style="s2">quite quickly so when the store closes</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.410" end="00:20:20.510" style="s2">at night could have those own gas going</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.710" end="00:20:22.100" style="s2">over the produce section or over other</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.510" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">areas there&#39;s other gases there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.100" end="00:20:26.210" style="s2">things that can be nebulized nebulized</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:27.890" style="s2">hydrogen peroxide so we&#39;re looking into</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.210" end="00:20:31.310" style="s2">these and types of environmental</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.890" end="00:20:33.470" style="s2">solutions there&#39;s also in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.310" end="00:20:35.660" style="s2">like surface disinfectants there are a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.470" end="00:20:38.030" style="s2">few companies claiming to have surface</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.660" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">treatments that can not just disinfect</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.030" end="00:20:42.430" style="s2">but be able to actually bind viruses on</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.640" end="00:20:45.050" style="s2">the surface for some period of time and</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.430" end="00:20:46.640" style="s2">we haven&#39;t been able to verify those</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.050" end="00:20:49.550" style="s2">claims yet we&#39;re in the process but</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.640" end="00:20:51.920" style="s2">that&#39;d be pretty awesome huge difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.550" end="00:20:54.800" style="s2">so the first place we really want to see</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.920" end="00:20:56.600" style="s2">these right away and working on getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.800" end="00:20:59.870" style="s2">a proposal together in the next week for</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.600" end="00:21:01.220" style="s2">it is obviously hospitals and I see use</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.870" end="00:21:02.600" style="s2">because it&#39;s the place where are not as</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.220" end="00:21:04.630" style="s2">the highest right now it&#39;s a place where</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.600" end="00:21:07.070" style="s2">there&#39;s the most total transmission</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.630" end="00:21:08.810" style="s2">because it&#39;s where you have the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.070" end="00:21:10.490" style="s2">sick people with the most severe</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.810" end="00:21:12.890" style="s2">sickness most severe sickness means</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.490" end="00:21:16.670" style="s2">coughing the most and the highest level</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.890" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">of viral load I can&#39;t give any</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.670" end="00:21:22.300" style="s2">quantitative numbers because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:22.300" style="s2">believe they exist yet but it does seem</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.380" end="00:21:28.850" style="s2">most likely that the total level of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.930" end="00:21:30.590" style="s2">viral load of exposure makes a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.850" end="00:21:32.660" style="s2">difference to how likely someone is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.590" end="00:21:34.970" style="s2">get sick at all and the severity of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.660" end="00:21:36.980" style="s2">sickness and so it&#39;s not simply are you</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.970" end="00:21:39.560" style="s2">exposed to virus but are you exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.980" end="00:21:41.030" style="s2">a million viral particles or a few viral</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.560" end="00:21:42.770" style="s2">particles going to be very different</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.030" end="00:21:46.340" style="s2">terms the immune systems capacity to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.770" end="00:21:48.020" style="s2">able to respond to it and so these types</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.340" end="00:21:50.390" style="s2">of technologies could take down the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.020" end="00:21:52.100" style="s2">viral load in the environments enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.390" end="00:21:54.560" style="s2">especially in the environments where</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.100" end="00:21:57.140" style="s2">people can&#39;t stop interacting</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.560" end="00:21:58.790" style="s2">that any that a lot of people just</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.140" end="00:22:00.860" style="s2">aren&#39;t exposed at all and any exposures</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.790" end="00:22:03.170" style="s2">are very low viral load exposures which</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.860" end="00:22:05.570" style="s2">means and which might actually even in</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.170" end="00:22:08.330" style="s2">that meaning that people produce an</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.570" end="00:22:11.230" style="s2">antibody response without getting severe</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.330" end="00:22:17.570" style="s2">illness premature to know for sure but</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.230" end="00:22:20.060" style="s2">things that being explored so in</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.570" end="00:22:23.060" style="s2">addition to inside of hospitals and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.060" end="00:22:29.390" style="s2">see use for the environmental tech and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.060" end="00:22:31.400" style="s2">in grocery stores prisons and police</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.390" end="00:22:33.500" style="s2">stations and fire departments and all of</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.220" end="00:22:49.130" style="s2">things we want to really look at</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.010" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">videos get pretty wild so I say a term</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.600" end="00:23:28.120" style="s2">like social engineering and then pretty</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:28.120" style="s2">soon I&#39;m an Illuminati member but</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.810" end="00:23:36.850" style="s2">so there&#39;s the environmental tech that</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.260" end="00:23:42.220" style="s2">can make spaces safer and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.850" end="00:23:44.350" style="s2">the social tech which is like @ic use</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.410" end="00:23:53.620" style="s2">really needs to shift that there has to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.380" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">be the ability to triage in the parking</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.620" end="00:23:57.430" style="s2">lot if people are Kovac patients are not</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:23:59.200" style="s2">coded patients and then a co-ed facility</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.430" end="00:24:01.870" style="s2">and a not coded facility they&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.780" end="00:24:12.220" style="s2">been the case throughout most of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.850" end="00:24:15.400" style="s2">places in the US which means that</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.220" end="00:24:16.870" style="s2">someone can go in and be more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.400" end="00:24:19.750" style="s2">get kovat at the hospital than almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.870" end="00:24:24.220" style="s2">anywhere else and let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.750" end="00:24:26.410" style="s2">some other health issues going in for so</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.220" end="00:24:30.640" style="s2">you already are you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.410" end="00:24:32.560" style="s2">situation of comorbidity then that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.640" end="00:24:35.740" style="s2">situation where you most don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.560" end="00:24:40.330" style="s2">get infections so we want to have things</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.740" end="00:24:42.520" style="s2">like masks everyone should have a mass</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.330" end="00:24:44.230" style="s2">before they leave their home but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.520" end="00:24:46.420" style="s2">say somebody messes up there&#39;s extra</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.230" end="00:24:47.890" style="s2">masks out front at the hospital or</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.420" end="00:24:49.900" style="s2">emergency room or ICU they have to put</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.890" end="00:24:53.380" style="s2">on before they go inside keep the space</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.900" end="00:24:57.340" style="s2">down if when people are signing in</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.380" end="00:24:59.110" style="s2">they&#39;re touching something then all that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.340" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">needs to be sterilized between times</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.110" end="00:25:03.580" style="s2">that people are engaging with it</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:05.620" style="s2">separating the kovat and the non kovat</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.580" end="00:25:07.660" style="s2">people super critical so those are</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.620" end="00:25:09.250" style="s2">basically kind of logistical things and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.660" end="00:25:11.500" style="s2">then there&#39;s the environmental tech in</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.250" end="00:25:14.380" style="s2">those spaces and the combo of being able</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.500" end="00:25:16.240" style="s2">to deploy things like the right kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.380" end="00:25:19.090" style="s2">UV light to sterilize equipment in</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:21.400" style="s2">sterilized rooms the right kind of combo</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.090" end="00:25:22.810" style="s2">filtration method so like something like</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.400" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">a Pecha filtration that can break the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.810" end="00:25:26.860" style="s2">viruses down with something like a HEPA</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:29.730" style="s2">that combined them with the right kinds</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.860" end="00:25:32.500" style="s2">of disinfectants and surface treatments</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.730" end="00:25:34.420" style="s2">really could make the spaces radically</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.500" end="00:25:36.880" style="s2">safer and now then when we start to open</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.420" end="00:25:39.730" style="s2">back up widely and think about think</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.880" end="00:25:41.680" style="s2">about like train stations and airports</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.730" end="00:25:44.470" style="s2">and the places with very very high</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.680" end="00:25:46.870" style="s2">contact are the things that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.470" end="00:25:51.250" style="s2">you think about like a TSA person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.870" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">sick touching everybody&#39;s passports and</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.250" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">whatever like the total amount of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:56.049" style="s2">infectious transmission that could</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:57.460" style="s2">happen there is huge and if anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.049" end="00:25:58.659" style="s2">was sick and giving them the thing they</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.460" end="00:26:00.880" style="s2">they could get it right</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.659" end="00:26:02.620" style="s2">a symptomatically so the little thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:05.020" style="s2">that they scan under then it scans the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.620" end="00:26:07.210" style="s2">barcode could we add UV to it they also</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.210" end="00:26:11.520" style="s2">environmental tech that could make a</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.710" end="00:26:13.630" style="s2">pretty significant difference</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.520" end="00:26:16.179" style="s2">the other big thing obviously is</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.630" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">Diagnostics and contact tracing and this</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.179" end="00:26:24.220" style="s2">is widely talked about the types of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:28.780" style="s2">Diagnostics matter and we see now the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.220" end="00:26:31.270" style="s2">whole thing about like a hundred plus</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.780" end="00:26:35.890" style="s2">cases in South Korea that tested clear</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.270" end="00:26:37.929" style="s2">that our testing tested having had</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.890" end="00:26:39.730" style="s2">corona virus that they no longer had it</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.929" end="00:26:42.490" style="s2">and have it again kovat nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.730" end="00:26:44.919" style="s2">specifically and we&#39;re seeing that in</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.490" end="00:26:46.750" style="s2">other countries there is this massive</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.919" end="00:26:48.309" style="s2">question of whether or not immunity is</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.750" end="00:26:49.450" style="s2">conferred and the nature of how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.309" end="00:26:52.390" style="s2">conferred and how long it will be</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.450" end="00:26:55.659" style="s2">convert for and across what set of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.390" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">mutations this is a super important</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.659" end="00:26:58.690" style="s2">question I&#39;ll I&#39;ll get back to why in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:04.630" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.690" end="00:27:06.760" style="s2">but what is it it is it that they really</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.630" end="00:27:09.490" style="s2">got better or was it the wrong kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.760" end="00:27:13.240" style="s2">test is a very important question</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.490" end="00:27:14.620" style="s2">because it&#39;s not like all the tests are</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.240" end="00:27:15.280" style="s2">the same the tests are testing very</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.620" end="00:27:22.059" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.280" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">so the antibody tests there are some</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.059" end="00:27:28.110" style="s2">people it appears maybe almost up to</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:31.720" style="s2">thirty percent of the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.110" end="00:27:33.280" style="s2">when using molecular methods using PCR</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.720" end="00:27:36.490" style="s2">methods where we know that they have</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.280" end="00:27:38.470" style="s2">this virus aren&#39;t producing meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.490" end="00:27:39.850" style="s2">antibodies there&#39;s a big question of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.470" end="00:27:41.770" style="s2">like what&#39;s going on with that then</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.850" end="00:27:43.780" style="s2">there are some people who have</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.770" end="00:27:46.030" style="s2">antibodies where it&#39;s not clear that</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.780" end="00:27:47.260" style="s2">they actually ever had kovat 19 so</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.030" end="00:27:48.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a question of did they have one</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.260" end="00:27:50.919" style="s2">of the four other corona viruses that</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.970" end="00:27:52.990" style="s2">cause normal colds and that those</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.919" end="00:27:56.470" style="s2">antibodies are actually protective</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.990" end="00:27:58.029" style="s2">against this or in some cases so what is</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.470" end="00:28:01.299" style="s2">an antibody test mean verse</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.029" end="00:28:03.999" style="s2">what what are the actual PCR tests mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.299" end="00:28:06.779" style="s2">and if we&#39;re doing PCR on what fluids so</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.999" end="00:28:09.549" style="s2">there&#39;s a big thing around being able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.779" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">when someone has been sick when do they</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.549" end="00:28:12.190" style="s2">get to come off quarantine well they</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">should come off quarantine when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.190" end="00:28:15.849" style="s2">no more viral shedding right when</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">they&#39;re exhale doesn&#39;t have viruses</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.849" end="00:28:20.679" style="s2">anymore and their feces doesn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:22.749" style="s2">viruses and so rather than just a period</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.679" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">of time or lack of symptom ology it</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.749" end="00:28:27.549" style="s2">should be testing based but that</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:29.710" style="s2">requires the right types of tests more</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.549" end="00:28:32.799" style="s2">importantly is early on in the process</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.710" end="00:28:34.719" style="s2">we want to be able to test and if</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.799" end="00:28:36.820" style="s2">someone has been exposed we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.719" end="00:28:39.429" style="s2">able to know as close to when they got</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.820" end="00:28:40.869" style="s2">exposed as possible not days later if</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.429" end="00:28:43.719" style="s2">we&#39;re testing for antibodies it takes</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.869" end="00:28:45.489" style="s2">many days for it to go from landing on</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.719" end="00:28:46.869" style="s2">the mouth or landing in the nose to go</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.489" end="00:28:48.809" style="s2">through the mucosal immune system into</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.869" end="00:28:53.169" style="s2">the blood producing antibody response</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.809" end="00:28:55.029" style="s2">and depending upon the sensitivity of</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.169" end="00:28:58.269" style="s2">the PCR technique even if we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.029" end="00:29:00.009" style="s2">nasal swabs if there&#39;s a small number of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.269" end="00:29:01.509" style="s2">viral particles will it be able to catch</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.009" end="00:29:04.119" style="s2">it or does it have to wait for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.509" end="00:29:07.719" style="s2">viral replication because if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.119" end="00:29:09.249" style="s2">rolling out tests but someone has to</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.719" end="00:29:11.259" style="s2">have been exposed to three days before</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.249" end="00:29:13.419" style="s2">which means people are showing up clear</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.259" end="00:29:14.919" style="s2">but they&#39;re not just because of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.419" end="00:29:17.559" style="s2">earliness of false negatives that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.919" end="00:29:22.419" style="s2">very effective so the kinds of tests</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.559" end="00:29:25.119" style="s2">that can be very high sensitivity can</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.419" end="00:29:26.889" style="s2">pick up small total viral count ideally</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.119" end="00:29:32.109" style="s2">be quantitative very fast turnaround</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.889" end="00:29:34.929" style="s2">times super-important so we we&#39;ve looked</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.109" end="00:29:36.249" style="s2">at the different types of tests and</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.929" end="00:29:38.440" style="s2">companies that are out there to be able</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.249" end="00:29:43.119" style="s2">to help with a suite of things that can</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.440" end="00:29:46.299" style="s2">meet the kind of national objectives and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.119" end="00:29:48.460" style="s2">beyond national there happens to be one</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.299" end="00:29:49.989" style="s2">technology that&#39;s really asymmetrically</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.460" end="00:29:53.109" style="s2">further ahead and the rest of them that</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.989" end="00:29:56.649" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to help quite a lot that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.109" end="00:29:59.619" style="s2">think is going to be a major part of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.649" end="00:30:01.089" style="s2">infrastructure for how to do pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.619" end="00:30:04.389" style="s2">preparedness in the future where we were</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.089" end="00:30:06.009" style="s2">able to identify and go into smart</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.389" end="00:30:08.200" style="s2">quarantine immediately and never have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.009" end="00:30:08.920" style="s2">go into totalize quarantine and all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.200" end="00:30:13.360" style="s2">damage</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.920" end="00:30:14.650" style="s2">that causes contact tracing maybe of all</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.360" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">the things I&#39;d like the rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.650" end="00:30:22.860" style="s2">people to know about and pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:25.750" style="s2">to would be contact tracing in order to</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.860" end="00:30:27.340" style="s2">have the testing be effective you either</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.750" end="00:30:30.700" style="s2">have to test everybody all the time</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.340" end="00:30:32.890" style="s2">right like test very big percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.700" end="00:30:34.930" style="s2">the total population and then if I test</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.890" end="00:30:36.400" style="s2">you today and you&#39;re negative that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.930" end="00:30:39.940" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean anything about do you go</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.400" end="00:30:41.980" style="s2">and get exposed tomorrow so you either</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.940" end="00:30:44.620" style="s2">need a pretty hype penetration on</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.980" end="00:30:47.230" style="s2">testing or you need some smart process</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.620" end="00:30:48.520" style="s2">to know who to test so that less total</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.230" end="00:30:50.860" style="s2">test can still be affect them so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.520" end="00:30:54.790" style="s2">goal of contact tracing is if you get</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.860" end="00:30:57.220" style="s2">tested and it shows oh you are positive</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.790" end="00:30:59.650" style="s2">that we can identify the people that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.220" end="00:31:01.390" style="s2">came in contact with over the period of</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.650" end="00:31:03.730" style="s2">time since you were probably exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.390" end="00:31:07.330" style="s2">get tests to them since they have higher</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.730" end="00:31:10.300" style="s2">likelihood and so we wanting to trace</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.330" end="00:31:11.710" style="s2">the contacts you&#39;ve had this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.300" end="00:31:13.810" style="s2">something that I have been very</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.710" end="00:31:16.740" style="s2">concerned by because this has been</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.810" end="00:31:20.740" style="s2">enacted in a number of countries Asian</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.740" end="00:31:22.570" style="s2">countries first and it is absolutely a</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.740" end="00:31:24.520" style="s2">kind of surveillance apparatus that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.570" end="00:31:26.140" style="s2">don&#39;t want States or companies to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.520" end="00:31:27.610" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think anybody actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.140" end="00:31:30.250" style="s2">thinks it&#39;s a good idea if you really</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.610" end="00:31:32.140" style="s2">think about it we&#39;ve been dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.250" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">the surveillance capitalism problems</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.140" end="00:31:37.450" style="s2">that are already like so excessive that</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:40.930" style="s2">it&#39;s all it&#39;s very hard to see how we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.450" end="00:31:44.110" style="s2">ever pull them back and surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.930" end="00:31:51.720" style="s2">state types issues from FISA act on</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.110" end="00:31:55.150" style="s2">right even before that so how do we and</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.720" end="00:31:59.470" style="s2">this whole thing of when things are bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.150" end="00:32:01.240" style="s2">enough that people will agree to civil</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.470" end="00:32:03.400" style="s2">liberty damaging things because they</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.240" end="00:32:05.140" style="s2">need to the terrorism is dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.400" end="00:32:07.530" style="s2">enough so Patriot or Homeland Security</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.140" end="00:32:10.660" style="s2">Act this obviously a very like</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.530" end="00:32:13.210" style="s2">historical process to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.660" end="00:32:18.750" style="s2">increase top-down control and power is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.210" end="00:32:18.750" style="s2">have a situation that justifies that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.470" end="00:32:22.750" style="s2">Google and Apple just a couple days ago</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.120" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">led the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.750" end="00:32:27.070" style="s2">in well lots of groups were working on</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:28.510" style="s2">contact tracing in a way of being able</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.070" end="00:32:30.940" style="s2">to roll it out since the two of them</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.549" end="00:32:44.830" style="s2">is going to be really key we do not want</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:03.549" style="s2">captured that has that access so being</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.600" end="00:33:05.980" style="s2">able to do it in a decentralized</p>

<p begin="00:33:11.590" end="00:33:15.700" style="s2">important so there are methods where the</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.700" end="00:33:20.049" style="s2">phones directly Bluetooth mediated when</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.010" end="00:33:21.730" style="s2">they come within a Bluetooth proximity</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.049" end="00:33:24.340" style="s2">to each other and then it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.730" end="00:33:26.350" style="s2">unlocked if it finds out that you were</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.340" end="00:33:28.270" style="s2">sick and then there were random numbers</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.350" end="00:33:29.590" style="s2">that were generated between you and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.270" end="00:33:31.870" style="s2">people who came in contact with and</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.590" end="00:33:33.159" style="s2">it&#39;ll ping them hey you were came in</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.870" end="00:33:37.289" style="s2">contact for someone who said go get</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.159" end="00:33:40.780" style="s2">tested so making sure that the right</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.289" end="00:33:42.669" style="s2">privacy provisions are in place so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.780" end="00:33:46.020" style="s2">the solutions to this don&#39;t destroy</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.669" end="00:33:51.010" style="s2">civil liberties we can see that in I</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.020" end="00:33:53.710" style="s2">have a friend who works at a refugee</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.010" end="00:33:56.760" style="s2">camp in Uganda and this has happened in</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.710" end="00:33:58.809" style="s2">other areas but she was saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.760" end="00:34:00.190" style="s2">quarantine was put in place for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.809" end="00:34:01.480" style="s2">people to stay in the refugee camp but</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.190" end="00:34:03.549" style="s2">there&#39;s no food in the refugee camp they</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.480" end="00:34:05.799" style="s2">would have to walk to like a UN facility</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.549" end="00:34:07.150" style="s2">that or somewhere like that that has</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.799" end="00:34:09.250" style="s2">food and they&#39;re not allowed to walk</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.150" end="00:34:11.639" style="s2">there and so the people are dying of or</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.250" end="00:34:16.980" style="s2">at risk of dying of starvation</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.639" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">other than coronavirus and we can see</p>

<p begin="00:34:22.750" end="00:34:30.970" style="s2">in the Philippines and so this descent</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.710" end="00:34:34.149" style="s2">into increased authoritarianism at like</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.970" end="00:34:36.360" style="s2">is it a good idea to have some process</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.149" end="00:34:39.870" style="s2">where we ever do close down the borders</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.360" end="00:34:40.860" style="s2">during a epidemic or pandemic yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.870" end="00:34:43.020" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.860" end="00:34:44.820" style="s2">and where we do some emergency</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.020" end="00:34:48.030" style="s2">provisions like give doctors the ability</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.820" end="00:34:49.710" style="s2">to treat that discretion more fully</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.030" end="00:34:51.360" style="s2">regarding their malpractice and like</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.710" end="00:34:54.450" style="s2">that based on emerging data before we</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.360" end="00:34:59.430" style="s2">have randomized control trials yes but</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.450" end="00:35:02.460" style="s2">do we want to give provisions to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.430" end="00:35:04.170" style="s2">types of major power players the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.460" end="00:35:07.140" style="s2">players that have major asymmetric power</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.170" end="00:35:11.510" style="s2">that don&#39;t let asymmetric power go once</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.140" end="00:35:14.130" style="s2">they have it no so I think that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.510" end="00:35:17.820" style="s2">this is a place where I think people</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.130" end="00:35:19.800" style="s2">have been having a hard time is people</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.820" end="00:35:21.060" style="s2">who are very libertarian oriented and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.800" end="00:35:24.150" style="s2">concerned with civil liberties and</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.060" end="00:35:26.700" style="s2">things like that many of them not all</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.150" end="00:35:28.710" style="s2">but many of them have been oriented</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.700" end="00:35:30.210" style="s2">towards a narrative that the virus isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.710" end="00:35:32.190" style="s2">that bad and the whole thing is just a</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.210" end="00:35:34.140" style="s2">conspiracy to take away civil liberties</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.190" end="00:35:38.040" style="s2">and see these hospitals that don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.140" end="00:35:39.270" style="s2">any people in them there are hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.040" end="00:35:42.540" style="s2">that don&#39;t have any people in them</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.270" end="00:35:44.160" style="s2">because there are very bad logistics and</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.540" end="00:35:45.330" style="s2">routing issues in many of the cities and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.160" end="00:35:47.580" style="s2">states where there are overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.330" end="00:35:50.010" style="s2">hospitals with other hospitals that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.580" end="00:35:51.240" style="s2">don&#39;t have hardly anyone there and other</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.010" end="00:35:54.800" style="s2">hospitals that have been opened up to</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.240" end="00:35:57.090" style="s2">deal with this that weren&#39;t full yet and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.800" end="00:35:58.890" style="s2">then there are other people who say oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.090" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">well the virus is so bad we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.890" end="00:36:02.180" style="s2">whatever it takes and have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:04.800" style="s2">naive</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.180" end="00:36:07.380" style="s2">positivity towards authorities and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:11.670" style="s2">really consider the surveillance issues</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.380" end="00:36:14.100" style="s2">I would say both of those are off naive</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.670" end="00:36:18.360" style="s2">the virus has an issue so is asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.100" end="00:36:20.720" style="s2">power and both should be paid attention</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.360" end="00:36:20.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.520" end="00:36:28.440" style="s2">so we have to get we do need to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.340" end="00:36:31.490" style="s2">contact tracing and we do have to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.440" end="00:36:33.870" style="s2">wide Diagnostics as part of the recovery</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.490" end="00:36:35.670" style="s2">also with regard to ID Diagnostics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.870" end="00:36:37.710" style="s2">important that we do some random testing</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.670" end="00:36:39.420" style="s2">not just people who are possibly sick</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.710" end="00:36:41.070" style="s2">but random testing for the background</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.420" end="00:36:41.700" style="s2">epidemiology that helps us know how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.070" end="00:36:44.370" style="s2">solve this</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.700" end="00:36:46.970" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t like then there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.370" end="00:36:49.650" style="s2">question around wait does random mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.970" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">that people have tests forced on them</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.650" end="00:36:51.840" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:54.870" style="s2">the tests are we talking about doctors</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.840" end="00:36:57.150" style="s2">are we talking about police so any model</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.870" end="00:36:59.190" style="s2">where police could get to randomly stop</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.150" end="00:37:02.520" style="s2">people and forcibly medically test them</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.190" end="00:37:04.500" style="s2">fuck no that&#39;s a very bad idea but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.520" end="00:37:08.790" style="s2">medical doctors that are treating people</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.500" end="00:37:10.830" style="s2">for other stuff anyways ADCO vid tests</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.790" end="00:37:15.900" style="s2">to it yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a totally valid</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.830" end="00:37:20.520" style="s2">thing and so being very thoughtful of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.900" end="00:37:21.720" style="s2">the types of blowback negative effects</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.520" end="00:37:24.210" style="s2">of the provisions that we put in place</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.720" end="00:37:25.770" style="s2">and yet the need to put provisions in</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.210" end="00:37:27.510" style="s2">place just making sure we&#39;re optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.770" end="00:37:29.010" style="s2">for both solving this problem and not</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.510" end="00:37:32.340" style="s2">causing other problems at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.010" end="00:37:33.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a key consideration one other</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.340" end="00:37:36.420" style="s2">thing I didn&#39;t say this should be</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.900" end="00:37:45.030" style="s2">happening already today before we even</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.420" end="00:37:46.680" style="s2">think about the dance phase is so I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.030" end="00:37:48.060" style="s2">mentioning all of that was how do you</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.680" end="00:37:50.130" style="s2">decrease the total amount of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.060" end="00:37:52.770" style="s2">transmission but this other part is how</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.130" end="00:37:54.570" style="s2">do you make it to where people who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.770" end="00:37:56.220" style="s2">infected a smaller percentage of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.570" end="00:37:59.250" style="s2">have severe infections that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.220" end="00:38:03.270" style="s2">question right now there&#39;s stuff being</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.250" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">explored regarding plasma transfer so</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.270" end="00:38:06.030" style="s2">people who have recovered who have</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:07.620" style="s2">antibodies can we take their plasma</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.030" end="00:38:11.100" style="s2">injected and other people either as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.620" end="00:38:12.990" style="s2">treatment and or as a prevention it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.100" end="00:38:14.840" style="s2">interesting research not far enough</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.990" end="00:38:16.980" style="s2">along to know but like it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.840" end="00:38:18.840" style="s2">it appears that there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.980" end="00:38:21.180" style="s2">people who from having had previous</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.840" end="00:38:23.010" style="s2">corona viruses recently might already</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.180" end="00:38:25.580" style="s2">have some background immunity and being</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.010" end="00:38:28.830" style="s2">able to identify that would be valuable</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.580" end="00:38:32.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s not known there is some</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.830" end="00:38:35.370" style="s2">indication that there are more and less</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.280" end="00:38:38.010" style="s2">virulent strains of this virus of SARS</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.370" end="00:38:39.870" style="s2">co2 and that there might be less</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.010" end="00:38:42.150" style="s2">virulent strains that people could be</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.870" end="00:38:43.650" style="s2">exposed to that wouldn&#39;t produce illness</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.150" end="00:38:45.570" style="s2">but would still produce a protective</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.650" end="00:38:47.190" style="s2">antibody to the more virulent strains so</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.570" end="00:38:52.950" style="s2">that&#39;s a very interesting kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.190" end="00:38:57.500" style="s2">natural vaccine approach and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.950" end="00:38:57.500" style="s2">herd immunity advancement type approach</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.930" end="00:39:04.520" style="s2">but in addition to that there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.700" end="00:39:07.400" style="s2">treatments right not just can we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.520" end="00:39:10.750" style="s2">antibodies but are there antiviral and</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.400" end="00:39:13.369" style="s2">not just antiviral but h2 modulating and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.750" end="00:39:21.260" style="s2">cytokine modulating and other types of</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.369" end="00:39:23.270" style="s2">treatments we there was so much talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.260" end="00:39:24.650" style="s2">about hydroxychloroquine because when</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.270" end="00:39:26.180" style="s2">Trump started talking about it obviously</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.650" end="00:39:28.099" style="s2">got a lot of attention and it became a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.180" end="00:39:30.170" style="s2">highly politicized topic and then it</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.099" end="00:39:34.789" style="s2">wasn&#39;t about just doing medicine well it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.170" end="00:39:37.250" style="s2">was about and you can see the biases</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.789" end="00:39:39.079" style="s2">right you could see people who just</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.250" end="00:39:40.549" style="s2">didn&#39;t want this to be that bad and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.079" end="00:39:42.079" style="s2">wanted there to be an answer and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.549" end="00:39:44.660" style="s2">wanted to believe that there already was</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.079" end="00:39:46.609" style="s2">an answer and you could also see people</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.660" end="00:39:47.930" style="s2">who wanted Trump to be wrong and bad and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.609" end="00:39:49.430" style="s2">stupid for having said something like</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.430" end="00:39:52.369" style="s2">public health professional who kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.260" end="00:39:53.869" style="s2">biased another direction and then they</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.369" end="00:39:57.109" style="s2">of course all read the data with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.869" end="00:39:58.339" style="s2">bias in mind so we tried to do a good</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.109" end="00:40:00.520" style="s2">letter to review that looked at the</p>

<p begin="00:40:08.150" end="00:40:14.750" style="s2">known about it on previous coronaviruses</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.789" end="00:40:17.960" style="s2">on previous SARS in in-vitro trials in</p>

<p begin="00:40:17.960" end="00:40:21.770" style="s2">open label stuff that we have so far</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.609" end="00:40:23.029" style="s2">given that we don&#39;t have the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.770" end="00:40:29.180" style="s2">randomized control trials that we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.029" end="00:40:31.369" style="s2">normally want to see and what I will say</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.180" end="00:40:32.660" style="s2">about that is that it does not appear</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.369" end="00:40:37.130" style="s2">that it&#39;s particularly effective in</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.660" end="00:40:39.410" style="s2">late-stage but that&#39;s that&#39;s to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.130" end="00:40:42.230" style="s2">guessed because very few antivirals are</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.410" end="00:40:48.500" style="s2">effective in late-stage right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.230" end="00:40:51.710" style="s2">generally the principal and medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.500" end="00:40:53.930" style="s2">with infectious disease and I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.710" end="00:40:56.119" style="s2">PhD in infectious disease research or</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.930" end="00:41:02.260" style="s2">medical doctor so I&#39;m just saying stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.119" end="00:41:04.400" style="s2">here verify it yourself but if you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.260" end="00:41:06.890" style="s2">herpes outbreak and you take acyclovir</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:08.690" style="s2">within the first 24 hours maybe up to 48</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.890" end="00:41:10.250" style="s2">hours it can be quite effective and</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.690" end="00:41:12.050" style="s2">beyond that it does almost nothing</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.250" end="00:41:14.060" style="s2">and the same is true for shingles and</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.050" end="00:41:17.360" style="s2">the same is true for when you start the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.060" end="00:41:18.470" style="s2">HIV cocktail can be very effective early</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.360" end="00:41:22.220" style="s2">on is not going to be very effective</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.470" end="00:41:24.320" style="s2">late so the idea of authorizing</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.220" end="00:41:25.880" style="s2">treatment for late stage or doing a</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.320" end="00:41:27.770" style="s2">randomized control trial late stage</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.880" end="00:41:30.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really make much sense based on</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.770" end="00:41:33.980" style="s2">the whole body of what&#39;s known about</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.200" end="00:41:35.060" style="s2">antiviral treatments in general this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.980" end="00:41:37.180" style="s2">actually something I&#39;m very concerned</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.060" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">about is if a randomized control trial</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.180" end="00:41:42.470" style="s2">is done on whether it&#39;s lopen Avira REM</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.880" end="00:41:44.690" style="s2">des aveer or hydroxychloroquine or</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.470" end="00:41:47.960" style="s2">whatever but let&#39;s say it&#39;s done on any</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.690" end="00:41:49.460" style="s2">antiviral late stage and we find that</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.960" end="00:41:51.230" style="s2">it&#39;s not successful compared to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.460" end="00:41:52.910" style="s2">placebo group and then we over</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.230" end="00:41:56.150" style="s2">generalize that to say it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.910" end="00:41:57.500" style="s2">successful and as opposed to it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.150" end="00:41:58.910" style="s2">successful late stage we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.500" end="00:42:02.030" style="s2">anything about early stage if we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.910" end="00:42:03.530" style="s2">test it and the most successful</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.030" end="00:42:05.540" style="s2">antivirals we have that work towards</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.530" end="00:42:08.540" style="s2">anything aren&#39;t successful late stage</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.540" end="00:42:10.340" style="s2">that&#39;s just that&#39;s we shouldn&#39;t be doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.540" end="00:42:12.050" style="s2">that study that&#39;s a very bit dumb study</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.340" end="00:42:13.160" style="s2">now of course we would like to be able</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.050" end="00:42:15.020" style="s2">to treat late stage because there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.160" end="00:42:16.730" style="s2">some people who are there so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.020" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">mind the randomized control trial that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.730" end="00:42:21.950" style="s2">does both early stage and late stage in</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.280" end="00:42:23.390" style="s2">case we get lucky on late stage but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.950" end="00:42:24.920" style="s2">precedent should be anything being</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.390" end="00:42:29.630" style="s2">studied should be looking at early stage</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.920" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">treatment I do want to say something</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.630" end="00:42:36.200" style="s2">about the epistemic s&#39; of randomized</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:38.630" style="s2">control trials but I have a couple open</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.200" end="00:42:42.410" style="s2">loops here the thing with regard to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.630" end="00:42:44.720" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine so we want to see</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.410" end="00:42:46.790" style="s2">randomized control trials early stage it</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.720" end="00:42:49.970" style="s2">will take awhile for those to come out</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.790" end="00:42:51.620" style="s2">some of them are already in process some</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.970" end="00:42:52.700" style="s2">of them are nonsense and only looking at</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.620" end="00:42:54.410" style="s2">late stage and aren&#39;t going to tell us</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.700" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">anything that we don&#39;t already have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.410" end="00:43:03.110" style="s2">pretty good guess about but as it is do</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:05.630" style="s2">we have enough insight that most every</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.110" end="00:43:07.910" style="s2">doctor who I&#39;ve spoken with about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.630" end="00:43:09.320" style="s2">issue who studied it well has said this</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.910" end="00:43:11.300" style="s2">is what I would use for myself and my</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.320" end="00:43:13.280" style="s2">family even if I can&#39;t take that opinion</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.300" end="00:43:15.980" style="s2">that position publicly because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.280" end="00:43:20.000" style="s2">defensible traditionally yes yeah yes I</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.980" end="00:43:22.160" style="s2">had some quite famous infectious disease</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.000" end="00:43:24.049" style="s2">doc say this does I already have it for</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.160" end="00:43:25.489" style="s2">myself for and if any of me or my</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.049" end="00:43:27.559" style="s2">get sake this what I&#39;ll do but I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.489" end="00:43:29.660" style="s2">talk about it publicly or say anything</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.559" end="00:43:31.189" style="s2">to that effect because the hospital</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.660" end="00:43:33.229" style="s2">system that I work for said I&#39;d lose my</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.189" end="00:43:34.670" style="s2">job I can&#39;t prescribe it to patients</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.229" end="00:43:37.069" style="s2">because the hospital system said that</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.670" end="00:43:38.449" style="s2">because they have been very trained with</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.069" end="00:43:44.390" style="s2">malpractice and other things to take</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.449" end="00:43:47.959" style="s2">maximally defensible positions so what I</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.390" end="00:43:51.650" style="s2">think is that in the hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.959" end="00:43:53.089" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because it&#39;s generic so</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.650" end="00:43:55.249" style="s2">nobody can make all that much money on</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.089" end="00:44:02.329" style="s2">it because anybody can make it right</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.249" end="00:44:03.859" style="s2">it&#39;s off patent now so since any company</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.329" end="00:44:06.499" style="s2">can make it they&#39;re just competing on</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.859" end="00:44:10.819" style="s2">the margins of being able to you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.499" end="00:44:12.289" style="s2">produce the goods slightly cheaper real</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.819" end="00:44:15.499" style="s2">money is made for things that are still</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.289" end="00:44:19.509" style="s2">on patent so if someone if we were</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.499" end="00:44:22.729" style="s2">wanting to look at kind of predatory</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.509" end="00:44:24.979" style="s2">perverse incentive it would most likely</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.729" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">be to prove that the generic things</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.979" end="00:44:30.019" style="s2">don&#39;t work to motivate the movement of</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:32.150" style="s2">drugs that actually have more money to</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.019" end="00:44:33.679" style="s2">be made and there&#39;s been some</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.150" end="00:44:35.719" style="s2">interesting traction not just with</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.679" end="00:44:37.849" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine but also ivermectin</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.719" end="00:44:40.160" style="s2">and methylene blue which are all super</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.849" end="00:44:42.170" style="s2">old very well known anti malarial drugs</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:44.599" style="s2">that have some antiviral and other kinds</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.170" end="00:44:46.489" style="s2">of activity I&#39;m very interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.599" end="00:44:50.089" style="s2">research on these drugs and other things</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.489" end="00:44:52.039" style="s2">like them where we have 40 or 50 or 70</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.089" end="00:44:53.660" style="s2">years of use on these because it means</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.039" end="00:44:55.309" style="s2">that we have very long-term safety that</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.660" end="00:44:56.900" style="s2">are already established we know what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.309" end="00:45:00.019" style="s2">contraindications are we know what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.900" end="00:45:01.819" style="s2">safety is and there really aren&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.019" end="00:45:03.679" style="s2">financial motives that are associated so</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.819" end="00:45:05.660" style="s2">all we have to do is show efficacy we</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.679" end="00:45:09.199" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do long term safety so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.660" end="00:45:10.819" style="s2">happy to rush randomized control trials</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.199" end="00:45:12.380" style="s2">if need be in a situation like an</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.819" end="00:45:14.269" style="s2">epidemic on something where long-term</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.380" end="00:45:16.189" style="s2">safety is already established in other</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.269" end="00:45:18.439" style="s2">contexts and all we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.189" end="00:45:20.439" style="s2">establishing efficacy in a new context I</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.439" end="00:45:23.179" style="s2">would not be happy to rush a new drug</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.439" end="00:45:24.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a totally novel chemical and we</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.179" end="00:45:25.999" style="s2">don&#39;t know anything about its establish</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.559" end="00:45:27.829" style="s2">safety and I certainly would not be</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.999" end="00:45:31.939" style="s2">happy to rush a new vaccine which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.829" end="00:45:34.099" style="s2">intended to have enduring effects so the</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.900" end="00:45:51.530" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine because as you say</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.880" end="00:45:52.940" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of controversy about</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.530" end="00:45:55.130" style="s2">it&#39;s become kind of a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.940" end="00:45:59.180" style="s2">political football but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.130" end="00:46:00.620" style="s2">there are I feel kind of the need to to</p>

<p begin="00:46:00.620" end="00:46:05.330" style="s2">have been sort of concerns about and</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.130" end="00:46:06.830" style="s2">it&#39;s used for a lot of other treatments</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.330" end="00:46:08.780" style="s2">at the moment and there&#39;s potential</p>

<p begin="00:46:14.360" end="00:46:17.060" style="s2">couple of articles from The Washington</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.380" end="00:46:21.440" style="s2">Post just before we started recording</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.060" end="00:46:23.540" style="s2">and the kind of the what is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.440" end="00:46:26.150" style="s2">generally accepted or the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.540" end="00:46:29.750" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s out there mostly is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.150" end="00:46:31.910" style="s2">it&#39;s not the evidence is not good and</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.750" end="00:46:34.310" style="s2">that the initial trial showing that</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.910" end="00:46:36.770" style="s2">there was some usefulness in it have not</p>

<p begin="00:46:41.420" end="00:46:46.610" style="s2">there that might kind of add to that and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.330" end="00:46:49.130" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t kind of we&#39;re not all</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.610" end="00:46:50.750" style="s2">able to completely check so what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.130" end="00:46:55.130" style="s2">sense of what the narratives are and</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.750" end="00:46:56.600" style="s2">what the truth is well fortunately it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:46:58.190" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">you&#39;d have to talk to a doctor and they</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.710" end="00:47:04.820" style="s2">have the job to review this and make the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:07.130" style="s2">decision so I&#39;m not going to advise</p>

<p begin="00:47:21.770" end="00:47:26.210" style="s2">are articles that are radically</p>

<p begin="00:47:26.210" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">to actually make sense of it is going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.720" end="00:47:36.620" style="s2">take a little bit deeper work so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:40.510" style="s2">tell you how I make sense of it and my</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.620" end="00:47:43.370" style="s2">sense making is almost certain to</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.510" end="00:47:44.420" style="s2">increase on this particular topic as the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.370" end="00:47:46.570" style="s2">days and weeks following more</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.420" end="00:47:51.320" style="s2">information comes out</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.570" end="00:47:54.220" style="s2">so is it a benign drug no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.320" end="00:47:56.300" style="s2">totally contraindications and risks and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.220" end="00:48:02.840" style="s2">nobody should be drinking fish tank</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.300" end="00:48:05.030" style="s2">cleaner like and if you just happen to</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.840" end="00:48:07.040" style="s2">find some hydroxychloroquine somehow or</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.030" end="00:48:08.390" style="s2">chloroquine by the way those two are</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.040" end="00:48:11.530" style="s2">quite different hydroxychloroquine has a</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.390" end="00:48:14.540" style="s2">much lower side effect profile and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.530" end="00:48:16.550" style="s2">any study that is comparing those two as</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.540" end="00:48:22.310" style="s2">if they&#39;re the same thing that is also</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.550" end="00:48:24.740" style="s2">inappropriate but are there concerns for</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.310" end="00:48:27.260" style="s2">people with specific kinds of heart</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.740" end="00:48:30.650" style="s2">issues that it along gates this QTc</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.260" end="00:48:32.030" style="s2">interval yes so you would want to see</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.650" end="00:48:35.060" style="s2">your doctor they would look at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.030" end="00:48:36.350" style="s2">contraindications of what not to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.060" end="00:48:37.610" style="s2">would not to give it with in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.350" end="00:48:39.620" style="s2">other drugs you&#39;re on or existing</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.610" end="00:48:42.440" style="s2">medical conditions maybe do an EKG and</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.620" end="00:48:44.030" style="s2">then decide if you seemed like a safe</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.440" end="00:48:46.910" style="s2">person to do it with where the benefits</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.030" end="00:48:51.320" style="s2">of doing it outweigh the possible risks</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.910" end="00:48:53.900" style="s2">of doing it and that kind of risk to</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.320" end="00:48:59.390" style="s2">benefit assessment is the key to using</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.900" end="00:49:05.180" style="s2">medicine with regard to shortage and</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.390" end="00:49:08.690" style="s2">supply so if we look at the food supply</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.180" end="00:49:13.010" style="s2">system right now we see that there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.690" end="00:49:14.150" style="s2">areas where farmers are telling crop</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.010" end="00:49:16.760" style="s2">back into the soil</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.150" end="00:49:18.620" style="s2">potatoes are rotting because no because</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.760" end="00:49:20.890" style="s2">McDonald&#39;s isn&#39;t feeding people so they</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.620" end="00:49:23.660" style="s2">aren&#39;t buying french fry materials and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.890" end="00:49:25.850" style="s2">dairy is being dumped in huge amounts</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.660" end="00:49:27.880" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like there&#39;s food wastage</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.850" end="00:49:30.560" style="s2">happening because of food excesses</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.880" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">because the normal distribution channels</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.560" end="00:49:35.600" style="s2">which are stores that aren&#39;t selling it</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.280" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">restaurants that aren&#39;t selling it but</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.600" end="00:49:39.470" style="s2">at the same time there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:40.550" style="s2">are starving in places in India where</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.470" end="00:49:43.640" style="s2">they can&#39;t get food and you see these</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.550" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2">lines in San Antonio of cars that are a</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.640" end="00:49:48.650" style="s2">mile long waiting for food lines it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.400" end="00:49:50.240" style="s2">not that there isn&#39;t enough food or that</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.650" end="00:49:52.400" style="s2">there&#39;s too much food there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.240" end="00:49:53.780" style="s2">an intelligence issue right a logistics</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.400" end="00:49:56.000" style="s2">issue of getting the stuff from where it</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.780" end="00:49:58.490" style="s2">is to where it needs to go the same has</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.000" end="00:49:59.840" style="s2">been true with PPE where it&#39;s like there</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.490" end="00:50:02.120" style="s2">have been huge</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.840" end="00:50:04.700" style="s2">stockpiles of PPE and in other places</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.120" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">and it just hasn&#39;t for whatever set of</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.700" end="00:50:08.420" style="s2">reasons got where it needs to go it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:10.010" style="s2">the best of my understanding that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.420" end="00:50:12.080" style="s2">case for the hydroxychloroquine there</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.010" end="00:50:14.510" style="s2">are both meaningful existing stockpiles</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.080" end="00:50:17.150" style="s2">and a lot of places that are up ramping</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.510" end="00:50:19.250" style="s2">their capability to produce it because</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.150" end="00:50:21.620" style="s2">it&#39;s an extremely simple molecule and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.250" end="00:50:23.990" style="s2">being that it&#39;s generic any lab that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.620" end="00:50:25.460" style="s2">wants to start to make it it could start</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.990" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">to make it I mean they would need FDA</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.460" end="00:50:29.150" style="s2">approval if they&#39;re in the US they</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:30.890" style="s2">obviously would need something different</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.150" end="00:50:32.330" style="s2">if they&#39;re in the developing world which</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.890" end="00:50:34.850" style="s2">is one of the nice things is being able</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.330" end="00:50:37.610" style="s2">to have something that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.850" end="00:50:40.870" style="s2">producible for large population</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.610" end="00:50:40.870" style="s2">developing world type places</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.830" end="00:50:48.290" style="s2">so one of the things we did was so there</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.100" end="00:50:50.240" style="s2">was this there was a Chinese study and</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.290" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">there were questions about the validity</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:53.300" style="s2">of the Chinese study there were two</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:55.910" style="s2">Chinese studies actually then there was</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.300" end="00:50:57.590" style="s2">this French study that got a lot of news</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.910" end="00:50:59.120" style="s2">and there were questions about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.590" end="00:51:01.640" style="s2">appropriateness of the methodology on</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.120" end="00:51:05.930" style="s2">the French study then there was this New</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.640" end="00:51:07.970" style="s2">York doctor Solanco who did it and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.930" end="00:51:09.950" style="s2">know he was claiming near pretty close</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.970" end="00:51:12.920" style="s2">to perfect results and there were</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.950" end="00:51:14.330" style="s2">questions about his methodology and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.920" end="00:51:16.070" style="s2">there were more people that started</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.330" end="00:51:21.710" style="s2">claiming that they were having success</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.070" end="00:51:24.260" style="s2">using it so we just brought a few MDS</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.710" end="00:51:25.910" style="s2">together who understood the pharmacology</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.260" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">of the drug did a review of all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.910" end="00:51:30.110" style="s2">literature and then called all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.640" end="00:51:31.730" style="s2">doctors we could find who had been using</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.110" end="00:51:33.350" style="s2">it in this country and in other</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.730" end="00:51:34.820" style="s2">countries and especially doing early</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.350" end="00:51:37.850" style="s2">treatment and said just give us all your</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.820" end="00:51:39.230" style="s2">data so what how many people did you</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.850" end="00:51:40.970" style="s2">treat what were they presenting with</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.230" end="00:51:43.250" style="s2">what kinds of diagnostics did you do up</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.970" end="00:51:45.800" style="s2">front and then what have you seen in</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.250" end="00:51:49.550" style="s2">terms of progression to severe cases and</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.800" end="00:51:51.550" style="s2">like that this is not randomized this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.550" end="00:51:55.490" style="s2">not placebo controlled double or single</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.550" end="00:51:58.400" style="s2">blinded it is multi-location if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.490" end="00:52:02.810" style="s2">factor the aggregate data now does it</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.400" end="00:52:05.840" style="s2">mean anything those all be placebos well</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.810" end="00:52:07.460" style="s2">we could look at the total effect that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.840" end="00:52:09.920" style="s2">placebos the range of effect that</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.460" end="00:52:11.600" style="s2">placebos have for similar viral</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.920" end="00:52:12.200" style="s2">conditions because placebos don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.600" end="00:52:14.540" style="s2">100</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.200" end="00:52:15.980" style="s2">success right they have a specific range</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.540" end="00:52:17.930" style="s2">of success where you can remove that</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.980" end="00:52:19.550" style="s2">statistical artifact and see is there an</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.930" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">effect beyond the type of effective Lisi</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.550" end="00:52:23.869" style="s2">Bo&#39;s typically have especially when you</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:26.960" style="s2">see that there are mechanistic effects</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.869" end="00:52:31.310" style="s2">and in-vitro effects and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.960" end="00:52:34.010" style="s2">vivo on other types of viruses so a</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.310" end="00:52:36.770" style="s2">pretty large number of doctors said that</p>

<p begin="00:52:41.420" end="00:52:49.250" style="s2">in nineteen that the percentage of those</p>

<p begin="00:52:49.250" end="00:52:54.320" style="s2">hospitalized was about seventy percent</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.140" end="00:53:07.790" style="s2">is correct and if just simply seeing a</p>

<p begin="00:53:35.420" end="00:53:43.700" style="s2">possible that prescribing physicians are</p>

<p begin="00:53:45.470" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">where specifically what the law would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.740" end="00:53:52.700" style="s2">doing is having the hospital system they</p>

<p begin="00:54:54.020" end="00:54:59.840" style="s2">go to advanced cases and die and these</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.320" end="00:55:02.210" style="s2">are people who have comorbidities and</p>

<p begin="00:55:02.210" end="00:55:08.120" style="s2">a very real need to say do we have</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.260" end="00:55:10.490" style="s2">enough data to say that it is a right</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.120" end="00:55:12.110" style="s2">choice that the risk benefit is worth</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.490" end="00:55:14.450" style="s2">this and that would be a decision</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.110" end="00:55:16.130" style="s2">between the doctor and the patient I do</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.450" end="00:55:19.720" style="s2">believe that during this time rather</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.130" end="00:55:21.770" style="s2">than only allow fda-approved things</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.720" end="00:55:26.390" style="s2">doctors should be able to treat that</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.770" end="00:55:27.980" style="s2">will and you know that there one could</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.390" end="00:55:29.870" style="s2">say from an FDA perspective they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.980" end="00:55:31.850" style="s2">allowed but not from a malpractice or a</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.870" end="00:55:33.140" style="s2">hospital perspective often and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.850" end="00:55:36.100" style="s2">going to be the key thing that we would</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.140" end="00:55:41.210" style="s2">want the state to legislate in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.100" end="00:55:42.890" style="s2">support of I wonder you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.210" end="00:55:44.920" style="s2">second and third order effects and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.890" end="00:55:47.510" style="s2">talked about a lot of those in the last</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.920" end="00:55:50.600" style="s2">film that we put out are you seeing any</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.510" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">of those well we already mentioned some</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.600" end="00:55:59.630" style="s2">of them right like talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:56:02.660" style="s2">food supply so the the huge number of</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.630" end="00:56:06.849" style="s2">locusts that are in parts of northern</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.660" end="00:56:09.099" style="s2">Africa and parts of the Middle East</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.849" end="00:56:11.529" style="s2">they the locusts were already there</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.099" end="00:56:13.900" style="s2">before the Kovan thing happened but they</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.529" end="00:56:15.579" style="s2">got much much worse I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.900" end="00:56:17.650" style="s2">specific stats on how much worse in</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.579" end="00:56:20.459" style="s2">recent infestations but it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.650" end="00:56:23.289" style="s2">the biggest thing in recent times and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.459" end="00:56:28.359" style="s2">destroyed crops in those areas that was</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.289" end="00:56:30.219" style="s2">actually because of travel bans that</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.359" end="00:56:32.709" style="s2">kept the pesticides from getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.219" end="00:56:34.029" style="s2">farmers and so because they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.709" end="00:56:36.249" style="s2">give the pesticides they couldn&#39;t treat</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.029" end="00:56:37.719" style="s2">for the past&#39;s and because they were you</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.249" end="00:56:39.759" style="s2">know doing agriculture that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.719" end="00:56:44.410" style="s2">susceptible to pests then they were all</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.759" end="00:56:46.269" style="s2">able to be devastated there were similar</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.410" end="00:56:49.269" style="s2">kinds of things that happened in India</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.269" end="00:56:53.349" style="s2">that led to crops rotting in fields and</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.269" end="00:56:55.630" style="s2">so we have this over demand and under</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.349" end="00:56:59.109" style="s2">demand supply chain set of issues where</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.630" end="00:57:01.269" style="s2">we have both rotting food damaged food</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.109" end="00:57:04.059" style="s2">supplies and people with no access to</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.269" end="00:57:06.339" style="s2">food simultaneously and we&#39;re just at</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.059" end="00:57:08.319" style="s2">the beginning of those effects starting</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.339" end="00:57:10.299" style="s2">to happen but those effects</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.319" end="00:57:11.709" style="s2">don&#39;t go away very quickly right like if</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.299" end="00:57:13.599" style="s2">you lose a crop that&#39;s gonna have some</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.709" end="00:57:16.509" style="s2">enduring effect and then you start</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.599" end="00:57:18.640" style="s2">getting manipulation on the price of</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.509" end="00:57:21.729" style="s2">food commodities so could there be</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.640" end="00:57:23.380" style="s2">escalation to food riots or wars over</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.729" end="00:57:24.969" style="s2">food shortages in areas where people</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.380" end="00:57:26.679" style="s2">don&#39;t have food like those are very real</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.969" end="00:57:28.630" style="s2">things and especially when you look at a</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.679" end="00:57:29.859" style="s2">place like India where the total number</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.630" end="00:57:32.589" style="s2">of people that could be in food shortage</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.859" end="00:57:34.359" style="s2">is a huge number of people then does</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.589" end="00:57:36.400" style="s2">that lead to violence does that cleave</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.359" end="00:57:39.130" style="s2">along Muslim Hindu lines could that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.400" end="00:57:40.449" style="s2">escalate to India Pakistan issues so</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.130" end="00:57:42.130" style="s2">this is where we&#39;re looking at an issue</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.449" end="00:57:45.179" style="s2">where you&#39;ve already got systemic</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.130" end="00:57:50.039" style="s2">fragility and you&#39;ve already got</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.179" end="00:57:50.039" style="s2">basically a situation primed for</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.489" end="00:57:56.709" style="s2">catalysis types events where you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:58:01.029" style="s2">the the financial system pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.709" end="00:58:04.779" style="s2">broke right the economy is</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.029" end="00:58:07.359" style="s2">extraordinarily damaged the social</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.779" end="00:58:09.609" style="s2">fabric has been very damaged in lots of</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.359" end="00:58:11.750" style="s2">areas we weren&#39;t talking about this very</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.609" end="00:58:14.550" style="s2">much but</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.750" end="00:58:16.170" style="s2">in addition to the mental health crisis</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.550" end="00:58:18.660" style="s2">that&#39;s happening from people being at</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.170" end="00:58:19.950" style="s2">home and not able to take care of their</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.660" end="00:58:22.490" style="s2">mind and the way they&#39;re used to in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.950" end="00:58:24.900" style="s2">increased anxiety do we start seeing</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.490" end="00:58:26.670" style="s2">benzo prescriptions go way up that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.900" end="00:58:28.530" style="s2">also have a long tail of the damaging</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.670" end="00:58:30.270" style="s2">effects of the benzo prescriptions are</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.530" end="00:58:33.750" style="s2">we seeing increased domestic violence</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.270" end="00:58:36.300" style="s2">both spousal ii and towards children as</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.750" end="00:58:38.310" style="s2">people are in proximity with each other</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.300" end="00:58:40.230" style="s2">that they aren&#39;t used to having it and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.310" end="00:58:44.480" style="s2">then what are the long path societal</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.230" end="00:58:44.480" style="s2">effects of that trauma that occurs right</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.080" end="00:58:50.970" style="s2">obviously it doesn&#39;t take very long to</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.660" end="00:58:52.530" style="s2">destroy a small business takes a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.970" end="00:58:55.290" style="s2">long time to rebuild an effective small</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.530" end="00:58:56.970" style="s2">business and it&#39;s like cutting down an</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.290" end="00:59:00.570" style="s2">old-growth forest do you just don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.970" end="00:59:05.610" style="s2">one back very quickly and so the damage</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.570" end="00:59:07.410" style="s2">to just basically the unemployment and</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.610" end="00:59:10.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen what the unemployment just</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.410" end="00:59:16.140" style="s2">complete skyrocket 10x plus any previous</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.800" end="00:59:18.030" style="s2">you know similar time period people</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.140" end="00:59:19.830" style="s2">don&#39;t get to refine jobs as quickly as</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.030" end="00:59:22.410" style="s2">they lost them or rebuild businesses or</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.830" end="00:59:25.350" style="s2">so there are enduring effects there</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.410" end="00:59:26.910" style="s2">obviously if surveillance apparatus is</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.350" end="00:59:37.020" style="s2">put in of the wrong type they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.910" end="00:59:40.140" style="s2">enduring effects so I think that and</p>
