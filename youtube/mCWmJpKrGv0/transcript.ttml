<p begin="00:00:00.890" end="00:00:06.750" style="s2">so there&#39;s business voice in the back of</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.200" end="00:00:08.730" style="s2">my head that keeps saying this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.750" end="00:00:10.530" style="s2">technology cooperative it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.730" end="00:00:14.370" style="s2">technology company it&#39;s not technology</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.530" end="00:00:15.269" style="s2">and yet all I&#39;ve been saying I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.370" end="00:00:16.619" style="s2">been saying it for a reason because</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.269" end="00:00:18.750" style="s2">before it was this is a technology</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.619" end="00:00:20.220" style="s2">cooperative now all of a sudden it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.750" end="00:00:23.880" style="s2">like this is not a technology</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.220" end="00:00:26.369" style="s2">cooperative part of that I understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.880" end="00:00:29.220" style="s2">what it is and I am resisting it because</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.369" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">it is the piece that is not the product</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.220" end="00:00:35.610" style="s2">not the process it is the individual</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:38.160" style="s2">piece of how I got here it is creating a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.610" end="00:00:41.040" style="s2">culture and a system of learning which</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.160" end="00:00:43.260" style="s2">means not shame culture but growth</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:45.239" style="s2">culture what happened what went wrong</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.260" end="00:00:46.440" style="s2">doing things out in the open and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.239" end="00:00:48.870" style="s2">learning from them and that is very much</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.440" end="00:00:50.610" style="s2">intimately intertwined with the mission</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.870" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">of together tech but there&#39;s a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.610" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">like self-reflection and growth that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:57.960" style="s2">have to do to be kind of be able to get</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:00:59.879" style="s2">there and this this cultural of radical</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.960" end="00:01:02.609" style="s2">acceptance we&#39;re like you might not see</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.879" end="00:01:05.880" style="s2">this person as as good as you as but</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.609" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">like they are they are just as worthy as</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.880" end="00:01:09.750" style="s2">you even if you can&#39;t see it and often</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:13.049" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna be able to see it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.750" end="00:01:14.850" style="s2">worthy exactly as you are and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.049" end="00:01:16.590" style="s2">that piece and I&#39;m I&#39;m eventually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.850" end="00:01:18.439" style="s2">get to and it&#39;s gonna be released and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.590" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see how that goes so</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.439" end="00:01:22.590" style="s2">that there&#39;s that piece that is my own</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">inter in piece of like right this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.590" end="00:01:25.229" style="s2">a technology for me I don&#39;t only have</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">technology to give there&#39;s this other</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.229" end="00:01:30.320" style="s2">piece of me I have to give that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:33.090" style="s2">equally as powerful but aside from that</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.320" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge people keep bringing up</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.090" end="00:01:36.659" style="s2">technology because it&#39;s a technology</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:39.420" style="s2">cooperative and there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.659" end="00:01:42.079" style="s2">like grates at me when that happens I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.420" end="00:01:44.520" style="s2">like but we&#39;re not the same as them and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.079" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">part of that I have to own it I have and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.520" end="00:01:49.110" style="s2">like meditating through it I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:50.729" style="s2">there&#39;s more to it to come but it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.110" end="00:01:52.229" style="s2">that it was like right cuz you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.729" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">explaining it well and you&#39;re right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.229" end="00:01:56.009" style="s2">not a technology company like what makes</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:01:58.860" style="s2">us different than them is there a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.009" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">technology company and we&#39;re not what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.860" end="00:02:06.030" style="s2">are is a solutions cooperative a way to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">create solutions together in this space</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.030" end="00:02:10.890" style="s2">between I have to do it all on my own</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:13.260" style="s2">and they will fix it</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.890" end="00:02:15.300" style="s2">how do we bring people together to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.260" end="00:02:18.990" style="s2">create solutions together and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.300" end="00:02:20.970" style="s2">those those others the github and open</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.990" end="00:02:22.200" style="s2">source do create solutions together but</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.970" end="00:02:24.240" style="s2">they&#39;re not designed to create solutions</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.200" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">together they&#39;re a technology company</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.240" end="00:02:28.110" style="s2">that creates solutions together and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:31.860" style="s2">are a solutions company and it creates</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.110" end="00:02:34.170" style="s2">technology so that means we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.860" end="00:02:37.860" style="s2">designed for the technologically elite</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.170" end="00:02:38.370" style="s2">we&#39;re not designed for the to make a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.860" end="00:02:40.709" style="s2">profit</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.370" end="00:02:43.170" style="s2">we&#39;re designed for the purpose of making</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.709" end="00:02:45.590" style="s2">our members lives better and how we do</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.170" end="00:02:49.050" style="s2">that is by listening to our members and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.590" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">not on I&#39;m we are gonna listen to our</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.050" end="00:02:54.180" style="s2">members but on a like I&#39;m a member</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:55.500" style="s2">you&#39;re a member we need to find our</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.180" end="00:02:58.290" style="s2">common problems and solve them together</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.500" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">and empowered with the tools to be able</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.290" end="00:03:03.450" style="s2">to make that easier and easier and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:05.220" style="s2">looking at the system what&#39;s working for</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.450" end="00:03:06.600" style="s2">me and not working for me what would</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.220" end="00:03:10.070" style="s2">make this more powerful for me what</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.600" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">would make this easier for me so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.070" end="00:03:14.930" style="s2">system of creating a solution and I need</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:17.250" style="s2">to honor that I also had a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.930" end="00:03:19.950" style="s2">with Heather we talked about how</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.250" end="00:03:22.440" style="s2">solution is the wrong word and I agree</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.950" end="00:03:24.299" style="s2">it is a very game a word it had craze</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.440" end="00:03:26.760" style="s2">with it a lot of baggage of like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.299" end="00:03:31.110" style="s2">solved it check and there is no solution</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.760" end="00:03:34.530" style="s2">like that these are constant sorry</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.110" end="00:03:35.459" style="s2">iterations on you start with something</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.530" end="00:03:37.410" style="s2">that&#39;s good enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.459" end="00:03:40.709" style="s2">Bittan created openly and transparently</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.410" end="00:03:42.810" style="s2">and you keep on making it better with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.709" end="00:03:43.290" style="s2">culture of learning growth what went</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.810" end="00:03:44.850" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.290" end="00:03:46.260" style="s2">how could we have how could we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.850" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">improve that if we knew what we knew now</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.260" end="00:03:50.610" style="s2">and then how do we do do that in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:52.019" style="s2">future every time something goes wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.610" end="00:03:53.580" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for things that could go</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.019" end="00:03:54.989" style="s2">wrong and hopefully you know stopping</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.580" end="00:03:56.519" style="s2">them before they go wrong but when they</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.989" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">go wrong we look at what happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.519" end="00:04:03.870" style="s2">without blame and shame and correct them</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:07.709" style="s2">and fix them and if different solutions</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.870" end="00:04:13.590" style="s2">work for different people we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.709" end="00:04:14.970" style="s2">a solution together so we don&#39;t want you</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.590" end="00:04:16.590" style="s2">to leave and create your own because</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.970" end="00:04:23.139" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna actually hurt the solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.590" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">itself 10,000 of us recreating a food</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.139" end="00:04:29.650" style="s2">solution for our city is gonna be more</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:31.449" style="s2">powerful than to 5,000 genes with their</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.650" end="00:04:32.770" style="s2">you know purchasing power to 5000 teams</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.449" end="00:04:34.090" style="s2">might create something to compete me</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.770" end="00:04:35.770" style="s2">like yours is better and jump on board</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.090" end="00:04:38.289" style="s2">but there&#39;s gonna be a cost to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.770" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">dissipating energy and I saw I was just</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.289" end="00:04:42.159" style="s2">talkin on the last videos it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:44.469" style="s2">will be into it what we are creating is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.159" end="00:04:45.789" style="s2">solutions and so that is partly we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.469" end="00:04:50.020" style="s2">talking about this fix the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.789" end="00:04:52.210" style="s2">Friday&#39;s is micro solidarity and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.020" end="00:04:55.150" style="s2">process which to me is very much the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.210" end="00:04:59.409" style="s2">I to the them the like I need to solve</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.150" end="00:05:01.210" style="s2">it by myself which I can&#39;t do and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.409" end="00:05:02.979" style="s2">need to solve it for us we need to pass</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.210" end="00:05:04.389" style="s2">laws they need you like enforce those</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.979" end="00:05:06.520" style="s2">laws those companies need to do what</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.389" end="00:05:08.379" style="s2">what we&#39;re paying them not to do like</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.520" end="00:05:10.029" style="s2">the system needs to be different and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.379" end="00:05:12.490" style="s2">not I it&#39;s too much for me because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.029" end="00:05:13.930" style="s2">can&#39;t how does one person have power so</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.490" end="00:05:16.089" style="s2">there&#39;s that space in between which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.930" end="00:05:18.909" style="s2">where we&#39;re creating solutions it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.089" end="00:05:21.819" style="s2">hopefully demanding other people have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.909" end="00:05:23.289" style="s2">have our solution it&#39;s inviting them to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.819" end="00:05:26.189" style="s2">be part of creating one that works for</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.289" end="00:05:31.150" style="s2">all of us because we want all of us and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.189" end="00:05:32.680" style="s2">so what you can&#39;t do is demand that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.150" end="00:05:34.839" style="s2">other people use it the same way you do</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.680" end="00:05:37.589" style="s2">right because that&#39;s gonna dissipate it</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.839" end="00:05:40.270" style="s2">you have to be this category to be here</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.589" end="00:05:43.210" style="s2">is gonna dissipate the energy but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.270" end="00:05:45.129" style="s2">like a hole in the radio so what we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.210" end="00:05:47.050" style="s2">creating what&#39;s together tech is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.129" end="00:05:50.110" style="s2">solutions cooperative but we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.050" end="00:05:52.750" style="s2">have eventually a better word than</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.110" end="00:05:55.539" style="s2">solutions problem-solving brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.750" end="00:05:57.610" style="s2">like a system to improve our lives</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.539" end="00:05:58.899" style="s2">together every we need a new word</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.610" end="00:06:01.300" style="s2">because every word is gonna have you</p>
