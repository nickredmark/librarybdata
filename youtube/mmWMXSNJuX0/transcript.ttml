<p begin="00:19:41.690" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">simple version of that is when you get</p>

<p begin="00:21:16.850" end="00:21:21.530" style="s2">well we know that the people who can</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.000" end="00:21:23.210" style="s2">collaborate with thousands of other</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.530" end="00:21:27.380" style="s2">people can together with those people</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.200" end="00:22:01.190" style="s2">mm-hmm so the global empires the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.300" end="00:22:05.059" style="s2">internet yeah and we wrote that book 116</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.190" end="00:22:07.490" style="s2">years ago it&#39;s all there it was coarse</p>

<p begin="00:22:17.809" end="00:22:21.890" style="s2">understood 50 100 years ago will you get</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.270" end="00:22:24.410" style="s2">it and the guys wrong support customers</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.890" end="00:22:26.150" style="s2">and they get it that gives me hope</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.410" end="00:22:28.040" style="s2">the more we can spread lease ID ISM and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.150" end="00:22:29.780" style="s2">the more I can get feedback of my deism</p>

<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:38.860" style="s2">I called the synthetic intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.490" end="00:22:42.520" style="s2">without synthetic intelligence we will</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.860" end="00:22:44.290" style="s2">not survive on this planet yeah and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.520" end="00:22:48.190" style="s2">isn&#39;t even climate is the bombs there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.290" end="00:22:50.340" style="s2">the biggest threat of all yea the bombs</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.190" end="00:22:53.170" style="s2">that are just scattered around yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.340" end="00:22:54.700" style="s2">we&#39;re only generation away from drones</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.170" end="00:22:59.700" style="s2">being built with atomic bombs put on</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.700" end="00:23:01.960" style="s2">them and you think Islamist is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.700" end="00:23:03.670" style="s2">there gonna be a lot of pissed-off guys</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.960" end="00:23:05.980" style="s2">out there try to impress girls the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.670" end="00:23:07.929" style="s2">way it&#39;ll be more than happy to sand</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.980" end="00:23:10.020" style="s2">bumps on the drones into heavily</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.929" end="00:23:13.000" style="s2">populate their isn&#39;t just blow people up</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.020" end="00:23:14.710" style="s2">as we write about digital ibid oh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.000" end="00:23:17.170" style="s2">saying it&#39;s probably gonna happen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.710" end="00:23:18.700" style="s2">very very likely going to happen it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.170" end="00:23:20.350" style="s2">nobody&#39;s doing anything to prevent it it</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.700" end="00:23:22.420" style="s2">is very likely that it will happen an</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.350" end="00:23:24.190" style="s2">East dropping and everybody&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.420" end="00:23:26.110" style="s2">solve the problem so how do we solve the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.190" end="00:23:28.059" style="s2">problem how do we start well you need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.110" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">simply not create an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.059" end="00:23:32.890" style="s2">guys are inspired to do that and by</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.400" end="00:23:34.960" style="s2">creating large populations of young men</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.890" end="00:23:36.250" style="s2">without purpose you create exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:37.929" style="s2">vironment the Middle East created with</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.250" end="00:23:40.360" style="s2">the wrong economies from the 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.929" end="00:23:41.950" style="s2">forward redirects errand we did the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.360" end="00:23:44.350" style="s2">thing in Europe in the eighteen hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.950" end="00:23:47.830" style="s2">we had tons of young men but no purpose</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.350" end="00:23:49.420" style="s2">again that brings me back to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.830" end="00:23:52.090" style="s2">importance of Jordan Peterson right</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.420" end="00:23:53.980" style="s2">innocence because because he has whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.090" end="00:23:55.720" style="s2">mission is to give young men I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.980" end="00:23:59.320" style="s2">not he wants to give you on women</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.720" end="00:24:01.740" style="s2">purpose as well but but but that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.320" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">what needs to be done to prevent the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.740" end="00:24:07.540" style="s2">extreme dangers that that we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:11.290" style="s2">is the reason why most young men because</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.540" end="00:24:12.850" style="s2">young men are are dangerous and the use</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.290" end="00:24:15.340" style="s2">of them talk about young men here is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.850" end="00:24:17.800" style="s2">because women are passive aggressive men</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.340" end="00:24:19.900" style="s2">are openly aggressive women bitch and</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.800" end="00:24:23.130" style="s2">they kill you psychologically whereas</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.900" end="00:24:26.020" style="s2">men will go take up arms and kill you</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.130" end="00:24:27.340" style="s2">physiologically and we talked about open</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.020" end="00:24:28.780" style="s2">violence here which is what you do with</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.340" end="00:24:31.030" style="s2">drones and pumps you&#39;re not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.780" end="00:24:33.880" style="s2">able to atomic bombs that spill gossiped</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.030" end="00:24:37.120" style="s2">right they will spill atomic shit on you</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.880" end="00:24:39.550" style="s2">okay young men young women also have one</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.120" end="00:24:41.650" style="s2">advantage here mm-hmm because child</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.550" end="00:24:43.610" style="s2">rearing belongs to the inner circuit all</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.650" end="00:24:45.980" style="s2">women are born with meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.610" end="00:24:47.690" style="s2">purpose even if they don&#39;t give birth to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.980" end="00:24:49.610" style="s2">their own children they get a dog and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.690" end="00:24:51.250" style="s2">they become a great aunt and they part</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.610" end="00:24:53.210" style="s2">of the child growing process</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.250" end="00:24:56.270" style="s2">biologically women are part of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.210" end="00:24:58.190" style="s2">chattering process whatever they do they</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.270" end="00:24:59.960" style="s2">got one benefit with that they have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.190" end="00:25:01.460" style="s2">purpose problem solved yeah but if the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.960" end="00:25:03.320" style="s2">men don&#39;t have it together then the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.460" end="00:25:08.120" style="s2">women are screwed as well aren&#39;t they I</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.320" end="00:25:09.770" style="s2">mean so women will be blown up by these</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.120" end="00:25:11.840" style="s2">bombs and the woman would scream and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.770" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">they&#39;ll be terrified because the horror</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">starts with paranoia and paranoia is</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:19.970" style="s2">female trait women are oversensitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:21.679" style="s2">that means learn one thing women are</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.970" end="00:25:25.130" style="s2">oversensitive means they&#39;re clever and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">intelligent too so take their warnings</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.130" end="00:25:28.549" style="s2">seriously if the women aren&#39;t</p>
