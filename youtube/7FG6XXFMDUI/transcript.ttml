<p begin="00:03:56.590" end="00:04:03.850" style="s2">see on on the the the screen it started</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.720" end="00:04:06.520" style="s2">out tiny at the very beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.850" end="00:04:08.020" style="s2">pandemic pandemic in 2020 and now we</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.520" end="00:04:10.690" style="s2">have our own platform to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.020" end="00:04:14.050" style="s2">raise solutions all over the world we</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.690" end="00:04:16.330" style="s2">were able to figure out how what can we</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.050" end="00:04:19.470" style="s2">do right now with a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.330" end="00:04:21.940" style="s2">dollars and ten thousand people and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.470" end="00:04:23.560" style="s2">in the very beginning ignored the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.940" end="00:04:25.240" style="s2">pandemic because it was everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.560" end="00:04:26.620" style="s2">we didn&#39;t want to focus on that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.240" end="00:04:28.300" style="s2">focused on</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.620" end="00:04:30.430" style="s2">rotation and we focused on community</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.300" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">building and education and healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.430" end="00:04:34.540" style="s2">and what does it look like when we what</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:35.889" style="s2">can we create from where we are with ten</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.540" end="00:04:38.860" style="s2">thousand people and a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.889" end="00:04:41.110" style="s2">dollars and it grew and grew and people</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.860" end="00:04:43.449" style="s2">came on board and we were able to not</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.110" end="00:04:44.889" style="s2">only brainstorm amazing potential ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.449" end="00:04:47.139" style="s2">they were able to actually implement</p>

<p begin="00:05:01.750" end="00:05:06.940" style="s2">and they were able to put that time</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.300" end="00:05:08.680" style="s2">towards good use of having generative</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.970" end="00:05:44.020" style="s2">realized that the distrust we have in</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.220" end="00:05:45.729" style="s2">our media and our governments cost us</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.020" end="00:05:49.050" style="s2">all as we it was very hard to</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.849" end="00:06:20.289" style="s2">we had to come up with a way to truly</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.840" end="00:06:24.550" style="s2">allow everybody to understand the truth</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.289" end="00:06:28.150" style="s2">of every issue what is so we developed</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.570" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">so that we could have the best source of</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.780" end="00:06:50.950" style="s2">but from our best estimate of science</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:52.900" style="s2">and the scientists were able to tell us</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.950" end="00:06:54.820" style="s2">that information and we created parallel</p>
