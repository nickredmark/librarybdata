<p begin="00:01:18.400" end="00:01:22.080" style="s2">uh john you&#39;ve talked about you know the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">use of psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.080" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2">in an appropriate context within the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">confines of a within the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.680" end="00:01:29.840" style="s2">structure of a wisdom tradition yeah now</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">that we&#39;ve kind of been going through</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.840" end="00:01:34.479" style="s2">quite a bit with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.119" end="00:01:34.960" style="s2">ecology of practices where would you say</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.479" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.960" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">psychedelics fits in with that ecology</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:43.040" style="s2">what else would you recommend having in</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:46.159" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.040" end="00:01:46.720" style="s2">for that yeah i mean that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.159" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.720" end="00:01:50.720" style="s2">and the i mean so i&#39;m hesitant to answer</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:52.159" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.720" end="00:01:54.640" style="s2">i answer you i will answer you i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.159" end="00:01:56.479" style="s2">going to cop out my hesitancy is</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.640" end="00:01:58.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a question that i think ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.479" end="00:02:01.119" style="s2">needs quite a bit of empirical research</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.880" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">to give sort of sort of a definitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.119" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">confident answer to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:06.320" style="s2">so please take it under advisement that</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:08.959" style="s2">what i&#39;m offering to you is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.320" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">uh sort of mostly speculative in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.959" end="00:02:15.360" style="s2">somewhat pejorative sense of the word</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">speculative um so i mean i think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:20.800" style="s2">people should have a significant</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:20.800" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.959" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know what that means in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.239" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">terms of years but years</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">i would think in which they have uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">developed quite a few of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">the practices that are directed</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">specifically towards</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:38.879" style="s2">addressing self-deception so active</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:42.959" style="s2">open-mindedness for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.879" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">aspects of mindfulness practice and also</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.959" end="00:02:46.879" style="s2">practices that are designed to link</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:47.840" style="s2">between a propositional and respectable</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.840" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">such as chanting alexio divina because</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the important bridge that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">to be needed</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">in order to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.480" end="00:03:02.239" style="s2">and then i would uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">also hope that within well i would</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.239" end="00:03:05.519" style="s2">recommend a stronger term</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">i would recommend that within that</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.519" end="00:03:10.879" style="s2">period of let&#39;s say two to three years</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">um they have also uh become</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.879" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">i think this is the right verb owned uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">within a community</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">of co-minded and co-dedicated people by</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">co-minded i don&#39;t mean that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">shares</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">the same metaphysical doctrines per se</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.080" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">but that people</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">like we see in the sangha or here on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">discord server</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:32.799" style="s2">are meeting in good faith and are</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:35.200" style="s2">edifying and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.799" end="00:03:37.040" style="s2">um supporting and affording each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.200" end="00:03:40.400" style="s2">uh cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.040" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">so i would then see uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.400" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">use of uh psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">happening not uh but ever by sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">isolated individuals</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">within a particularly uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">sacred ritualistic context so perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">it might be something it might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:03.439" style="s2">that something like an initiation</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.439" end="00:04:08.080" style="s2">that moves people perhaps from you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">a novice stage to an aspirant</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.080" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">stage or something like that um i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:15.360" style="s2">it should have the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:18.160" style="s2">kind of setting</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.360" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">as things like baptism had i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.160" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">it should be</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">initially something that people just</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">sort of do regularly</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">uh perhaps after that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">something that is used by</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">as long as it seems to go well with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">uh then perhaps it could be something</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">that can be used</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">a little bit more frequently perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">like the eucharist was in christianity</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">uh so i think because it is a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">powerful tool</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">um it has to be that within</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">a a context that both</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:57.759" style="s2">is cautious about its power but also</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">reverential about its potential for</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.759" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">supporting transformation in people</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:04.880" style="s2">thank you that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">thank you great adam you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:14.639" style="s2">question yeah hey john</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">i had a philosophical question for you</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.639" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">what are the main tenets of for vacanism</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:24.639" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know i didn&#39;t know there</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:28.639" style="s2">was such a thing um</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.639" end="00:05:31.199" style="s2">um meant the main tenets of verbatism</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.639" end="00:05:31.199" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:37.919" style="s2">ah i</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:38.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i i guess the the main</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.919" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">tennis ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.800" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">well i mean let&#39;s try in terms of sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">of traditional philosophical categories</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:46.960" style="s2">since you posed it as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:50.080" style="s2">philosophical question</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.960" end="00:05:53.360" style="s2">i suppose the main metaphysical tenets</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.080" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">would be that your metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">could try and get beyond both</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.479" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">uh a kantian and a platonic framework</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:06.319" style="s2">uh by centering on intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:08.240" style="s2">uh um as the main uh thing that unites</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:09.919" style="s2">your phenomenology and your epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.240" end="00:06:11.759" style="s2">to your metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.919" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">i think that the metaphys that your</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.759" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">epistemology should be</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">uh very oriented towards a phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">and pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">i i think it should then overlap with</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">um well i think something like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:30.319" style="s2">cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">to give us the deep interconnection</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">between our epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:37.039" style="s2">and our particular our our scientific</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">practice that is relevant to both</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.039" end="00:06:44.639" style="s2">uh epistemology and intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">um and then all of that machinery what</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">used to be called</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.360" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">ethics but i don&#39;t mean ethics in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">modern sense i mean it very much the way</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:54.160" style="s2">doe talks about it where we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.759" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">about the whole project of esthesis</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:59.120" style="s2">the whole project of spiritual exercises</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:07:01.199" style="s2">and the transformation of individuals</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.199" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">above and beyond uh other aspects</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">and helping you make moral decisions it</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.160" end="00:07:16.880" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">centered on the sets of practices</p>

<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">your pragmatic and phenomenological</p>

<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">something like an integration between</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:05.599" style="s2">did that answer your question uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">it did although can i ask a follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.599" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:10.479" style="s2">yeah you you rang true on</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.039" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">intelligibility a few times and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.479" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">distinguished it from other philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">so could you play a little more on</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">yeah so i mean this is where for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">i mean intelligibility is i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:26.960" style="s2">a a a nexus point you&#39;re thinking of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">like in a small world network</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.960" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">small world network of people&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.360" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">cognitive grammar intelligibility i</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">think is like</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:37.760" style="s2">um the central hub because it links</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">uh aspects of your phenom aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.760" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">your phenomenological experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">aspects of your conceptualization of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">um and aspects of your theorization</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">theorizing about the world together they</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">they all presuppose</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">intelligibility and you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:56.480" style="s2">there&#39;s ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of you&#39;re into a couple</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.480" end="00:09:00.560" style="s2">major choice points around this</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">one is you can go sort of the in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">modern route</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:07.920" style="s2">in kant and argue uh following</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">occam that intelligibility is purely a</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.920" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">mental property</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">um it is something imposed by the mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">on the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">um or you can go the platonic view and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">in a sense intelligibility is completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:27.200" style="s2">uh sort of um where we want to put it</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">that intelligibility is</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.200" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">something that is completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:35.440" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t want to i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:39.200" style="s2">attribute the wrong adjective here to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.440" end="00:09:40.720" style="s2">to plato so that intelligibility is in</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.200" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">some sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t have a better but something</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of a fairly abstractly</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.320" end="00:09:50.320" style="s2">existing metaphysical entity</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">um and i think what the traditions</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.320" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">pragmatism and phenomenology have</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:57.560" style="s2">brought out is</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.560" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">intelligibility is some</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">property of things</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:07.680" style="s2">real patterns of things that makes the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.680" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">act of understanding impossible for us</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:17.519" style="s2">um and that although in</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:18.880" style="s2">theoretical analysis we can separate the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.519" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">cognitive act</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.880" end="00:10:23.279" style="s2">of sense making uh from whatever those</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:26.079" style="s2">real patterns</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.279" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">are in our experience they are because</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.079" end="00:10:29.839" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">mutually in our experience they</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.839" end="00:10:33.680" style="s2">are interdependent uh and interdefining</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.680" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what the term</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">intelligibility means it means for me</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:40.560" style="s2">the point at</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.680" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">that the point of if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.560" end="00:10:45.920" style="s2">because i talk about this a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.640" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">in the series the the deepest point of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.920" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">conformity</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">between the sense-making capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">mind and the real patterns that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">found in the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.240" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">that&#39;s great thank you welcome</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">all right andre has a question uh that</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.200" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">he wants me to read can phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:06.560" style="s2">and cognitive science be implemented</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">correctly and fluently</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.560" end="00:11:10.079" style="s2">together can heidegger&#39;s phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.079" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">ideas like equipment and being ready at</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">hand be applied to further</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">to those to cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">is is that what the implication of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">last part of the question is</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">andre you&#39;re here did you want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.399" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">clarify</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">yeah well you covered a lot of it in</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">what you were just saying to um</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">adam there um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:38.240" style="s2">so i was at a talk earlier today and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:39.760" style="s2">talked about um</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.240" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">some of your ideas i&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.760" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">lecture it&#39;s from because i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">watched them all i&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">watched one um but it was like an</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">oscillation between contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">and meditation and it was called</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:54.880" style="s2">something ontology</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">and it there was an idea of um</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.880" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">using the attachment of um equipment</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">and when i saw the word equipment and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">ontology i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">in terms of hedger and things being</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.880" end="00:12:09.040" style="s2">ready to handle uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.320" end="00:12:11.120" style="s2">present hand i&#39;m wondering whether that</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">can work</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.120" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">so um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.399" end="00:12:26.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to be presumptuous sorry</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.839" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">pretentious a lot of my work is</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">actually built on work of what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:32.399" style="s2">4e cognitive science especially the work</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:35.760" style="s2">of people like</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.399" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">bert dreyfus uh gallagher</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.760" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">people like like that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">these dreyfus in particular um</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">brought heidegger into cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.240" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">in a profound way i agree with dreyfus</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:54.160" style="s2">not everybody does</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">but i think a very good case can be made</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.160" end="00:12:58.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">uh a lot of heidegger&#39;s notions um</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.320" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">especially around dozen and the presence</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">of being and other things</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:06.720" style="s2">in that constellation of ideas i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.120" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">equating them but they do form a</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.720" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">consolation</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">that a lot of what heidegger is talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">about can be understood in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:16.320" style="s2">uh relevance realization dreyfus argues</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:19.920" style="s2">specifically and it and it was precisely</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:20.959" style="s2">because he brought this heideggerian</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.920" end="00:13:22.880" style="s2">notion</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.959" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">into cognitive science that he was able</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.880" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:28.639" style="s2">uh standard computational models of mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:30.959" style="s2">and introduce what has later been called</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.639" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">the frame problem which is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.959" end="00:13:34.079" style="s2">problem of how do we zero in on relevant</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">information from all the available</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.079" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">information i think that&#39;s very much um</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:42.639" style="s2">one of the ways in which heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">intersection with cognitive sciences had</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.639" end="00:13:46.079" style="s2">a huge influence on my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">the work of gallagher and others</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.079" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">especially the people who are talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">um cognition as inherently embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">enacted and embedded</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">this of course is deeply influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">heidegger and even more so</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">by marla ponti and the phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.199" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">phenomenology of perception so the</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:12.639" style="s2">uh there are deep or influential</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">they are very active right now and i</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.639" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">think they&#39;re even foundational for</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">what i think is going to be the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.839" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:21.760" style="s2">it&#39;s already one of the most important i</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">think it will become the dominant model</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.760" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">of how you do cognitive science which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">called four e-cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">third generation cognizance so um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">why heidelgerian themes</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">uh recur throughout uh the series i have</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:36.079" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">an episode dedicated to heidegger within</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.079" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">the series</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.399" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">okay thank you very much that that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">cleared up a lot for me um and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:49.279" style="s2">thanks for filling my questions</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">thank you i think it&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.279" end="00:14:51.440" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">the last few questions are brought to</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.440" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">mind you know the role that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">these philosophers would play in in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">you know in you know there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:04.720" style="s2">you know who who have read these</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">philosophers but a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:10.399" style="s2">you know where do you see sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">philosophical reading of these deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.399" end="00:15:15.839" style="s2">thinkers as sort of required reading or</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:17.680" style="s2">and would that limit its its appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.839" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">the general public who</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.680" end="00:15:23.360" style="s2">may not be interested in in</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">reading you know these philosophers in</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.360" end="00:15:29.759" style="s2">depth or have that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">um so no i don&#39;t see it as i</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.759" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">i i don&#39;t see it i don&#39;t think people</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">have to have read uh dionysus to be good</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:38.399" style="s2">eastern orthodox christians or aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:41.759" style="s2">to be good catholics</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.399" end="00:15:45.279" style="s2">but i would also say that studying</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.759" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">a dionysus uh maximus or studying</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.279" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">uh a a augustan or aquinas will help to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">make you</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">a catholic um so i think they shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">be mandatory</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:58.079" style="s2">but they should be held up as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">reverential exemplars</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.079" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">i was hoping to model</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.120" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">to exemplify perhaps is a better word</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">um there&#39;s there there there should be</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">individuals who</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:14.959" style="s2">right this is gonna sound uh i don&#39;t i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.360" end="00:16:16.320" style="s2">not trying to set myself up but i was</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.959" end="00:16:19.279" style="s2">trying to exemplify</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.320" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">that there should be people within the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.279" end="00:16:23.120" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion who did</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">what i tried to do with awakening from</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.120" end="00:16:28.480" style="s2">the meeting crisis and the other series</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">which is act and that&#39;s kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.480" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">how i see paul vander clay and other</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">people acting it&#39;s the role</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:35.519" style="s2">you know and this is dangerous because</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:36.320" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to set up a priesthood or</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.519" end="00:16:38.639" style="s2">anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.320" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">but there are people whose role it is to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.639" end="00:16:42.480" style="s2">provide</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">good mediation between</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.480" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">the profundities of a community and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">the day-to-day life of people within</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.160" end="00:16:51.759" style="s2">that community</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">so i don&#39;t think the role of i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.759" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">think it&#39;s a mandatory</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">requirement and this is how it would</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:16:59.839" style="s2">perhaps differ from</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:00.160" style="s2">from other communities of the past i</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.839" end="00:17:02.720" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">so i&#39;m not trying to set up something</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.720" end="00:17:08.000" style="s2">like plato&#39;s academy</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">um uh that&#39;s that&#39;s not what i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.000" end="00:17:11.600" style="s2">is needed i&#39;m hoping to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">what is already happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.600" end="00:17:15.839" style="s2">which is and i i spoke on you know on</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:18.799" style="s2">wednesday i spoke at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">the movement summit to all of these all</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.799" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:22.880" style="s2">gosh i was overwhelmed by the number of</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.880" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">were there from all of these communities</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:28.880" style="s2">of practices around a movement and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:30.480" style="s2">embodiment and mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.880" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">they hadn&#39;t read all this philosophy but</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.480" end="00:17:34.160" style="s2">i gave a talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:35.600" style="s2">how cognitive science and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.160" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">philosophical framework</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.600" end="00:17:43.280" style="s2">can really help them to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">and access and enhance this practice and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.280" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">build a community</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.320" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">and it was the reception i got at that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:49.760" style="s2">talk was overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.840" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">so these people didn&#39;t feel like oh they</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.760" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">need to go out and read all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">but if it&#39;s if it&#39;s done well and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">seemed to have been done well by</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.240" end="00:18:00.080" style="s2">the response i get you know and what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">can do</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.080" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">is part with right we can i see that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">there should be some people</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">uh this sounds so self-promotional but</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the role i see myself in is</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">perhaps and i would hope there would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.720" end="00:18:15.120" style="s2">other people would have that role</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">of doing that translation and making it</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">viable</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">and inspirational and edifying to people</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">who are trying bottom up to build the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">religion that is not a religion</p>

<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">because i feel it has been sidelined</p>

<p begin="00:19:31.360" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">let me talk about it a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">bernie i have to talk for quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:39.440" style="s2">a little bit uh self-referentially i</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">hope that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.440" end="00:19:45.360" style="s2">um i sort of not commented on</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">this very directly not because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.360" end="00:19:49.440" style="s2">not making an important point</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">but i&#39;ve been very concerned about any</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.440" end="00:19:55.120" style="s2">bias that i might</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">care um what do i mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.120" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">there&#39;s aspects of this movement</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:04.400" style="s2">that are difficult for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:05.840" style="s2">i&#39;m going to invoke an important</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.400" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">distinction here between that weber</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.840" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">makes between the manifest</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.559" end="00:20:13.440" style="s2">example of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">the manifest function is what any social</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.440" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">organization or movement a group of</p>

<p begin="00:20:32.240" end="00:20:36.400" style="s2">was bureaucracy um so bureaucracy of</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">concerned about a lot of the manifest</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">goals</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">um that i i&#39;m deeply sympathetic to them</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.480" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">i do i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">that the police have been overly</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:19.200" style="s2">militarized since the patriot act</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">totally</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.200" end="00:21:22.799" style="s2">um do i think that there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">dirty tricks that are being played</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.799" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">against uh marginalized groups by you</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">know uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">voter suppression and and media</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.559" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:32.880" style="s2">totally and i think that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">those are very important issues</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.880" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a little too simplistic to</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:39.120" style="s2">gather them under the term racism</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">but that is nevertheless an important</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.120" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">part of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">however so while while that manifests</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">part of it has</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">pretty much my unqualified support</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">blatant function is very very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">because the latent function feels like</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:54.159" style="s2">the fundamentalist christianity i grew</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.520" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">up in</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.159" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">that traumatized me i have people</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:00.720" style="s2">telling me</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">that i&#39;m guilty of an original sin that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.720" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">i did not personally commit but that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:06.240" style="s2">committed by my ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:08.559" style="s2">and that there&#39;s nothing i can do about</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.240" end="00:22:10.640" style="s2">it and any of my attempts to overcome it</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.559" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">are actually going to be undermined</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.640" end="00:22:14.320" style="s2">by it because it&#39;s so pervasive and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">profound in my psyche</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.320" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">and that the only proper thing i should</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:21.280" style="s2">do is be endlessly contrite</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.559" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">and guilty until some external power</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.280" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">pronounces me acceptable for reasons</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">that i know not of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">and so that that is very very</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.520" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">i&#39;ve sort of recused myself because that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">made me sort of angry and upset by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:37.280" style="s2">demonstrations</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:38.640" style="s2">not because of their goals which i i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">already said i think are there</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.640" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">are very important and laudable noble</p>

<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:46.720" style="s2">but what you might call the religious</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">aspects of these things</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2">been very difficult for me to step away</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:54.320" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.320" end="00:23:01.679" style="s2">therefore to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">there might be other people who are in</p>

<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">participating in these movements for</p>

<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.720" style="s2">of it has been going on and people have</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:34.960" style="s2">better than existential threats and i</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:36.480" style="s2">like it i&#39;m going to start using that</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">that there is a proper religious</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.480" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">response</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:41.919" style="s2">to the extinction threats like like</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:45.600" style="s2">ecological disaster</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.919" end="00:24:49.039" style="s2">and i think we could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.600" end="00:24:52.320" style="s2">address the latent function that has</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.039" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">made the topic</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.320" end="00:24:55.840" style="s2">of these demonstrations so super salient</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:24:57.440" style="s2">to people</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.840" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">i think the religion that&#39;s not religion</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.440" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">and what we&#39;re trying to do here is</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">exactly the right strategy</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:04.320" style="s2">for answering that i think if this is if</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:05.919" style="s2">people are honest</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.320" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">maybe they won&#39;t be i don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.919" end="00:25:11.520" style="s2">this we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:15.039" style="s2">say that there are other</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">issues that are as morally valuable as</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:19.279" style="s2">important and important as dealing</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:20.480" style="s2">with racism and and the consolation of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.279" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">things around it</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.480" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">but also that can be can have a properly</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:30.240" style="s2">religious response to it but i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">perhaps then a better response to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.240" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">we more carefully and comprehensively</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">and in a confidently scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">rigorous manner</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:41.679" style="s2">cultivate the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.679" end="00:25:47.200" style="s2">is that at all helpful barney um</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">yeah let me just throw something real</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.200" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">quick here</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:51.520" style="s2">um i&#39;ve been working with faith groups</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">on climate collapse</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.520" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">and then when covet hit and george floyd</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">protest hit</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.720" end="00:25:58.240" style="s2">they suddenly are besieged by white</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">guilt</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.240" end="00:26:02.480" style="s2">and besties by the breakup of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:05.279" style="s2">institution financially</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.480" end="00:26:05.520" style="s2">and they&#39;re asking for orientation and</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.279" end="00:26:07.520" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.520" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">and my orientation is to provide</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.520" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">something that it can</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2">further develop to also orient</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:13.760" style="s2">themselves towards climate collapse</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.720" end="00:26:16.720" style="s2">which is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:18.159" style="s2">the heart of what i&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.720" end="00:26:20.960" style="s2">so i was hoping</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.159" end="00:26:22.159" style="s2">um uh so if another thing i want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:24.960" style="s2">throw out is it could</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.159" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">one possibility plausibility is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.960" end="00:26:28.400" style="s2">failure of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.840" end="00:26:29.840" style="s2">meta assimilation and meta accommodation</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.400" end="00:26:32.159" style="s2">in past practices</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.840" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">that needs to be revived and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.159" end="00:26:36.880" style="s2">know whether that is a good enough</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">of a good starting point</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.880" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">i think it is but i think the point</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.320" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">if people are so if they&#39;re already in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:47.679" style="s2">religious framework maybe remind them</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:48.480" style="s2">and maybe this goes towards what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.679" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">just saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.480" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">about med assimilation and meta</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:54.400" style="s2">accommodation guilt is</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">ultimately a frame breaking strategy</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.400" end="00:26:57.200" style="s2">therefore it is necessary for insight</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:26:59.360" style="s2">and transformation</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.200" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">the guilt alone is insufficient you also</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.360" end="00:27:03.919" style="s2">need a frame making strategy</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s where love that&#39;s where love</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.919" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">especially agapic love</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">is is supposed to take the lead and if</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">and i mean i mean one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">themes running through</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">especially it&#39;s i mean especially</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">prevalent in christianity</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:22.480" style="s2">is but ultimately the love should be</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">more important to you than the guilt the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.480" end="00:27:25.039" style="s2">guilt is ultimately supposed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:27.039" style="s2">frame breaking</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.039" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">that affords a new and more profound</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.039" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">kind of frame making</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.520" end="00:27:33.760" style="s2">about when you&#39;re talking about uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:35.120" style="s2">the the meta assimilation and they met</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.760" end="00:27:38.320" style="s2">accommodation</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.120" end="00:27:42.640" style="s2">and so i think the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:45.679" style="s2">people and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.640" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">community that&#39;s offering not only just</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.679" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">frame breaking strategies</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">frame making strategies and make them</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">scalable and attractive to other people</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.679" end="00:27:56.799" style="s2">i think is that&#39;s a way of being viable</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.799" end="00:28:01.600" style="s2">that&#39;s quite what you want i would say</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">for people who are staying within</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.600" end="00:28:04.720" style="s2">their faith community i would remind</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">them that</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.720" end="00:28:09.919" style="s2">there is this deep tradition and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.000" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a constant refrain</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.919" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">that both of these have to be held</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:18.480" style="s2">guilt the concern i have is when guilt</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">and anger</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.480" end="00:28:22.720" style="s2">especially when they come together in</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">outrage they become exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.720" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">um they are framed they are merely frame</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">breaking</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">and they tend to remove people from</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">rational reflection</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">uh because of the way they trigger very</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.080" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">primitive processing in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">so we could perhaps remind people and</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:43.600" style="s2">wake them up to</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">there was always sort of a stereoscopic</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.600" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">uh within the religious traditions it</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:49.919" style="s2">was not always or never was supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:52.080" style="s2">be just guilt</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.919" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">it was also supposed to be about love</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:56.880" style="s2">and that love was supposed to give</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:28:58.960" style="s2">people a comprehensive way of making the</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.880" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">new frame that replaced</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.960" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">the frame that was broken in the frame</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:04.399" style="s2">breaking</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.480" end="00:29:06.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit more helpful to you</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.399" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">yes yes thank you very much yes and</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.799" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2">i was going to suggest that you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">covet 19 and george floyd protesters</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:14.880" style="s2">just hang over</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">from this um from just the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.880" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">matter assimilation and accommodation</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">from the past</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">well i mean i think i think kobit really</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:24.880" style="s2">exacerbated</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">um the meaning crisis and i was saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">at the very beginning we were going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:29.279" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:30.880" style="s2">large-scale tsunami sort of mental</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.279" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">health issues and</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:34.080" style="s2">people really trying to do everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:37.120" style="s2">they can to ramp up meaning</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.080" end="00:29:38.799" style="s2">i think that&#39;s part of what&#39;s going on i</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:41.200" style="s2">also do think that there</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.799" end="00:29:42.559" style="s2">are legitimate like i said i think the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.200" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">manifest issues</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.559" end="00:29:46.320" style="s2">need to be addressed i don&#39;t comment on</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.480" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">those uh because</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.320" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">um that&#39;s i that&#39;s not my rule um</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:56.399" style="s2">but where i can comment is what i</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">what i think is the degree to which this</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.399" end="00:30:00.880" style="s2">overlaps with</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:03.039" style="s2">meaning crisis may actually make it</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.880" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">worse in some ways the thing that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.039" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">seeing now and it&#39;s only anecdotal</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:10.399" style="s2">but as as the the high</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:13.279" style="s2">um the demonstrations are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.399" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">wane people are getting a rebound effect</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.279" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">right and and so meaning crisis is now</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:19.120" style="s2">striking them as even worse</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">than it was before all of this because</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.120" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">now now what do they do now what do they</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">do</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:35.279" style="s2">said charitably i</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.000" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">i mean i i&#39;m very torn about this issue</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.279" end="00:30:37.640" style="s2">for the reasons i&#39;ve tried to describe</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s why i was more</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.640" end="00:30:40.480" style="s2">autobiographical</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.880" end="00:30:42.320" style="s2">than i normally am because i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.480" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">people i want people to understand</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.320" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">that i i i don&#39;t i&#39;m not i don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:47.840" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">response to this i&#39;m trying to work this</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.840" end="00:30:50.159" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">precisely because i think there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.159" end="00:30:54.880" style="s2">much uh like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:57.039" style="s2">it feel and i mean this in in the proper</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.880" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">sense it feels kafka s to me</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.039" end="00:31:04.000" style="s2">this tension between the manifest and</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">the latent</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.000" end="00:31:09.120" style="s2">okay one issue that uh strong</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">strong and i actually have been debating</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">a bit is</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:13.760" style="s2">you know how to address these issues</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">between the left people on the left and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.760" end="00:31:16.480" style="s2">people in the right who don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.480" end="00:31:19.919" style="s2">particularly i mean there&#39;s those on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:21.279" style="s2">left who seem not</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.919" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">you know a lot a lot of people not</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.279" end="00:31:25.039" style="s2">willing to discuss do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">my suggestion was you know a dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.039" end="00:31:28.720" style="s2">type approach and finding those who are</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:31.679" style="s2">willing to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.720" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">to to talk and and sort of demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.679" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:35.519" style="s2">and you know to show that we can have</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:38.399" style="s2">those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.519" end="00:31:39.120" style="s2">oh i mean that&#39;s part of the logos i</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.399" end="00:31:40.880" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.120" end="00:31:42.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve had i&#39;ve had and i keep reminding</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.880" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">people is i see dialogos</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.880" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">um actually within a whole pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">program</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:49.120" style="s2">but so there&#39;d be there&#39;d be practices</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">that led</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.120" end="00:31:52.399" style="s2">into it and you know and edward rush has</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:55.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">um the empathy circling and what he has</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:31:59.279" style="s2">explicitly done</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.720" end="00:32:01.360" style="s2">repeatedly is got people who are</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.279" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">hardline democrats and republicans</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.360" end="00:32:05.600" style="s2">go through that practice and what it</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">does very reliably according to him</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.600" end="00:32:09.360" style="s2">and i think he&#39;s being very honest um is</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">it moves people</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.360" end="00:32:13.679" style="s2">from sort of bad faith adversarial into</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:15.279" style="s2">good faith dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.679" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">in which people both sides get</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.279" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">rehumanized a commitment to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:22.159" style="s2">possibility of a shared process</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">starts to come into the fore so i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.159" end="00:32:26.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.039" end="00:32:28.159" style="s2">an empty hypothesis i think we already</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.000" end="00:32:31.039" style="s2">have some it&#39;s i get it it&#39;s it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.159" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of ethnographic and anecdotal</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.039" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">information but we do have empirical</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:36.000" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.120" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">that this is in fact an efficacious uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.000" end="00:32:39.120" style="s2">uh possibility</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">i think it would be good if people on</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">the left and people on the right</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">sort of see that they might have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">complimentary relationship opponent</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.760" end="00:32:49.360" style="s2">i i think pete both sides could</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:51.679" style="s2">acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.360" end="00:32:53.039" style="s2">what they&#39;re not not what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.679" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">they&#39;re very good at saying what they</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.039" end="00:32:56.399" style="s2">make salient</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:32:57.760" style="s2">they need to do is maybe talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.399" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">they background</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.760" end="00:33:01.440" style="s2">i think the right tends to background</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:04.640" style="s2">the fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.440" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">human beings are are beset by fate that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.640" end="00:33:07.919" style="s2">we are small mortal creatures that can</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.640" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">be overwhelmed by</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.919" end="00:33:12.960" style="s2">circumstances that we we need to take</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:15.279" style="s2">that into account and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.960" end="00:33:17.120" style="s2">um band together to help people when</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.279" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">they are overwhelmed by fate</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.120" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">i think the left and that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:23.120" style="s2">right often falls into cruelty because</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">it forgets that i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.120" end="00:33:27.440" style="s2">i think the left tends to forget that</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">nevertheless although human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.440" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">beset by fate and they are mortals</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:33.519" style="s2">um they are responsible for virtue</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">they&#39;re responsible for the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.519" end="00:33:38.480" style="s2">of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:40.799" style="s2">and and that human beings also need a</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.480" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">a an environment that challenges them</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.799" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">and demands that they cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">virtue in a reliable and systematic way</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s why i think the left tends to</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">fall into</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">um self-righteousness as it&#39;s besetting</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:55.120" style="s2">vice</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting for me is how the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.120" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">seminal sages like jesus or the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">always criticize these two together they</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:04.640" style="s2">always criticize</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.519" end="00:34:06.880" style="s2">cruelty and self-righteousness i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.640" end="00:34:07.760" style="s2">that&#39;s important i&#39;ve taken that as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:11.200" style="s2">signal</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.760" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">um lesson about well maybe we need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.200" end="00:34:15.119" style="s2">to sort of look at this in a much more</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">fashion um and that&#39;s where that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">try to be i try to avoid um</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:23.919" style="s2">being specifically political i&#39;m happy</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:25.919" style="s2">when people</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.919" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">and i like i think zack stein for this</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.919" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">when people want to do what</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:30.879" style="s2">he i think rightly calls metapolitical</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:31.599" style="s2">discourse which is what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.879" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.599" end="00:34:35.760" style="s2">when we try and talk about what are the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:38.639" style="s2">conditions of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.760" end="00:34:40.240" style="s2">that would bring about efficacious</p>

<p begin="00:34:40.240" end="00:34:48.560" style="s2">and afford good opponent processing</p>

<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">of intelligibility as the bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">tea information and</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">information and osteoporosis physical</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">ontology with respect to the formal</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:52.400" style="s2">cause</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:55.119" style="s2">i couldn&#39;t help but notice that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.400" end="00:35:56.720" style="s2">parallels of that bridge and the bridge</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.119" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">in the agent&#39;s arena relationship as</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.720" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">well as relevant realization</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">and transactivity were the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:06.240" style="s2">with this framing your control of</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:07.920" style="s2">intelligibility as the norm of norms is</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.240" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">not all that surprising</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.920" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">and i believe that it does a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:12.560" style="s2">explain your endorsement of spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:13.760" style="s2">specifically his views on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.560" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">neoplatonic ascent</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.760" end="00:36:18.000" style="s2">and the notion that ethics is about</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:21.119" style="s2">right relation to the ultimate principle</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.000" end="00:36:23.040" style="s2">however as much as you like platinus&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:24.560" style="s2">vertical axis in terms of ontological</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.040" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">levels you acknowledge that he has</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.560" end="00:36:27.440" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">of nothing valuable to say about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">horizontal temporal app</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:34.240" style="s2">my proposal is this intelligibility is</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:36.320" style="s2">the norm of the vertical axis</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.240" end="00:36:38.560" style="s2">but agape is the norm of the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.320" end="00:36:38.560" style="s2">axis</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:44.320" style="s2">sorry i&#39;m saying yeah because i i</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.480" end="00:36:46.079" style="s2">prefer interrupting but i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.320" end="00:36:46.960" style="s2">this is one of the moves that is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">central</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">um in christianity what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">right now but please i interrupted right</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:55.119" style="s2">i was just making non-linguistic noises</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:57.280" style="s2">of approval</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.119" end="00:36:58.480" style="s2">okay yeah it cuts out so i couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.280" end="00:37:01.040" style="s2">quite catch it sorry about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.480" end="00:37:02.880" style="s2">anyway this would make intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.040" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">something like the primary principle and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.880" end="00:37:07.359" style="s2">agape by contrast the ultimate principle</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:08.480" style="s2">and yeah so that i just want to get you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:11.920" style="s2">are you with me</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">yeah i think so i i i yeah i think so in</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.920" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">so far</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:20.160" style="s2">yeah yes um the primary principle</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">in that you have different ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:25.359" style="s2">um being is coming to being so</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">uh the vertical with uh platinus is very</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.359" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">much ontological</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">um and non-temporal but the agape as you</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:33.839" style="s2">said is</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">uh through time and it&#39;s it&#39;s in that</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.839" end="00:37:39.599" style="s2">sense historically creative</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:41.040" style="s2">um yeah and that&#39;s an element that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.599" end="00:37:42.960" style="s2">missing from spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.040" end="00:37:45.119" style="s2">i see where you&#39;re going with this the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.960" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">the the issue that i have</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.119" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">is people see hegel as correcting that</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">error but i think hegel he really</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">diminishes the vertical dimension</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:56.880" style="s2">and the aspect of personal</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">transformation that is still central in</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.880" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">spinoza gets lost in hegel</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.800" end="00:38:06.000" style="s2">um so um yeah it would be to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:08.720" style="s2">beyond spinoza and bring something back</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.000" end="00:38:10.320" style="s2">but not go the way that hegel went with</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.320" end="00:38:14.880" style="s2">am i am i sort of seeing what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">seeing yeah can i can i go further</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.880" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">because i think this might speak to what</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.240" end="00:38:20.160" style="s2">you just said</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">okay so i would also stipulate that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.160" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">bridge of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:25.680" style="s2">extends between the poles of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">propositional and the perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.680" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">while the bridge of agape extends</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:30.079" style="s2">between the poles of the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:31.359" style="s2">in the procedural</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.079" end="00:38:32.960" style="s2">if you grant the notion that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.359" end="00:38:34.880" style="s2">vertical axis is static and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.960" end="00:38:36.480" style="s2">horizontal axis is dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.880" end="00:38:38.320" style="s2">then intelligibility speaks to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.480" end="00:38:39.520" style="s2">ground of being and agape speaks to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.320" end="00:38:41.920" style="s2">pinnacle of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:42.800" style="s2">or to put it down sorry or to put it</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.920" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">another way</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.800" end="00:38:46.320" style="s2">i propose to you that this brings true</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">structure and good function</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.320" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">into beautiful organizations it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:52.240" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:53.440" style="s2">i like it um the thing i&#39;m worried about</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.240" end="00:38:54.720" style="s2">wondering about though is</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.440" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.720" end="00:38:58.880" style="s2">so you said that agape is about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:39:02.079" style="s2">participatory and the procedural</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.880" end="00:39:04.400" style="s2">but and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.079" end="00:39:04.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.040" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">how do you get the the affect that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:14.560" style="s2">part that is central to agape because</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:15.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a very affect is a perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.560" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">thing right</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.680" end="00:39:21.280" style="s2">um it&#39;s about modifying yourself i i</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know um can you can you speak a</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.280" end="00:39:23.760" style="s2">bit more about epic then i could maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.960" end="00:39:27.599" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.760" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">translate it so my worry here is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:31.040" style="s2">speaking orthogonally</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:32.320" style="s2">you may be speaking about this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.040" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.320" end="00:39:35.760" style="s2">a metaphysical mapping and i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">about it in terms of a causal</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.760" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">relationship between cognitive processes</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">so take that into consideration but my</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:44.880" style="s2">my but what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:45.839" style="s2">so agape is obviously a motivational</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">state and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.839" end="00:39:50.560" style="s2">as i&#39;ve repeatedly said of it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:52.640" style="s2">emotion or a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.560" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">it&#39;s an existential mode but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.640" end="00:39:57.440" style="s2">affective it right</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:58.960" style="s2">it it motivates you it arouses you it</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.440" end="00:40:01.119" style="s2">directly shapes your salience</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:04.720" style="s2">landscaping it affords sophism</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.119" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">um etc so um and i take</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.720" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">those to be uh properly perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">experiences those are</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">alterations of the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.839" end="00:40:14.319" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">is getting an optimal grip on a</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.319" end="00:40:19.040" style="s2">situation that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:20.000" style="s2">affect in general does right is it it it</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.040" end="00:40:22.240" style="s2">reshapes your</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:23.440" style="s2">salience landscape and help your optimal</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.240" end="00:40:25.200" style="s2">gripping</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.440" end="00:40:26.640" style="s2">yeah okay so is it possible that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.200" end="00:40:29.760" style="s2">have a perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.640" end="00:40:31.520" style="s2">um disposition towards affect but that</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.760" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">the affect is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.520" end="00:40:34.720" style="s2">uh it comes from the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">rather than the perspective is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.720" end="00:40:40.240" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">uh it could be i mean it could be that</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.240" end="00:40:46.800" style="s2">um the difficulty is and this isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:47.599" style="s2">my work this is redfield and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.800" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.599" end="00:40:51.599" style="s2">they see that participatory is creating</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:55.040" style="s2">affordances</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.599" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">and then the the perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.040" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">selects the ones that are effectively</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:02.400" style="s2">salient or significant</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.200" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">and and so and so affect</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.400" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">is basically uh like i was proposing to</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">you is actually a translation between</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:14.400" style="s2">participatory affordance um and</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:14.400" style="s2">perspectival salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.800" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ll need to think about that but</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">fortunately there&#39;s a recording so then</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:20.800" style="s2">i&#39;ll go over it very very slowly and</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:23.599" style="s2">google and whatnot and see what i come</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.800" end="00:41:24.800" style="s2">up with sure so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.599" end="00:41:26.720" style="s2">you might want to take a look at the</p>

<p begin="00:45:46.240" end="00:45:48.839" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:50.560" style="s2">the word that came up for me was</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.839" end="00:45:54.000" style="s2">stereologia as</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.560" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">an analogy to stereoscopy you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.000" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">you&#39;re able to see in 3d and depth</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">perception</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:00.960" style="s2">through the overlap of of two single</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">eyes</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.960" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">so stereology so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:10.319" style="s2">notion of knowledge or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">that arises out of two people meeting</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.319" end="00:46:15.119" style="s2">and and creating that something that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:18.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to describe</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.119" end="00:46:19.119" style="s2">uh um dialogue what do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.000" end="00:46:21.760" style="s2">that stereology</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.119" end="00:46:22.160" style="s2">stereology in english but going back to</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.760" end="00:46:25.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:28.400" style="s2">greek roots stereology would be a</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.280" end="00:46:29.359" style="s2">coin for that something what do you</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.400" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">think about that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.359" end="00:46:33.440" style="s2">i think that&#39;s very cool um because we</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:34.720" style="s2">actually talk about the phenomena that</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.440" end="00:46:38.000" style="s2">emerges</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.720" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">as the weak term uh logos or the german</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.000" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">term geist</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:42.800" style="s2">so logos of course is part of the word</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">that you&#39;re coining there</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.800" end="00:46:46.800" style="s2">um so that is actually i i like that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:50.000" style="s2">think that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.800" end="00:46:52.240" style="s2">um talk to chris about that because</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.000" end="00:46:56.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.240" end="00:46:58.000" style="s2">um you get uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.240" end="00:46:59.440" style="s2">it in fact people sometimes even</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.000" end="00:47:01.440" style="s2">phenomenologically report</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.440" end="00:47:02.960" style="s2">they feel like you not only have their</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.440" end="00:47:04.800" style="s2">own perspective but they have</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.960" end="00:47:06.000" style="s2">another person&#39;s perspective right</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.800" end="00:47:08.640" style="s2">beside them</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.000" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">almost like stereoscopic vision um when</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.640" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">you when they&#39;re doing these practices</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:15.040" style="s2">that&#39;s cool i i like that all right</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.760" end="00:47:17.359" style="s2">thank you great thank you for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.040" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">feedback just a name it&#39;s not the names</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.359" end="00:47:21.839" style="s2">it&#39;s the practice that matters</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:23.440" style="s2">yeah but but but naming things well i</p>

<p begin="00:48:31.280" end="00:48:34.960" style="s2">i could bring to bear to actually talk</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.920" end="00:48:37.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.960" end="00:48:38.480" style="s2">aspects and dimensions of enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.760" end="00:48:41.839" style="s2">experience</p>

<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:48:59.680" style="s2">a buddhist interpretation enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.079" end="00:49:03.119" style="s2">is finding so much resonance</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.680" end="00:49:03.599" style="s2">with a lot of this emerging cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.119" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.599" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">i found that very encouraging yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">i would suggest a public dialogue</p>

<p begin="00:50:04.559" end="00:50:09.119" style="s2">uh helping us out</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:11.599" style="s2">um i i&#39;m trying to finish up a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.119" end="00:50:14.160" style="s2">projects but uh the next project on my</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.599" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">list to sort of tackle in parallel with</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.160" end="00:50:17.599" style="s2">a much larger and possibly impossible</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:20.240" style="s2">project is</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.599" end="00:50:22.559" style="s2">figuring out sort of how to divide up</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.240" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">your ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.559" end="00:50:26.640" style="s2">and figuring out this whole integration</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:27.599" style="s2">issue i know we&#39;ve talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.640" end="00:50:31.680" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.599" end="00:50:34.079" style="s2">um and then um it&#39;s sort of like well</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:36.240" style="s2">how how would you divide up the ecology</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.079" end="00:50:39.200" style="s2">of practices it strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.240" end="00:50:39.760" style="s2">you could do something like uh movement</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">versus</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:46.160" style="s2">mental only versus uh things that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:46.720" style="s2">are integrated into your daily life</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.160" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.720" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">more on the mindfulness scale um or you</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">could do something around</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:56.319" style="s2">say the four types of knowing um</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">which is not my favorite model anymore</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.319" end="00:50:59.040" style="s2">for reasons that will become apparent</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:01.839" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.040" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">um and and so i&#39;m just trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.839" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">out what the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:06.800" style="s2">sort of the i guess the different</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:09.040" style="s2">methods of dividing up the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.800" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">practices might might look like</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.040" end="00:51:13.119" style="s2">because i&#39;d like to start to do that so</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:14.319" style="s2">that people can sort of grasp on to and</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.119" end="00:51:15.920" style="s2">figure out which ones</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.319" end="00:51:17.359" style="s2">like if i&#39;m doing these two i don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.920" end="00:51:19.040" style="s2">this one sort of a thing maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.359" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">if that&#39;s even possible so i want your</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.040" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">thoughts on that if i could get them</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:25.040" style="s2">yeah so my thoughts on that are going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:28.400" style="s2">be incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.040" end="00:51:30.160" style="s2">and unsatisfying um because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.400" end="00:51:31.760" style="s2">there&#39;s been proposals and i&#39;ve wanted</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.160" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">to work with other people on this before</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.760" end="00:51:36.960" style="s2">and i&#39;m happy to undertake it</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:40.480" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to come up with such</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.960" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">a schematization um and</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.480" end="00:51:44.160" style="s2">the the couple times i&#39;ve tried it the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:48.079" style="s2">projects have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.160" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">um collapsed they they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.079" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2">they didn&#39;t keep going um so</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.839" end="00:51:55.440" style="s2">what i&#39;ve been doing now uh to try and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">give people guidance and you know this</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.440" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">from from the sang is i&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:51:59.760" style="s2">to get sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:02.240" style="s2">people design principles about the you</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.760" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">know relationships of complementarity</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.240" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">and layering and linking um i</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:09.520" style="s2">i take your point to be well said that</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:13.599" style="s2">unless people need</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.520" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">something more categorical and how</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.599" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">they put together an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:20.240" style="s2">practices so</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">i am happy to uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:24.079" style="s2">enter into this discussion with people</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">who are</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.079" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">doing it um and it might be that we want</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">to talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">and i people are doing it bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:36.480" style="s2">then we can put hopefully i can bring</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:38.960" style="s2">some good cog side of bear upon it</p>

<p begin="00:53:18.319" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">design principles</p>

<p begin="00:54:08.559" end="00:54:14.480" style="s2">the method of um</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.920" end="00:54:16.000" style="s2">memorizing psychology in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.480" end="00:54:17.359" style="s2">four ways of knowing is probably not a</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.000" end="00:54:17.760" style="s2">good method i tend to agree with you on</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.359" end="00:54:19.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.760" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t think the four ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.119" end="00:54:25.599" style="s2">should be ignored i think there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:27.440" style="s2">important aspects i do yeah um right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.599" end="00:54:29.440" style="s2">the design questions there&#39;s design</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.440" end="00:54:31.599" style="s2">questions then there&#39;s questions</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.440" end="00:54:32.480" style="s2">of you know how does cognition work</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.599" end="00:54:35.440" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s questions about you know and</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.440" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">i mean this in</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:43.839" style="s2">strong sense of the practicality of this</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:45.359" style="s2">um because uh like</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.839" end="00:54:47.119" style="s2">we want this to be very flexible and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.359" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">scalable for people</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:51.599" style="s2">um and so and we don&#39;t want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">we definitely want it to be pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.599" end="00:54:56.880" style="s2">and not homogeneous um</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.839" end="00:54:58.079" style="s2">so guess i i&#39;m basically saying what my</p>

<p begin="00:56:32.559" end="00:56:36.880" style="s2">will allow for people</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.480" end="00:56:38.000" style="s2">or afford people a chance to to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.880" end="00:56:41.200" style="s2">communicate</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.000" end="00:56:42.799" style="s2">to articulate and like to develop some</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.200" end="00:56:45.200" style="s2">sort of community toss perhaps</p>

<p begin="00:56:52.960" end="00:56:55.200" style="s2">a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:56.960" style="s2">people here some people who i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.200" end="00:56:59.920" style="s2">think have been here before</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.960" end="00:57:01.680" style="s2">uh to talk about the your the lessons in</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.920" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">your meditation class</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.680" end="00:57:05.920" style="s2">are are quickly becoming i think an</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:09.280" style="s2">essential corollary to your</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.920" end="00:57:11.040" style="s2">awakening from the meeting crisis uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.280" end="00:57:12.880" style="s2">what was the intent yeah maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.040" end="00:57:14.960" style="s2">just talk talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.880" end="00:57:17.280" style="s2">about that for to introduce it to people</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.960" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">who aren&#39;t who aren&#39;t aware</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.280" end="00:57:20.720" style="s2">oh so the awakening from the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.680" end="00:57:23.119" style="s2">crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.720" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">uh philosophical right in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:27.920" style="s2">cognite scientific and then it&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">to give um</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.920" end="00:57:32.960" style="s2">a a historical and scientific</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">theoretical explanation</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.960" end="00:57:40.319" style="s2">uh of the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.960" end="00:57:43.680" style="s2">it&#39;s historical and structural features</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.319" end="00:57:46.799" style="s2">and then also propose what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.680" end="00:57:50.480" style="s2">cognitive and existential individual</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.799" end="00:57:53.359" style="s2">and you know practices uh could</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.480" end="00:57:54.960" style="s2">uh potentially address the issues in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.359" end="00:57:56.799" style="s2">meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.960" end="00:57:58.000" style="s2">what i did not do in awakening for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.799" end="00:58:01.599" style="s2">meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.000" end="00:58:05.040" style="s2">was actually afford people the chance to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.599" end="00:58:06.559" style="s2">start to train practices</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.040" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">and to start to build an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:08.720" style="s2">practices and this is why the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:11.119" style="s2">with mark</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:12.480" style="s2">i think i mean all of the discussions</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.119" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">here have been very important</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.480" end="00:58:15.760" style="s2">but the discussion that i had with mark</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:19.040" style="s2">just now i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.760" end="00:58:20.160" style="s2">is is the most pressing of that issue</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.040" end="00:58:22.480" style="s2">that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.160" end="00:58:23.359" style="s2">get under further discussion but what</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.480" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">happens on</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.359" end="00:58:29.599" style="s2">what happens in the senga</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.400" end="00:58:31.040" style="s2">is we meet every weekday morning at 9 30</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.599" end="00:58:34.799" style="s2">and i&#39;m teaching people</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.040" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">uh uh meditative practices</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.799" end="00:58:38.079" style="s2">contemplative practices building</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:41.520" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.079" end="00:58:43.280" style="s2">um uh like i said practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.520" end="00:58:44.960" style="s2">complementary relationships linking</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.280" end="00:58:46.160" style="s2">practices like lectio divina and</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.960" end="00:58:48.319" style="s2">chanting</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:49.200" style="s2">or practices that integrate movement and</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.319" end="00:58:51.119" style="s2">mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.200" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">like uh the tai chi walking that i</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.119" end="00:58:56.880" style="s2">taught today and so i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:59.920" style="s2">directly teaching people uh um</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.880" end="00:59:03.040" style="s2">practices that are relevant</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.920" end="00:59:05.440" style="s2">to awakening from the meeting crisis um</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.040" end="00:59:07.280" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to exemplify them trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.440" end="00:59:10.559" style="s2">example i&#39;m trying to afford</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.280" end="00:59:13.040" style="s2">um a community i think a very good</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.559" end="00:59:16.160" style="s2">community i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.040" end="00:59:18.400" style="s2">community is wonderful in which</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.160" end="00:59:19.599" style="s2">they can cultivate uh an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.400" end="00:59:23.920" style="s2">these practices</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.599" end="00:59:27.599" style="s2">um and get feedback encouragement</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.920" end="00:59:29.119" style="s2">um uh from other people so yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.599" end="00:59:32.720" style="s2">you&#39;re exactly right brad i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.119" end="00:59:34.240" style="s2">that um that</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.720" end="00:59:36.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t like the word practical because</p>

<p begin="00:59:36.720" end="00:59:44.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it it it&#39;s slightly pejorative</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.760" end="00:59:46.319" style="s2">um so i i i often say practicable</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.880" end="00:59:49.119" style="s2">which is an ugly sounding word so it</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.319" end="00:59:53.599" style="s2">won&#39;t get confused um</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.119" end="00:59:55.280" style="s2">but i think the uh the morning classes</p>

<p begin="00:59:58.079" end="01:00:04.640" style="s2">are are the practicable component</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.200" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">that is as important and as necessary</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.640" end="01:00:08.480" style="s2">as the theoretical component that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.960" end="01:00:10.720" style="s2">presented in awakening from the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.480" end="01:00:13.280" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.720" end="01:00:15.200" style="s2">exactly and and like you said so so we</p>

<p begin="01:00:44.400" end="01:00:48.319" style="s2">you okay for a few more or</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.400" end="01:00:49.760" style="s2">how are you but i want to i want to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.319" end="01:00:51.839" style="s2">one more thing to what you just said</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.760" end="01:00:53.359" style="s2">because in one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.839" end="01:00:55.599" style="s2">arguments</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.359" end="01:00:57.280" style="s2">i returned to several times in awakening</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.599" end="01:01:02.079" style="s2">from the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.280" end="01:01:06.160" style="s2">is that you need to reclaim</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.079" end="01:01:08.720" style="s2">um the claim</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.160" end="01:01:09.760" style="s2">that there are many truths that are only</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.720" end="01:01:13.440" style="s2">accessible to us</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.760" end="01:01:16.640" style="s2">in transformation that there are truths</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.440" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">of transformation and that</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.640" end="01:01:23.680" style="s2">for much of what it&#39;s even to be known</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:25.040" style="s2">in order to properly awakened from the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.680" end="01:01:28.160" style="s2">meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.040" end="01:01:30.799" style="s2">not be known without also undertaking</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.160" end="01:01:34.799" style="s2">the important transformation</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.799" end="01:01:37.119" style="s2">that is aligned up to</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.799" end="01:01:38.079" style="s2">those things that need to be known and</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.119" end="01:01:41.200" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.079" end="01:01:42.559" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a deeper issue</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.200" end="01:01:44.160" style="s2">secondly i just wanted to point out one</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.559" end="01:01:46.400" style="s2">more thing brad and then i&#39;ll i&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.160" end="01:01:48.880" style="s2">happy to take three more questions</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.400" end="01:01:49.760" style="s2">which is uh well i want to also point</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.880" end="01:01:52.000" style="s2">people to and</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.760" end="01:01:54.079" style="s2">this discord server knows about this</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.000" end="01:01:56.480" style="s2">this is with verveiki because</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.079" end="01:01:58.720" style="s2">those dialogues and biological events</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.480" end="01:02:01.760" style="s2">are supposed to in fact</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:04.559" style="s2">form a mediating role between</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.760" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">theory of uh awakening from the meaning</p>

<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:09.039" style="s2">and the community and ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.119" end="01:02:12.079" style="s2">practices uh that are found</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.039" end="01:02:13.440" style="s2">uh in in the morning sega i just wanted</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.079" end="01:02:15.039" style="s2">to say those two things</p>

<p begin="01:02:36.720" end="01:02:41.200" style="s2">hopefully this wasn&#39;t already discussed</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.480" end="01:02:45.039" style="s2">but i actually just had a quick question</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.200" end="01:02:47.680" style="s2">um do you have any recommendations if</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.039" end="01:02:48.960" style="s2">i&#39;m personally interested in the tai chi</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.680" end="01:02:51.039" style="s2">and ki gong</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.960" end="01:02:52.559" style="s2">i think that&#39;s how you say it that</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.039" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve been teaching</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.559" end="01:02:59.200" style="s2">do you have like a recommendation of</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:03:01.119" style="s2">what to sort of look for i know like in</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.200" end="01:03:05.200" style="s2">these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.119" end="01:03:06.400" style="s2">uh practices there&#39;s a lot of variety</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.200" end="01:03:08.799" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know if you have maybe if</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.400" end="01:03:12.000" style="s2">there&#39;s in these days</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.799" end="01:03:13.520" style="s2">uh like an online or a youtube channel</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.000" end="01:03:14.880" style="s2">maybe you might recommend or something</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.520" end="01:03:18.079" style="s2">just to</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.880" end="01:03:20.079" style="s2">explore that whole area more without</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.079" end="01:03:20.720" style="s2">getting sort of lost in maybe some of</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.079" end="01:03:24.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.720" end="01:03:27.920" style="s2">the more uh maybe</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.160" end="01:03:30.079" style="s2">fringy aspect of it uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.920" end="01:03:32.079" style="s2">i mean i i have been looking at them and</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.079" end="01:03:33.920" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.079" end="01:03:35.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s kind of also legal reasons</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.920" end="01:03:38.480" style="s2">around this so i haven&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.119" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">recommended a particular</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.480" end="01:03:42.880" style="s2">you know channel yet um i might do that</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:44.640" style="s2">i got to talk to amar a bit more about</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.880" end="01:03:46.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.640" end="01:03:49.359" style="s2">there are important principles to look</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.319" end="01:03:53.119" style="s2">for so</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.359" end="01:03:56.720" style="s2">be wary of people who are you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.119" end="01:03:58.559" style="s2">tai chi and qigong that will allow you</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.720" end="01:04:00.319" style="s2">to move objects with your mind or push</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.559" end="01:04:03.599" style="s2">things over without touching them</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.319" end="01:04:06.799" style="s2">or all that uh bullshit um</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.599" end="01:04:08.160" style="s2">so that&#39;s a definite thing be wary of</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.799" end="01:04:10.240" style="s2">the opposite end</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.160" end="01:04:11.599" style="s2">people who want to reduce tai chi and</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.240" end="01:04:13.520" style="s2">qigong</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.599" end="01:04:15.119" style="s2">knowing how to punch and kick they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.520" end="01:04:17.119" style="s2">removed all the mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.119" end="01:04:19.760" style="s2">they&#39;ve removed all the aspiration</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.119" end="01:04:22.319" style="s2">they&#39;ve removed all the philosophia</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.760" end="01:04:23.280" style="s2">so those are two extremes that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.319" end="01:04:25.599" style="s2">should</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.280" end="01:04:27.680" style="s2">avoid it&#39;s very good if you find</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.599" end="01:04:30.720" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s teaching tai chi</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.680" end="01:04:31.680" style="s2">and sees it within an ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.720" end="01:04:34.480" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.680" end="01:04:36.319" style="s2">uh it has been my experience that</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.480" end="01:04:40.799" style="s2">individuals who learn about it</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.319" end="01:04:43.039" style="s2">in that way um tend to get the good</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.799" end="01:04:44.799" style="s2">out of tai chi where people who learn it</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.039" end="01:04:47.920" style="s2">as a sole discipline</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.799" end="01:04:50.480" style="s2">tend to become most fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.920" end="01:04:52.079" style="s2">about uh tai chi in a way that i think</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.480" end="01:04:55.760" style="s2">is ultimately detrimental</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.079" end="01:04:59.200" style="s2">uh to the taoist spirit behind tai chi</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.760" end="01:05:00.079" style="s2">try to find somebody whose focus is very</p>

<p begin="01:05:58.480" end="01:06:02.640" style="s2">another question</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.160" end="01:06:04.160" style="s2">yeah yeah uh this one is about the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.640" end="01:06:06.160" style="s2">written our design document</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.160" end="01:06:07.920" style="s2">because what you said last time about</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.160" end="01:06:09.599" style="s2">the cognitive science thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.920" end="01:06:10.960" style="s2">opened the can of worms with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.599" end="01:06:12.960" style="s2">metaphysics and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.960" end="01:06:16.000" style="s2">what i wanted to ask is what does</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.960" end="01:06:18.480" style="s2">metaphysics mean to physically</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.000" end="01:06:20.480" style="s2">what does metaphysics mean to what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.480" end="01:06:21.680" style="s2">to to physicalism like you said in your</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.480" end="01:06:24.079" style="s2">email</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.680" end="01:06:25.359" style="s2">yeah yeah i i just i i&#39;m just asking i</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.079" end="01:06:28.319" style="s2">couldn&#39;t quite hear you</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.359" end="01:06:28.319" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.559" end="01:06:34.559" style="s2">uh so it depends it depends uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.480" end="01:06:36.079" style="s2">i uh let the time we&#39;re gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.559" end="01:06:37.039" style="s2">the type of physicalism that i think is</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.079" end="01:06:40.480" style="s2">defensible</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.039" end="01:06:43.680" style="s2">which is non-reductive physicalism um</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.480" end="01:06:46.240" style="s2">so i take metaphysics to be uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.680" end="01:06:47.760" style="s2">the term was given to us by aristotle i</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.240" end="01:06:50.319" style="s2">take it to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.760" end="01:06:52.319" style="s2">some reflection that comes after the</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.319" end="01:06:55.039" style="s2">physics and is beyond the physics</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.319" end="01:06:55.760" style="s2">and is supposed to give us the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.039" end="01:06:57.839" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.760" end="01:06:58.880" style="s2">by which we can make sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.839" end="01:07:00.880" style="s2">physics so</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.880" end="01:07:02.319" style="s2">i think that metaphysics has always and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.880" end="01:07:04.160" style="s2">this is how i see it as</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.319" end="01:07:05.440" style="s2">fundamentally different from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.160" end="01:07:08.640" style="s2">supernatural</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.440" end="01:07:10.880" style="s2">and one of the things i want to try to</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.640" end="01:07:12.799" style="s2">challenge is the assimilation of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.880" end="01:07:15.200" style="s2">metaphysical to the supernatural</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.799" end="01:07:16.240" style="s2">that we&#39;ve inherited from our christian</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.200" end="01:07:18.079" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:21.280" style="s2">so i think the metaphysics has always</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.079" end="01:07:23.839" style="s2">been um in a relationship of continuity</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.280" end="01:07:25.280" style="s2">with physics properly so i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.839" end="01:07:26.960" style="s2">there&#39;s any contradiction with a</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.280" end="01:07:30.160" style="s2">physicalist having a metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.960" end="01:07:31.599" style="s2">insofar as a physicalist thinks that</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.160" end="01:07:35.599" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.599" end="01:07:38.880" style="s2">aspects of physical reality</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.599" end="01:07:40.079" style="s2">that are presupposed by physics and</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.880" end="01:07:42.559" style="s2">therefore cannot be</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.079" end="01:07:43.359" style="s2">established by physics that they&#39;re they</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.559" end="01:07:46.160" style="s2">are therefore</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.359" end="01:07:48.079" style="s2">the proper venue uh for rational</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.160" end="01:07:50.799" style="s2">discussion and reflection</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.079" end="01:07:51.520" style="s2">and plausibility normativity as the only</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.799" end="01:07:53.039" style="s2">means of</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.520" end="01:07:54.559" style="s2">justifying and establishing those</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.039" end="01:07:56.799" style="s2">presuppositions</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.559" end="01:07:58.240" style="s2">for example i think every physicalist</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.799" end="01:08:00.400" style="s2">this is only one example</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.240" end="01:08:01.359" style="s2">every physicalist is committed to</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.400" end="01:08:03.440" style="s2">causation</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.359" end="01:08:04.960" style="s2">but there is no physicalist there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.440" end="01:08:06.960" style="s2">experiments or i should say</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.960" end="01:08:08.480" style="s2">that&#39;s i use the wrong word there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.960" end="01:08:10.480" style="s2">physics experiment</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.480" end="01:08:12.559" style="s2">that can establish causation because</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.480" end="01:08:14.319" style="s2">every experiment by its very nature its</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.559" end="01:08:17.120" style="s2">intelligibility structure</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.319" end="01:08:18.719" style="s2">supposes causation that mean that</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.120" end="01:08:20.080" style="s2">causation is just some arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.719" end="01:08:22.159" style="s2">anomalous notion</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.080" end="01:08:23.600" style="s2">i think no i think what you can then do</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.159" end="01:08:26.640" style="s2">is do what you do</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.600" end="01:08:27.120" style="s2">even within analytic metaphysics is you</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.640" end="01:08:30.080" style="s2">try</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.120" end="01:08:32.159" style="s2">and explicate and justify this notion</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.080" end="01:08:32.799" style="s2">and explain how and why it can have the</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.159" end="01:08:35.839" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.799" end="01:08:39.440" style="s2">it has within your physics um</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.839" end="01:08:42.880" style="s2">and i think therefore there is always</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.440" end="01:08:43.520" style="s2">an important role but it&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.880" end="01:08:46.799" style="s2">and i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.520" end="01:08:50.400" style="s2">irremovable mediating rule between</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.799" end="01:08:50.400" style="s2">something like cognitive science</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.120" end="01:08:54.560" style="s2">and your metaphysics via your philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.679" end="01:08:56.400" style="s2">of science</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.560" end="01:08:57.839" style="s2">because if the philosophy of science is</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.400" end="01:09:00.560" style="s2">exactly that place</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.839" end="01:09:01.679" style="s2">where you are trying to work out um the</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.560" end="01:09:03.040" style="s2">ontology of</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.679" end="01:09:05.279" style="s2">all of the entities and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.040" end="01:09:07.759" style="s2">relationships between them</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.279" end="01:09:08.400" style="s2">that are presupposed in all of science</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.759" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2">not just</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.400" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">physics and that that is therefore</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:16.400" style="s2">like the important mediator in any kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:19.679" style="s2">of physicalism</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.400" end="01:09:22.080" style="s2">your metaphysics so um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.679" end="01:09:24.159" style="s2">that&#39;s what i take metaphysics to be for</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.080" end="01:09:26.560" style="s2">many of the people myself included</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.159" end="01:09:27.600" style="s2">who consider themselves non-reductive uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.560" end="01:09:30.400" style="s2">physicalist but</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.600" end="01:09:31.839" style="s2">nevertheless i think that uh both the</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.400" end="01:09:34.640" style="s2">philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.839" end="01:09:35.279" style="s2">and then further uh the metaphysics that</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.640" end="01:09:37.759" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.279" end="01:09:39.040" style="s2">is that emerges in response to that</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.759" end="01:09:41.120" style="s2">philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.040" end="01:09:42.400" style="s2">and acts as i think an important</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.120" end="01:09:44.319" style="s2">constraint on it</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.400" end="01:09:47.440" style="s2">um that&#39;s that&#39;s how they see that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.319" end="01:09:50.239" style="s2">they do and see the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.440" end="01:09:51.040" style="s2">i mean the problem with the term of</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.239" end="01:09:52.560" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.040" end="01:09:55.040" style="s2">and like and this is one of the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.560" end="01:09:57.440" style="s2">issues i have about it as i&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.040" end="01:09:58.960" style="s2">i think it for historical reasons that</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.440" end="01:10:00.840" style="s2">are not ultimately philosophically</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.960" end="01:10:03.520" style="s2">justifiable</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.840" end="01:10:06.480" style="s2">metaphysical for natural</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.520" end="01:10:07.120" style="s2">and magical in the pejorative sense of</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.480" end="01:10:08.960" style="s2">magic</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.120" end="01:10:11.440" style="s2">have all been assimilated together in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.960" end="01:10:14.400" style="s2">way that&#39;s uh very dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.440" end="01:10:16.159" style="s2">um and and i i think when many people</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.400" end="01:10:18.560" style="s2">invoke the term</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.159" end="01:10:19.280" style="s2">both posit both with from a positive</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.560" end="01:10:21.040" style="s2">regard</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.280" end="01:10:23.520" style="s2">and from a negative regard in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.040" end="01:10:27.040" style="s2">current culture they&#39;re using the term</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.520" end="01:10:29.600" style="s2">in that way that i i reject</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.040" end="01:10:30.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of what i would say at</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.600" end="01:10:32.560" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.880" end="01:10:34.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that&#39;s a complete answer</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.560" end="01:10:36.320" style="s2">because of</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.000" end="01:10:38.000" style="s2">the subtlety of your thinking that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.320" end="01:10:39.760" style="s2">i would start the conversation with you</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.000" end="01:10:41.360" style="s2">around that topic</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.760" end="01:10:43.040" style="s2">yeah well i i basically agree with</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.360" end="01:10:44.800" style="s2">everything that you said there so and</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.040" end="01:10:46.960" style="s2">i think that was incredibly useful on to</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.800" end="01:10:48.719" style="s2">also uh directly right model</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.960" end="01:10:50.320" style="s2">thank you very much oh well thank you</p>

<p begin="01:10:52.000" end="01:10:54.560" style="s2">question jay david just wanted to make a</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:56.880" style="s2">clarification</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.560" end="01:10:58.320" style="s2">but he&#39;s not assuming sole credit</p>

<p begin="01:11:14.960" end="01:11:20.159" style="s2">last question was david you had one more</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.920" end="01:11:20.159" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.400" end="01:11:24.880" style="s2">yeah john i&#39;m just curious about your</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.360" end="01:11:27.760" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.880" end="01:11:28.880" style="s2">traditions you&#39;ve studied with the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.760" end="01:11:32.080" style="s2">the teachers and</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.880" end="01:11:35.600" style="s2">the lineage of all the i guess major</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.080" end="01:11:36.400" style="s2">um practices that you you do in teach so</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.600" end="01:11:40.800" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.400" end="01:11:45.120" style="s2">qigong etc so the the meditation</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.800" end="01:11:47.840" style="s2">and the uh tai chi chuan</p>
