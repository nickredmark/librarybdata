<p begin="00:01:13.049" end="00:01:16.229" style="s2">are like getting into politics for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.790" end="00:01:18.540" style="s2">first time whether that&#39;s voting whether</p>

<p begin="00:01:20.280" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">and or running themselves because they</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.860" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">realize there aren&#39;t enough politicians</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:30.210" style="s2">that are quality to vote for all of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:32.340" style="s2">is needed but also that is a long</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.210" end="00:01:34.110" style="s2">arduous process and we need solutions</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.340" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">now and so that&#39;s one of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.110" end="00:01:39.900" style="s2">need is like ideas and innovations and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:42.329" style="s2">solutions and we need a way to get the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.900" end="00:01:46.130" style="s2">best ones out into the market into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.329" end="00:01:46.130" style="s2">world into wherever it is they exist</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.310" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">continuously and we need to do it in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.840" end="00:01:52.229" style="s2">in a safe way and we need to do it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.700" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of things that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.229" end="00:01:56.189" style="s2">need and a lot that the system gives to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:59.670" style="s2">that and a lot that it takes away and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.189" end="00:02:02.729" style="s2">I&#39;m proposing a new somewhat systems and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.670" end="00:02:05.009" style="s2">what organization so what I think we</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.729" end="00:02:07.710" style="s2">need I think personally I would really</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.009" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">like access to information but I needed</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.710" end="00:02:10.500" style="s2">to me trustworthy because even if I</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">trust this accurate information I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.500" end="00:02:14.030" style="s2">having a debate I&#39;m having a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:16.530" style="s2">with someone who&#39;s a policy changer</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.030" end="00:02:18.299" style="s2">unless they can trust the information I</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.530" end="00:02:21.150" style="s2">have there isn&#39;t really a point like</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.299" end="00:02:22.829" style="s2">when I watch a documentary I somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.150" end="00:02:24.269" style="s2">trust the documentary and then when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.829" end="00:02:25.470" style="s2">like but do your own research it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.269" end="00:02:28.980" style="s2">well then what was the point</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.470" end="00:02:30.180" style="s2">what was the point because if I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.980" end="00:02:31.650" style="s2">trust this and we can have a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.180" end="00:02:33.450" style="s2">on this and I have to do my research and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.650" end="00:02:35.010" style="s2">you have to do your research where do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.450" end="00:02:38.879" style="s2">find the common ground because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.010" end="00:02:40.470" style="s2">I can research all day long but if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.879" end="00:02:41.939" style="s2">not going to help you understand it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.470" end="00:02:43.349" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna help me get you to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.939" end="00:02:44.760" style="s2">same meeting ground so we can make</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.349" end="00:02:47.430" style="s2">decisions it&#39;s not really gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.760" end="00:02:49.470" style="s2">point so we need information that we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.430" end="00:02:51.060" style="s2">point to that&#39;s accurate and trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.470" end="00:02:52.680" style="s2">and for me that means it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.060" end="00:02:54.629" style="s2">transparent I need to know who funded it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.680" end="00:02:56.040" style="s2">where it came from how accurate it is is</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.629" end="00:02:57.659" style="s2">it the best of the information we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:03:00.739" style="s2">because there is no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.659" end="00:03:03.900" style="s2">perfect information just the best of and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.739" end="00:03:06.659" style="s2">if it&#39;s a scientific piece like what</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.900" end="00:03:08.220" style="s2">percentage of papers are pro vs. con or</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.659" end="00:03:10.980" style="s2">like this side versus this side and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.220" end="00:03:14.879" style="s2">seeing the bigger picture of information</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.980" end="00:03:16.739" style="s2">and like we have enough information out</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:19.169" style="s2">there it exists it&#39;s online like all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.739" end="00:03:21.329" style="s2">human information is online but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.169" end="00:03:23.609" style="s2">usable because it&#39;s not trustworthy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.329" end="00:03:25.620" style="s2">it&#39;s not one place we go to the closest</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.609" end="00:03:28.379" style="s2">we have to this is Wikipedia like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.620" end="00:03:30.510" style="s2">because it is kind of a place where we</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.379" end="00:03:32.849" style="s2">go to do we trust information a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.510" end="00:03:34.919" style="s2">too much probably but we can also go to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.849" end="00:03:37.769" style="s2">the back end and see how trustworthy it</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.919" end="00:03:39.959" style="s2">is see the discussions see the toward</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.769" end="00:03:43.049" style="s2">the bottom and see the references and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.959" end="00:03:44.489" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s one entity it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.049" end="00:03:46.139" style="s2">online encyclopedia there are ways that</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.489" end="00:03:47.400" style="s2">we can have information that isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.139" end="00:03:49.560" style="s2">online encyclopedia that&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.400" end="00:03:52.379" style="s2">powerful but it needs to have that</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.560" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">trustworthiness as well as having</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.379" end="00:03:56.669" style="s2">information we can trust that is access</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:03:59.549" style="s2">it has to be accessible which means it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.669" end="00:04:01.590" style="s2">has to be able to be not just for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.549" end="00:04:03.090" style="s2">like intellectual elite in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.590" end="00:04:05.549" style="s2">category there any pieces of that there</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.090" end="00:04:07.199" style="s2">could be like oh if you&#39;re really versed</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.549" end="00:04:09.000" style="s2">in this topic having the deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.199" end="00:04:10.349" style="s2">conversation but it has to also be</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.000" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">available at a surface level for</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.349" end="00:04:14.129" style="s2">everyone to be like ok and now I</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:16.229" style="s2">understand blockchain technology now I</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.129" end="00:04:18.180" style="s2">understand or voting on it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.229" end="00:04:20.269" style="s2">able to be understood by different</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.180" end="00:04:24.150" style="s2">learning styles by different</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.269" end="00:04:26.490" style="s2">neurodiversity and so making information</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.150" end="00:04:32.039" style="s2">accessible so that we&#39;re truly honoring</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.490" end="00:04:34.169" style="s2">our diversity we also need people we</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.039" end="00:04:38.550" style="s2">don&#39;t exist on Islands we need people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.169" end="00:04:40.349" style="s2">create with and to organize with and to</p>

<p begin="00:04:56.220" end="00:05:01.169" style="s2">to work with people we need tools we</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.830" end="00:05:03.599" style="s2">need tools to be able to collaborate the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.169" end="00:05:06.419" style="s2">old systems infrastructure was roads and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.599" end="00:05:09.900" style="s2">is we still need those delivery systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.419" end="00:05:11.250" style="s2">the railways the internet like all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.900" end="00:05:14.759" style="s2">that is infrastructure that we use and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.250" end="00:05:17.190" style="s2">we will continue to use but there&#39;s new</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.759" end="00:05:18.630" style="s2">infrastructure which is like the usable</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.190" end="00:05:21.740" style="s2">information definitely still the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.630" end="00:05:25.949" style="s2">internet creating systems that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.740" end="00:05:27.900" style="s2">create from the bottom up together I get</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.949" end="00:05:29.610" style="s2">a little sidetracked here people to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.900" end="00:05:33.990" style="s2">connect to the tools to collaborate with</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.610" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">is what we need so Facebook YouTube all</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.990" end="00:05:37.110" style="s2">of these things are amazing but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">not designed for collaboration we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.110" end="00:05:40.289" style="s2">use them for collaboration but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:42.110" style="s2">not designed specifically for that</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.289" end="00:05:44.610" style="s2">purpose they&#39;re designed for profit and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.110" end="00:05:46.860" style="s2">there are amazing tools out there that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.610" end="00:05:48.300" style="s2">are not accessible because they&#39;re too</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.509" end="00:05:54.270" style="s2">what like I use Facebook for free why</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.250" end="00:05:55.590" style="s2">would I go base ten dollars a month to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.270" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">collaborate with different people we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.590" end="00:05:59.789" style="s2">create a tool that anyone can find a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:02.430" style="s2">group of people with if we design it for</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.789" end="00:06:03.870" style="s2">that purpose that you can go on and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.430" end="00:06:05.250" style="s2">you&#39;re like hey this Park needs cleaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.870" end="00:06:06.150" style="s2">who in my neighborhood wants to go out</p>

<p begin="00:06:06.150" end="00:06:10.530" style="s2">neighborhood and you design a park clean</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.180" end="00:06:11.699" style="s2">up right that&#39;s a simple entity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.530" end="00:06:13.139" style="s2">like hey we need to figure out this food</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.699" end="00:06:13.800" style="s2">system like why are we throwing out so</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.139" end="00:06:15.900" style="s2">much food</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.800" end="00:06:17.219" style="s2">well what when you&#39;re creating from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.900" end="00:06:19.680" style="s2">bottom up you&#39;re creating like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.219" end="00:06:21.810" style="s2">the problem what the information we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:23.699" style="s2">on that problem how do we combine that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.810" end="00:06:25.469" style="s2">information together what is solutions</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.699" end="00:06:27.030" style="s2">brainstorm wonder what is something we</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.469" end="00:06:29.009" style="s2">can do now cuz maybe the solution costs</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.030" end="00:06:30.659" style="s2">billions and takes thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.009" end="00:06:33.240" style="s2">yeah but we need something that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.659" end="00:06:36.870" style="s2">take a year and cost a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.240" end="00:06:39.430" style="s2">dollars to create so we&#39;re creating yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.870" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">having the tools to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.430" end="00:06:45.550" style="s2">get organized gives us our true power</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:47.110" style="s2">that we already inherently have but kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.550" end="00:06:49.479" style="s2">of been told that we don&#39;t have life no</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.110" end="00:06:51.190" style="s2">all those people in power you mean the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.479" end="00:06:53.259" style="s2">people with money ie the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.190" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">spending money than regular consumer in</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.259" end="00:06:57.400" style="s2">a capitalist system and the voters in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:07:03.009" style="s2">democracy we&#39;re both of those things</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.400" end="00:07:04.419" style="s2">most in a democracy we need an efficient</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.009" end="00:07:08.320" style="s2">use of our resources</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.419" end="00:07:10.900" style="s2">which right now is somehow the market is</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.320" end="00:07:13.660" style="s2">somehow if you can pay this price then</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.900" end="00:07:17.710" style="s2">you can use it however you want that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.660" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">not a great system because we&#39;re wasting</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.710" end="00:07:22.030" style="s2">our finite resources like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:24.490" style="s2">supply and demand because it&#39;s okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.030" end="00:07:26.650" style="s2">a finite supply this demand isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.490" end="00:07:29.289" style="s2">momentary demand it&#39;s the demand for our</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.650" end="00:07:31.360" style="s2">whole species lifetime if we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.289" end="00:07:34.330" style="s2"> up instead of recycling it</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.360" end="00:07:36.190" style="s2">infinitely then we need to take in</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.330" end="00:07:38.110" style="s2">consideration the demand over the life</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.190" end="00:07:40.389" style="s2">of our species not just the momentary</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.110" end="00:07:43.030" style="s2">demand now everyone wants iPhones no we</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.389" end="00:07:44.889" style="s2">want to be able to have our kids kids</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.030" end="00:07:47.710" style="s2">kids kids kids they&#39;ll have a world to</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.889" end="00:07:49.660" style="s2">live on so we need to be able to take</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.710" end="00:07:50.949" style="s2">care of our finite resources actually no</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.660" end="00:07:53.169" style="s2">more stuff is and the truth is if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.949" end="00:07:55.120" style="s2">designing it from cradle to grave</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.169" end="00:07:56.919" style="s2">technology if we&#39;re designing it so that</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.120" end="00:07:58.150" style="s2">it&#39;s like from extraction through to</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.919" end="00:08:00.669" style="s2">when no longer using this product and</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.150" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">we&#39;re getting the resources back that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.669" end="00:08:03.760" style="s2">available to us in a way that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:05.860" style="s2">available to the current industry</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.760" end="00:08:07.870" style="s2">because there&#39;s no incentives create it</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.860" end="00:08:12.159" style="s2">that way we have the incentive it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.870" end="00:08:13.720" style="s2">planet so and we need did I say this one</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.159" end="00:08:16.539" style="s2">first I said it first before but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.720" end="00:08:17.800" style="s2">know if I said personal a video it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.539" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">sixth point but it&#39;s also kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.800" end="00:08:20.919" style="s2">first point which is that we need ideas</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:24.970" style="s2">we need innovation we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.919" end="00:08:26.979" style="s2">have new things come into existence to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.970" end="00:08:29.380" style="s2">be able to assess them for risk and be</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.979" end="00:08:31.630" style="s2">able to implement them and then track</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.380" end="00:08:32.830" style="s2">them keep them going like not just oh we</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.630" end="00:08:34.150" style="s2">sure it was safe and now we&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.830" end="00:08:35.830" style="s2">gonna look at it again I know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.150" end="00:08:37.810" style="s2">like short term implications long term</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.830" end="00:08:40.360" style="s2">implications and the more people we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.810" end="00:08:41.409" style="s2">lukina problems the more easy we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.360" end="00:08:43.050" style="s2">gonna be able to see them work more</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.409" end="00:08:47.730" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna be able to troubleshoot them</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.050" end="00:08:49.949" style="s2">yeah together it&#39;s just better so I just</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.730" end="00:08:53.730" style="s2">but those are the things that we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.949" end="00:08:55.949" style="s2">and yeah yeah weak a lot more than that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.730" end="00:08:58.500" style="s2">but that&#39;s what I&#39;m creating is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.949" end="00:09:01.110" style="s2">solution to those things information</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.500" end="00:09:02.070" style="s2">that is accurate and trustworthy because</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.110" end="00:09:04.110" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna decide on what that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.070" end="00:09:05.970" style="s2">together that you can connect whether</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.110" end="00:09:08.250" style="s2">you have a group of people you want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.970" end="00:09:10.230" style="s2">create something with the tools to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.250" end="00:09:11.459" style="s2">able to create with that group of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.230" end="00:09:12.870" style="s2">that you&#39;ve already created and also if</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.459" end="00:09:14.639" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a group of people to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.870" end="00:09:16.110" style="s2">able to find your group of people and be</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.639" end="00:09:17.790" style="s2">able to that means be able to move</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.110" end="00:09:19.410" style="s2">between groups and find which one&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.790" end="00:09:21.750" style="s2">and which ones don&#39;t and who you are as</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.410" end="00:09:23.880" style="s2">a human being and who you work well with</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.750" end="00:09:25.290" style="s2">and don&#39;t work well with and what kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.880" end="00:09:27.269" style="s2">of projects you work well on and what</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.290" end="00:09:29.190" style="s2">position you hold on those projects are</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.269" end="00:09:30.750" style="s2">all things that we can use technology to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.190" end="00:09:32.579" style="s2">help people find because it&#39;s better for</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.750" end="00:09:34.230" style="s2">them it&#39;s so great to know who you are</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.579" end="00:09:37.079" style="s2">and what you&#39;re here on this planet to</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.230" end="00:09:39.750" style="s2">do and feel and feel like you have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.079" end="00:09:41.310" style="s2">purpose and it&#39;s also for the betterment</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.750" end="00:09:42.360" style="s2">of society that more people have that</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.310" end="00:09:43.769" style="s2">right like the more people who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.360" end="00:09:45.510" style="s2">living their purpose and like living</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.769" end="00:09:47.010" style="s2">their best life the more we all get that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.510" end="00:09:49.910" style="s2">innovation and creativity</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.010" end="00:09:52.500" style="s2">I mean access to what they came up with</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.910" end="00:09:54.060" style="s2">and we don&#39;t need everyone doing that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.500" end="00:09:56.339" style="s2">need like a tiny fraction of people to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.060" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">be innovating and creating stuff and if</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.339" end="00:09:59.880" style="s2">we unleash that they&#39;d sky&#39;s the limit</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:03.180" style="s2">we can do all of this like what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.880" end="00:10:05.130" style="s2">proposing is somewhat complex some point</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.180" end="00:10:08.279" style="s2">there&#39;s if I have trouble explaining it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.130" end="00:10:10.829" style="s2">in you know elevator pitch but at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.279" end="00:10:12.060" style="s2">same time like it&#39;s like oh here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.829" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">scientific website here&#39;s the history</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.060" end="00:10:15.149" style="s2">wanted here&#39;s this it&#39;s like if they all</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">existed think of the world we could live</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.149" end="00:10:19.110" style="s2">in it&#39;s like yeah but that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:21.300" style="s2">stuff to do right but there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.110" end="00:10:22.920" style="s2">us and if we have enough funds to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.300" end="00:10:25.319" style="s2">it and we have enough people to create</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.920" end="00:10:28.589" style="s2">it both they&#39;re like free hours of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.319" end="00:10:30.209" style="s2">greater work of the crowd and also the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.589" end="00:10:33.360" style="s2">people that are like putting in the long</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.209" end="00:10:34.589" style="s2">long long hours who are like sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.360" end="00:10:36.300" style="s2">over time like they&#39;re putting in you</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.589" end="00:10:37.709" style="s2">know ten to 40 hours a week that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.300" end="00:10:38.910" style="s2">need to be paid for because they need</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.709" end="00:10:40.740" style="s2">food on the table and a roof over their</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.910" end="00:10:42.269" style="s2">head we have enough of all of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.740" end="00:10:43.709" style="s2">people to create these things and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.269" end="00:10:46.620" style="s2">doing it efficiently so it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.709" end="00:10:49.319" style="s2">one not each app has to run their own</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.620" end="00:10:50.670" style="s2">company in their own entity and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.319" end="00:10:52.050" style="s2">therefore each of them has to charge ten</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.670" end="00:10:55.110" style="s2">dollars a month per member which is why</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.050" end="00:10:56.730" style="s2">the other tools do because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.110" end="00:10:58.439" style="s2">have enough people using them and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.730" end="00:11:00.360" style="s2">have to be able to fund their employees</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.439" end="00:11:02.070" style="s2">to keep this thing going</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.360" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">we can do that on a massive scale so</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.070" end="00:11:04.980" style="s2">that it&#39;s going to cost us a lot less to</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:06.510" style="s2">create each project it&#39;s going to cost</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.980" end="00:11:08.010" style="s2">us a lot less to keep each project going</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.510" end="00:11:10.380" style="s2">than what it would with the others</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.010" end="00:11:12.600" style="s2">because we&#39;re breaking down that system</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.380" end="00:11:14.190" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to mark it we have a ready</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.600" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">based market we don&#39;t need to fund it we</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.190" end="00:11:18.089" style="s2">have ready funding we have there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">of barriers that you face we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.089" end="00:11:21.480" style="s2">assessed the risk we&#39;re not creating and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">spending millions of dollars and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.480" end="00:11:24.570" style="s2">saying by the way we needed 10 million</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:25.649" style="s2">people to use this where are there 10</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.570" end="00:11:28.500" style="s2">million people who want to use this</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.649" end="00:11:29.820" style="s2">worse is flipping that and saying how</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.500" end="00:11:32.070" style="s2">many people want to create this together</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.820" end="00:11:34.320" style="s2">I&#39;m 10 million people awesome can we</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.070" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">create this for 10 million people and if</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.320" end="00:11:38.130" style="s2">there&#39;s 10 million people are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:40.500" style="s2">give $5 like that&#39;s 50 million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.130" end="00:11:41.610" style="s2">we hope to create this with what could</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.500" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">you create 50 million dollars pretty</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.610" end="00:11:46.740" style="s2">much anything technology wise the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:49.050" style="s2">currently exists anyway like different</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.740" end="00:11:52.290" style="s2">entity iterations of what already exists</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.050" end="00:11:54.420" style="s2">so yeah the other thing I wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.290" end="00:11:55.829" style="s2">about and I&#39;m probably not gonna be on</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.420" end="00:11:58.320" style="s2">for a full hour today I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.829" end="00:12:01.110" style="s2">talk until I&#39;m done the talking points</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.320" end="00:12:03.329" style="s2">but can I get a mic a doc for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.110" end="00:12:04.290" style="s2">all day every day there is a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.329" end="00:12:06.630" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.290" end="00:12:10.470" style="s2">that&#39;s the point yes there&#39;s a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.630" end="00:12:13.019" style="s2">a lot this is this is a big huge</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.470" end="00:12:14.850" style="s2">undertaking but it&#39;s not a big huge</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.019" end="00:12:18.420" style="s2">undertaking for any one person there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.850" end="00:12:19.620" style="s2">gonna be tons and tons of us so and no</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.420" end="00:12:22.050" style="s2">one has to take on more than they are</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.620" end="00:12:23.490" style="s2">capable of more than they want to take</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.050" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">on more than they want to stretch</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.490" end="00:12:29.610" style="s2">themselves to grow and learn and so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:33.600" style="s2">fact that there&#39;s like a dozen different</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.610" end="00:12:36.540" style="s2">projects might seem overwhelming but at</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.600" end="00:12:38.370" style="s2">the same time it&#39;s the world of people</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.540" end="00:12:40.110" style="s2">like there&#39;s more than enough people to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.370" end="00:12:41.220" style="s2">work on those individual projects in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.110" end="00:12:43.140" style="s2">beginning we&#39;re only gonna create one</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.220" end="00:12:45.240" style="s2">project at a time because we want the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.140" end="00:12:48.600" style="s2">momentum we want the energy we want all</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.240" end="00:12:50.430" style="s2">of that behind one project but when that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.600" end="00:12:51.810" style="s2">becomes overwhelming or we have too many</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.430" end="00:12:54.060" style="s2">people to work on one project too much</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.810" end="00:12:56.100" style="s2">money to fund into one project how sad</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.060" end="00:12:57.540" style="s2">that we have too much money we have more</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.100" end="00:12:59.190" style="s2">money than we can spend than we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.540" end="00:13:00.300" style="s2">spend on different projects when it</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.190" end="00:13:01.860" style="s2">makes sense when we have a higher</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.300" end="00:13:04.079" style="s2">threshold of people that he&#39;s needed on</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.860" end="00:13:05.449" style="s2">one project we can open two simultaneous</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.079" end="00:13:07.829" style="s2">projects and eventually we get to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.449" end="00:13:08.940" style="s2">there&#39;s tons and tons of projects and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.829" end="00:13:11.940" style="s2">that&#39;s when we get to the more in each</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.940" end="00:13:13.350" style="s2">technology anyway you&#39;re creating an app</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.940" end="00:13:14.100" style="s2">for a very specific group of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.350" end="00:13:16.170" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.100" end="00:13:17.610" style="s2">you live a common life that needs this</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.170" end="00:13:21.170" style="s2">specific thing that the other tools</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.610" end="00:13:24.149" style="s2">aren&#39;t gonna work for anyway quite um</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.170" end="00:13:25.319" style="s2">eat this dress from a daily life I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.149" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">often you&#39;d say that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.319" end="00:13:32.579" style="s2">the whole life is stressful it can be we</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:33.630" style="s2">all have our daily that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.579" end="00:13:35.009" style="s2">do that we have put food on the table</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.630" end="00:13:38.839" style="s2">and a roof over our head clothes on our</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.009" end="00:13:40.680" style="s2">backs that we have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.839" end="00:13:45.149" style="s2">insanity that is our current world</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.680" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">whether whichever side you&#39;re on and all</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.149" end="00:13:51.269" style="s2">of those things are made better together</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:52.980" style="s2">like if you&#39;re a family unit deciding</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.269" end="00:13:55.769" style="s2">what groceries to buy what&#39;s on sale</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.980" end="00:13:58.769" style="s2">where you&#39;re spending your time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.769" end="00:14:00.180" style="s2">gonna be stressful more stressful than</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.769" end="00:14:02.819" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing it as a community and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.180" end="00:14:03.870" style="s2">greater community and so the more were</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.819" end="00:14:05.370" style="s2">able to come together and create</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.870" end="00:14:05.959" style="s2">solutions together the better it is for</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.370" end="00:14:08.069" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.959" end="00:14:10.290" style="s2">mainly because I love type of a leader</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.069" end="00:14:12.319" style="s2">the mandatory Ness of it the politics</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.290" end="00:14:17.970" style="s2">versus the economics clear to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.319" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">like without a minute right we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.970" end="00:14:22.380" style="s2">creating a whole again these notes don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:23.819" style="s2">make sense I should read them I did the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.380" end="00:14:25.319" style="s2">points that with what we need made sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.819" end="00:14:28.589" style="s2">the notes after were just the random</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.319" end="00:14:30.870" style="s2">thoughts so one of the thoughts I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.589" end="00:14:32.459" style="s2">over the last week which is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.870" end="00:14:33.689" style="s2">things when it comes here like why why</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.459" end="00:14:35.490" style="s2">was this not what I was always is</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.689" end="00:14:38.939" style="s2">deciding between a political in an</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.490" end="00:14:40.110" style="s2">economic system and I still remember it</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.939" end="00:14:43.589" style="s2">for like high school so it might be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.110" end="00:14:46.259" style="s2">little fuzzy but communism is both a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.589" end="00:14:48.689" style="s2">political and economic system it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.259" end="00:14:51.240" style="s2">like centrally planned political system</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.689" end="00:14:54.389" style="s2">and essentially planned economic system</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.240" end="00:14:56.310" style="s2">which works together to in historically</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.389" end="00:14:58.170" style="s2">not work there shortages there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.310" end="00:15:00.750" style="s2">violence there&#39;s we kind of suck at</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.170" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">central planning it&#39;s a species we just</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.750" end="00:15:03.660" style="s2">do we suck at breaking things down into</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:05.490" style="s2">the components and understanding them</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.660" end="00:15:07.889" style="s2">both as as their individual entities and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.490" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">as their complex together nests we do</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.889" end="00:15:10.800" style="s2">one or the other and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:12.360" style="s2">understand that&#39;s why the capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.800" end="00:15:14.459" style="s2">system somewhat works is because it</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.360" end="00:15:15.930" style="s2">isn&#39;t centrally planned it&#39;s like oh you</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.459" end="00:15:18.660" style="s2">see a problem come for the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.930" end="00:15:23.220" style="s2">make a profit but there&#39;s a downside to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.660" end="00:15:24.689" style="s2">that agreed the inefficiency the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.220" end="00:15:26.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a downside to it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.689" end="00:15:28.030" style="s2">destroying our planet with that system</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.250" end="00:15:30.270" style="s2">there cannot be finite growth</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.030" end="00:15:32.530" style="s2">an infinite growth on a finite planet</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.270" end="00:15:37.050" style="s2">sir can be fine i growth on an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.530" end="00:15:40.660" style="s2">planet but that&#39;s all so politics</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.050" end="00:15:42.340" style="s2">certain in our system or democratic</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.660" end="00:15:44.230" style="s2">which is our political system and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.340" end="00:15:46.360" style="s2">different if you think we&#39;re democratic</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.230" end="00:15:48.550" style="s2">we are maybe not perfectly democratic</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.360" end="00:15:50.490" style="s2">but we&#39;re democratic and then our</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.550" end="00:15:53.380" style="s2">economic system which is capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.490" end="00:15:56.020" style="s2">they&#39;re very intertwined and very like</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.380" end="00:15:57.370" style="s2">ok our corporations are in charge have</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.020" end="00:15:58.510" style="s2">given money to the politics they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.370" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">of in charge the politics the media</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.510" end="00:16:02.380" style="s2">that&#39;s supposed to kind of talk about</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:04.480" style="s2">them neutrally is owned by the by the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.380" end="00:16:08.410" style="s2">the capitalists they&#39;re really they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.480" end="00:16:11.860" style="s2">really the 1% of the capitalists so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.410" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">all intertwined but it&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.860" end="00:16:14.560" style="s2">it&#39;s the flipped clinic on a set</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:16.360" style="s2">intertwined where&#39;s communism it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.560" end="00:16:18.220" style="s2">designed to be intertwined rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.360" end="00:16:21.090" style="s2">it became kind of intertwined anyway</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.220" end="00:16:24.820" style="s2">another point politics is not voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.090" end="00:16:27.420" style="s2">politics neither is your economic system</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.820" end="00:16:29.950" style="s2">really but under economic system it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.420" end="00:16:32.110" style="s2">let&#39;s explain that further so if I vote</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.950" end="00:16:34.120" style="s2">that&#39;s my choice in my political system</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.110" end="00:16:35.770" style="s2">once there&#39;s a leader of my country I</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.120" end="00:16:37.300" style="s2">don&#39;t get a choice of other like my</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.770" end="00:16:38.650" style="s2">choice is voting once they&#39;re in charge</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.300" end="00:16:41.320" style="s2">they&#39;re in charge of me I don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.650" end="00:16:46.060" style="s2">opt out of taxes and opt out of them as</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.320" end="00:16:48.100" style="s2">my like leader of my country I in</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.060" end="00:16:50.830" style="s2">capitalism I also don&#39;t get a opt out of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.100" end="00:16:52.089" style="s2">capitalism I don&#39;t get to just like not</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.830" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">put like me I could go live in the woods</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.089" end="00:16:54.970" style="s2">you know but even that I think is</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.289" end="00:20:56.830" style="s2">people are supporting this and then how</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.970" end="00:20:59.200" style="s2">can we and we&#39;re not replacing Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.830" end="00:21:01.330" style="s2">but it&#39;s not something we&#39;re doing from</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.330" end="00:21:03.940" style="s2">today what in the beginning we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.529" end="00:21:06.279" style="s2">creating things that haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.940" end="00:21:07.570" style="s2">created yet or things that have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.279" end="00:21:10.210" style="s2">created but are inaccessible because</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.570" end="00:21:12.070" style="s2">they&#39;re too much money per person so we</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.210" end="00:21:15.519" style="s2">can create food apps that help us eat</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.070" end="00:21:16.779" style="s2">better that are the same as the ones you</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.519" end="00:21:18.639" style="s2">have to pay ten bucks a month for and</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.779" end="00:21:20.409" style="s2">yeah you were also strangely paying ten</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.639" end="00:21:21.759" style="s2">bucks a month for it but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.409" end="00:21:23.139" style="s2">going to create apps and apps and apps</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.759" end="00:21:24.399" style="s2">app so you&#39;re getting all of them for</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.139" end="00:21:26.049" style="s2">$10 bucks the beginning you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.399" end="00:21:27.429" style="s2">like the one app and that&#39;s not even our</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.049" end="00:21:29.139" style="s2">funding model in the beginning because</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.429" end="00:21:30.369" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t that wouldn&#39;t speak to me</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.139" end="00:21:32.289" style="s2">if it was from someone else I was like</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.369" end="00:21:34.509" style="s2">wait I&#39;m paying $10 month and then in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.289" end="00:21:38.190" style="s2">year I get a food app that sounds weird</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.509" end="00:21:40.480" style="s2">if I&#39;m putting in $25 not per month just</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.190" end="00:21:42.190" style="s2">$25 and then once it&#39;s done I get that</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.480" end="00:21:45.639" style="s2">food out that&#39;s okay to me and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.190" end="00:21:47.049" style="s2">retain $20 for the next project and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.639" end="00:21:49.450" style="s2">next project the next one is till we</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.049" end="00:21:51.369" style="s2">have the systems in place to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.450" end="00:21:53.019" style="s2">so we have the Facebook that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.369" end="00:21:54.399" style="s2">designed for until we&#39;re unlocking</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.019" end="00:21:57.550" style="s2">unlimited projects and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.399" end="00:22:02.800" style="s2">putting in $10 month but because</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.550" end="00:22:07.140" style="s2">it&#39;s never mandatory until it is in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.800" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">way that okay so Walmart comes into a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.140" end="00:22:13.810" style="s2">into a town they wipe out the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:15.370" style="s2">competition they lower their prices so</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.810" end="00:22:16.870" style="s2">that it I mean they do have low prices</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.370" end="00:22:18.250" style="s2">so that it wipes up or not but then they</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.870" end="00:22:20.380" style="s2">raise their prices because now they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.250" end="00:22:22.720" style="s2">now they&#39;re probably now they can they</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.380" end="00:22:24.130" style="s2">they pay an okay way just I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.720" end="00:22:25.480" style="s2">if they lower their wage once everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.130" end="00:22:26.860" style="s2">wiped out but they still it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.480" end="00:22:27.850" style="s2">a place where people can work so people</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.860" end="00:22:31.450" style="s2">definitely come on board and work there</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.850" end="00:22:34.270" style="s2">because it&#39;s a job once there&#39;s nobody</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.450" end="00:22:35.740" style="s2">left in a village to compete with them</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.270" end="00:22:37.570" style="s2">then they can raise their prices again</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.740" end="00:22:39.400" style="s2">because they&#39;re a for-profit entity that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.570" end="00:22:42.010" style="s2">all makes complete corporate sense for</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.400" end="00:22:43.960" style="s2">them to do as individuals it also makes</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.010" end="00:22:45.340" style="s2">sense for us to be like oh wait am I</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.960" end="00:22:47.140" style="s2">gonna shop at the general store am I</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.340" end="00:22:48.340" style="s2">gonna shop at Walmart well unless you</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.140" end="00:22:49.510" style="s2">can see the full big picture of them</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.300" end="00:22:59.620" style="s2">to make that decision but if we&#39;re the</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.140" end="00:23:11.320" style="s2">from here what would you like to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.670" end="00:23:13.150" style="s2">what would you we&#39;re creating it from</p>

<p begin="00:23:13.150" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">are to see what&#39;s ours but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.530" end="00:23:20.280" style="s2">if we come in and wipe out all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:23.440" style="s2">competition in a market and there is no</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.280" end="00:23:24.700" style="s2">equivalent it&#39;s somewhat okay because</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.700" end="00:23:27.280" style="s2">to we&#39;re not going to then raise our</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.960" end="00:23:29.320" style="s2">prices cuz we&#39;re the people paying the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.280" end="00:23:31.420" style="s2">prices we&#39;re not going to lower the wage</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.320" end="00:23:32.530" style="s2">because we&#39;re the ones getting in some</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.420" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">of us are the ones getting that wage</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.530" end="00:23:36.580" style="s2">that why we might do but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:40.180" style="s2">human beings were like okay well if</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.580" end="00:23:41.590" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna want to work there when</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.180" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">they&#39;re yeah there&#39;s an incentive to</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:48.340" style="s2">you like my brain is not doing justice</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.890" end="00:23:51.790" style="s2">on this long long weekends Monday to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.340" end="00:23:53.470" style="s2">this topic but I&#39;m here I&#39;m showing up</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.790" end="00:23:55.330" style="s2">and that&#39;s all I have to do is show up</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.470" end="00:23:58.120" style="s2">and imperfectly explain this the best of</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.330" end="00:23:59.980" style="s2">my current ability there&#39;s just like so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.120" end="00:24:02.140" style="s2">much like I do a much better job when</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.980" end="00:24:04.090" style="s2">I&#39;m talking to myself on camera what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.140" end="00:24:05.380" style="s2">talking because this is exact something</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.090" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">that not a single person has come in</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.380" end="00:24:07.750" style="s2">it&#39;s me talking on camera one way versus</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:09.760" style="s2">you talk I don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.750" end="00:24:10.370" style="s2">difference is maybe it&#39;s just that I did</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.760" end="00:24:12.410" style="s2">this for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.370" end="00:24:17.210" style="s2">first my brains frezzle that could</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.410" end="00:24:19.190" style="s2">absolutely be the case but there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.210" end="00:24:21.470" style="s2">what we need and then how we come</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.190" end="00:24:23.000" style="s2">together and actually create it and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.470" end="00:24:25.790" style="s2">have the system of how we come together</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.000" end="00:24:27.980" style="s2">and create it it&#39;s once we get a</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.790" end="00:24:31.880" style="s2">threshold of like 10,000 people who want</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.980" end="00:24:32.420" style="s2">to fund this together I&#39;m puttin $25</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.880" end="00:24:35.000" style="s2">each</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.420" end="00:24:37.100" style="s2">that gives us $250,000 to create our</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.000" end="00:24:39.110" style="s2">first project with once we&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.100" end="00:24:41.540" style="s2">our fur and how we create that project</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.110" end="00:24:43.370" style="s2">for $250,000 when it&#39;s a multi-million</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.540" end="00:24:44.510" style="s2">dollar project like it&#39;s it&#39;ll be worth</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.370" end="00:24:47.240" style="s2">multi-million dollars we&#39;re only going</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.510" end="00:24:48.760" style="s2">to spend $250,000 creating it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.240" end="00:24:50.809" style="s2">marking it and doing all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.760" end="00:24:53.059" style="s2">because there&#39;s cheaper ways we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.809" end="00:24:54.890" style="s2">create together than a corporation can</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.059" end="00:24:58.250" style="s2">create like we&#39;re can be more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.890" end="00:25:00.140" style="s2">than any corporation out there but not</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.250" end="00:25:01.520" style="s2">really from day one but the point is is</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.140" end="00:25:03.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason there&#39;s multinational</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.520" end="00:25:04.970" style="s2">corporations there&#39;s a reason they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.260" end="00:25:06.470" style="s2">that they have more efficiency and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.970" end="00:25:07.700" style="s2">and then it&#39;s impossible to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.470" end="00:25:11.059" style="s2">market when you&#39;re competing with one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.700" end="00:25:12.770" style="s2">them because they can undercut you we</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.059" end="00:25:15.200" style="s2">can do that on a massive scale to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.770" end="00:25:18.110" style="s2">corporations because they can&#39;t compete</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.200" end="00:25:22.120" style="s2">with us we can compete with them they</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.110" end="00:25:22.120" style="s2">cannot compete with us because we are us</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:26.200" style="s2">well think I could explain that better</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.770" end="00:25:32.090" style="s2">good luck coming in and and undercutting</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:36.190" style="s2">the law the Walton Walton Walter</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.090" end="00:25:39.290" style="s2">whatever the ball our people are family</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.190" end="00:25:40.790" style="s2">but like as a new family right a new</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.290" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">family that&#39;s like and we&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.790" end="00:25:44.210" style="s2">me hundreds of millions of dollars no</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:45.830" style="s2">you&#39;re not good luck with that because</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.210" end="00:25:46.970" style="s2">how are you gonna break into that</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.830" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">marketplace they have store it</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.970" end="00:25:52.790" style="s2">everywhere they have the big the buying</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">power you can&#39;t create a for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.790" end="00:25:55.580" style="s2">company that&#39;s gonna compete with that</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:58.760" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be so hard I mean I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.580" end="00:26:00.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a way but with a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.760" end="00:26:03.050" style="s2">money involved but we the people</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.980" end="00:26:04.910" style="s2">actually can easily take over from that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.050" end="00:26:06.350" style="s2">not ten thousand people but if we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.910" end="00:26:08.630" style="s2">ten million members who are like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.350" end="00:26:11.540" style="s2">here&#39;s what I buy here&#39;s where I buy it</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.630" end="00:26:14.059" style="s2">from I&#39;m willing to buy it from us if</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.540" end="00:26:15.950" style="s2">it&#39;s that price or lower or ten percent</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.059" end="00:26:17.360" style="s2">more like whatever you can we get a set</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.950" end="00:26:18.890" style="s2">it and then like it makes sense for us</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.360" end="00:26:20.600" style="s2">to now create these things as we have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.890" end="00:26:22.760" style="s2">threshold as we have enough people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.600" end="00:26:23.720" style="s2">use toothpaste you know like have tea</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.760" end="00:26:27.470" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.720" end="00:26:29.390" style="s2">to buy it from us and we have a ethical</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.470" end="00:26:32.060" style="s2">healthy alternative that people are</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.390" end="00:26:34.340" style="s2">willing to use because we&#39;ve asked them</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.060" end="00:26:35.780" style="s2">not just assumed then we can create it</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.340" end="00:26:38.510" style="s2">for that number of people like once the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.780" end="00:26:39.890" style="s2">cost makes sense to invest that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.510" end="00:26:41.300" style="s2">we do it not let&#39;s make the toothpaste</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.890" end="00:26:42.680" style="s2">and then market it and see if we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.300" end="00:26:44.870" style="s2">bring and draw in enough people and sell</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.680" end="00:26:46.550" style="s2">for profit and convince them that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.870" end="00:26:47.930" style="s2">healthy it&#39;s like no is it actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.550" end="00:26:50.120" style="s2">healthy because we&#39;re gonna have and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.930" end="00:26:52.060" style="s2">while we&#39;re creating or overnight we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.120" end="00:26:54.740" style="s2">not creating - Thursday 1:00 at all</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.060" end="00:26:56.840" style="s2">we&#39;re more collecting information on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.740" end="00:26:58.760" style="s2">toothpaste companies so we can see where</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.840" end="00:27:00.320" style="s2">the holes in the marketplace are or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.760" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">like we can pick the best of what&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.320" end="00:27:04.100" style="s2">the market without the advertising</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:07.070" style="s2">they&#39;re still going to advertise to us</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.100" end="00:27:09.350" style="s2">but we can ignore that and say okay how</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.070" end="00:27:10.580" style="s2">does Colgate compare two columns I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.350" end="00:27:13.760" style="s2">is that one by the same company anyway</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.580" end="00:27:16.580" style="s2">compared to like my local person who</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.760" end="00:27:19.940" style="s2">makes toothpaste but a guaranteed there</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.580" end="00:27:22.490" style="s2">is so helping the mom and pops get into</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.940" end="00:27:23.930" style="s2">business because you&#39;re my neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.490" end="00:27:25.280" style="s2">being able to make a toothpaste saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.930" end="00:27:26.660" style="s2">hey I don&#39;t like honey the ones are on</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.280" end="00:27:28.730" style="s2">the market here&#39;s mine here&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.660" end="00:27:31.640" style="s2">creating I can create a hundred of them</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.730" end="00:27:33.500" style="s2">who wants to buy the other 99 that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.640" end="00:27:35.270" style="s2">can create those systems in place so</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.500" end="00:27:37.610" style="s2">we&#39;re not supporting Colgate and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.270" end="00:27:39.620" style="s2">supporting our viewers where it makes</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.610" end="00:27:41.570" style="s2">sense or like hey neighbor how much does</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.620" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">it cost to make those hundred if we were</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.570" end="00:27:45.590" style="s2">able how much time do you spend making</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:47.210" style="s2">that if we&#39;re able to use your recipe</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.590" end="00:27:49.820" style="s2">because you don&#39;t want to spend that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.210" end="00:27:52.340" style="s2">time and we&#39;re able to create a million</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.820" end="00:27:53.450" style="s2">things of it and you get you get it for</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.340" end="00:27:55.160" style="s2">life because you&#39;re though I made it or</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.450" end="00:27:58.700" style="s2">whatever the weird incentive is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.160" end="00:28:01.130" style="s2">not millions of dollars but is for you</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.700" end="00:28:04.400" style="s2">anyway we can create from the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.130" end="00:28:07.700" style="s2">much more efficient more efficiently by</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.400" end="00:28:09.380" style="s2">taking less risks and spreading those</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.700" end="00:28:11.810" style="s2">risks out amongst us right us each</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.380" end="00:28:13.850" style="s2">putting ten dollars in to have a life</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.810" end="00:28:15.050" style="s2">not electrons like toothpaste but a we</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.850" end="00:28:17.330" style="s2">know we&#39;re getting ten tubes out of it</p>

<p begin="00:39:58.530" end="00:40:02.250" style="s2">now the point is to organize them and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.930" end="00:40:03.900" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m proposing the point is</p>

<p begin="00:40:17.310" end="00:40:21.840" style="s2">an app which app we&#39;re gonna vote on</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.560" end="00:40:24.270" style="s2">that because democracy so we it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.840" end="00:40:25.980" style="s2">want 10,000 people who aren&#39;t looking to</p>

<p begin="00:42:54.060" end="00:42:57.530" style="s2">and here&#39;s what the cost is and here is</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.100" end="00:42:59.430" style="s2">to be able to explain because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.530" end="00:43:01.080" style="s2">different things in the different phases</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.430" end="00:43:03.270" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard to keep it straight in my</p>

<p begin="00:46:41.920" end="00:46:45.340" style="s2">someone can have a majority wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.080" end="00:46:47.230" style="s2">even need to vote anything like whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.340" end="00:46:51.010" style="s2">I just if I 51% of the vote whatever I</p>

<p begin="00:46:51.010" end="00:46:55.150" style="s2">like how meetings run like that so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.410" end="00:46:57.790" style="s2">gonna make sure no one has 51 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.150" end="00:46:59.080" style="s2">the vote before we go into so if I see</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.790" end="00:47:00.520" style="s2">someone has my vote and there&#39;s heavy</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.080" end="00:47:02.230" style="s2">one percent maybe I&#39;m taking it away and</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.520" end="00:47:04.060" style="s2">giving it to anyone else if I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.230" end="00:47:06.880" style="s2">someone to have controlling power in</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.060" end="00:47:08.410" style="s2">that meeting if I do if I really think</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.880" end="00:47:10.150" style="s2">that that person runs it really well and</p>

<p begin="00:47:10.150" end="00:47:13.270" style="s2">they&#39;re great their ideas are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.040" end="00:47:14.410" style="s2">that should be listened to then yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.270" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">gonna leave them with my vote even if</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.410" end="00:47:20.170" style="s2">they have 51% like that just makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:21.460" style="s2">and so and different meetings are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.170" end="00:47:22.510" style="s2">run differently this is the financial</p>

<p begin="00:47:22.510" end="00:47:25.150" style="s2">what it&#39;s decided on maybe I picked</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.830" end="00:47:27.490" style="s2">different people for that one than I do</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.150" end="00:47:29.740" style="s2">for for another one and we can even once</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.490" end="00:47:31.630" style="s2">we have that where technology allows is</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.740" end="00:47:33.940" style="s2">where we&#39;re Democrat where as democratic</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.630" end="00:47:36.610" style="s2">and transparent as technology allows so</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.940" end="00:47:38.290" style="s2">once it is in place it maybe I can give</p>

<p begin="00:56:25.160" end="00:56:29.059" style="s2">like always the next next level and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.470" end="00:56:30.470" style="s2">fact we have this bar that everyone has</p>

<p begin="00:56:37.609" end="00:56:40.880" style="s2">homophobic you still have those things</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.349" end="00:56:43.130" style="s2">subconscious because our society is</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.880" end="00:56:45.740" style="s2">those things so to just yell at everyone</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.130" end="00:56:48.529" style="s2">for being it not realizing our own</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.740" end="00:56:51.049" style="s2">is problematic and so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.529" end="00:56:52.220" style="s2">because all that this is not I got a</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.049" end="00:56:53.480" style="s2">little sidetracked on me in there I</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.220" end="00:56:58.670" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t probably cut this off the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.480" end="00:57:02.269" style="s2">outer armor but being able to create the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.670" end="00:57:03.559" style="s2">tools so we can work together that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.269" end="00:57:05.420" style="s2">definitely will come into play and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.559" end="00:57:07.190" style="s2">have to but I don&#39;t think my ideas on</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.420" end="00:57:08.809" style="s2">that topic is the that&#39;s why it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.190" end="00:57:10.670" style="s2">part of the values it&#39;s not like and</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.809" end="00:57:12.619" style="s2">people have to allow other people to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.670" end="00:57:14.150" style="s2">homophobic it&#39;s like no no that&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.619" end="00:57:16.359" style="s2">the values it&#39;s we have to love people</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.150" end="00:57:18.740" style="s2">like we&#39;re it&#39;s it&#39;s diversity though</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.359" end="00:57:20.690" style="s2">diversity not just in that we have</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.740" end="00:57:23.150" style="s2">people of all genders and all races and</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.690" end="00:57:25.130" style="s2">all but also that some of those people</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.150" end="00:57:26.210" style="s2">are going to not be at the point where</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.130" end="00:57:27.859" style="s2">they can understand that there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.210" end="00:57:32.720" style="s2">than two genders</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.859" end="00:57:34.249" style="s2">they live in a binary gender world they</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.720" end="00:57:36.799" style="s2">haven&#39;t gone through the gender yet</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.249" end="00:57:37.789" style="s2">like can we not have compassion for that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.799" end="00:57:39.890" style="s2">do you remember going through it</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.789" end="00:57:42.380" style="s2">yourself like it&#39;s it&#39;s that&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.890" end="00:57:44.329" style="s2">that&#39;s like okay we&#39;re very it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.380" end="00:57:46.039" style="s2">evolution and once you&#39;re awoken to it</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.329" end="00:57:47.989" style="s2">it like breaks apart everything in your</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.039" end="00:57:49.579" style="s2">world so maybe yeah people aren&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.989" end="00:57:51.339" style="s2">got more going on they&#39;re not ready</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.579" end="00:57:55.039" style="s2">they&#39;re not capable emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.339" end="00:57:57.140" style="s2">intellectually of that yet why is it any</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.039" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">less prejudice to require them to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.140" end="00:58:02.089" style="s2">that when they&#39;re not ready mentally and</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:03.559" style="s2">and emotionally then that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.089" end="00:58:05.150" style="s2">using the right language that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.559" end="00:58:07.549" style="s2">know pronouns like it&#39;s like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.150" end="00:58:09.680" style="s2">there has to be a balancing there has to</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.549" end="00:58:11.390" style="s2">be like yes we make save spaces for</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.680" end="00:58:14.630" style="s2">people like everyone deserves a safe</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.390" end="00:58:16.759" style="s2">space and nobody gets everywhere is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.630" end="00:58:18.799" style="s2">safe space that&#39;s just gonna have to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.759" end="00:58:20.989" style="s2">how it is like it&#39;s like okay we all</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.799" end="00:58:22.670" style="s2">have our own triggers that we can honor</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.989" end="00:58:25.069" style="s2">those triggers and find when we need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.670" end="00:58:27.019" style="s2">and and find safe space and not have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.069" end="00:58:30.259" style="s2">do emotional labor when we we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.019" end="00:58:32.029" style="s2">to our diversity is our strength we</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.259" end="00:58:34.190" style="s2">can&#39;t say that no one ever has to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.029" end="00:58:37.099" style="s2">emotional labor some of us love doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.190" end="00:58:38.660" style="s2">emotional labor requiring everyone to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.099" end="00:58:40.239" style="s2">emotionally from quiring just women to</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.660" end="00:58:43.099" style="s2">do promotional labor is what&#39;s broken</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.239" end="00:58:45.289" style="s2">being able to say hey who&#39;s willing to</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.099" end="00:58:49.539" style="s2">take on this emotional labor who&#39;s up to</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.289" end="00:58:52.160" style="s2">it today is a better system saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.539" end="00:58:53.480" style="s2">not don&#39;t ask anyone at question ever</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.160" end="00:58:55.970" style="s2">because it could be offensive is</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.480" end="00:58:58.339" style="s2">ridiculous and it keeps us separated to</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.970" end="00:59:00.349" style="s2">be able to say okay this person doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.339" end="00:59:02.059" style="s2">like these questions but they&#39;re open to</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.349" end="00:59:04.249" style="s2">these questions and more we have access</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.059" end="00:59:07.220" style="s2">to that information the better we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.249" end="00:59:08.690" style="s2">work is diverse species and so giving</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.220" end="00:59:12.049" style="s2">people access to that information and</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.690" end="00:59:15.619" style="s2">honoring our intellectual and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.049" end="00:59:18.440" style="s2">and evolutionary differences that we are</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.619" end="00:59:21.019" style="s2">different and in different areas and</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.440" end="00:59:22.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not up to me to tell you how to</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.019" end="00:59:25.279" style="s2">grow it&#39;s up to me to give you the tools</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.880" end="00:59:26.749" style="s2">for you to decide how to grow and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.279" end="00:59:28.130" style="s2">not even that&#39;s not up to me but at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.749" end="00:59:29.420" style="s2">same time I think we can do that for</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.130" end="00:59:31.369" style="s2">each other so why not</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.420" end="00:59:33.559" style="s2">why if we&#39;re if we&#39;re requiring people</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.369" end="00:59:35.539" style="s2">to grow and evolve let&#39;s make it easier</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.559" end="00:59:36.140" style="s2">let&#39;s create the tools to allow that to</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.539" end="00:59:37.940" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.140" end="00:59:40.430" style="s2">which somewhat requires the tools to</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.940" end="00:59:41.540" style="s2">allow that to not happen to allow people</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.430" end="00:59:44.000" style="s2">to have space</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.540" end="00:59:45.760" style="s2">to explore their ideas and not require</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.000" end="00:59:48.230" style="s2">that their ideas be up to par with ours</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.760" end="00:59:49.580" style="s2">that there&#39;s even a par that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.230" end="00:59:51.590" style="s2">okay my ideas are more evolved than</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.580" end="00:59:55.280" style="s2">yours is already less of all right like</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.590" end="00:59:58.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay right one minute I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.280" end="00:59:59.750" style="s2">been off topic for a while on topic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.040" end="01:00:01.550" style="s2">definitely to do with me but like that</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.750" end="01:00:02.960" style="s2">that level of focus and more the more I</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.550" end="01:00:06.560" style="s2">step into who I truly am the more I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.960" end="01:00:09.020" style="s2">gonna draw on people who are that I just</p>

<p begin="01:01:45.320" end="01:01:52.010" style="s2">can have compassion for that but where</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.520" end="01:01:54.620" style="s2">there&#39;s so many of those people and they</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.010" end="01:01:55.979" style="s2">have a system like they have positions</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.620" end="01:01:59.339" style="s2">on the supreme</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.979" end="01:02:01.380" style="s2">and our political leaders and owned all</p>
