<p begin="00:00:03.389" end="00:00:10.139" style="s2">turn if we want to talk about how can we</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.790" end="00:00:12.030" style="s2">transition to a world without war and as</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.139" end="00:00:15.150" style="s2">always with idea cafes are allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.030" end="00:00:19.910" style="s2">pass and not have participate in the up</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.150" end="00:00:21.990" style="s2">to 5 minute presentation part and just</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.910" end="00:00:27.439" style="s2">participate in it in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.990" end="00:00:27.439" style="s2">out after and who would like to go first</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.010" end="00:00:36.059" style="s2">I&#39;ll go first</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:38.610" style="s2">alright as we were we were talking a</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.059" end="00:00:41.399" style="s2">little bit beforehand that from my</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.610" end="00:00:44.730" style="s2">perspective how do we transition to a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.399" end="00:00:47.969" style="s2">world with that war is first ending the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.730" end="00:00:49.559" style="s2">war that&#39;s inside ourselves or for me</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.969" end="00:00:51.960" style="s2">specifically the ending the war that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.559" end="00:00:53.460" style="s2">inside of me because there are times</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.960" end="00:00:56.930" style="s2">when there are parts of me that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.460" end="00:01:02.789" style="s2">fighting with each other and it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.930" end="00:01:04.610" style="s2">incredibly difficult to take action in</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.789" end="00:01:08.760" style="s2">the world and so you know really</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.610" end="00:01:12.360" style="s2">understanding what the different parts</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.760" end="00:01:14.820" style="s2">of me are wanting and what they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.360" end="00:01:16.710" style="s2">trying to get for me and and the more I</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.820" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">do that the more it gives me the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.710" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">patience to sit with somebody who has a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">perspective that is completely different</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.659" end="00:01:29.659" style="s2">than mine and hear them and understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:31.950" style="s2">that ok what they&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.659" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">completely antithetical to how I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.950" end="00:01:37.560" style="s2">that they should be doing it and yet</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to get a need met and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.560" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">can I help to understand what need</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to get met in order to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.840" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">address how to move forward and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:55.890" style="s2">there as I am able to you know resolve</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">the inner conflict within me it helps me</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.890" end="00:02:00.619" style="s2">to you know be able to resolve conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:03.780" style="s2">with the people in the family and family</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.619" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">and the more I&#39;m able to do that then</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.780" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">the more I can go you know the more then</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:12.370" style="s2">the more I have a secure base from which</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:15.140" style="s2">to go out</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.370" end="00:02:16.640" style="s2">interact with the world and interact</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.140" end="00:02:19.840" style="s2">with people who maybe have very</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.640" end="00:02:19.840" style="s2">different perspectives than I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.620" end="00:02:25.909" style="s2">ultimately I think it&#39;s an individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.269" end="00:02:30.230" style="s2">thing you know that transition to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.909" end="00:02:32.780" style="s2">world without war is comes down to my</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.230" end="00:02:34.849" style="s2">individual you know what are the what</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.780" end="00:02:40.040" style="s2">are the things that I can do on a daily</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.849" end="00:02:42.079" style="s2">basis to reduce conflict both within</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.040" end="00:02:47.829" style="s2">myself and within my interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.079" end="00:02:50.840" style="s2">relationships because as that is able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.829" end="00:02:56.209" style="s2">transition it it ripples out it has an</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.840" end="00:03:01.700" style="s2">effect and yeah I think that&#39;s that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.209" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">leave it there as always I started</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.700" end="00:03:04.340" style="s2">talking for my mics up who would like to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:05.780" style="s2">go next at the raise of hands that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.340" end="00:03:11.810" style="s2">aren&#39;t done mic everyone just wake</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.780" end="00:03:17.690" style="s2">everyone all right friends</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.810" end="00:03:20.359" style="s2">I think mm-hmm I think here is where I</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.690" end="00:03:22.370" style="s2">eat from an interpersonal point of view</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.359" end="00:03:23.389" style="s2">and you know from a prac of practice</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.370" end="00:03:25.669" style="s2">point of view that&#39;s something you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.389" end="00:03:27.349" style="s2">to work on all the time but I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.669" end="00:03:30.230" style="s2">this word first you know we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.349" end="00:03:33.410" style="s2">this first it&#39;s like I think hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.230" end="00:03:35.329" style="s2">we can agree that we always um want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.410" end="00:03:38.419" style="s2">try and do both things at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.329" end="00:03:40.040" style="s2">right it&#39;s kind of paradoxical but we</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.419" end="00:03:44.150" style="s2">want to work on ourselves and on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.040" end="00:03:46.609" style="s2">system and those two are related but my</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.150" end="00:03:50.599" style="s2">more general approach what I want to try</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.609" end="00:03:54.590" style="s2">to bring in today is to see the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.599" end="00:03:58.209" style="s2">being anti-war itself like I tweeted the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.590" end="00:04:00.680" style="s2">other day like and beaten anti-war is</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.209" end="00:04:03.049" style="s2">like the easiest thing and the hardest</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.680" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">thing because first you have to make the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.049" end="00:04:09.410" style="s2">decision to commit to it which I think a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:12.079" style="s2">lot of people want to do in principle</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.410" end="00:04:14.900" style="s2">but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think you can do if</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.079" end="00:04:19.310" style="s2">you&#39;re in a military or engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.900" end="00:04:21.590" style="s2">something like that but then in my tweet</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.310" end="00:04:25.240" style="s2">I said and then and then the and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.590" end="00:04:29.979" style="s2">the moderates come for you right because</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.240" end="00:04:31.600" style="s2">that the problem is not just the warp</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.979" end="00:04:35.289" style="s2">the warmongers right that&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.600" end="00:04:36.699" style="s2">reductionist but there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.289" end="00:04:40.750" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s liberals and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.699" end="00:04:42.550" style="s2">conservatives that go to war but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.750" end="00:04:44.919" style="s2">problem is like like with the Iraq war</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.550" end="00:04:48.160" style="s2">like it was the moderates that tipped</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.919" end="00:04:51.880" style="s2">the scales that bought in to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.160" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">fear-mongering and the lies that execute</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.880" end="00:05:01.240" style="s2">that carried out an institutional you</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:05:04.150" style="s2">know a scale war right and so so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.240" end="00:05:06.759" style="s2">moderates that went along with it have</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.150" end="00:05:09.039" style="s2">have have a reckoning to do right they</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.759" end="00:05:17.770" style="s2">have to understand how they contributed</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.039" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">to that ongoing kind of just tradition</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.770" end="00:05:25.500" style="s2">if you will of wars the status quo right</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:28.590" style="s2">but to be really at you know to to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.500" end="00:05:31.030" style="s2">transition to a world without war</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.590" end="00:05:33.070" style="s2">incrementalism has been kind of the name</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.030" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">of the game right like let&#39;s let&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.070" end="00:05:38.110" style="s2">know have a world police trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:40.599" style="s2">minimize conflict but then you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.110" end="00:05:44.590" style="s2">blowback from all those activities right</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.599" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">so I think a game B approach has to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.590" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">a higher standard right like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:53.139" style="s2">always been anti-war activists but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:55.810" style="s2">hasn&#39;t always been that practical and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.139" end="00:05:59.979" style="s2">the discussion between Jordan Hall and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.810" end="00:06:01.389" style="s2">and BJ Campbell yesterday was pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.979" end="00:06:04.030" style="s2">interesting on this point because they</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.389" end="00:06:06.639" style="s2">talked a lot about just kind of the you</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.030" end="00:06:08.349" style="s2">know structural game theoretical things</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.639" end="00:06:11.349" style="s2">that lead countries to war it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.349" end="00:06:14.169" style="s2">kind of unavoidable right and this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.349" end="00:06:18.930" style="s2">all this is all true historically but in</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.169" end="00:06:21.719" style="s2">our moment we&#39;re not just being idealist</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.930" end="00:06:24.610" style="s2">but we you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.719" end="00:06:27.219" style="s2">game that we&#39;re trying to play and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.610" end="00:06:33.130" style="s2">technology the global communication</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.219" end="00:06:35.080" style="s2">infrastructure uh makes makes war uh you</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.130" end="00:06:38.110" style="s2">know less and less viable less and less</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.080" end="00:06:41.040" style="s2">attractive so let&#39;s relate it to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.110" end="00:06:44.680" style="s2">current events right the Iran situation</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.040" end="00:06:47.890" style="s2">all the serious leftists all the Bernie</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.680" end="00:06:50.380" style="s2">surrogates like myself are against war</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.890" end="00:06:53.470" style="s2">with Iran mm-hmm because it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.380" end="00:06:54.940" style="s2">any sense and and in Trump&#39;s actions in</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.470" end="00:06:59.110" style="s2">this regard er you know extrajudicial</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.940" end="00:07:03.310" style="s2">and kind of you know white whitewashing</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.110" end="00:07:07.750" style="s2">issue you know calling the e the guy a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.310" end="00:07:11.260" style="s2">terrorist when you know um in fact what</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.750" end="00:07:13.060" style="s2">he is is a government official right uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.260" end="00:07:16.540" style="s2">and and you could say the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.060" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">about American people in like Dick</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.540" end="00:07:21.160" style="s2">Cheney or Donald Rumsfeld mmm and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:24.120" style="s2">made this point on on majority report</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.160" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">this morning I just finished watching it</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.120" end="00:07:31.330" style="s2">so uh yeah I think that&#39;s all I have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:34.110" style="s2">say it&#39;s just that you know we we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.330" end="00:07:38.560" style="s2">to take this kind of principled</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.110" end="00:07:43.540" style="s2">commitment to anti-war as a precondition</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.560" end="00:07:45.820" style="s2">for uh answering the question all right</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.540" end="00:07:48.120" style="s2">thanks Brent would either Bentley or</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.820" end="00:07:50.800" style="s2">Eric like to go next</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.120" end="00:07:55.570" style="s2">Eric wants to go next probably works out</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.800" end="00:07:57.100" style="s2">well if he might be stepping out so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.570" end="00:07:59.710" style="s2">I mean I think I can be fairly quick</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.100" end="00:08:01.810" style="s2">here I mean III broadly agree that war</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.710" end="00:08:05.380" style="s2">in the outside world doesn&#39;t end while</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.810" end="00:08:08.140" style="s2">you know each of us is is that confident</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.380" end="00:08:09.100" style="s2">in conflict with ourselves I do all ii</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.140" end="00:08:10.810" style="s2">think a couple of things there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.100" end="00:08:12.880" style="s2">couple of things that I wanted to bring</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.810" end="00:08:15.370" style="s2">to this firstly what we actually mean by</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.880" end="00:08:17.140" style="s2">war because if but if by war you simply</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.370" end="00:08:19.150" style="s2">mean armed conflict with weapons on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.140" end="00:08:22.870" style="s2">large scale between you know to to large</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.150" end="00:08:24.790" style="s2">groups then yeah they&#39;re this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.870" end="00:08:26.170" style="s2">a bit but I think it runs much much much</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.790" end="00:08:27.550" style="s2">much deeper than that which is kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.170" end="00:08:31.210" style="s2">think what Kyra was alluding to that</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.550" end="00:08:33.070" style="s2">pretty much every activity we engage in</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.210" end="00:08:35.260" style="s2">on an international on a global scale is</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.070" end="00:08:38.950" style="s2">a form of warfare right politics is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.260" end="00:08:40.810" style="s2">form of warfare you know there that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.950" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">deeply deeply deeply rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.810" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">everything that we do and I and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:49.090" style="s2">the identification by the game be</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:51.070" style="s2">thought people if you like that over</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.090" end="00:08:54.490" style="s2">rival ristmas is one of the key key</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.070" end="00:08:56.170" style="s2">key key underlying destructive dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.490" end="00:08:57.820" style="s2">that exists within game a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.170" end="00:09:00.730" style="s2">obviously the ultimate evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.820" end="00:09:03.700" style="s2">rivalries dynamics is war but a bit as I</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.730" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">say I think we play it out in many many</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.700" end="00:09:07.420" style="s2">many many many different ways not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.850" style="s2">in terms of armed conflict but that on</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.420" end="00:09:12.310" style="s2">the streets of armed conflict while the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.850" end="00:09:14.110" style="s2">tools of war exist while there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.310" end="00:09:15.550" style="s2">weapons and tanks and machine guns and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.110" end="00:09:17.850" style="s2">so on and so on and so on sooner or</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.550" end="00:09:19.750" style="s2">later someone is going to use them right</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.850" end="00:09:21.340" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t get rid of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.750" end="00:09:22.750" style="s2">things unilaterally if you you know if</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.340" end="00:09:24.940" style="s2">you&#39;re the only one without any guns</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.750" end="00:09:26.260" style="s2">well yeah this is a silly position to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.940" end="00:09:29.050" style="s2">an equal if you&#39;re the only one with</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.260" end="00:09:30.490" style="s2">guns yeah there&#39;s nothing stopping you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.050" end="00:09:33.220" style="s2">from running rampant over everything so</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.490" end="00:09:35.770" style="s2">III do think that the while the tools of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.220" end="00:09:38.140" style="s2">war exist war will continue to exist and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.770" end="00:09:39.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t see any way of getting rid of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.140" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2">the tools of war you can&#39;t uninvent</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.730" end="00:09:44.710" style="s2">stuff you can&#39;t unring these bells and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:47.740" style="s2">so I I kind of feel that war might be</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.710" end="00:09:50.530" style="s2">something that we&#39;re stuck with and all</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.740" end="00:09:52.990" style="s2">we can do is somehow seek to limit the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.530" end="00:09:55.210" style="s2">worst of its effects and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.990" end="00:09:59.540" style="s2">all I have to say I will fight you Erik</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.210" end="00:09:59.540" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.910" end="00:10:14.920" style="s2">would you like to share yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.560" end="00:10:17.620" style="s2">appreciate what you&#39;ve all said care</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.920" end="00:10:18.970" style="s2">about working on personally that&#39;s I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.620" end="00:10:20.980" style="s2">been on a journey for that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.970" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">been very important because we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.980" end="00:10:25.950" style="s2">really help other people or not if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:28.150" style="s2">don&#39;t have the fortitude to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.950" end="00:10:32.980" style="s2">Brent was saying about everything and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.150" end="00:10:37.020" style="s2">Eric that&#39;s definitely a challenge the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.980" end="00:10:40.960" style="s2">part I would like to bring in is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.020" end="00:10:44.980" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult at times to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.960" end="00:10:47.560" style="s2">just good decisions that&#39;s kind of one</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.980" end="00:10:51.580" style="s2">of my passions and so you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.560" end="00:10:55.540" style="s2">look back at just after 9/11 the United</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.580" end="00:10:58.840" style="s2">States it was very close to unanimous to</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.540" end="00:11:02.940" style="s2">go to war by our government officials</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.840" end="00:11:02.940" style="s2">and by many people in the States</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.390" end="00:11:09.160" style="s2">I wore on things I like doing is working</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">on tools that&#39;ll let us take a step back</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.160" end="00:11:21.030" style="s2">and take a look at these things you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:23.470" style="s2">without letting our emotions take over</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.030" end="00:11:25.510" style="s2">which goes back to what you know what</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.470" end="00:11:27.490" style="s2">Kara was saying about being able to</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.510" end="00:11:30.090" style="s2">regulate those to some extent and</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.490" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">understand them and feel them properly</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.090" end="00:11:36.370" style="s2">but also having tools that help us take</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:38.740" style="s2">in this large amount of information that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.370" end="00:11:40.510" style="s2">we have for lots of different places and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.740" end="00:11:46.350" style="s2">be able to synthesize that in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.510" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">our brains can can actually make use of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.350" end="00:11:55.090" style="s2">as opposed to summarizing and and making</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:58.200" style="s2">large biases there always be small</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.090" end="00:12:00.550" style="s2">biases but kind of reducing that bias</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.200" end="00:12:02.680" style="s2">for those using tools like that I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.550" end="00:12:10.600" style="s2">that could help us in future decisions</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.680" end="00:12:13.120" style="s2">about or and then you know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.600" end="00:12:17.050" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of that desert that&#39;s all I</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.120" end="00:12:20.380" style="s2">had to add on it all right thanks</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.050" end="00:12:23.020" style="s2">Bentley I will take my turn now I did a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.380" end="00:12:25.960" style="s2">video on November 11th which is our</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.020" end="00:12:27.850" style="s2">remembrance day here on how we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.960" end="00:12:30.160" style="s2">actually obtain a world without war and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.850" end="00:12:31.960" style="s2">then well Bentley was talking I realized</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.160" end="00:12:34.510" style="s2">that the war I&#39;m talking about is very</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.960" end="00:12:35.980" style="s2">much the systemic countries fighting</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.510" end="00:12:38.860" style="s2">each other is what I would define is</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.980" end="00:12:40.510" style="s2">were like people in power using big</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.860" end="00:12:41.080" style="s2">weapons to fight each other on a massive</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.510" end="00:12:43.900" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.080" end="00:12:45.430" style="s2">and that there are two types of four one</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.900" end="00:12:46.660" style="s2">of which has fought for profit and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.430" end="00:12:48.730" style="s2">most of the war that&#39;s going on right</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.660" end="00:12:51.850" style="s2">now and other war that has fought for</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.730" end="00:12:53.320" style="s2">ideology that would be like Isis is kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.850" end="00:12:57.450" style="s2">of fighting a war of ideology and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.320" end="00:13:00.850" style="s2">think both of those can be fought</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.450" end="00:13:04.510" style="s2">whatever the fight war like stock water</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.850" end="00:13:07.510" style="s2">with information and empowerment of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.510" end="00:13:09.730" style="s2">people that how we stop the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.510" end="00:13:12.280" style="s2">are done for profit is to take their</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.730" end="00:13:14.940" style="s2">profit away I don&#39;t buy land mines so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.280" end="00:13:18.220" style="s2">can&#39;t pick the best of land mines to buy</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.940" end="00:13:19.420" style="s2">but I guarantee you</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.220" end="00:13:21.550" style="s2">everyone who sits on those boards</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.420" end="00:13:24.820" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s a CEO everyone who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.550" end="00:13:28.890" style="s2">CFO also is on boards and has their</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.820" end="00:13:31.660" style="s2">money in every other industry and having</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.890" end="00:13:33.640" style="s2">the information laid out so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.660" end="00:13:35.110" style="s2">boycott them to the nth degree</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.640" end="00:13:37.540" style="s2">I mean their kids don&#39;t go to our</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.110" end="00:13:39.550" style="s2">schools we do not buy any of their</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.540" end="00:13:41.710" style="s2">products we do not we would put an end</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.550" end="00:13:43.780" style="s2">to war in three months less than three</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.710" end="00:13:44.890" style="s2">months once it hits them in their wallet</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.780" end="00:13:48.400" style="s2">which is the reason they&#39;re paint</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.890" end="00:13:50.890" style="s2">they&#39;re playing it there isn&#39;t a war</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.400" end="00:13:54.210" style="s2">left anymore now the ideology one is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.890" end="00:13:56.530" style="s2">different position to fight because</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.210" end="00:13:58.810" style="s2">those people aren&#39;t doing it for profit</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.530" end="00:14:00.340" style="s2">but the army the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.810" end="00:14:01.960" style="s2">actually doing the fighting and putting</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.340" end="00:14:05.740" style="s2">their bodies on the line are generally</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.960" end="00:14:08.110" style="s2">very desperate people and so once you</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.740" end="00:14:11.230" style="s2">have access to food and clothing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.110" end="00:14:12.910" style="s2">shelter it&#39;s a lot harder to turn you</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.230" end="00:14:14.920" style="s2">into a murderer it&#39;s a lot harder to</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.910" end="00:14:17.290" style="s2">convince you that these people are your</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.920" end="00:14:20.130" style="s2">enemy and that is another place where we</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.290" end="00:14:22.480" style="s2">fight or is things like this idea Cafe</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.130" end="00:14:25.300" style="s2">creating platforms that connect the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:28.840" style="s2">world not just that we&#39;re connected but</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.300" end="00:14:30.010" style="s2">truly connected that these wars these</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.840" end="00:14:31.980" style="s2">things that Trump have done in the last</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.010" end="00:14:34.300" style="s2">few months there was like the Kurdish</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.980" end="00:14:35.950" style="s2">genocide that he basically helped move</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.300" end="00:14:37.720" style="s2">forward I don&#39;t know when exactly did to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.950" end="00:14:40.120" style="s2">do that he pulled people out of was</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.720" end="00:14:42.130" style="s2">fighting them and one of my good friends</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.120" end="00:14:45.040" style="s2">is Kurdish and one of my good friends</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.130" end="00:14:49.900" style="s2">who just cut my hair is is was born in</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.040" end="00:14:51.760" style="s2">Iran and having neighbors that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.900" end="00:14:53.320" style="s2">actually and friends that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">part of these like that are directly</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.320" end="00:14:56.740" style="s2">affected by and have family members that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:58.360" style="s2">are directly affected by it changes</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.740" end="00:15:00.580" style="s2">things it&#39;s a lot harder to turn an</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.360" end="00:15:02.860" style="s2">entire group of people into the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.580" end="00:15:04.600" style="s2">when you are participating in</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.600" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">necessarily to do with war you know book</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.950" end="00:15:10.000" style="s2">clubs you can have you know play music</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:11.920" style="s2">together whatever it happens to be the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.000" end="00:15:15.190" style="s2">more we connect to the globe on that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.920" end="00:15:19.660" style="s2">level I think the the more we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.190" end="00:15:22.360" style="s2">access to not being to not have anymore</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.660" end="00:15:25.840" style="s2">and then what Kira talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.360" end="00:15:28.180" style="s2">that that personal piece the knowing</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.840" end="00:15:30.510" style="s2">when we&#39;re at war more with ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.180" end="00:15:31.630" style="s2">and when I&#39;m like trying to be in</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.510" end="00:15:33.400" style="s2">dominance</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.630" end="00:15:35.050" style="s2">/ someone or allowing someone to be in</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.400" end="00:15:36.790" style="s2">dominant so for me just like owning</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.050" end="00:15:40.390" style="s2">those emotions but I think that can only</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.790" end="00:15:42.730" style="s2">be done to a certain degree until bring</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.390" end="00:15:43.990" style="s2">groups or in groups working on projects</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.730" end="00:15:47.170" style="s2">for in groups with it with a mission</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.990" end="00:15:48.120" style="s2">being able to figure out that conflict</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.170" end="00:15:50.290" style="s2">because I can figure out my</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.120" end="00:15:51.670" style="s2">interpersonal conflict but that when</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.290" end="00:15:54.070" style="s2">someone else is involved is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.670" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">other level and once we figure out those</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.070" end="00:15:58.750" style="s2">two pieces not that and then it&#39;s all at</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.040" end="00:16:00.970" style="s2">the same time it&#39;s like once we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.750" end="00:16:04.450" style="s2">actual empowerment of groups and access</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.970" end="00:16:06.070" style="s2">to the information we don&#39;t leave it up</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.450" end="00:16:09.160" style="s2">to our government officials to stop</p>

<p begin="00:16:09.160" end="00:16:12.340" style="s2">therefore we don&#39;t just even port out</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.600" end="00:16:14.080" style="s2">into the street we boycott them to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.340" end="00:16:15.940" style="s2">nth degree it&#39;s like no we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.080" end="00:16:18.070" style="s2">if Starbucks is investing in landmines</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.940" end="00:16:21.790" style="s2">in a month say they are we don&#39;t buy</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.070" end="00:16:23.560" style="s2">stuff from Starbucks and wait if 10% of</p>

<p begin="00:16:23.560" end="00:16:27.310" style="s2">money where their mouth is and stop</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.120" end="00:16:29.290" style="s2">supporting war war would change</p>

<p begin="00:16:44.680" end="00:16:49.630" style="s2">just ask you Bentley you mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.710" end="00:16:52.090" style="s2">after 9/11 the country was almost</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.630" end="00:16:54.010" style="s2">unanimously behind war does that were</p>

<p begin="00:16:55.270" end="00:17:03.550" style="s2">agrees that it&#39;s okay well I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.750" end="00:17:07.300" style="s2">we have a choice of everyone thinks it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.550" end="00:17:09.939" style="s2">okay to do it okay I mean that&#39;s who</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.300" end="00:17:16.030" style="s2">makes the decision right the people no I</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.939" end="00:17:21.430" style="s2">think that if we had the right tools to</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.030" end="00:17:24.010" style="s2">look at the facts at the time we did for</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.430" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">some people I don&#39;t know we didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.010" end="00:17:27.670" style="s2">to constantly have the information I</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:30.250" style="s2">don&#39;t want to contradict your point too</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.670" end="00:17:32.500" style="s2">much but but there was people that were</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.250" end="00:17:34.840" style="s2">right about it and that&#39;s what matters</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.500" end="00:17:36.910" style="s2">right now on this topic right we need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.840" end="00:17:39.610" style="s2">listen to the people who were right at</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.910" end="00:17:42.040" style="s2">the time Michael Moore Bernie Sanders</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.610" end="00:17:44.740" style="s2">like hundreds hundreds of people and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.040" end="00:17:45.520" style="s2">the populace - right it&#39;s not like it</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.740" end="00:17:47.890" style="s2">was more it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.520" end="00:17:50.440" style="s2">are the government pushing right and not</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.890" end="00:17:51.850" style="s2">the Elector itself and then the people</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.440" end="00:17:54.430" style="s2">were given no choice right two years</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.850" end="00:17:55.990" style="s2">after 9/11 and the Iraq plans were</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.430" end="00:17:57.640" style="s2">already made in the project for a new</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.990" end="00:18:00.310" style="s2">American Century documents right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.640" end="00:18:02.530" style="s2">there is momentum behind this and people</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.310" end="00:18:06.550" style="s2">were just lied to right so we can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.530" end="00:18:11.200" style="s2">can&#39;t in any way like really rationalize</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.550" end="00:18:13.990" style="s2">it after the fact we should we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.200" end="00:18:15.430" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying is that those those</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.990" end="00:18:18.100" style="s2">people that had the right information</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.430" end="00:18:22.230" style="s2">did not have a tool to make that</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.100" end="00:18:22.230" style="s2">information clear to most everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.720" end="00:18:30.790" style="s2">I mean in what happened in the US within</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.540" end="00:18:32.230" style="s2">the UK there was a BBC reporter came out</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.790" end="00:18:33.130" style="s2">and said this whole dossiers been sexed</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.230" end="00:18:34.990" style="s2">up there are no weapons of mass</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.130" end="00:18:36.700" style="s2">destruction and the I have a very very</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.990" end="00:18:38.770" style="s2">reliable source yeah absolutely this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.700" end="00:18:40.600" style="s2">all bullshit right and the government</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.770" end="00:18:42.790" style="s2">here set up an entire link entire</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.600" end="00:18:44.590" style="s2">inquiry to exonerate the government</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.790" end="00:18:46.060" style="s2">castigate the BBC and everything that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.590" end="00:18:48.220" style="s2">was reported later turned out to be true</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.060" end="00:18:49.390" style="s2">and so you know and and more than a</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.220" end="00:18:50.860" style="s2">million people turned out on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.390" end="00:18:52.570" style="s2">of London to say no the war in Iraq is</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.860" end="00:18:53.860" style="s2">wrong it&#39;s illegal bla bla bla bla bla</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.570" end="00:18:55.270" style="s2">bla bla none of this shit made any</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.860" end="00:18:57.730" style="s2">difference yeah the decision was made</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.270" end="00:19:02.530" style="s2">the day 9/11 happened or probably even</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.730" end="00:19:06.670" style="s2">before one of the what&#39;s coming up for</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.530" end="00:19:09.960" style="s2">me and as everyone was sharing was the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.670" end="00:19:14.320" style="s2">concept of the war on sense-making and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.960" end="00:19:15.970" style="s2">when we bring it back to okay the way</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:21.340" style="s2">that we were making sense of the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.970" end="00:19:23.290" style="s2">at that time did not produce the results</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.340" end="00:19:28.570" style="s2">that we wanted Brent there may have been</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.290" end="00:19:31.990" style="s2">some people who knew and yet there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.570" end="00:19:34.120" style="s2">still a lack of trust in in some of</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.990" end="00:19:38.560" style="s2">those people in a large portion of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.120" end="00:19:42.310" style="s2">population and so how do you how do how</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.560" end="00:19:45.130" style="s2">do we take into account that war on</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.310" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">sense-making that that the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.130" end="00:19:51.630" style="s2">have historically made sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:55.650" style="s2">world all of those tools no longer work</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.630" end="00:19:59.340" style="s2">and how you and so exactly going back to</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.650" end="00:20:02.640" style="s2">what Bentley said of they may have known</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.340" end="00:20:07.520" style="s2">but they didn&#39;t have the effective tools</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.640" end="00:20:11.400" style="s2">either interpersonal the or</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.520" end="00:20:13.380" style="s2">technological wise to disseminate that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.400" end="00:20:15.450" style="s2">information and the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.380" end="00:20:18.570" style="s2">population didn&#39;t know how to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.450" end="00:20:20.760" style="s2">of it yeah and it&#39;s no different today</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.570" end="00:20:23.700" style="s2">right and that&#39;s why it&#39;s important like</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.760" end="00:20:25.080" style="s2">there&#39;s still a war on sense-making and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.700" end="00:20:28.170" style="s2">and and there&#39;s still a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.080" end="00:20:30.540" style="s2">disagreement about what happened in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.170" end="00:20:32.010" style="s2">and what&#39;s happened since then right and</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.540" end="00:20:34.520" style="s2">it goes back to what Eric was saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.010" end="00:20:38.430" style="s2">mm-hmm which is actually a point that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.520" end="00:20:40.560" style="s2">Foucault really really lobbied for and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.430" end="00:20:43.260" style="s2">that&#39;s that you know politics is just an</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.560" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">extension of war it&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.260" end="00:20:48.930" style="s2">way a way to look at it that you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:51.770" style="s2">you you can understand how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.930" end="00:20:54.090" style="s2">entangled and it is a kind of postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.770" end="00:20:55.860" style="s2">process mm-hmm even though Foucault</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.090" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a strictly a postmodernist to</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.860" end="00:21:00.060" style="s2">disentangle to deconstruct that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:02.700" style="s2">relationship between more in politics</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.060" end="00:21:05.430" style="s2">right and now we&#39;re in this moment we</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.700" end="00:21:07.770" style="s2">need to go beyond that can I ask for a</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.430" end="00:21:10.530" style="s2">little bit of clarification disentangle</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.770" end="00:21:14.100" style="s2">okay so can you bring it down into a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.530" end="00:21:16.710" style="s2">maybe more concrete example than war in</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.100" end="00:21:22.200" style="s2">politics because usually as something</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.710" end="00:21:23.670" style="s2">like that can be applied to like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.200" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">trying to I&#39;m trying to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.670" end="00:21:27.300" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying exactly and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:33.330" style="s2">fully I don&#39;t fully crack it and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.300" end="00:21:36.810" style="s2">trying to yeah no I&#39;m not I&#39;m not super</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.330" end="00:21:39.120" style="s2">clear on your question either okay so he</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.810" end="00:21:45.450" style="s2">so you said Foucault said that we need</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.120" end="00:21:49.020" style="s2">to do angle war from politics or so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.450" end="00:21:51.240" style="s2">guess I guess maybe the first question</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.020" end="00:21:53.580" style="s2">would be what what is what does he mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.240" end="00:21:56.910" style="s2">or what do you mean by politics in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.580" end="00:22:00.540" style="s2">situation so that that expression goes</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.910" end="00:22:05.000" style="s2">back to a kind of war theorist named</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.540" end="00:22:05.000" style="s2">Klaus bits who said that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.980" end="00:22:13.160" style="s2">something like war is you know politics</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.330" end="00:22:15.350" style="s2">by other means something like that like</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.160" end="00:22:18.110" style="s2">it was a famous kind of excerpt from his</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.350" end="00:22:20.930" style="s2">treatise on more and then Foucault</p>

<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">that like at the end of the day it</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.590" end="00:22:28.340" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter because it&#39;s a kind of um</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.340" end="00:22:38.060" style="s2">this idea is that like there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.500" end="00:22:40.310" style="s2">factors behind war it&#39;s not just</p>

<p begin="00:23:10.250" end="00:23:15.380" style="s2">policies and we need to get we need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.250" end="00:23:18.020" style="s2">move away from that in the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.380" end="00:23:20.090" style="s2">direction just towards more like</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.020" end="00:23:22.190" style="s2">pragmatic peaceful initiatives right it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.090" end="00:23:26.870" style="s2">comes back to like realism versus</p>

<p begin="00:23:26.870" end="00:23:30.740" style="s2">what you know do do we look at other</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.820" end="00:23:33.530" style="s2">countries like Iran as friends or</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.740" end="00:23:35.240" style="s2">enemies right and Jubilee has friends</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.530" end="00:23:37.010" style="s2">from Moran I have friends from Iran like</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.010" end="00:23:44.230" style="s2">as state threats to to my livelihood or</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.510" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">to global security but the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.230" end="00:23:48.560" style="s2">perpetuates that narrative right because</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:50.350" style="s2">it&#39;s in their interest to do so and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.560" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">think they do themselves a disservice</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.350" end="00:23:54.590" style="s2">whether its conservatives or kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:57.620" style="s2">liberal Hawks like Hillary Clinton they</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.590" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">do themselves a disservice by just</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.620" end="00:24:02.540" style="s2">toeing the line of traditional neocon</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:05.680" style="s2">foreign policy like we need to enter a</p>

<p begin="00:24:05.680" end="00:24:10.040" style="s2">especially now more than ever because of</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.040" end="00:24:15.500" style="s2">change being an existential threat to</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.070" end="00:24:17.650" style="s2">everyone we need to move in the opposite</p>

<p begin="00:24:17.900" end="00:24:21.630" style="s2">what does that look like what does it</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.830" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">actually look like in the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.630" end="00:24:26.580" style="s2">direction like things that maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:29.490" style="s2">could do or like the current because the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.580" end="00:24:31.909" style="s2">issue is a lot of what war is is our</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.490" end="00:24:34.590" style="s2">political elites that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.909" end="00:24:36.750" style="s2">theoretically elected going to war with</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.590" end="00:24:38.970" style="s2">one another when often it isn&#39;t the will</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.750" end="00:24:44.730" style="s2">of the people people don&#39;t want to go to</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.970" end="00:24:48.990" style="s2">war how do we actually transition to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.730" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">world without war going back to my my</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.990" end="00:24:55.169" style="s2">opening point like we need to elect the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:56.549" style="s2">anti-war candidates like for real and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.169" end="00:24:59.700" style="s2">not just the ones that say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.549" end="00:25:01.620" style="s2">anti-war but we need to vet those that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.700" end="00:25:03.510" style="s2">that track record in those policies and</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.620" end="00:25:04.830" style="s2">elect those people that&#39;s that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.510" end="00:25:09.419" style="s2">the political dimension that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.830" end="00:25:12.600" style="s2">dimension one of my kind of favorite</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.419" end="00:25:15.750" style="s2">theories and approaches I wanted to be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.600" end="00:25:16.490" style="s2">little more prepared with today but but</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.750" end="00:25:21.659" style="s2">I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.490" end="00:25:23.100" style="s2">um is you know as I said going in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.659" end="00:25:24.270" style="s2">opposite direction of war what that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.100" end="00:25:26.309" style="s2">looks like visa vie the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.270" end="00:25:27.960" style="s2">military-industrial complex is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.309" end="00:25:30.779" style="s2">this concept of a peace industrial</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.960" end="00:25:32.760" style="s2">complex and if you map out what the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.779" end="00:25:37.169" style="s2">military-industrial excetera</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.760" end="00:25:39.059" style="s2">complex is which I&#39;ve done partially and</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.169" end="00:25:41.159" style="s2">you map out the research about it then</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.059" end="00:25:44.700" style="s2">you have a pretty good map of what game</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.159" end="00:25:47.580" style="s2">a kind of protocols and beliefs look</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.700" end="00:25:49.230" style="s2">like right and and and and where the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.580" end="00:25:52.020" style="s2">investment is right and I love your</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.230" end="00:25:54.990" style="s2">point about divestment Jubilee like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.020" end="00:25:57.480" style="s2">is a key thing right like with the Iran</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.990" end="00:26:00.529" style="s2">assassination you know defense stocks</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.480" end="00:26:03.350" style="s2">spiked a little bit right it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.529" end="00:26:05.909" style="s2">you know the military-industrial complex</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.350" end="00:26:08.700" style="s2">profits from this that&#39;s that&#39;s their</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.700" end="00:26:14.330" style="s2">those people we need to liberate them</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.529" end="00:26:20.010" style="s2">from their you know defense contracting</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.330" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">world by by a divesting and investing in</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.010" end="00:26:24.390" style="s2">a peace industrial complex which which</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:26.909" style="s2">needs you know we talk about scalability</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.390" end="00:26:29.789" style="s2">the peace industrial complex like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.909" end="00:26:31.889" style="s2">military-industrial complex is scaled</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.789" end="00:26:35.309" style="s2">its global it&#39;s ubiquitous we need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.889" end="00:26:37.320" style="s2">scale civil society you know universal</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.309" end="00:26:39.299" style="s2">basic income there&#39;s a whole host of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.320" end="00:26:41.399" style="s2">things that we talk about in these in</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.299" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">these circles and communities that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.399" end="00:26:47.759" style="s2">can converge on that kind of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:49.019" style="s2">of a piece industrial complex and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.759" end="00:26:51.600" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s people that have done</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.019" end="00:26:54.690" style="s2">great work on it you know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.600" end="00:26:58.979" style="s2">kind of stuff I&#39;d like to to to</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.690" end="00:27:00.600" style="s2">foreground and unpack more ya know I</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.979" end="00:27:01.350" style="s2">love the idea of a piece industrial</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.600" end="00:27:03.629" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.350" end="00:27:06.629" style="s2">I mean I for me personally I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.629" end="00:27:08.580" style="s2">our first step is is um the elected part</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.629" end="00:27:10.590" style="s2">because everything elected just runs</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.580" end="00:27:12.210" style="s2">very slowly and it&#39;s a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.590" end="00:27:13.979" style="s2">people in power who might not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.210" end="00:27:16.139" style="s2">do anything anyway but we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.979" end="00:27:20.249" style="s2">middle of an election like in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.139" end="00:27:22.889" style="s2">like it has to be um yes I would like</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.249" end="00:27:25.229" style="s2">them America especially to in left</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.690" end="00:27:53.340" style="s2">peace in the peace process like</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.359" end="00:27:55.710" style="s2">everyone&#39;s talking about spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.340" end="00:27:58.649" style="s2">and faith where is the faith in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.710" end="00:28:00.659" style="s2">ultimate it&#39;s a attractor that we want</p>

<p begin="00:30:59.889" end="00:31:05.590" style="s2">create the trust you know when there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.759" end="00:31:08.350" style="s2">when there&#39;s a disaster an earthquake or</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.279" end="00:31:34.899" style="s2">have that coordination and so but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.460" end="00:31:36.309" style="s2">think going back to what the the thing I</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.899" end="00:31:40.749" style="s2">was talking about earlier of the war on</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.309" end="00:31:45.159" style="s2">sense-making there is a profound lack of</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.749" end="00:31:47.799" style="s2">trust in our society not just with our</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.159" end="00:31:50.860" style="s2">politicians but with individuals there</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.799" end="00:31:54.909" style="s2">are only a very few number of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.860" end="00:31:56.789" style="s2">that I deeply trust in my life and but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.909" end="00:32:00.850" style="s2">have spent most of the last few years</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.789" end="00:32:06.490" style="s2">focusing on how do I build that trust</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.850" end="00:32:10.179" style="s2">and part of that is when somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.490" end="00:32:13.139" style="s2">you know when when someone that in my</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.179" end="00:32:17.350" style="s2">life shares something that where our</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.139" end="00:32:20.830" style="s2">views are diametrically opposed that can</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.350" end="00:32:22.629" style="s2">feel incredibly threatening to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.830" end="00:32:24.539" style="s2">want to change their mind and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.629" end="00:32:26.860" style="s2">convince them that they&#39;re wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.539" end="00:32:30.369" style="s2">making peace with that threat that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.860" end="00:32:33.369" style="s2">feel and being learning how to hold both</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.369" end="00:32:36.490" style="s2">their their reality and my reality in my</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.369" end="00:32:39.009" style="s2">head at the same time in order and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.490" end="00:32:41.019" style="s2">the the discomfort that I feel of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.009" end="00:32:44.470" style="s2">holding both of those things at the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.019" end="00:32:48.610" style="s2">time too in order to get to the place</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.470" end="00:32:53.259" style="s2">where there&#39;s trust where Trust is built</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.610" end="00:32:55.659" style="s2">and so like how do we build that type of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.259" end="00:32:59.860" style="s2">you know system Brett I hear what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.659" end="00:33:03.070" style="s2">saying about Bernie I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.860" end="00:33:04.720" style="s2">trust politicians period like doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.070" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">matter what they represent I don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.720" end="00:33:09.820" style="s2">them I trust people that I know impress</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:12.580" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.820" end="00:33:16.750" style="s2">we&#39;ll listen to my perspective and hear</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.580" end="00:33:20.410" style="s2">me and so creating you know how building</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.750" end="00:33:23.950" style="s2">that you know I think there is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.410" end="00:33:27.100" style="s2">organization with politicians and if we</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.950" end="00:33:31.600" style="s2">took that and married that with like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.100" end="00:33:33.640" style="s2">ability like a more of a listening to</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.600" end="00:33:35.230" style="s2">build that trust then I could think we</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.640" end="00:33:37.240" style="s2">could go towards the direction of what</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.230" end="00:33:39.850" style="s2">Jubilees talking about and so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.240" end="00:33:45.010" style="s2">know that&#39;s the it&#39;s both of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.850" end="00:33:46.530" style="s2">pieces because I yeah I don&#39;t I just you</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.010" end="00:33:49.270" style="s2">know good bad or indifferent</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.530" end="00:33:51.520" style="s2">unilaterally I don&#39;t trust someone who</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.270" end="00:33:56.230" style="s2">identifies as a politician I don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.520" end="00:33:58.330" style="s2">and and I&#39;m I&#39;m trying to be a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.230" end="00:34:00.130" style="s2">bit more open to someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.330" end="00:34:02.790" style="s2">advocating for a politician I&#39;m like I</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.130" end="00:34:06.010" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I trust you either</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.790" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">but being open to it it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.010" end="00:34:09.280" style="s2">I have my bias that says that&#39;s person</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:11.080" style="s2">not to be trusted</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.280" end="00:34:14.950" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to be open to that being</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.080" end="00:34:16.270" style="s2">something that can change I have thought</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.950" end="00:34:18.100" style="s2">him on that issue but Bentley just son</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.270" end="00:34:20.740" style="s2">paused himself so I feel like he all</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.100" end="00:34:25.390" style="s2">right you did so I feel like yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.740" end="00:34:31.720" style="s2">I was I was thinking that yeah building</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.390" end="00:34:35.070" style="s2">trust between people is important I</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.720" end="00:34:38.080" style="s2">would think that if we have really good</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.070" end="00:34:43.240" style="s2">processes and tools in place that having</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.080" end="00:34:45.370" style="s2">trust in those or being able to inspect</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.240" end="00:34:48.540" style="s2">everything and have trust because you</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.370" end="00:34:51.130" style="s2">and the people that that you trust have</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.540" end="00:34:55.300" style="s2">looked at the information once it&#39;s laid</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.130" end="00:34:59.410" style="s2">out in a very methodical and useful way</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.300" end="00:35:02.440" style="s2">and I don&#39;t the problem with trusting</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.410" end="00:35:05.230" style="s2">people that haven&#39;t put all those facts</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.440" end="00:35:14.560" style="s2">into some sort of process is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.230" end="00:35:17.080" style="s2">always open to unknown biases so I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.560" end="00:35:19.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of room we have on you</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.080" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">know making spreadsheets for decisions</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.180" end="00:35:23.350" style="s2">is kind of a way of staying it that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:25.810" style="s2">don&#39;t we are brain</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.350" end="00:35:28.030" style="s2">cannot does not have the power to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.810" end="00:35:30.820" style="s2">consume all the facts about these things</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.030" end="00:35:34.420" style="s2">that&#39;s just who we are at our limit so</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.820" end="00:35:37.480" style="s2">without a tool it&#39;s not possible to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.420" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">it accurately although we can get lucky</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.480" end="00:35:46.930" style="s2">most of the time but so I would rather</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:48.220" style="s2">trust in processes than individuals but</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.930" end="00:35:49.780" style="s2">Trust is an important part because</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.220" end="00:35:57.490" style="s2">people won&#39;t take collective action</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.780" end="00:35:59.500" style="s2">without trust can I reply to that first</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.490" end="00:36:01.810" style="s2">of all like I&#39;m completely with you Kyra</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.500" end="00:36:04.210" style="s2">like on the other nut not trusting</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.810" end="00:36:07.270" style="s2">politicians like that that&#39;s where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.210" end="00:36:10.920" style="s2">coming from as a place of skepticism and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.270" end="00:36:14.800" style="s2">cynicism and you know criticism of</p>

<p begin="00:36:24.550" end="00:36:28.930" style="s2">a whole different conversation like like</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.500" end="00:36:30.670" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a hegemony of the status</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.930" end="00:36:32.590" style="s2">quo right that makes it hard to change</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.670" end="00:36:34.510" style="s2">and in some parts of the world green</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.590" end="00:36:35.890" style="s2">parties are successful in there and</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.050" end="00:36:52.660" style="s2">I did and at the risk of sounding the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.310" end="00:36:54.460" style="s2">risk of sounding a bit dismissive of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.660" end="00:36:56.260" style="s2">some of what&#39;s been said I think this</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.460" end="00:36:57.610" style="s2">notion of that wall goes away if people</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.260" end="00:36:59.620" style="s2">just talk to each other and trust each</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.610" end="00:37:01.870" style="s2">other more I I think it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.620" end="00:37:03.400" style="s2">somewhat absurd and naive because you</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.870" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">know the average person in the street</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.400" end="00:37:08.620" style="s2">the vast vast vast majority of people I</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:09.910" style="s2">think I can fairly safely say never want</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.620" end="00:37:11.860" style="s2">Ward you know what I mean it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.910" end="00:37:14.050" style="s2">certainly not in their own backyard you</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.860" end="00:37:15.880" style="s2">know I mean nobody ever wants it and yet</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.050" end="00:37:17.020" style="s2">we go to war again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.880" end="00:37:18.340" style="s2">because the fact of the matter is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.020" end="00:37:20.710" style="s2">prime minister or a president can</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.340" end="00:37:22.150" style="s2">declare war doesn&#39;t matter at all what</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.710" end="00:37:23.230" style="s2">the country thinks and there&#39;s already a</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.150" end="00:37:25.870" style="s2">couple of million soldiers whatever</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.230" end="00:37:27.120" style="s2">tools and arms and tanks and planes and</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.870" end="00:37:29.800" style="s2">whatever ready to fly them to wherever</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.120" end="00:37:34.450" style="s2">immediately so I think the whole notion</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.800" end="00:37:36.760" style="s2">of war being got rid of while we</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.450" end="00:37:39.100" style="s2">maintain a system of nay</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.760" end="00:37:44.170" style="s2">and government I think I think is a is</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.100" end="00:37:46.300" style="s2">an absurd and naive hope I also think we</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.170" end="00:37:49.030" style="s2">don&#39;t get rid of it with nations and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.300" end="00:37:51.070" style="s2">borders and such but it&#39;s transitioning</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.030" end="00:37:55.000" style="s2">to a world with without that which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.070" end="00:37:55.480" style="s2">about figuring out how do we trust one</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.000" end="00:37:57.640" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.480" end="00:37:59.440" style="s2">Bonita Roy just put something and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.640" end="00:38:01.450" style="s2">amazing the game be space about like</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.440" end="00:38:03.400" style="s2">this is the polarization of the left and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.450" end="00:38:04.990" style="s2">the right and you know we need to she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.400" end="00:38:06.760" style="s2">said it way better but there was this</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.990" end="00:38:08.590" style="s2">idea that came to me on what she wrote</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.760" end="00:38:10.300" style="s2">where I&#39;m like when my kid look is</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.590" end="00:38:11.500" style="s2">playing with someone for social play</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.300" end="00:38:12.910" style="s2">with son for two hours I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.500" end="00:38:14.440" style="s2">learned their name I&#39;m like what&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.910" end="00:38:16.300" style="s2">day I don&#39;t know it&#39;s like we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.440" end="00:38:18.010" style="s2">playin it on time for that but like</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.300" end="00:38:19.690" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t ask for their ideology right</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.010" end="00:38:21.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like do you want to play this they</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.690" end="00:38:24.550" style="s2">don&#39;t need to necessarily have the trust</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.520" end="00:38:26.410" style="s2">they don&#39;t need to have and so figuring</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.550" end="00:38:28.630" style="s2">out how do we working groups together</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.410" end="00:38:30.280" style="s2">without needing to agree on the thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.630" end="00:38:31.780" style="s2">right can we agree the project needs to</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.280" end="00:38:34.810" style="s2">get me right up or cooling what I said</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.780" end="00:38:36.940" style="s2">if we&#39;re doing a piece global industrial</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.810" end="00:38:38.470" style="s2">complex whatever was called I&#39;m putting</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.940" end="00:38:41.140" style="s2">ten dollars in and we&#39;re voting on</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.470" end="00:38:42.970" style="s2">what&#39;s the most important project your</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.140" end="00:38:45.010" style="s2">project might not get funded right your</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.970" end="00:38:46.900" style="s2">project maybe there&#39;s two and you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.010" end="00:38:48.430" style="s2">really wanted one well there&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.900" end="00:38:49.720" style="s2">option to just split it and be like well</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.430" end="00:38:51.610" style="s2">you people work on this one and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.720" end="00:38:53.710" style="s2">people work on that one that there are</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.610" end="00:38:55.900" style="s2">ways to work around while still owning</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.710" end="00:38:57.970" style="s2">right there is that tension we all have</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.900" end="00:39:00.700" style="s2">when someone disagrees with us like how</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.970" end="00:39:03.430" style="s2">can we get to gaming B without needing</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.700" end="00:39:05.020" style="s2">to agree on what game B is how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.430" end="00:39:07.050" style="s2">to game B by having any when we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.020" end="00:39:09.520" style="s2">fundamentally different needs and wants</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.050" end="00:39:11.530" style="s2">so I kind of owning that and figuring</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.520" end="00:39:14.200" style="s2">out how do we work together right in</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.530" end="00:39:15.940" style="s2">small groups that grow and allow for</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.200" end="00:39:17.830" style="s2">that trust to be built but also allow</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.940" end="00:39:19.480" style="s2">for the trust being done and Fred sheets</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.830" end="00:39:22.020" style="s2">because I don&#39;t trust the Red Cross I</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.480" end="00:39:24.640" style="s2">don&#39;t think they&#39;re the best source of</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.020" end="00:39:26.650" style="s2">disaster relief I might give them ten</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.640" end="00:39:28.480" style="s2">bucks because they&#39;re something but</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.650" end="00:39:30.610" style="s2">they&#39;re like us having something where I</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.480" end="00:39:32.110" style="s2">can see I can see transparently where</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.610" end="00:39:33.970" style="s2">that money&#39;s going and then after the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.110" end="00:39:35.140" style="s2">first disaster we critique that and say</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.970" end="00:39:36.550" style="s2">here&#39;s what could have been done better</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.140" end="00:39:38.860" style="s2">so the next one&#39;s even better</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.550" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">and the next one&#39;s even better so we</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.860" end="00:39:42.250" style="s2">have the ability to go in and set up a</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:43.480" style="s2">whole new city right away when refugees</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.250" end="00:39:45.570" style="s2">have to leave right it would people</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.480" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">whether it&#39;s form or or climate change</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.570" end="00:39:49.870" style="s2">we&#39;ve come up with solutions to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:51.010" style="s2">problems without needing to first get</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.870" end="00:39:53.990" style="s2">along</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.010" end="00:39:55.640" style="s2">but I want to build a build on all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.990" end="00:39:58.790" style="s2">that because I think it ties into</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.640" end="00:40:00.770" style="s2">Bentley&#39;s point about process and for me</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.790" end="00:40:04.760" style="s2">that the process we should be fostering</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.770" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">is demilitarization right like people</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.760" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">don&#39;t even talk about that enough but</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:11.450" style="s2">but to unpack it and define it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:12.799" style="s2">execute it as a process we work towards</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.450" end="00:40:14.660" style="s2">and I&#39;ve written about this concept</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.799" end="00:40:17.869" style="s2">called normative incrementalism where we</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.660" end="00:40:20.089" style="s2">overcome social paradoxes by agreeing to</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.869" end="00:40:22.970" style="s2">work towards that attractor right in</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.089" end="00:40:24.500" style="s2">this case game B so the process we</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.970" end="00:40:26.140" style="s2">should be working on is demilitarization</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.500" end="00:40:29.690" style="s2">because there is a process of</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.140" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">militarization that that is the logic</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.690" end="00:40:35.829" style="s2">dictating you know how a lot of politics</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:39.470" style="s2">goes and how a lot of money is spent um</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.829" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">mmm and well I just quickly want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.470" end="00:40:43.190" style="s2">throw out a statistic that goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:43.960" style="s2">what we were talking about with the Iraq</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.190" end="00:40:48.530" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.960" end="00:40:49.940" style="s2">mmm yeah this is from like 12 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.530" end="00:40:53.990" style="s2">so I don&#39;t remember the source but I saw</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.940" end="00:40:55.910" style="s2">a statistic when I was studying that 96</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.990" end="00:40:58.790" style="s2">percent of international relations</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.910" end="00:41:00.349" style="s2">scholars were against the Iraq war right</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.790" end="00:41:02.990" style="s2">does that does the mainstream media tell</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.349" end="00:41:05.480" style="s2">you that you know do those guys go on TV</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.990" end="00:41:08.150" style="s2">as kind of analysts and and and share</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.480" end="00:41:11.720" style="s2">that not so much right because of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.150" end="00:41:14.809" style="s2">hegemony of um you know the the power</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.720" end="00:41:16.250" style="s2">Lee in this case a pushing for war so</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.809" end="00:41:18.470" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s something we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.250" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">to be cognizant of all throughout</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.470" end="00:41:22.880" style="s2">history and on your point Jubilee about</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:24.020" style="s2">the Red Cross like a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.880" end="00:41:25.549" style="s2">know where you&#39;re coming from I know</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.020" end="00:41:27.589" style="s2">people have worked for the Red Cross or</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.549" end="00:41:30.319" style="s2">the UN and they&#39;re totally disillusioned</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.589" end="00:41:32.329" style="s2">because those organizations are are just</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.319" end="00:41:35.900" style="s2">functional and corrupt and this speaks</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.329" end="00:41:37.490" style="s2">to a non geared artist is thisis that</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.900" end="00:41:39.740" style="s2">all of you know corporate philanthropy</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.490" end="00:41:43.099" style="s2">and stuff it&#39;s all co-opted it all gets</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.740" end="00:41:45.020" style="s2">fed back into game a and and and we need</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.099" end="00:41:47.240" style="s2">to realize that and get ahead of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.020" end="00:41:48.770" style="s2">problem right by through divestment and</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.240" end="00:41:53.059" style="s2">through different types of organizations</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.770" end="00:41:55.819" style="s2">and etc um and then the last thing I</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.059" end="00:41:56.990" style="s2">want to say is about is about trust just</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.819" end="00:41:59.540" style="s2">to kind of finish my thought with that</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.990" end="00:42:01.849" style="s2">like like we should be distrustful of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.540" end="00:42:03.859" style="s2">politics of course and in the media and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.849" end="00:42:05.480" style="s2">how its presented and we should not</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.859" end="00:42:10.519" style="s2">necessarily trust our own institutions</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.480" end="00:42:15.130" style="s2">are our own intuitions about things but</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.519" end="00:42:17.299" style="s2">when you actually examine and scrutinize</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.130" end="00:42:22.039" style="s2">somebody like Bernie and his track</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.299" end="00:42:25.999" style="s2">record and his movement sorry he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.039" end="00:42:27.829" style="s2">a lifelong anti-war advocate and not</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.999" end="00:42:30.619" style="s2">only that like he&#39;s done it correctly</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.829" end="00:42:33.170" style="s2">he&#39;s embodied the communication</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.619" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">protocols and and peaceful gestures and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.170" end="00:42:37.009" style="s2">all that kind of stuff he does it he</p>

<p begin="00:44:06.410" end="00:44:12.049" style="s2">is the media right the media doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.289" end="00:44:13.940" style="s2">necessarily support Bernie we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.049" end="00:44:15.499" style="s2">disagree on whether Bernie&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.940" end="00:44:17.509" style="s2">person to be in charge of the United</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.499" end="00:44:20.569" style="s2">States but we could</p>

<p begin="00:44:20.569" end="00:44:23.779" style="s2">can trust someone write the imbd for</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.189" end="00:44:26.509" style="s2">politicians the wiki election week</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.779" end="00:44:28.369" style="s2">raised on Saturday is one such project</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.509" end="00:44:31.069" style="s2">right it does not be that project but a</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.369" end="00:44:33.079" style="s2">project that makes sense of who do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.069" end="00:44:35.869" style="s2">trust in politics the most not because</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.079" end="00:44:37.519" style="s2">the media tells us to and where they get</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.869" end="00:44:39.829" style="s2">their money from but like we&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.519" end="00:44:43.039" style="s2">something that we can we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.829" end="00:44:44.959" style="s2">trust and that is where like maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.039" end="00:44:46.399" style="s2">don&#39;t need we need to have a distrust</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.959" end="00:44:49.399" style="s2">right like I might trust you as an</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.399" end="00:44:51.529" style="s2">individual but it&#39;s more about trusting</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.399" end="00:44:54.259" style="s2">the process and the group right like if</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.529" end="00:44:55.939" style="s2">you can see it and it&#39;s transparent I we</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.259" end="00:44:58.819" style="s2">can fight all day about whether Bernie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.939" end="00:45:00.769" style="s2">the best person for for the or we could</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.819" end="00:45:02.419" style="s2">step back and be like which I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.769" end="00:45:05.989" style="s2">I would love in charge of it but like</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.419" end="00:45:07.939" style="s2">finding the how do we look for the truth</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.939" end="00:45:12.619" style="s2">without being in a debate right like how</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.549" end="00:45:14.599" style="s2">do we distrust information so that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.619" end="00:45:16.279" style="s2">can all use it because all the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.599" end="00:45:18.679" style="s2">information that&#39;s in your head Brent is</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:27.739" style="s2">of us you don&#39;t need that you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.639" end="00:45:29.389" style="s2">to spend the time and energy saying it</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.739" end="00:45:33.829" style="s2">repeatedly it&#39;s like oh I can see</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.389" end="00:45:35.449" style="s2">Bernie&#39;s track record you&#39;re like we</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.149" end="00:45:53.269" style="s2">trusting the processes more than</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.359" end="00:45:55.039" style="s2">trusting people at least that was my</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.269" end="00:45:57.709" style="s2">what I what I thought I heard you say</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.039" end="00:45:59.389" style="s2">and so so please correct me if that&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.709" end="00:46:03.289" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong and I want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.389" end="00:46:07.279" style="s2">that because I mean it&#39;s ultimately I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.289" end="00:46:10.369" style="s2">going to trust you know my husband more</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.279" end="00:46:12.559" style="s2">than I am going to trust someone you</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.369" end="00:46:14.630" style="s2">know a random stranger off of the street</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.559" end="00:46:17.869" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna trust his opinion more because</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.630" end="00:46:20.719" style="s2">I have a I have a more accurate you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.869" end="00:46:22.519" style="s2">I have I have a track record with him I</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.719" end="00:46:23.929" style="s2">know that that he&#39;s somebody that I can</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.519" end="00:46:27.679" style="s2">trump that that I think that his opinion</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.929" end="00:46:30.250" style="s2">I can trust on most things they&#39;re his</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.679" end="00:46:34.070" style="s2">choice of music maybe not so much</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.250" end="00:46:35.570" style="s2">but and so like that I&#39;m trying to I I</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.070" end="00:46:38.420" style="s2">want to understand your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.570" end="00:46:40.310" style="s2">because that that&#39;s that that was one</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.420" end="00:46:44.619" style="s2">that kind of found my brain went huh I</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.310" end="00:46:49.730" style="s2">don&#39;t understand well it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.619" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">who would you trust more if your husband</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.730" end="00:46:53.540" style="s2">hadn&#39;t looked at the bank account for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.440" end="00:46:56.800" style="s2">month on what the dollar amount is at</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.540" end="00:47:00.770" style="s2">your bank account or your bank&#39;s website</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.800" end="00:47:04.430" style="s2">so the bank&#39;s website is is the process</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.770" end="00:47:06.230" style="s2">as a system as opposed to your memory or</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.430" end="00:47:07.730" style="s2">your husband&#39;s memory of all the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.230" end="00:47:09.890" style="s2">deposits and withdrawals you&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.730" end="00:47:12.320" style="s2">since you started the account that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.890" end="00:47:15.560" style="s2">what that&#39;s the piece that we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.320" end="00:47:17.330" style="s2">for this type of decision-making that</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.560" end="00:47:19.310" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to make on these current</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.330" end="00:47:20.540" style="s2">problems we&#39;re doing it all out of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.310" end="00:47:23.960" style="s2">brains and our memories and our</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.540" end="00:47:27.020" style="s2">interpretations we don&#39;t have a written</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.960" end="00:47:30.830" style="s2">process of evaluating that information</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.020" end="00:47:33.290" style="s2">and synthesizing a decision so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.830" end="00:47:34.880" style="s2">the tool I&#39;m working on okay there are</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.290" end="00:47:39.130" style="s2">no current tools that do that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:39.130" style="s2">I like that example that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.890" end="00:47:49.430" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m gonna have to show just that</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.760" end="00:47:52.339" style="s2">one okay thank you yeah I can try to add</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.430" end="00:47:54.369" style="s2">to that because I agree the the process</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.339" end="00:47:58.369" style="s2">and is important and I&#39;ll try to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.369" end="00:48:04.810" style="s2">politics but it&#39;s um you know all all of</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.369" end="00:48:07.099" style="s2">this overlaps but the idea of process</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.810" end="00:48:08.750" style="s2">obviously is super important but the</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.099" end="00:48:10.780" style="s2">question is what process right so what</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.750" end="00:48:15.260" style="s2">comes to mind it for me is two things</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.780" end="00:48:17.810" style="s2">one is technocracy right technocracy is</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.260" end="00:48:19.760" style="s2">all about process and it&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.810" end="00:48:21.830" style="s2">you know it&#39;s about bureaucracy and</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.760" end="00:48:24.589" style="s2">rationalization and and having</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.830" end="00:48:26.089" style="s2">hierarchies and kind of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.589" end="00:48:31.160" style="s2">sense-making right i mean that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.089" end="00:48:34.660" style="s2">have already uh and and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.160" end="00:48:36.800" style="s2">things like the UN are supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.660" end="00:48:38.510" style="s2">support that but there&#39;s there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.800" end="00:48:41.320" style="s2">much tension between the kind of global</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.510" end="00:48:43.130" style="s2">order and the american-led</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.320" end="00:48:47.120" style="s2">you know very</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.130" end="00:48:48.950" style="s2">of that hmm um and then so so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.120" end="00:48:51.320" style="s2">tons and tons of critiques of</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.950" end="00:48:53.990" style="s2">technocracy going back the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.320" end="00:48:57.560" style="s2">last century it&#39;s it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.990" end="00:49:01.550" style="s2">brilliant discourse because it&#39;s um you</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.560" end="00:49:04.760" style="s2">know it subverts it this it continues</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.550" end="00:49:07.760" style="s2">the the kind of postmodern trend if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.760" end="00:49:09.170" style="s2">will of subverting the Enlightenment you</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.760" end="00:49:12.170" style="s2">know pointing out how the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.170" end="00:49:14.060" style="s2">goes into totalitarianism and then to</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.170" end="00:49:17.380" style="s2">bureaucracy and technocracy and all this</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.060" end="00:49:20.030" style="s2">but you know Elizabeth Warren is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.380" end="00:49:21.800" style="s2">technocratic Obama is a technocrat</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.030" end="00:49:24.710" style="s2">people who judge as a technocratic</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.800" end="00:49:25.970" style="s2">meaning that they they they are very</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.710" end="00:49:29.300" style="s2">process-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.970" end="00:49:33.910" style="s2">right but by and large they&#39;re nested in</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.300" end="00:49:36.110" style="s2">the a certain type of status quo process</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.910" end="00:49:39.350" style="s2">where they&#39;re being pulled from all</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.110" end="00:49:41.990" style="s2">sides and they don&#39;t really have a moral</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.350" end="00:49:44.660" style="s2">compass of their own they try to their</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.990" end="00:49:48.320" style="s2">their you know nominally pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.660" end="00:49:50.030" style="s2">people but but there&#39;s a lot lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.320" end="00:49:52.190" style="s2">hypocrisy there like like I said with</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.030" end="00:49:54.590" style="s2">being an anti-war activist in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.190" end="00:49:58.880" style="s2">military like like like Pete Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.590" end="00:50:01.600" style="s2">judge um you know went went to went to</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.880" end="00:50:03.980" style="s2">war which some call just a photo-op</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.600" end="00:50:05.660" style="s2">which which it may or may not have been</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.980" end="00:50:07.940" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter because he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.660" end="00:50:11.180" style="s2">anti-war and the end to be truly</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.940" end="00:50:14.900" style="s2">anti-war is such a complex like highly</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.180" end="00:50:16.700" style="s2">ethical you know position to take up so</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.900" end="00:50:18.320" style="s2">what is the answer to detect ocker see</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.700" end="00:50:20.930" style="s2">right what is the antidote to that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.320" end="00:50:27.290" style="s2">think it&#39;s this other process that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.930" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">alluding to that that you know going</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.290" end="00:50:33.320" style="s2">back to the civil rights movement Martin</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:35.120" style="s2">Luther King and every progressive a kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.320" end="00:50:36.890" style="s2">of leader that that has followed in his</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.120" end="00:50:40.340" style="s2">footsteps are about a different type of</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.890" end="00:50:41.600" style="s2">process than the technocratic one uh so</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.340" end="00:50:45.290" style="s2">we need to understand the difference</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.600" end="00:50:47.240" style="s2">there what is the other process called</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.290" end="00:50:48.440" style="s2">is it called somewhere I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.240" end="00:50:55.670" style="s2">avoid politics it&#39;s called Bernie</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.440" end="00:50:56.910" style="s2">Sanders but going going back to this</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.670" end="00:50:59.280" style="s2">idea of trust</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.910" end="00:51:01.800" style="s2">like Anthony Giddens is a famous</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:04.170" style="s2">sociologist and he said Trust is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.800" end="00:51:07.170" style="s2">lifeblood of modernity and this is back</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.170" end="00:51:09.180" style="s2">in the 90s right and and you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.170" end="00:51:13.470" style="s2">post 9/11 age we&#39;ve had virtually no</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.180" end="00:51:15.360" style="s2">trust and you know Obama was like a new</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.470" end="00:51:18.270" style="s2">hope and then you know the financial</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.360" end="00:51:21.330" style="s2">crisis is what he inherited and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.270" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">handle that satisfactorily for virtually</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.330" end="00:51:25.770" style="s2">anybody except the banks mm-hmm so you</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:27.570" style="s2">know again what is the process there</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.770" end="00:51:30.900" style="s2">he&#39;s being a technocrat he&#39;s being a</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.570" end="00:51:33.240" style="s2">compromiser a satisficer all these types</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.900" end="00:51:34.530" style="s2">of things and you know I give Obama and</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.240" end="00:51:37.710" style="s2">the benefit of the doubt he did the best</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.530" end="00:51:41.550" style="s2">job he could and he appeased a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.710" end="00:51:43.050" style="s2">people so he could remain popular except</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.550" end="00:51:45.840" style="s2">he was constantly under attack from</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.050" end="00:51:47.460" style="s2">people like Trump right like you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.840" end="00:51:49.710" style="s2">politics and also in our last 10 wins</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.460" end="00:51:53.190" style="s2">what I was I really do we&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.710" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">be doing um just to end by the hour so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.190" end="00:51:57.030" style="s2">always say I&#39;m going to that I doubt so</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:59.630" style="s2">let&#39;s take our we can each wrap it up</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.030" end="00:52:01.980" style="s2">for two minutes unless anyone has any</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.630" end="00:52:03.810" style="s2">closing questions or thoughts they want</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.980" end="00:52:06.180" style="s2">other people to I do have one closing</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.810" end="00:52:08.490" style="s2">question for Bentley going back to that</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.180" end="00:52:10.350" style="s2">processing process example just is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.490" end="00:52:12.630" style="s2">my brains trying to wrap it wrap my head</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.350" end="00:52:14.400" style="s2">around it so the example that popped</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.630" end="00:52:17.220" style="s2">into my head is say I woke up one</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:19.020" style="s2">morning and my account was overdrawn by</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.220" end="00:52:21.570" style="s2">a thousand dollars like all the money</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.020" end="00:52:22.920" style="s2">had been taken out and it said that it</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.570" end="00:52:27.090" style="s2">was came out of you know that it had</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.920" end="00:52:32.610" style="s2">been withdrawn by my husband&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.090" end="00:52:35.190" style="s2">debit card I trust if he tells me that</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.610" end="00:52:37.020" style="s2">he didn&#39;t do that I would question the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.190" end="00:52:38.640" style="s2">bank before I would question him I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.020" end="00:52:41.130" style="s2">question that that maybe our account had</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.640" end="00:52:43.740" style="s2">been hacked before I would question here</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.130" end="00:52:45.990" style="s2">yeah because it&#39;s an open system you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.740" end="00:52:48.720" style="s2">then look and see the inside you would</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.990" end="00:52:50.280" style="s2">know when to question that system and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:54.090" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a good failsafe is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.280" end="00:52:58.620" style="s2">our intuitions is a safety check on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.090" end="00:53:01.560" style="s2">system right but but if I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.620" end="00:53:04.020" style="s2">that trust with with my husband&#39;s attend</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.560" end="00:53:08.680" style="s2">I with him I wouldn&#39;t necessarily have</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.020" end="00:53:11.349" style="s2">the intuition to question that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.680" end="00:53:14.950" style="s2">yeah yeah there there needs to be trust</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.349" end="00:53:16.569" style="s2">between people as well and large groups</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.950" end="00:53:19.299" style="s2">of people and also you kind of build a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.569" end="00:53:20.470" style="s2">trust in people as they put inputs into</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.299" end="00:53:23.410" style="s2">the system you can see that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.470" end="00:53:25.270" style="s2">putting wise inputs so we could probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.410" end="00:53:26.799" style="s2">take that off a line that you like and</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.270" end="00:53:33.880" style="s2">get the more detail but that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.799" end="00:53:38.349" style="s2">very valuable insight I&#39;ll give my</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.880" end="00:53:39.819" style="s2">closing remarks last so I can as always</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.349" end="00:53:42.039" style="s2">so you can think about YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.819" end="00:53:46.930" style="s2">I&#39;ll pass so other people can give any</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.039" end="00:53:49.559" style="s2">closing remarks all right I&#39;ll just say</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.930" end="00:53:53.410" style="s2">you know if if steven pinker is right</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.559" end="00:53:55.119" style="s2">and we are already on a path to ending</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.410" end="00:53:57.960" style="s2">war I mean then we have nothing to worry</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.119" end="00:53:59.980" style="s2">about right but but I&#39;m a critic of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.960" end="00:54:02.680" style="s2">people like Pinker along with many</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.980" end="00:54:04.539" style="s2">others for being you know more than a</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.680" end="00:54:08.349" style="s2">bit myopic and sticking his head in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.539" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">sand about you know what&#39;s really going</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.349" end="00:54:13.779" style="s2">around going on around the world with</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:17.140" style="s2">existential threats and with you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.779" end="00:54:20.260" style="s2">progressive movements to to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.140" end="00:54:22.589" style="s2">that and I&#39;ll just double down on my</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.260" end="00:54:26.079" style="s2">point that like we need to commit to</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.589" end="00:54:28.930" style="s2">anti-war while also continuously being</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.079" end="00:54:31.809" style="s2">self-critical about about about that</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.930" end="00:54:35.140" style="s2">about that process and I think I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.809" end="00:54:37.390" style="s2">cuz I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been deeply buried in</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.140" end="00:54:40.660" style="s2">a lot of research for the past decade</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.390" end="00:54:42.549" style="s2">along these lines and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.660" end="00:54:43.960" style="s2">lonely path because a lot a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.549" end="00:54:46.119" style="s2">stuff is out there but it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.960" end="00:54:47.920" style="s2">talked about yet you know cuz we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.119" end="00:54:50.770" style="s2">still on that kind of sense-making path</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.920" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">towards some of those ideas that have</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.770" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">been out there for a long time thank you</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.480" end="00:55:05.020" style="s2">Eric you wanna close all marks sure I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.789" end="00:55:09.309" style="s2">go um I think you know I think Eric</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.020" end="00:55:14.589" style="s2">maybe you had mentioned it being naive</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.309" end="00:55:17.740" style="s2">to focus my perception it being naive to</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.589" end="00:55:19.829" style="s2">focus on the individual because what if</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.740" end="00:55:21.950" style="s2">if these systems are still there that</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.829" end="00:55:25.420" style="s2">nothing&#39;s going to change and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.950" end="00:55:30.020" style="s2">probably a distortion of what you said</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.420" end="00:55:33.410" style="s2">the thing that I have to ask the thing I</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.020" end="00:55:36.980" style="s2">asked myself on a daily basis is what do</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.410" end="00:55:39.349" style="s2">I have the power to change and I can</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.980" end="00:55:44.030" style="s2">have all of these conversations but</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.349" end="00:55:47.089" style="s2">unless I am able to build trust with</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.030" end="00:55:53.240" style="s2">someone in order to you know could to</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.089" end="00:55:55.099" style="s2">take action in the world then it you</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.240" end="00:55:57.349" style="s2">know that is the thing I have the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.099" end="00:55:59.059" style="s2">ability to affect and I find these</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.349" end="00:56:01.460" style="s2">conversations interesting and at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.059" end="00:56:05.540" style="s2">same time there&#39;s a part of me that kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.460" end="00:56:07.730" style="s2">of goes okay this just feels forgive my</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.540" end="00:56:12.200" style="s2">forgive this language but like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.730" end="00:56:16.700" style="s2">mental masturbation of trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.200" end="00:56:20.680" style="s2">these problems that we can&#39;t that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.700" end="00:56:24.680" style="s2">can&#39;t actually solve it in thought and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.680" end="00:56:26.630" style="s2">you take action by by taking action with</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.680" end="00:56:28.460" style="s2">people that you trust that&#39;s right I</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.630" end="00:56:30.440" style="s2">will come back to that time and time</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.460" end="00:56:32.119" style="s2">again of what is it that I have the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.440" end="00:56:37.940" style="s2">ability to change in my day to day life</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.119" end="00:56:40.549" style="s2">and how do i how do i affect that and</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.940" end="00:56:43.309" style="s2">the the best way I know how to affect</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.549" end="00:56:46.809" style="s2">that is by building trust with people in</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.309" end="00:56:52.460" style="s2">order to take action</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.809" end="00:56:53.690" style="s2">Magnus Eric yeah I&#39;ve got a few things</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.460" end="00:56:54.829" style="s2">first here is a bit of a distortion</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.690" end="00:56:56.569" style="s2">because I&#39;m actually all about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.829" end="00:56:58.130" style="s2">individual that&#39;s that that&#39;s where my</p>

<p begin="00:56:58.130" end="00:57:01.339" style="s2">individuals then things change as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.260" end="00:57:04.190" style="s2">consequence of that so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.339" end="00:57:08.299" style="s2">that&#39;s actually my whole thing but I do</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.190" end="00:57:09.530" style="s2">feel that in a way as you said it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.299" end="00:57:11.329" style="s2">form of masturbation because it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:57:12.589" end="00:57:15.829" style="s2">you know while part of the narratives to</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.450" end="00:57:17.660" style="s2">elect a president is how good a</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.829" end="00:57:18.109" style="s2">commander-in-chief is he going to be you</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.660" end="00:57:20.390" style="s2">know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.109" end="00:57:22.309" style="s2">this this whole thing is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.390" end="00:57:24.650" style="s2">way in which we evaluate the suitability</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.309" end="00:57:26.660" style="s2">of somebody for office right is their</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.650" end="00:57:28.910" style="s2">ability to fight wars how good are they</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.660" end="00:57:32.170" style="s2">going to be in a fight so you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.910" end="00:57:34.579" style="s2">do think that war does not end until</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.170" end="00:57:35.720" style="s2">there are just no one around who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.579" end="00:57:37.130" style="s2">prepared to sign up to be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.720" end="00:57:38.420" style="s2">soldier and there&#39;s no one around who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.130" end="00:57:39.140" style="s2">prepared to shoot a gun out of somebody</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.420" end="00:57:41.780" style="s2">else you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.140" end="00:57:43.490" style="s2">and and that is the only way that war</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.780" end="00:57:46.760" style="s2">stops and so yes it&#39;s all about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.490" end="00:57:48.980" style="s2">individual but trying to attack systems</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.760" end="00:57:51.020" style="s2">while the systems have all the guns and</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.980" end="00:57:53.210" style="s2">one guy in charge can let loose all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.020" end="00:57:57.200" style="s2">guns whenever they want it just seems to</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.210" end="00:58:01.130" style="s2">me to be absurd the notion of moving to</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.200" end="00:58:04.150" style="s2">a world without war is is it will be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.130" end="00:58:07.340" style="s2">byproduct of moving to a world full of</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.150" end="00:58:08.960" style="s2">actualized people right that it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.340" end="00:58:11.570" style="s2">goal in and of itself it will be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.960" end="00:58:13.690" style="s2">byproduct of a more meaningful goal</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.570" end="00:58:15.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of where I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.690" end="00:58:17.540" style="s2">thanks Eric um</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.440" end="00:58:18.740" style="s2">Remzi also give you a chance to if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.540" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">want a closing remark even though you</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.740" end="00:58:25.130" style="s2">haven&#39;t actually he spoke of it yet in</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:29.750" style="s2">this idea Kevin like what Eric just said</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.130" end="00:58:32.000" style="s2">and but one of the things that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.750" end="00:58:34.190" style="s2">really hear the conversation was the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.000" end="00:58:37.790" style="s2">war is a structure as a is a structural</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.190" end="00:58:39.530" style="s2">issue it affords until it&#39;s like any</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.790" end="00:58:41.089" style="s2">other game of sport parsnip let&#39;s think</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.530" end="00:58:42.290" style="s2">of like American football right you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.089" end="00:58:44.570" style="s2">got two teams who are coming and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.290" end="00:58:46.520" style="s2">playing by specific set of rules and you</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.570" end="00:58:48.349" style="s2">don&#39;t expect somebody one of the players</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.520" end="00:58:50.630" style="s2">to have a gun in their pocket and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.349" end="00:58:52.430" style="s2">shoot somebody and kill them and why</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.630" end="00:58:55.550" style="s2">because there are are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.430" end="00:58:58.130" style="s2">consequences from within the rules of</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.550" end="00:59:01.160" style="s2">the game and so there&#39;s other higher</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.130" end="00:59:03.140" style="s2">authorities as it were that are</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.160" end="00:59:05.750" style="s2">controlling those rules of the game and</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.140" end="00:59:07.040" style="s2">but that don&#39;t necessarily benefit those</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.750" end="00:59:09.920" style="s2">individuals were making the rules</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.040" end="00:59:12.320" style="s2">meaning the outcome of the game is going</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.920" end="00:59:13.970" style="s2">to be dependent upon clear rules that</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.320" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">everyone&#39;s already pre decided to find</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.970" end="00:59:20.030" style="s2">and so and because there&#39;s no group of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:22.430" style="s2">people who are in power we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.030" end="00:59:24.310" style="s2">cheat and allow that person to shoot</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.430" end="00:59:27.080" style="s2">somebody dead or grab the ball and</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.310" end="00:59:28.580" style="s2">circumvent those rules in and play</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.080" end="00:59:32.540" style="s2">outside of the rules for their own</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.580" end="00:59:36.619" style="s2">advantage means that they can&#39;t and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.540" end="00:59:39.020" style="s2">the the solution is structural and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.619" end="00:59:41.540" style="s2">so the game a as we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.020" end="00:59:44.480" style="s2">about is structural in what is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.540" end="00:59:46.040" style="s2">property its land its resources and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.480" end="00:59:47.660" style="s2">humans have always been fighting over</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.040" end="00:59:48.510" style="s2">land and resources I know this because</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.660" end="00:59:50.700" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.510" end="00:59:55.290" style="s2">was born we were in the crux of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.700" end="00:59:57.750" style="s2">crosshairs of Catholicism and in and in</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.290" end="01:00:00.600" style="s2">the Islam world and we&#39;ve always had to</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.750" end="01:00:02.670" style="s2">change religion base to join whatever</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.600" end="01:00:06.180" style="s2">team was to our advantage</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.670" end="01:00:09.930" style="s2">so that we can survive and so but if we</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.180" end="01:00:12.650" style="s2">are to be able to prevent war there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.930" end="01:00:15.060" style="s2">got to be some level of only</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.650" end="01:00:18.090" style="s2">individualized power but that there is</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.060" end="01:00:21.240" style="s2">overall a group set of rules that no one</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.090" end="01:00:23.970" style="s2">no there&#39;s no larger Authority or group</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.240" end="01:00:27.060" style="s2">Authority like a nation who cancer can</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.970" end="01:00:29.970" style="s2">be an authority to change the rules and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.060" end="01:00:32.790" style="s2">in to go out play outside those rules</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.970" end="01:00:34.950" style="s2">that&#39;s what we have today I mean we just</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.790" end="01:00:36.990" style="s2">violated the rules by assassinating</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.950" end="01:00:41.130" style="s2">somebody so that means there are no</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.990" end="01:00:43.020" style="s2">rules and so until we change the actual</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.130" end="01:00:44.910" style="s2">explode consequences to breaking them</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.020" end="01:00:46.620" style="s2">but yeah of course they&#39;re always going</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.910" end="01:00:49.770" style="s2">to be consequences but it&#39;s a power</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.620" end="01:00:53.070" style="s2">dynamic Eric as we all know but needless</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.770" end="01:00:55.590" style="s2">to say so until we identify a new nation</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.070" end="01:00:58.200" style="s2">that neuters power down to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.590" end="01:01:00.810" style="s2">individual level and then we trust the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.200" end="01:01:03.420" style="s2">game then it&#39;s okay you I don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.810" end="01:01:05.160" style="s2">people I never will I don&#39;t care you</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.420" end="01:01:06.660" style="s2">know as some of course we you want to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.160" end="01:01:08.490" style="s2">able to trust people but you only trust</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.660" end="01:01:10.950" style="s2">them so far as you know that they can</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.490" end="01:01:13.050" style="s2">play by the rules and that they&#39;re bound</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.950" end="01:01:14.670" style="s2">by the rules as soon as somebody&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.050" end="01:01:16.260" style="s2">bound by the rules then you can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.670" end="01:01:18.720" style="s2">them anymore and then and then it</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.260" end="01:01:21.120" style="s2">changes the dynamic of the game you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.720" end="01:01:23.730" style="s2">if you watch any of the gangster movies</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.120" end="01:01:25.320" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s like a classic example of</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.730" end="01:01:27.960" style="s2">you know having rules and not having</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.320" end="01:01:30.510" style="s2">rules and Wars is another byproduct of</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.960" end="01:01:33.230" style="s2">that and so none that&#39;s never gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.510" end="01:01:36.480" style="s2">change until we get clear rules</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.230" end="01:01:39.870" style="s2">regarding property resources how all of</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.480" end="01:01:42.060" style="s2">that is valued and distributed and once</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.870" end="01:01:44.970" style="s2">we do that then we can figure out the</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.060" end="01:01:49.790" style="s2">governance part but until we do there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.970" end="01:01:49.790" style="s2">not going to be any solution to war ever</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.210" end="01:01:56.780" style="s2">want a chance to do those are marks</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.710" end="01:01:56.780" style="s2">right Mike thanks for coming</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.050" end="01:02:01.950" style="s2">no I don&#39;t know anything at all great</p>

<p begin="01:02:11.220" end="01:02:16.470" style="s2">I think these conversations are how we</p>
