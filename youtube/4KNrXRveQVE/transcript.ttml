<p begin="00:01:44.240" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">given that we set out for these metamark</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.200" end="00:01:50.479" style="s2">deep dives</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:52.840" style="s2">stuff that we&#39;re not usually presenting</p>

<p begin="00:01:58.399" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">and exploring on my own</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:08.800" style="s2">but haven&#39;t really integrated into uh</p>

<p begin="00:02:08.800" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">and i guess um the the main thing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.840" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">makes the meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">these different aspects and things is uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">is basically that they&#39;re based on the</p>

<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">engine or base philosophy right um</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">so we live in a kind of a renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:30.800" style="s2">this was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">very good point uh made by uh by a</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">time we&#39;re in i read one article it says</p>

<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">like 2 500 years ago another</p>

<p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:36.080" style="s2">try and gather all the little pearls</p>

<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">um this particular theme i</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">if we had four teams lined up in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">pipeline so we have um</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:07.520" style="s2">we had aesthetics in the arts last time</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">and then we have spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.520" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">and we have gender and sexuality and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">then we have religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">and spirituality in a way is close to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">religion so</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:22.160" style="s2">i the original idea was to take that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">as a third but it made more sense in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">way to do it as the second</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">and the reason um is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">actually it connects beautifully to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:35.440" style="s2">aesthetics there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">nice bridge between the aesthetics of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.440" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">the arts and spirituality on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">and on the other hand we can do</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">more fun stuff um and get into</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">some more visceral stuff i guess in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">gender part if we have spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">covered first</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2">so i have a powerpoint presentation um</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">one way of grasping it</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">is that it has to do with subjective</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">now subjective states as we discuss in</p>

<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">i guess not all of these um are</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">resonate with all of us</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">but hopefully each of us can get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:11:00.880" style="s2">of some of them right</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">we like what what does magnificence feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.880" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite correct to say that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">magnificence is an emotion</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.880" end="00:11:12.560" style="s2">and nor would it be it would be quite a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">reduction to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.560" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">that all of these things like is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:19.360" style="s2">magnificent is it</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">happiness well they&#39;re positive one</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.360" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">sense or another right</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.880" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">let&#39;s see um</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">they&#39;re positive uh in one sense or</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:36.160" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">uh but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.160" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">um they&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">in and of themselves happiness right</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.079" end="00:11:49.440" style="s2">they are high states there are different</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.360" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">different experiences that we can have</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:53.920" style="s2">within the range of high</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.440" end="00:11:53.920" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.040" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">so so there is a thread to them they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:06.160" style="s2">all positive experiences in some</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:06.880" style="s2">way but they&#39;re all quite subtle and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.160" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.880" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">to to name and grasp and point out and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:16.880" style="s2">um and they&#39;re fairly rare</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">unfortunately we would like to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.880" end="00:12:23.760" style="s2">lives imbued with all of these qualities</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:27.279" style="s2">and we would wish for one another</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.760" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">on a good day that</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.279" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">these qualities uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">were manifested in the lives of others</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:40.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s just to get at</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.959" end="00:12:47.360" style="s2">what spirituality really really is</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:51.040" style="s2">it has to do with these high state</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.360" end="00:12:54.560" style="s2">qualities we&#39;ll get to this in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.040" end="00:12:58.320" style="s2">so there is a connection here between</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.560" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">these qualities and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.320" end="00:13:03.200" style="s2">and the aesthetic that we discussed last</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">time so aesthetic as we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.200" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">often comes first in a metameme</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">or the arts they tend to breach the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">long long before the metabeam becomes</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:18.800" style="s2">conscious</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">ideas and ideals and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.800" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">much much less</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.920" end="00:13:28.000" style="s2">manifest structures of society and</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">much less norms in society and embodied</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.000" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">experience of the people</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.200" end="00:13:35.440" style="s2">so there is something about all of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:37.760" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.440" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">which link it intuitively to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.760" end="00:13:42.160" style="s2">aesthetic and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">it is that the aesthetic always whether</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">a rain dance or um</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">paintings of animals on a cave on a cape</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">wall</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2">or the ceiling of a mighty temple</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:14:00.399" style="s2">they all grasp for something intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:03.600" style="s2">for something expressive</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.399" end="00:14:05.120" style="s2">which you still cannot express correctly</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.600" end="00:14:08.800" style="s2">in words which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.120" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">outside of the symbolic word word</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">world and somehow points at the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">at something you wouldn&#39;t want to ruin</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:21.199" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:24.240" style="s2">that innately grabs your respect</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.199" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">um and of course they have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">the right hemisphere stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">um in the brain this</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:33.199" style="s2">famous master in the hem and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">emissary</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.199" end="00:14:39.440" style="s2">um division of a right and left brain or</p>

<p begin="00:14:50.240" end="00:14:56.320" style="s2">and they all relate to somehow</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">expressing a depth to existence</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.320" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">something that is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:04.720" style="s2">the obvious something</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:07.199" style="s2">either in the direction of beauty which</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:11.120" style="s2">is of course the the most obvious</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.199" end="00:15:14.160" style="s2">expression of aesthetics but also um</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.120" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">truth-seeking or mystery as uh as this</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.160" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">kind of depth this should actually be</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:25.199" style="s2">or tragedy that you care about</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:28.800" style="s2">the brokenness of the world and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.199" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">inherent suffering of being and beings</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.800" end="00:15:33.199" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:33.199" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:42.240" style="s2">all of the aesthetic movements have come</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.399" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">from the um from frequenting</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.240" end="00:15:50.079" style="s2">from frequenting these higher states</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">somehow there&#39;s a connection between</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.079" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">reaching into these higher states and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">being in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:56.880" style="s2">sense of intuitive wholeness and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:16:00.720" style="s2">expressing that on in the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.880" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">as aesthetics and that you can do</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.720" end="00:16:05.759" style="s2">before you actually formalize the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to be many people to</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.759" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">do it it&#39;s enough that it happens within</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:11.199" style="s2">one artist and then it comes out as some</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.199" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">cultural innovation or expression</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.399" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">which is why you then express</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.839" end="00:16:23.279" style="s2">often things that are beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">confines of your time</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.279" end="00:16:30.160" style="s2">or your society and you can reach into</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:30.639" style="s2">later value memes or emerging value</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:37.440" style="s2">that you haven&#39;t been fed as a kid</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">and i mean there are clear examples of</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.440" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">this um</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">if we look at the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:47.199" style="s2">um these qualities again like subtlety</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:52.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.199" end="00:16:52.320" style="s2">it take a child musical g&#39;s like uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">billy eilish for instance so uh billy</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.680" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">eilish</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">she&#39;s from california i guess and uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">and she expresses um a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">well in in her lyrics and stuff a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">things that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:13.600" style="s2">um well much too mature for for</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.199" end="00:17:14.240" style="s2">for a kid like that uh and if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.600" end="00:17:15.839" style="s2">her or if</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.240" end="00:17:18.160" style="s2">interviewers ask her about it she just</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">says well i just felt like it</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.160" end="00:17:21.439" style="s2">but if you look at her on stage you</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">notice there&#39;s a subtlety to her</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.439" end="00:17:25.439" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:27.199" style="s2">um which i i can&#39;t really uh i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.439" end="00:17:28.559" style="s2">really embody that myself but but she</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">follows the music</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.559" end="00:17:33.919" style="s2">very very very subtly and and uh she</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:36.640" style="s2">gets into these high states</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.919" end="00:17:37.840" style="s2">and from there she can download the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">outer reaches</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.840" end="00:17:42.320" style="s2">of our culture and then express it in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.000" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">way that makes a lot of people feel</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.799" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so big right</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.960" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">yeah so so that&#39;s just to point out the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:55.039" style="s2">bridge here</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">but now we&#39;re delving into spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.039" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">so we&#39;ve already kind of said this um</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a scale of subjective states</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">and uh i didn&#39;t make this picture myself</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.320" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">a friend made it eric newton he&#39;s uh his</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:16.320" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">therapist in uh in new orleans and he</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.320" end="00:18:21.679" style="s2">actually uses these states in his</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">uh it&#39;s uh from the states are from our</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.679" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">books</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:29.039" style="s2">um but uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:31.039" style="s2">uh but he uses this in his uh therapy</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.039" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">and actually he has spread this to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.039" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">group of four therapists and</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">from what i hear it&#39;s actually been</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:41.200" style="s2">revolutionizing their practice</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">because they can they get a skill which</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.200" end="00:18:45.360" style="s2">is much more</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">specific than just saying how are you on</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:48.480" style="s2">a scale from one to ten which is always</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">relative and people will say well i</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.480" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">guess a seven</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">um you name some qualities um</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:18:58.559" style="s2">and the idea of these subjective states</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">is simply that</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.559" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">at any time it&#39;ll feel like something to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">be you</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">so uh well thomas nagle um</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:08.480" style="s2">famously asked what is it like to be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">bat</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">in this likely it is like something can</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">be a bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:21.760" style="s2">um but being is never indifferent</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:25.039" style="s2">there&#39;s always a sense of good or bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.760" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">to it um and uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.039" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">on most</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.960" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">in most of our time that we&#39;re alive</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.480" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">will be actually at the state seven or</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:39.760" style="s2">most of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">um or plus minus a couple of states here</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.760" end="00:19:43.440" style="s2">these are the states of everyday life as</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.679" end="00:19:48.640" style="s2">it were</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.440" end="00:19:48.640" style="s2">um so um</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">like and to be very honest unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:19:58.640" style="s2">we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:20:01.280" style="s2">normally in a uh on any</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.640" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">day of the week most people will not be</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.280" end="00:20:04.799" style="s2">at eight</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">satisfied with everything just just a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.799" end="00:20:11.039" style="s2">basic okayness</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:12.960" style="s2">um we&#39;ll tend to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.039" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">some little unease somewhere in our</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.960" end="00:20:19.039" style="s2">system especially if we&#39;re adults</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:22.480" style="s2">because we&#39;ll have uh we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.039" end="00:20:24.559" style="s2">um accumulated with so many little</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.480" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">traumas and hurts and insecurities and</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.559" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">worries that there&#39;s always something</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">and nagging us a little bit and now and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:30.799" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:33.200" style="s2">that&#39;ll let go and we&#39;re in a higher</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.799" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">state satisfied everything is just</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.200" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">genuinely okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:39.280" style="s2">like life&#39;s supposed to be but then to</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">be honest we also</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:46.840" style="s2">quite often fall down below</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:49.919" style="s2">uh the the seven and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.840" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">at um</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.919" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">and and we&#39;re at um uneasy</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:58.799" style="s2">we&#39;re genuinely feeling some unease or</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.880" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">some like something that affects us</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:04.640" style="s2">that in a way that that we can tell that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:05.120" style="s2">uh well we&#39;re a little bit out of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.640" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.120" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">we have a headache we&#39;re a bit tired</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">etc etc and we can go to very uneasy so</p>

<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:15.280" style="s2">real anxiety going on but then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">still in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.280" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">in the scope of what everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">usually feel like</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">feels like so 99 of us 99</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:26.240" style="s2">of the time are going to be in these</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">middle range states</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.240" end="00:21:33.440" style="s2">very uneasy uneasy somewhat uneasy</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">satisfied lively but</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.440" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">but somewhere along somewhere around</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:40.480" style="s2">lively like life doesn&#39;t really get</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.480" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">than that normal life doesn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">i mean you&#39;ll be at the party</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">and just for once everything is perfect</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">you some some friends you wouldn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:22:00.559" style="s2">were there</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.280" end="00:22:01.679" style="s2">uh surprise you uh you&#39;re getting a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.559" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">nice flow</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.679" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">you just feel genuinely alive and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:08.240" style="s2">you just feel happy to be connected with</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">people you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:15.360" style="s2">fun all worries are gone gone gone but</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">there is something beyond that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.360" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">not all people experience these higher</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:23.120" style="s2">states that are beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:26.400" style="s2">and they will genuinely not believe</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.120" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">that they exist but they do and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.400" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:31.679" style="s2">spirituality is real because</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:34.799" style="s2">spirituality in this definition</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.679" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">is simply that which</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.799" end="00:22:41.679" style="s2">corresponds to these</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">four highest states so</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.679" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">what happens if your heart blows open</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">and you feel joyous and full of light</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:53.120" style="s2">maybe in a moment where you&#39;re deeply in</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.120" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">and you actually get it to work you</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">actually get</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">whoever you&#39;re deeply in love with</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">wonderful</p>

<p begin="00:23:04.880" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">it&#39;s like something in reality itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">shifts right</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">or you&#39;re super super inspired</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:17.600" style="s2">by a deep deep purpose and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">contemplate on it and how you can make</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.600" end="00:23:24.400" style="s2">this happen in your life and you open up</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:28.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of vastness or obliges</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.400" end="00:23:28.799" style="s2">just openness just clarity</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.840" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s really as far as my</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.960" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">my own spiritual experience would go um</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">but we do know that there are saints and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">sages</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:49.120" style="s2">um and well maybe not in the moral sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:50.480" style="s2">i&#39;d be agnostic about that or highly</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.120" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">skeptical about it but</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.480" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2">but but there are people who experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">a profound love for all</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:00.880" style="s2">that is and a lot of people have these</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:04.400" style="s2">experiences in</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:06.159" style="s2">psychedelic in psychedelic context of</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.400" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.159" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">there are also experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:16.400" style="s2">enlightenment just full</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">super being or whatever um and for most</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.400" end="00:24:21.039" style="s2">people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:24.880" style="s2">again only on dmt trips etc but um</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.039" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2">um but but these are possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.880" end="00:24:32.720" style="s2">so what i mean when i say spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">is whatever pertains to</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:37.279" style="s2">these highest states these states that</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">beyond um</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:44.840" style="s2">that are beyond what we experience in</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:48.880" style="s2">everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.840" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2">um and they um</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.880" end="00:24:55.120" style="s2">they can be</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">expressed in life and that is also then</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.120" end="00:24:59.679" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s spirituality is nurturing these</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.679" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:04.320" style="s2">getting to know them growing the</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.320" end="00:25:07.919" style="s2">to be in these states transmitting these</p>

<p begin="00:25:07.919" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">and expressing these states through</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:15.600" style="s2">for instance artistic work but it can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:17.430" style="s2">through other things as well it can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.600" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">through service</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.430" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">there&#39;s bhakta yoga for instance it can</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">be through</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">it can be through truth seeking it can</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">be through a purpose a divine purpose</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.159" end="00:25:34.960" style="s2">or through the spiritual practice itself</p>

<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">and and there&#39;s like a real</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.520" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a real difference there</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">because fundamentally what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">spiritual it means to have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">relationships to these states right</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.279" end="00:25:56.640" style="s2">so you can be religious but not</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.880" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">spiritual it can be spiritual but not</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.640" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">religious but i&#39;m not too fond of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">distinction as as we&#39;ll get to in</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:09.039" style="s2">like hopefully in a future episode</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">um but um</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.039" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">um yeah the the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">terrible or the tragic part is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:27.520" style="s2">since these states are so rare</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">and maybe only manifest the minority of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.520" end="00:26:31.200" style="s2">the population</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">and if they do it manifest they can do</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.200" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">so rarely</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:39.600" style="s2">do it so rarely that people actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">forget about it then</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.600" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">um most people won&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">in spirituality so so they say i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:48.960" style="s2">believe in god i don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:51.440" style="s2">religions</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.960" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">but it&#39;s a terrible baby to be throwing</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.440" end="00:26:54.400" style="s2">out with the bathwater</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:57.200" style="s2">that you&#39;re also throwing out</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.400" end="00:26:59.760" style="s2">spirituality which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.200" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">in terms of without saying anything</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.760" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">about the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">um the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:09.660" style="s2">presuppositions that you have about</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">reality or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.660" end="00:27:13.840" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">but it is real that people have these</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.840" end="00:27:18.840" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:21.520" style="s2">and if in that sense spirituality is</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.840" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.520" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">and most people won&#39;t believe it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">nevertheless we may need</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">that spirituality and we may need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:38.320" style="s2">garner its forces and harness its forces</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:41.360" style="s2">to um to resolve a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:45.120" style="s2">issues of our time and the challenges</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.360" end="00:27:45.120" style="s2">and to have the best possible lives</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.840" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">um so one way</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:58.080" style="s2">of grasping this is in the term</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">of cosmo eroticism so</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.080" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">um cosmo eroticism means</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.679" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">falling in love with life or it means</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:12.960" style="s2">um loving the experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:12.960" style="s2">or suchness or isness of life itself</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.200" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">and i thus placed it on a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">sort of hierarchy that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.159" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">eroticism is actually at the center</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:28.720" style="s2">um wilbur and others have recently been</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.720" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">they&#39;ve talking about growing up and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">showing up</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:38.000" style="s2">and waking up for a while</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:40.000" style="s2">and cleaning up but they&#39;ve recently</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.000" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">added a fifth it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.000" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">opening up and it particularly</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">corresponds to this to this</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">eroticism to um</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:58.159" style="s2">to feeling truly alive</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:29:01.760" style="s2">to genuinely enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.159" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">the experience of things</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.760" end="00:29:08.320" style="s2">so meta-modern spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:12.799" style="s2">accepts that spirituality exists</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.320" end="00:29:16.000" style="s2">and then posits that me eroticism</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.799" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">and the falling in love with life</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.000" end="00:29:20.320" style="s2">is a primary goal and this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:24.840" style="s2">primary goal</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.320" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">before compassion and even before</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.840" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">transcendence this is important because</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:33.840" style="s2">look at it how much</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:34.559" style="s2">is our compassion worth let&#39;s say i</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.840" end="00:29:38.080" style="s2">meditate</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.559" end="00:29:40.960" style="s2">on the suffering of others and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.080" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">i try to be compassionate but my own</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.960" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">does not have that fullness of</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:51.279" style="s2">it it&#39;s gonna be almost all but</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:53.919" style="s2">impossible for me</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.279" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">to wish for a fullness of the heart and</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.919" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">of experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:30:00.640" style="s2">and and the love of life if i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:05.840" style="s2">it myself</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:08.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s like a foundation for compassion</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">in turn transcendence going beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.320" end="00:30:12.960" style="s2">self and going beyond</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:14.880" style="s2">any particular identification and going</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.960" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">beyond</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">any worldly desires</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">in turn needs to build on both</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:26.240" style="s2">erraticism</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">and compassion because</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.240" end="00:30:29.679" style="s2">well let&#39;s say i have a transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">goal</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.679" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">but i let it override simple compassion</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:37.760" style="s2">or relatedness</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">to you well</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.760" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">then i&#39;m it&#39;s that that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:45.919" style="s2">pretty severe form of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:45.919" style="s2">of spiritual bypassing</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">so we have to in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.679" end="00:30:54.880" style="s2">way of grasping spirituality where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:58.000" style="s2">centering out the higher states</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.880" end="00:30:59.039" style="s2">which are always experienced by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.000" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">experiencer</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.039" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">we have to focus on this cosmo eroticism</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:10.240" style="s2">first we have to create</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:10.240" style="s2">this fullness of life</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:20.960" style="s2">so that leaves us with a work of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.399" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">spiritual awakening which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.960" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">somewhat different i suppose from</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">just meditating uh and uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">going for that transcendence or or just</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">cultivating that compassion</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">also worthy goals but maybe not where</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.760" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">where the core should be of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:42.159" style="s2">spiritual project</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">erotic in this sense of course life</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.159" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">force</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">aliveness carnality power and power is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:51.600" style="s2">positive thing it means</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:53.519" style="s2">to create and as we said creation always</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.600" end="00:31:57.360" style="s2">as i said in the last episode</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.519" end="00:31:59.679" style="s2">creation always implies destruction</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.360" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">so so the power to decide over life and</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:02.799" style="s2">death or what exists or not but</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">everybody wants</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.799" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">power over their own life</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:09.519" style="s2">and we don&#39;t like to be powerless and we</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:13.679" style="s2">want to feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.519" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">empowered there are of course</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.679" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">a lot of uh a lot of bad ways this can</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:21.360" style="s2">show up</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:25.679" style="s2">and if if our ira if our erotic</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.360" end="00:32:29.519" style="s2">core is frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.679" end="00:32:31.600" style="s2">energetic flows that we feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.519" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">alive in our bodies we just feel that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:36.720" style="s2">can breathe</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">that we can feel a fullness of existence</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.720" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">lightness presence</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:44.960" style="s2">and in a sense just an advanced very</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:44.960" style="s2">general sense happiness</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:51.120" style="s2">but why aren&#39;t i mean and we all know</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.640" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">this from when we were little kids</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">uh before we had accumulated enough</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:59.360" style="s2">trauma</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.120" end="00:33:01.919" style="s2">uh that at least sometimes christmas</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.360" end="00:33:03.600" style="s2">would really really really really feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.919" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">like christmas</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.600" end="00:33:07.279" style="s2">uh well sorry if this doesn&#39;t apply to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">you personally but i&#39;m sure you can find</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.279" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">um some corresponding experience but</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">i if i go back to early childhood</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">memories i remember here</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:21.919" style="s2">um like on uh when</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">when christmas was nearing up and when</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:26.559" style="s2">this was when i was four or</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:27.440" style="s2">something and i just look at the redness</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.559" end="00:33:30.799" style="s2">of one of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.440" end="00:33:34.399" style="s2">uh christmas shiny christmas balls</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.799" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s just like my whole existence is</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.399" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">just flow</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">overflowing with this loving um</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:44.399" style="s2">um just this mood</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:47.440" style="s2">or sense that it&#39;s so real that</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.399" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">christmas is happening for instance</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.440" end="00:33:51.200" style="s2">but then of course we we get worn out we</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:55.440" style="s2">have seen them in</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.200" end="00:33:59.039" style="s2">the same experiences before um</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.440" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">we have uh apprehensions because we know</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:02.399" style="s2">there are there are risks when we open</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:05.679" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.399" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">um so so we&#39;re blocked by all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.679" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">traumas</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.159" end="00:34:15.040" style="s2">all sorts of little wounds all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">contradictions within ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.040" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">so to get to the higher states</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">we need to of course practice on those</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:23.919" style="s2">or or create</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">opportunities and situations and rituals</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.919" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">and the rest of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">but we primarily need to heal our cosmo</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2">erotic core</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">which cannot ignore things like</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:37.599" style="s2">sexuality and just our</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:37.599" style="s2">will and want to be happy</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">so looking closer at that trauma</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">um so in um</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">in integral circles they they use these</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.879" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">um these four</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">bodies as they call them from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">um which are imported from from uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">new religion really and and uh and uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.760" end="00:35:16.240" style="s2">mystical practices</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">and they call them the gross body which</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.240" end="00:35:19.599" style="s2">would be like</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">just the sense that i have like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.599" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">sitting on the chair</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">um i uh um</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:28.960" style="s2">i can feel a little bit dry in my mouth</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">because i&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.960" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">i can feel a certain tension here and</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.359" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s obvious that the gross</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">body is obvious</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:45.680" style="s2">in every moment however</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:48.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot lot more going on</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.680" end="00:35:50.480" style="s2">if i if we examine it a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">closely</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.480" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">so if you look at beyond the gross body</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">you have all these flows</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.320" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">of emotions and feelings and moods</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">that are also just in subtler sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:11.920" style="s2">bodily sensations</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">they&#39;re just not as obvious um and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.920" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t necessarily be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:20.480" style="s2">locate them in your body</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">um sometimes you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.480" end="00:36:24.839" style="s2">uh so so maybe right now if i look in i</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.160" end="00:36:27.440" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.839" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">feel well there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">nervousness</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:32.640" style="s2">going on but i i mean that&#39;s my way of</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.800" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">naming it but there&#39;s like a very very</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:37.520" style="s2">subtle sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:40.320" style="s2">tension there is uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">there is a a bit of eagerness pressing</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.320" end="00:36:45.240" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:46.560" style="s2">there is a bit of like focus and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.240" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">concentration</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.560" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">and all of these things are going on at</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:53.440" style="s2">the same time now</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">beyond that there is another layer</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.440" end="00:37:00.320" style="s2">of experience which is how</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">the whole of reality around myself</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.320" end="00:37:07.599" style="s2">is felt at this particular moment</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">so that is what&#39;s called the causal body</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.599" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">and um so</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:15.760" style="s2">and then and here i mean the language</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:18.079" style="s2">really breaks down it really breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.760" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">you can&#39;t name it but for me for</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.079" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">instance it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of a crack up there and</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:26.560" style="s2">you can kind of sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">i can sense the whole thing is a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.560" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">bit wobbly but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">at the same time it&#39;s it&#39;s big and open</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">and sometimes it feels contracted like</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">jail</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">and you could go beyond that i can go</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.839" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">the non-dual realm which is that just</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">the quality of business or suchness or</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:52.000" style="s2">being or i am-ness itself</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:55.680" style="s2">uh and all of those these</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.000" end="00:37:56.720" style="s2">are always ever present now it&#39;s mistake</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.680" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">actually i would say</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.720" end="00:38:04.160" style="s2">to call them bodies because it misleads</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:07.599" style="s2">the reader um what they are</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:10.240" style="s2">in my vocabulary is they are layers</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.599" end="00:38:11.680" style="s2">of phenomenology phenology phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.240" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.680" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">the direct experience of the now the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">phenomena as they show up in first</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">person experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">and there are different layers of depth</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">to that phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:30.800" style="s2">some obvious and in the foreground</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:31.680" style="s2">and others less obvious and in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.800" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.680" end="00:38:39.040" style="s2">but here&#39;s the crux they become more</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:42.640" style="s2">significant to our inner states</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.040" end="00:38:46.320" style="s2">the deeper we go so</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.640" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">for instance let&#39;s say i feel totally at</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.320" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">peace the world feels big and vast and</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:53.760" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:55.760" style="s2">and i have no fear and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.760" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">and everything just flows beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.760" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">through my body</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.800" end="00:39:03.200" style="s2">but i have a terrible tummy ache</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">will i be unhappy will i be suffering</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.200" end="00:39:09.520" style="s2">no the gross body</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:11.920" style="s2">suffers but it is within</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.520" end="00:39:13.440" style="s2">the larger embrace of the subtle body</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.920" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">and the causal body</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.440" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">which are healed and at peace and in</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:21.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.119" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">in that case i don&#39;t really suffer</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.040" end="00:39:24.320" style="s2">likewise you can turn this around you</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:28.160" style="s2">can say</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.320" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">um you can say that um</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.160" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">we&#39;re at a party we&#39;re having fun</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:36.160" style="s2">we&#39;re eating wonderful cake we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:38.160" style="s2">drinking the best whiskey ever</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">but we feel empty inside and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.160" end="00:39:43.680" style="s2">something nagging at us</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.520" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">and we feel unsure about</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.680" end="00:39:47.359" style="s2">whether reality is a good or bad place</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:49.520" style="s2">or even</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.359" end="00:39:51.520" style="s2">maybe we have a profound existential</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.520" end="00:39:52.880" style="s2">fear whether or not this is reality at</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.520" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.880" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">which would be a pathology at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">non-dual</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:40:02.560" style="s2">level um</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">and of course these relate and then of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:07.040" style="s2">course i&#39;m not happy</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:10.960" style="s2">in any profound or deeper sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.040" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">so there there&#39;s an increasing</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.960" end="00:40:18.079" style="s2">um scale here of</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">what we might want to address</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.079" end="00:40:21.200" style="s2">as we delve deeper into spirituality and</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.200" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">um the higher states have to do of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.319" end="00:40:29.520" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.440" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">with movements which are harmonic</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.520" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">and in resonance at the higher at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">deeper</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">layers of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:43.280" style="s2">phenomenology um so and</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:45.760" style="s2">and they&#39;re ever present but to notice</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.280" end="00:40:48.400" style="s2">them is a kind of involution</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.760" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">so when we&#39;re kids we&#39;re just really</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.400" end="00:40:51.359" style="s2">aware</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:53.760" style="s2">of the gross body and the other things</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.359" end="00:40:56.960" style="s2">just kind of are in the background</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.760" end="00:40:57.520" style="s2">um but then we can be better and better</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.960" end="00:41:00.319" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">become better and better recognizing and</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.319" end="00:41:04.240" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">and responding to the qualities present</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.240" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">within those other deeper layers</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:10.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s a kind of involution then</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.720" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.160" end="00:41:16.160" style="s2">that we kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a subject object thing we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.160" end="00:41:20.640" style="s2">um extract ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:22.880" style="s2">from the concreteness of one experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.640" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">and see the the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.880" end="00:41:28.960" style="s2">larger subtler experience within which</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.079" end="00:41:28.960" style="s2">that arises</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.680" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">so trauma often</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:39.839" style="s2">very often has to do with a subtle body</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:44.640" style="s2">um very often it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.839" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">um with just</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.640" end="00:41:50.720" style="s2">our hearts tensing up on a subtle level</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.880" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">and then never fully opening to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.720" end="00:41:55.599" style="s2">happiness never fully opening to love</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">never fully opening to an erotic</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.599" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">exchange</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:01.040" style="s2">under fully opening um to the joy of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.160" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">friendship</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.040" end="00:42:08.480" style="s2">to the beauty of a wilderness um site</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">to the intuition of a work or a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.480" end="00:42:12.480" style="s2">that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:13.119" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to manifest in our</p>

<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">we&#39;re blocked kind of let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">so how what do these blocks feel like</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">now we get into</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:30.400" style="s2">if we go a few previous here</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:33.200" style="s2">now we go into the lower states here</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.400" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">um the ones that are below the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.200" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">experience of everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:42.480" style="s2">where which are nightmarish</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:44.240" style="s2">and which we also fairly rarely</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:48.240" style="s2">experience but that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.240" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">the the seriousness of reality</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">um so reality is a cosmic joke but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.800" end="00:42:53.839" style="s2">also very very very dead serious and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.839" end="00:42:58.640" style="s2">reason it is very very dead serious is</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.800" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">because of the real potential and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.640" end="00:43:02.800" style="s2">ever-present</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:03.520" style="s2">potential of the lower states so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.800" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.520" end="00:43:07.040" style="s2">existence of the lower states sets us up</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:10.160" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.040" end="00:43:12.800" style="s2">uh very very very high stakes</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.160" end="00:43:14.720" style="s2">in life and in existence and in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.800" end="00:43:17.440" style="s2">universe which is why we have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:19.359" style="s2">be religious about the universe um or</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.440" end="00:43:20.000" style="s2">and our place in it because we have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.359" end="00:43:24.400" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.000" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">into account that hell exists for real</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">um so going into these lower states i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:30.160" style="s2">going to go through them a little bit</p>

<p begin="00:46:09.520" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">catapulted up to a high state and this</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.599" end="00:46:14.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:14.400" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.079" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">george and buddhism for instance or or</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">tibetan buddhism you have all these</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.560" end="00:46:24.240" style="s2">pictures of</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">a monster which you face up and then it</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">becomes up</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">and then becomes a saint or your friend</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">or or</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">an angel of some sort um</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">and the the monster is illusory</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.880" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">uh but nevertheless it&#39;s there and you</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:43.040" style="s2">have to go through it</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:47.599" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.040" end="00:46:50.000" style="s2">we have seen that well we suffer more</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.599" end="00:46:52.400" style="s2">when something is wrong on when we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.000" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">pathologies or constrictions on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">deeper layers of phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">now um</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">if we then zoom in on these states and</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.280" end="00:47:06.880" style="s2">we look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.480" end="00:47:06.880" style="s2">wilbur&#39;s four quadrants again um</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:13.599" style="s2">and this is yeah it gets a bit theory</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:14.400" style="s2">um heavy but if you zoom in on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.599" end="00:47:17.280" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.400" end="00:47:18.880" style="s2">themselves then you can actually use the</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.280" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">same heuristic of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.880" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">four quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:26.160" style="s2">which well i guess a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.200" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.160" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">have some uh background knowledge about</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:32.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:34.640" style="s2">and you can divide it up into its</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.480" end="00:47:38.480" style="s2">qualities</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.640" end="00:47:40.559" style="s2">so at the upper left which is the inner</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.480" end="00:47:43.119" style="s2">experience itself of the inner</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.559" end="00:47:46.079" style="s2">experience itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.119" end="00:47:48.400" style="s2">that there is the state itself so uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:50.880" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.400" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">something going on at the gross level at</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.880" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">the gross level at the subtle level</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">at the causal level or at the non-dual</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:48:00.000" style="s2">level so we notice that the lower states</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">also seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:04.880" style="s2">at the causal level or the subtle level</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:07.839" style="s2">or the non-dual level for instance</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.880" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">um it&#39;s not enough to just have a tummy</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.839" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">ache to be in hell</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">um but beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:19.119" style="s2">if we look then at the social part the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:21.280" style="s2">social quadrant</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">of the inner experience there is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.280" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">of what goes on within each of these</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:31.119" style="s2">layers of phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:34.559" style="s2">at each time so we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.119" end="00:48:36.800" style="s2">um well in the gross body i&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.559" end="00:48:38.000" style="s2">any number of sensations that i can name</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.800" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">or not name</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.000" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">or not be able to name but i mean i see</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">the light around me</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">i feel the chair i have</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:48.880" style="s2">emotions which pertain more to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.760" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">subtle body</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.880" end="00:48:52.680" style="s2">i have the flows all of these relate to</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">something all of these have</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.680" end="00:48:56.559" style="s2">directionality</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:59.040" style="s2">and of course stuckness we&#39;ll get back</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.559" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">to that in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.040" end="00:49:07.839" style="s2">a third quality of the state</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.839" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">is the capacity to observe</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.839" end="00:49:13.599" style="s2">and recognize the state within myself</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:15.520" style="s2">so this is the eye of the eye we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.599" end="00:49:18.960" style="s2">also develop in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.520" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">so you can we can develop in the gross</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.960" end="00:49:24.559" style="s2">subtle causal non-dual states themselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:26.319" style="s2">we can develop in the content of those</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">states and fix the different flows that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.319" end="00:49:29.680" style="s2">are within them</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:30.880" style="s2">but to do so we must be able to</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.680" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">recognize</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.880" end="00:49:36.640" style="s2">those states within ourselves which is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:36.640" style="s2">capacity in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.960" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">and then to do something about it we get</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.440" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">to what corresponds to the systemic</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">to the systemic quadrant uh how things</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">how different objects relate to one</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">another there is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">agency the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:59.680" style="s2">to change the content of the states</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:50:00.240" style="s2">and or to traverse uh the different</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.680" end="00:50:04.000" style="s2">layers</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.240" end="00:50:07.839" style="s2">and or to steer our um</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.000" end="00:50:13.119" style="s2">our inner</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.839" end="00:50:14.960" style="s2">eye of the eye so to speak um so</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.119" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">we can different people can be</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.960" end="00:50:19.760" style="s2">differently developed</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:22.880" style="s2">in all of these four quadrants of</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.760" end="00:50:28.079" style="s2">states so some people can have</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.880" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">um a much richer causal</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.079" end="00:50:33.280" style="s2">state experience but they can maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">recognize that&#39;s what&#39;s going on in them</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.280" end="00:50:36.480" style="s2">others are good at recognizing all</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:38.480" style="s2">that&#39;s going on in them but</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.480" end="00:50:40.240" style="s2">the inside is still a mess some people</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.480" end="00:50:44.480" style="s2">are good at reorganizing</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.240" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">themselves um and and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.480" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">locking up stuff or or untying knots</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:55.839" style="s2">affecting their own state</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:57.119" style="s2">um so that kind of actually breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.839" end="00:50:59.920" style="s2">this one-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.119" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">um theory that we have in the book but</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.920" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">the book</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.400" end="00:51:04.240" style="s2">of course was not primarily about</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.720" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">transpersonal psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.240" end="00:51:09.359" style="s2">spirituality was about</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">politics and societies we wanted to go</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.359" end="00:51:14.000" style="s2">on a little bit quicker before</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">we went too deep into this context into</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.000" end="00:51:20.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.079" end="00:51:22.079" style="s2">topic um but a lot of people who are you</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.000" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2">know more on the spiritual side or high</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:25.520" style="s2">depth people</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:28.079" style="s2">have reacted that well it does feel a</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.520" end="00:51:31.760" style="s2">little bit shallow and they&#39;re not wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.079" end="00:51:34.800" style="s2">um it is because these um</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.760" end="00:51:38.079" style="s2">these distinctions are not made there</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.800" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">so that this doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.079" end="00:51:45.359" style="s2">that a state is higher if just</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s happier or more pleasurable</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.359" end="00:51:52.800" style="s2">not necessarily then i mean again</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.640" end="00:51:54.240" style="s2">we have to travel to really really enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.800" end="00:51:57.040" style="s2">the cake we have to enjoy it</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.240" end="00:51:57.599" style="s2">at the subtle level as well not just on</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.040" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">the call</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.599" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">on the gross level</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.839" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.599" end="00:52:12.960" style="s2">yeah so our task</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.319" end="00:52:14.319" style="s2">as spiritual seekers is to help one</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.960" end="00:52:17.280" style="s2">another and ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.319" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">to develop these four capacities in</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.280" end="00:52:23.920" style="s2">relation to one another</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:23.920" style="s2">um develop um</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.079" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">the the real experience of of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:30.960" style="s2">deeper and deeper layers of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:33.520" style="s2">phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">recognize the ability to recognize and</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.520" end="00:52:38.319" style="s2">self-reflect</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.359" end="00:52:40.480" style="s2">to see the content and what is going on</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:42.240" style="s2">because the content of our experience is</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.480" end="00:52:44.319" style="s2">always relational that&#39;s why it</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.240" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">is there and it&#39;s always in movement</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.319" end="00:52:51.119" style="s2">always in a flow</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">and it is um then ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.119" end="00:52:59.680" style="s2">about transforming those experiences</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:00.559" style="s2">now stuckness is important here what is</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">stuckness</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.559" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">in in the cause and the subtle body</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:09.760" style="s2">stuckness in the causal body is</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:13.040" style="s2">basically when two flows</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.760" end="00:53:14.319" style="s2">conflict with each other so you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.040" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">maybe one flow</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.319" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">to protect yourself and to assert</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:26.319" style="s2">and you have one flow to open up and oh</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:27.280" style="s2">and and submit yourself to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.319" end="00:53:32.000" style="s2">vulnerability</p>

<p begin="00:54:15.920" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">what i found was in that therapy work</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.160" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">was that there</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">i was walking around with a shitload of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:26.800" style="s2">tensions</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">in my chest that</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.800" end="00:54:34.559" style="s2">exactly correlated to my inability</p>

<p begin="00:54:34.559" end="00:54:36.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.599" end="00:54:44.640" style="s2">and that caused a ton load of problems</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:47.599" style="s2">in my life but it wasn&#39;t easy</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.640" end="00:54:48.480" style="s2">to spot and once i had spotted it and i</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:52.160" style="s2">like recognize wait a minute i can</p>

<p begin="00:54:52.160" end="00:54:57.599" style="s2">like a needle</p>

<p begin="00:54:57.599" end="00:55:01.680" style="s2">um but going from there to actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.559" end="00:55:04.079" style="s2">doing something about it</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.680" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">also took a lot of time and work and</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.079" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">actually still</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:10.720" style="s2">still ongoing but here here is again</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the opening up part</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">a lot cosmo eroticism</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:17.040" style="s2">something is stopping us or blocking us</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:19.839" style="s2">from being fully</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.040" end="00:55:21.560" style="s2">in life fully engaged across the layers</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.839" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">of phenological experience</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.560" end="00:55:27.359" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:29.599" style="s2">oh yeah stuckness in the subtle body two</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.359" end="00:55:32.160" style="s2">subjectively felt flows collide and</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.599" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">block one another</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.160" end="00:55:38.640" style="s2">untied the subtle body changes is freed</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.480" end="00:55:40.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we can mean with an open</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.640" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">heart</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.559" end="00:55:47.599" style="s2">that the the heart allows itself</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:47.599" style="s2">as it were to smile</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.680" end="00:55:52.790" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.079" end="00:56:00.640" style="s2">so um actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.119" end="00:56:05.359" style="s2">the chakras but also i mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.599" end="00:56:07.440" style="s2">all sorts of versions of this</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.359" end="00:56:08.400" style="s2">um i i like the chakras because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.440" end="00:56:11.839" style="s2">so simple</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.400" end="00:56:14.400" style="s2">um of course um</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.839" end="00:56:16.079" style="s2">a lot of ink has been spilled to say</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.400" end="00:56:20.799" style="s2">that the chakras oh they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:20.799" style="s2">they&#39;re real they&#39;re not real uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.880" end="00:56:25.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no uh physiological</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.119" end="00:56:28.640" style="s2">correspondence to them</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.520" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">um but again that that discussion misses</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.640" end="00:56:33.680" style="s2">the point</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:36.160" style="s2">the point is uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.680" end="00:56:37.440" style="s2">these didn&#39;t grow from the study of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.160" end="00:56:39.920" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.440" end="00:56:42.000" style="s2">the gross body or the medical body or</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.920" end="00:56:45.200" style="s2">the biological body</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.000" end="00:56:49.280" style="s2">um they</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.200" end="00:56:51.680" style="s2">and they grew from</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.280" end="00:56:53.599" style="s2">exploration of subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.680" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">more specifically</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.599" end="00:57:02.400" style="s2">uh subjective experience of um</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:57:06.079" style="s2">um of the subtle body</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.400" end="00:57:09.200" style="s2">so just as so i think they still present</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.079" end="00:57:12.960" style="s2">a good map for us to see</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.200" end="00:57:16.400" style="s2">what we need to open up and they also</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.960" end="00:57:22.000" style="s2">subtly guide us from the grass</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">towards the cause of the non-dual</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.000" end="00:57:25.119" style="s2">in a chakra meditation for instance if</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:28.240" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.119" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">work very diligently through</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.240" end="00:57:31.359" style="s2">all of these energy centers you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:34.240" style="s2">begin at the root chakra</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.359" end="00:57:34.880" style="s2">and until you can kind of feel it and</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.240" end="00:57:38.319" style="s2">you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.880" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">feel some flow through it then you go on</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.319" end="00:57:41.920" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:43.760" style="s2">sacral chakra at the below below the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.920" end="00:57:47.280" style="s2">navel in the belly</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.760" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">you go on until uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.280" end="00:57:52.880" style="s2">until some there&#39;s a smile there</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:54.319" style="s2">until there&#39;s a smile at the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.880" end="00:57:57.040" style="s2">the belly</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.319" end="00:57:58.720" style="s2">and i think a lot of people can can</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.040" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">relate to that</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.720" end="00:58:02.640" style="s2">and that when when you&#39;re like generally</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:04.000" style="s2">happy there&#39;s just a little smile on</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.640" end="00:58:06.079" style="s2">your belly you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.000" end="00:58:07.520" style="s2">and you can go on to the solar plexus</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.079" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">chakra you can feel like</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.520" end="00:58:14.319" style="s2">a certain will or a fire or power</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">and and these things often also reflect</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.319" end="00:58:17.760" style="s2">our experi</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:19.280" style="s2">our personalities like this really</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.760" end="00:58:21.760" style="s2">assertive guy</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.280" end="00:58:24.079" style="s2">sit down meditate with him he won&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.760" end="00:58:25.119" style="s2">a lot in any of the chakras but he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.079" end="00:58:26.880" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.119" end="00:58:29.760" style="s2">he&#39;ll feel this one very strong like</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.880" end="00:58:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s overflowing</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.760" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">heart chakra of course feeling</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.480" end="00:58:35.839" style="s2">compassion</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:37.920" style="s2">feeling love compassion feels like hurt</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.839" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">but it feels like good hurt</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.920" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">um throat chakra</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:44.799" style="s2">things are getting more subtle this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:47.200" style="s2">what actually i meditated on before i</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.799" end="00:58:51.839" style="s2">got on this call</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.200" end="00:58:51.839" style="s2">has to with expressiveness truth seeking</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:58.319" style="s2">things that can&#39;t really be proven</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.680" end="00:59:00.160" style="s2">but intuitively felt we kind of make</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.319" end="00:59:01.839" style="s2">sense that</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.160" end="00:59:03.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to say something we kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.839" end="00:59:06.160" style="s2">of tense up a little bit here</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.440" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">something gets stuck quite literally in</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.160" end="00:59:09.520" style="s2">our throat</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:11.359" style="s2">we it doesn&#39;t flow through us the</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.520" end="00:59:15.359" style="s2">communication doesn&#39;t flow</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.359" end="00:59:18.319" style="s2">third eye chakra um</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.359" end="00:59:20.400" style="s2">well then we&#39;re getting into stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.319" end="00:59:24.160" style="s2">when you feel into that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.400" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">uh you generally don&#39;t feel exactly some</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.160" end="00:59:29.119" style="s2">sensations in your body you almost feel</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:30.559" style="s2">outside of your body crown chakra you</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.119" end="00:59:33.359" style="s2">work through the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.559" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">you a lot of meditations start there and</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.359" end="00:59:37.359" style="s2">they say</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.839" end="00:59:40.640" style="s2">start looking at this little</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.359" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">spot on the top of your head and</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.640" end="00:59:44.799" style="s2">after a while you tend to be catapulted</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.920" end="00:59:47.200" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.799" end="00:59:48.000" style="s2">from all thoughts and and the body and</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.200" end="00:59:49.839" style="s2">now this</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.000" end="00:59:51.680" style="s2">only rarely happens to me i&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.839" end="00:59:54.000" style="s2">super meditator myself</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.680" end="00:59:55.280" style="s2">uh but i do have this experience so you</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.000" end="00:59:58.240" style="s2">work through all of them</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.280" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">and then it&#39;s like you jump off a cliff</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.240" end="01:00:02.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:02.559" style="s2">you just plunge down into darkness it</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.240" end="01:00:04.880" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.559" end="01:00:07.839" style="s2">be pretty scary because you you worry</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.880" end="01:00:10.799" style="s2">that you can&#39;t actually get back</p>

<p begin="01:00:25.440" end="01:00:33.119" style="s2">for our subtle body work</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.720" end="01:00:35.520" style="s2">and but just meditating on them</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.119" end="01:00:38.079" style="s2">and just feeling in on them usually</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.520" end="01:00:38.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.160" end="01:00:42.240" style="s2">what it i mean all the necessary stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.720" end="01:00:45.359" style="s2">so we might need</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.240" end="01:00:49.520" style="s2">um somatic therapy</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.359" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">we might need we might need</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.520" end="01:00:52.720" style="s2">different forms of therapy like just</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:55.680" style="s2">talk therapy and</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.720" end="01:00:56.000" style="s2">freudian stuff and figure out who were</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.680" end="01:00:59.520" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.000" end="01:01:03.440" style="s2">mad at when we were kids and how we felt</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.520" end="01:01:06.000" style="s2">belittle and and powerless and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.440" end="01:01:06.799" style="s2">but by and large to get to these higher</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.000" end="01:01:09.680" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.799" end="01:01:11.920" style="s2">um and to frequent them more often and</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.680" end="01:01:14.079" style="s2">to express them in our lives</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.920" end="01:01:15.520" style="s2">and to do so in a healthy manner we need</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.079" end="01:01:18.640" style="s2">to somehow</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.520" end="01:01:21.200" style="s2">unlock and open up at on all of these</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.640" end="01:01:22.480" style="s2">levels and and they&#39;re of course good to</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.200" end="01:01:26.240" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.480" end="01:01:29.520" style="s2">in sexual relationships um that you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.240" end="01:01:32.319" style="s2">it makes sense to before</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.520" end="01:01:33.200" style="s2">uh while making love for instance uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.319" end="01:01:36.799" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.200" end="01:01:38.799" style="s2">you uh focus entirely on on like</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.799" end="01:01:40.000" style="s2">opening up your heart chakra to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.799" end="01:01:44.000" style="s2">person uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.000" end="01:01:47.520" style="s2">you&#39;re sharing an experience with</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.000" end="01:01:50.559" style="s2">uh it can make more sense to work</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.520" end="01:01:53.119" style="s2">downwards and up until you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.559" end="01:01:54.400" style="s2">and all orgasms and stuff they actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.119" end="01:01:56.240" style="s2">work the same way that</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.400" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">you can almost feel that it&#39;s like one</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.240" end="01:02:01.520" style="s2">of those things you hit</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:05.039" style="s2">and then in a theme park</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.520" end="01:02:06.960" style="s2">where you can go where it goes higher uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.039" end="01:02:08.640" style="s2">depending on how hard you hit so if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.960" end="01:02:11.119" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.640" end="01:02:11.920" style="s2">better subtle body flows throughout</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.119" end="01:02:14.880" style="s2">throughout these</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.920" end="01:02:16.799" style="s2">then the orgasm can go higher and it can</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.880" end="01:02:19.839" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.799" end="01:02:20.319" style="s2">romantic and overflowing or it can even</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.839" end="01:02:23.680" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.319" end="01:02:27.200" style="s2">um it can even feel cosmic um</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.680" end="01:02:30.559" style="s2">but it it depends on these opening up</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.200" end="01:02:31.440" style="s2">opening ups uh i&#39;ll hopefully say more</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.559" end="01:02:33.680" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.440" end="01:02:35.039" style="s2">because i make it sound so cute and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.680" end="01:02:39.039" style="s2">not um</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.039" end="01:02:40.960" style="s2">but yeah but but in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.039" end="01:02:42.799" style="s2">in the next session i&#39;ll hopefully get</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.960" end="01:02:44.400" style="s2">back to this</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.799" end="01:02:47.520" style="s2">so this distinction has become very</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.400" end="01:02:51.839" style="s2">popular lately citric and tantric</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.520" end="01:02:55.039" style="s2">i want to connect true to it um</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.839" end="01:02:58.319" style="s2">i want to connect to it in this</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.039" end="01:03:02.480" style="s2">model that we&#39;re presenting here</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.319" end="01:03:04.559" style="s2">um so sutrix spirituality um</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.480" end="01:03:05.680" style="s2">is more like the classical buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.559" end="01:03:08.480" style="s2">thing uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.680" end="01:03:09.200" style="s2">you meditate you have the sutras you</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.480" end="01:03:12.559" style="s2">follow</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.200" end="01:03:16.160" style="s2">a certain code and you purify your soul</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.559" end="01:03:19.599" style="s2">you get away from from the grass</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.160" end="01:03:21.440" style="s2">uh and and focus instead on the causal</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.599" end="01:03:24.000" style="s2">and you kind of and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.440" end="01:03:26.319" style="s2">relationship there than that you go</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.000" end="01:03:28.000" style="s2">vikasa meditation for instance is has</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.319" end="01:03:30.720" style="s2">been called causal mental</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.000" end="01:03:33.039" style="s2">causal body meditation as well which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.720" end="01:03:36.410" style="s2">based on classical buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.039" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">um so um um</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.410" end="01:03:40.559" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:42.160" style="s2">and and in in these meditations you</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.559" end="01:03:45.440" style="s2">might do things like</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:48.799" style="s2">well you um</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.440" end="01:03:51.200" style="s2">imagine a rotting body you imagine death</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.799" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">you you realize that the gross body</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.200" end="01:03:54.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t it there is actually a causal body</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:59.200" style="s2">underlying it</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.960" end="01:04:03.359" style="s2">um or no not body layer of</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.200" end="01:04:06.880" style="s2">layer of phenomenology and if you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.359" end="01:04:11.520" style="s2">resonate and gain harmony with that</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.880" end="01:04:13.680" style="s2">even a tummy ache won&#39;t destroy your day</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.520" end="01:04:14.960" style="s2">where uh i mean but there are risks of</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.680" end="01:04:17.839" style="s2">course without its uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.960" end="01:04:18.400" style="s2">life negating um and there&#39;s the unhappy</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.839" end="01:04:21.839" style="s2">buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.400" end="01:04:24.720" style="s2">syndrome meaning that um like</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.839" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">buddhists are actually less happy than</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.720" end="01:04:28.960" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:32.160" style="s2">other religious followers which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.960" end="01:04:33.440" style="s2">quite contrary to to popular belief</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.160" end="01:04:36.319" style="s2">and this is of course because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.440" end="01:04:38.559" style="s2">been taught uh a religion or world view</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.319" end="01:04:38.559" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.280" end="01:04:46.079" style="s2">says that the world is suffering and uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.640" end="01:04:48.480" style="s2">the only way is to get out of it um</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.079" end="01:04:50.640" style="s2">but this isn&#39;t of course true of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.480" end="01:04:52.799" style="s2">minority who are practitioners</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.640" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">within buddhism and dedicate their lives</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.799" end="01:04:58.160" style="s2">to this they tend to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:05:02.160" style="s2">unusually happy but as</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.160" end="01:05:02.559" style="s2">as a as a doctrine it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.160" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.559" end="01:05:09.520" style="s2">life affirmative now tantric buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:11.760" style="s2">and tantric spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.520" end="01:05:14.640" style="s2">puts cosmeroticism at the center as i</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.760" end="01:05:16.799" style="s2">have suggested here as well</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:17.680" style="s2">and it works more through the subtle</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.799" end="01:05:20.640" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.680" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">and goes from the subtle body to</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.640" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">non-dual spirituality so it also reaches</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:30.240" style="s2">deeper and it&#39;s often than more esoteric</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:30.240" style="s2">and smaller groups and more radical</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.359" end="01:05:37.920" style="s2">but of course if you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.799" end="01:05:38.880" style="s2">tantric practices um and you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.920" end="01:05:41.599" style="s2">with this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.880" end="01:05:42.640" style="s2">uh with this kind of work that has to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.599" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.640" end="01:05:49.520" style="s2">um engaging with life</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:50.960" style="s2">and saying yes to all of that those</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.520" end="01:05:53.920" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.960" end="01:05:56.799" style="s2">um then you well there&#39;s the risk of</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.920" end="01:05:59.359" style="s2">erratic seduction or there the risk of</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.799" end="01:06:00.559" style="s2">getting attached to desirable or</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.359" end="01:06:03.680" style="s2">positive experiences</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.559" end="01:06:05.440" style="s2">in the subtle body and this can develop</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.680" end="01:06:08.640" style="s2">into crazy sex cults as</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.440" end="01:06:08.640" style="s2">it usually does</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.599" end="01:06:12.880" style="s2">oh yeah and that&#39;s actually as far as i</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.280" end="01:06:16.240" style="s2">got in the presentation so</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.880" end="01:06:17.839" style="s2">uh um yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.240" end="01:06:19.680" style="s2">we can say more about transpersonal</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.839" end="01:06:22.799" style="s2">perspective on this but the idea of a</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.680" end="01:06:24.880" style="s2">trans personal perspective is basically</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.799" end="01:06:27.440" style="s2">there&#39;s more detail to it but i just</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.880" end="01:06:30.799" style="s2">want to say that</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.440" end="01:06:34.640" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.799" end="01:06:38.160" style="s2">create these spaces for one another</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.640" end="01:06:43.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s the more</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.160" end="01:06:43.520" style="s2">tantric we go the more social it gets</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.240" end="01:06:49.839" style="s2">the more social it gets um um</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.079" end="01:06:51.440" style="s2">yeah speaking as a sociologist</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.839" end="01:06:53.520" style="s2">spirituality is social</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.440" end="01:06:55.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a social enterprise because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.520" end="01:06:58.240" style="s2">about the relatedness to reality</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.760" end="01:07:00.480" style="s2">and we need and we always relate through</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.240" end="01:07:04.240" style="s2">and via and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.480" end="01:07:07.599" style="s2">between one another and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.240" end="01:07:10.880" style="s2">um like</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.599" end="01:07:14.079" style="s2">we cannot and should not uh view this</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.880" end="01:07:17.680" style="s2">as uh like the separate</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.079" end="01:07:20.400" style="s2">paths of different uh individuals</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.680" end="01:07:20.799" style="s2">um again this this goes back to tantric</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.400" end="01:07:24.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.799" end="01:07:28.300" style="s2">and stuff um and going from uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.400" end="01:07:29.839" style="s2">going to mayan of buddhism and stuff but</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.300" end="01:07:32.960" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.839" end="01:07:36.640" style="s2">but the idea is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.960" end="01:07:40.400" style="s2">you meet a person all four layers</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.640" end="01:07:40.400" style="s2">are interacting at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.200" end="01:07:46.720" style="s2">and we need to address the interactions</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.640" end="01:07:47.839" style="s2">of all of those four layers and create a</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.720" end="01:07:51.359" style="s2">spiritually</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.839" end="01:07:54.559" style="s2">rich society that would be</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.359" end="01:07:57.280" style="s2">a meta-modern spiritual goal</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.559" end="01:07:58.720" style="s2">that we together create rituals</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.280" end="01:08:02.480" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.720" end="01:08:06.720" style="s2">norms understandings relationships</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.480" end="01:08:09.440" style="s2">which strengthen this rich field</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.720" end="01:08:10.400" style="s2">of the different layers of our</p>

<p begin="01:08:10.400" end="01:08:14.400" style="s2">um of our interconnected uh</p>

<p begin="01:08:18.319" end="01:08:21.920" style="s2">phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.839" end="01:08:23.279" style="s2">the deeper we go there the more intimate</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.920" end="01:08:26.640" style="s2">it gets</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.279" end="01:08:26.640" style="s2">and the more social it gets</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.799" end="01:08:30.080" style="s2">so i mean fixing a tummy ache is about</p>

<p begin="01:09:04.239" end="01:09:07.759" style="s2">uh so we&#39;ve got a couple of questions</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.199" end="01:09:10.000" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.759" end="01:09:11.440" style="s2">from rob had a few really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.000" end="01:09:14.719" style="s2">ones do you want to</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.440" end="01:09:15.359" style="s2">start us off rob sure thank you daniel</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.719" end="01:09:18.640" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.359" end="01:09:20.319" style="s2">wonderful um so the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.640" end="01:09:22.239" style="s2">the question i wanted to bring up was</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.319" end="01:09:24.319" style="s2">really related to this um</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.239" end="01:09:25.520" style="s2">this dichotomy between sutrick and</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.319" end="01:09:28.319" style="s2">tantric</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.520" end="01:09:29.920" style="s2">um streams of thought i think about</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.319" end="01:09:31.520" style="s2">spiritual practice but</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.920" end="01:09:33.120" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a pattern that ken wilber</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.520" end="01:09:34.640" style="s2">points out um</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.120" end="01:09:36.640" style="s2">in a lot of his work i think it comes up</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.640" end="01:09:39.440" style="s2">in in brief history of</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.640" end="01:09:40.799" style="s2">everything and uh he talks about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.440" end="01:09:42.880" style="s2">difference between</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.799" end="01:09:44.239" style="s2">the transcendent stream which i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.880" end="01:09:47.359" style="s2">relates to the sutrick</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.239" end="01:09:48.239" style="s2">um of sort of up and out of the body up</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.359" end="01:09:50.480" style="s2">and out of</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.239" end="01:09:52.000" style="s2">of gross experience and toward the sort</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.480" end="01:09:53.920" style="s2">of transcendental plane</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.000" end="01:09:55.199" style="s2">and then the imminent stream and he</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.920" end="01:09:56.640" style="s2">relates these to</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.199" end="01:09:58.960" style="s2">and the eminent would be like sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.640" end="01:10:02.239" style="s2">down into the body down into embodiment</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.960" end="01:10:04.640" style="s2">into the gross and the physical um and</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.239" end="01:10:06.000" style="s2">he relates these to like transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.640" end="01:10:09.199" style="s2">being masculine and</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.000" end="01:10:11.600" style="s2">imminent being feminine which uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.199" end="01:10:13.199" style="s2">goes back to sort of the history of of</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.600" end="01:10:15.120" style="s2">like uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.199" end="01:10:16.640" style="s2">matriarchal cultures versus patriarchal</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.120" end="01:10:19.760" style="s2">cultures and how they celebrated</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.640" end="01:10:22.719" style="s2">spirituality and</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.760" end="01:10:24.159" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s something in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.719" end="01:10:25.840" style="s2">process of going</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.159" end="01:10:27.920" style="s2">through a tran transformation</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.840" end="01:10:30.080" style="s2">spiritually that looks to me like it</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.920" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">needs both of these streams</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.080" end="01:10:33.760" style="s2">but interestingly in like past uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.880" end="01:10:36.239" style="s2">cultural</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.760" end="01:10:37.920" style="s2">value memes like pre-modern up through</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.239" end="01:10:39.280" style="s2">modernism there was a real preference</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.920" end="01:10:41.760" style="s2">for masculine</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.280" end="01:10:43.360" style="s2">streams or for the sutra or transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.760" end="01:10:46.719" style="s2">stream and a real</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.360" end="01:10:48.880" style="s2">um allergy almost to the feminine and</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.719" end="01:10:50.880" style="s2">a lot of you know pre-modern religions</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.880" end="01:10:53.600" style="s2">where like if you banish the body and</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.880" end="01:10:55.280" style="s2">punish the like physical drives and</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:59.440" style="s2">stuff then you&#39;ll transcend and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.280" end="01:11:01.360" style="s2">you&#39;ll awaken um whereas like</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.440" end="01:11:02.480" style="s2">emerging into post-modernity there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.360" end="01:11:04.800" style="s2">whole lot more of like</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.480" end="01:11:05.679" style="s2">banish the masculine and prefer the</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.800" end="01:11:09.760" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.679" end="01:11:13.840" style="s2">um kind of reaction um to that process</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.760" end="01:11:13.840" style="s2">and a little bit of a sort of um</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.440" end="01:11:19.120" style="s2">maybe we&#39;d call it a like archaic</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.920" end="01:11:23.640" style="s2">revivalism</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.120" end="01:11:26.640" style="s2">but like archaic in the sense of like</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.640" end="01:11:28.480" style="s2">pre-transcendent masculine back when</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.640" end="01:11:30.159" style="s2">there was just a lot more embedded like</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.480" end="01:11:34.640" style="s2">sort of magical thinking kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.159" end="01:11:36.880" style="s2">approach to um spirituality so in</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.640" end="01:11:38.080" style="s2">my question then is how does the</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.880" end="01:11:41.840" style="s2">metamodern meme</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.080" end="01:11:45.120" style="s2">treat these two streams and</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.840" end="01:11:46.800" style="s2">um and the like other value memes and</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.120" end="01:11:48.960" style="s2">their reactions to them how is</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.800" end="01:11:51.120" style="s2">how does metamodernism like approach</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.960" end="01:11:54.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.120" end="01:11:57.930" style="s2">so so there um there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.800" end="01:11:59.360" style="s2">there there are a lot of um ways to um</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.930" end="01:12:02.719" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.360" end="01:12:05.920" style="s2">um to work with with this issue</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.719" end="01:12:08.080" style="s2">um i guess um</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.920" end="01:12:09.280" style="s2">well i&#39;ll say a couple of things uh one</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.080" end="01:12:12.080" style="s2">thing is</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.280" end="01:12:14.400" style="s2">and just on a very basic level we have</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.080" end="01:12:17.840" style="s2">hard value means or or metamines</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.400" end="01:12:20.159" style="s2">and soft values or metamines and</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.840" end="01:12:21.280" style="s2">the hard ones generally come together</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.159" end="01:12:24.640" style="s2">with um</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.280" end="01:12:27.280" style="s2">a material revolution um or</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.640" end="01:12:30.560" style="s2">in the revolution of industry and</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.280" end="01:12:30.560" style="s2">transport and information</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.640" end="01:12:35.440" style="s2">so um and they tend to fulfill the</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.560" end="01:12:38.480" style="s2">ethics</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.440" end="01:12:39.440" style="s2">of the former which was a critique of</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.480" end="01:12:42.719" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.440" end="01:12:46.159" style="s2">two steps forward so so we have</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.719" end="01:12:49.360" style="s2">i mean animism which is</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.159" end="01:12:52.400" style="s2">a fairly soft value mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.360" end="01:12:55.600" style="s2">and quite embodied and so on and</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.400" end="01:12:58.159" style="s2">um well</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.600" end="01:12:59.600" style="s2">going from there you have you have what</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.159" end="01:13:02.640" style="s2">i call faustianism</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.600" end="01:13:04.560" style="s2">red which is fairly hard and</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.640" end="01:13:06.400" style="s2">masculine from there on you actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.560" end="01:13:08.400" style="s2">have if you look</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.400" end="01:13:10.080" style="s2">not at the teachings of the church later</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.400" end="01:13:12.560" style="s2">on but you look at the core</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.080" end="01:13:14.000" style="s2">uh teachings of jesus or buddha or</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.560" end="01:13:17.440" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.000" end="01:13:19.120" style="s2">they would criticize power relations and</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.440" end="01:13:21.120" style="s2">they were these religions were actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.120" end="01:13:25.040" style="s2">popular with women so uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.120" end="01:13:28.880" style="s2">and so buddhism for instance uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.040" end="01:13:33.840" style="s2">worked to um to have buddhist nuns</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.880" end="01:13:33.840" style="s2">uh join join the sangha for instance and</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.920" end="01:13:40.480" style="s2">well christianity would</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.400" end="01:13:41.760" style="s2">say that well sure render unto caesar</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.480" end="01:13:45.520" style="s2">what belongs to him</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.760" end="01:13:48.960" style="s2">but in the end at the end of the day um</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.520" end="01:13:51.040" style="s2">well you should govern because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.960" end="01:13:54.880" style="s2">just not because you&#39;re powerful</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.040" end="01:13:58.480" style="s2">right uh and then you have uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.880" end="01:14:00.400" style="s2">modernism which is quite masculine it</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.480" end="01:14:02.920" style="s2">takes up all of the all of the things</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.400" end="01:14:05.520" style="s2">that were in the ethics of</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.920" end="01:14:06.800" style="s2">post-pasteurism or the critique of</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.520" end="01:14:08.719" style="s2">faustianism</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.800" end="01:14:10.480" style="s2">so it says okay sure we won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.719" end="01:14:13.520" style="s2">slaves i&#39;m sure we&#39;re equals</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.480" end="01:14:14.800" style="s2">but from that basis or setting we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.520" end="01:14:16.640" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.800" end="01:14:17.920" style="s2">we&#39;re going to express ourselves we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.640" end="01:14:19.840" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.920" end="01:14:21.040" style="s2">create stuff out in the world then you</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.840" end="01:14:22.719" style="s2">have a feminine</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.040" end="01:14:25.520" style="s2">critique of that or soft critique of</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.719" end="01:14:28.159" style="s2">that in post-modernism and of course</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.520" end="01:14:30.000" style="s2">if you look at the demographics of today</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.159" end="01:14:31.679" style="s2">the developmental demographics and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.000" end="01:14:35.120" style="s2">cultural demographics</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.679" end="01:14:38.239" style="s2">uh you have a high prevalence of women</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.120" end="01:14:40.159" style="s2">in post-modernism so meta-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.239" end="01:14:42.480" style="s2">comes in at a point where the masculine</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.159" end="01:14:46.560" style="s2">reasserts itself again</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.480" end="01:14:49.520" style="s2">um and and</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.560" end="01:14:50.800" style="s2">with with terms such as or with with the</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.520" end="01:14:53.520" style="s2">slogans such as</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.800" end="01:14:54.960" style="s2">after re deconstruction reconstruction</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.520" end="01:14:58.239" style="s2">must follow</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.960" end="01:15:01.600" style="s2">uh or protosynthesis or</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.239" end="01:15:05.040" style="s2">sincere irony and um</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.600" end="01:15:07.679" style="s2">that it wants to create something again</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.040" end="01:15:07.679" style="s2">and wants to</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.080" end="01:15:11.920" style="s2">out compete the modern world in many</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.199" end="01:15:15.120" style="s2">ways right</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.920" end="01:15:19.040" style="s2">so so in terms of spirituality then</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.120" end="01:15:22.880" style="s2">uh metamodernism uh is a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.040" end="01:15:25.920" style="s2">on the masculine side</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.880" end="01:15:26.560" style="s2">and if you look at what i have proposed</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.920" end="01:15:29.040" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.560" end="01:15:29.840" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t exactly i mean of course i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.040" end="01:15:33.600" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.840" end="01:15:36.880" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna agree with wilbur that</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.600" end="01:15:40.560" style="s2">and then with yourself that we need</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.880" end="01:15:43.520" style="s2">both transcendence and and uh and</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.560" end="01:15:44.880" style="s2">both the transcenders and the uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.520" end="01:15:48.480" style="s2">ascenders</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.880" end="01:15:51.920" style="s2">no the ascenders and the descenders yes</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.480" end="01:15:53.679" style="s2">um and and they need to kind of meet in</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.920" end="01:15:57.040" style="s2">this cosmic dance</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.679" end="01:16:00.400" style="s2">now what i try to do here uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.040" end="01:16:03.920" style="s2">is still a kind of meta-modern</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.400" end="01:16:07.280" style="s2">synthesis that attempts at least to</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.920" end="01:16:10.880" style="s2">uh achieve that end if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.280" end="01:16:13.920" style="s2">this one for instance uh it connects</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.880" end="01:16:17.440" style="s2">to the states um that</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.920" end="01:16:20.480" style="s2">it goes from the the more grow</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.440" end="01:16:24.560" style="s2">gross to towards the more uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.480" end="01:16:28.239" style="s2">subtle towards the more transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.560" end="01:16:31.440" style="s2">uh but uh it tries</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.239" end="01:16:35.040" style="s2">to make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.440" end="01:16:39.840" style="s2">um we</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.040" end="01:16:42.159" style="s2">we always do our homework</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.840" end="01:16:43.040" style="s2">and go through all of that those low</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.159" end="01:16:46.840" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.040" end="01:16:48.239" style="s2">to make sure that eroticism is at the</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.840" end="01:16:52.640" style="s2">core</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.239" end="01:16:55.360" style="s2">but the goal is still transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.640" end="01:16:56.320" style="s2">so the goal is still transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.360" end="01:16:59.600" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.320" end="01:17:01.640" style="s2">a second layer of compassion we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.600" end="01:17:03.120" style="s2">what we&#39;re worried about are these</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.640" end="01:17:06.400" style="s2">colonizations</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.120" end="01:17:10.320" style="s2">of either force of the other</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.400" end="01:17:12.480" style="s2">so we don&#39;t want eroticism colonizing</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.320" end="01:17:14.400" style="s2">the transcendent then we&#39;re stuck in</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.480" end="01:17:15.280" style="s2">with adida and he&#39;s gonna your</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.400" end="01:17:18.400" style="s2">wives</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.280" end="01:17:21.730" style="s2">which he literally did and</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.400" end="01:17:23.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t want compassion</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.730" end="01:17:26.000" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.440" end="01:17:26.960" style="s2">we don&#39;t want compassion trumping</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.000" end="01:17:30.560" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.960" end="01:17:33.679" style="s2">we just wanted to undergird it</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.560" end="01:17:36.800" style="s2">and we don&#39;t want a transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.679" end="01:17:40.480" style="s2">to empty out life of eroticism</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.800" end="01:17:43.040" style="s2">and compassion which easily happens</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.480" end="01:17:44.159" style="s2">and a lot of people who start meditating</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.040" end="01:17:48.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.159" end="01:17:48.800" style="s2">like in the 70s and the 80s tm was huge</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.080" end="01:17:51.920" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.800" end="01:17:53.679" style="s2">so a lot of people went to tm uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.920" end="01:17:56.239" style="s2">transcendental meditation</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.679" end="01:17:57.440" style="s2">and they sat down and they did their</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.239" end="01:17:59.360" style="s2">mantras</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.440" end="01:18:00.800" style="s2">and they had trans transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.360" end="01:18:03.199" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.800" end="01:18:06.320" style="s2">and this stuff actually activates a lot</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.199" end="01:18:06.320" style="s2">of a lot of your</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.440" end="01:18:10.880" style="s2">i just learned this the other day</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.880" end="01:18:13.840" style="s2">actually that it activates or</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.880" end="01:18:16.159" style="s2">default networks so so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.840" end="01:18:17.520" style="s2">daydreaming on steroids and you you can</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.159" end="01:18:19.840" style="s2">reach farther in your thoughts and</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.520" end="01:18:21.920" style="s2">creativity if done correctly</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.840" end="01:18:23.600" style="s2">but what a lot of people experienced</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.920" end="01:18:26.960" style="s2">instead</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.600" end="01:18:29.360" style="s2">was that they just felt emptied out</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.960" end="01:18:30.400" style="s2">and they just felt kind of numb to</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.360" end="01:18:31.600" style="s2">experience and they felt their</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.400" end="01:18:34.400" style="s2">creativity</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.600" end="01:18:36.159" style="s2">was killed and then they stop doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.400" end="01:18:38.480" style="s2">transcendental meditation and then they</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.159" end="01:18:39.280" style="s2">join whatever pentecostal church is</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.480" end="01:18:42.159" style="s2">nearest</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.280" end="01:18:43.040" style="s2">because there people are singing people</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.159" end="01:18:45.040" style="s2">are happy</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.040" end="01:18:47.760" style="s2">and then before you know it they&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.040" end="01:18:51.040" style="s2">at uh you know a crazy version of uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.760" end="01:18:53.199" style="s2">post fostering spirituality and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.040" end="01:18:54.400" style="s2">literally believing in miracles and</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.199" end="01:18:57.679" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.400" end="01:18:59.440" style="s2">uh and they pick up a lot of patriarchal</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.679" end="01:19:00.960" style="s2">crazy stuff that has to do with that</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.440" end="01:19:05.280" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.960" end="01:19:08.400" style="s2">um so um um</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.280" end="01:19:10.800" style="s2">the the the marriage of the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.400" end="01:19:11.600" style="s2">and the descendant is basically that we</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.800" end="01:19:14.800" style="s2">always start</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.600" end="01:19:18.080" style="s2">with the descendant um and</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.800" end="01:19:19.920" style="s2">move upwards and</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.080" end="01:19:22.640" style="s2">whenever we don&#39;t we end up doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.920" end="01:19:26.800" style="s2">spiritual bypassing and</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.640" end="01:19:29.920" style="s2">and i mean maybe maybe that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.800" end="01:19:33.040" style="s2">if you&#39;re living a monk life and</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.920" end="01:19:34.640" style="s2">you really really really pay the huge</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.040" end="01:19:37.679" style="s2">price that it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.640" end="01:19:41.440" style="s2">to live a secret life fully</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.679" end="01:19:44.560" style="s2">um but then um</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.440" end="01:19:46.239" style="s2">well there&#39;s obvious all of those forces</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.560" end="01:19:49.600" style="s2">are still going to be there right</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.239" end="01:19:52.880" style="s2">you&#39;re still going to be mad at your dad</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.600" end="01:19:55.120" style="s2">sexually frustrated and whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.880" end="01:19:57.360" style="s2">and we do have all of these sexual abuse</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.120" end="01:20:00.560" style="s2">problems in all of these churches</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.360" end="01:20:04.880" style="s2">um um and congregations</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.560" end="01:20:07.760" style="s2">so it appears as though like we need</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.880" end="01:20:09.679" style="s2">this fountainhead of life this cosmere</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.760" end="01:20:12.480" style="s2">eroticism</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.679" end="01:20:13.199" style="s2">for the transcendence to occur in a</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.480" end="01:20:16.560" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.199" end="01:20:20.639" style="s2">manner and yeah and i</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.560" end="01:20:24.880" style="s2">feel at least like that</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.639" end="01:20:28.639" style="s2">there&#39;s it still asserts</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.880" end="01:20:32.159" style="s2">the goal of transcendence but it does so</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.639" end="01:20:36.560" style="s2">in a hierarchical manner which is then</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.159" end="01:20:38.800" style="s2">again a more as in a more a center</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.560" end="01:20:40.719" style="s2">way and i&#39;m sure there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.800" end="01:20:42.800" style="s2">future forms of spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.719" end="01:20:45.520" style="s2">or future views on spirituality which</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.800" end="01:20:50.400" style="s2">will turn this on its head again</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.520" end="01:20:50.400" style="s2">but that&#39;s how these things evolve</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.159" end="01:20:55.920" style="s2">awesome rob do you have any follow up</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.679" end="01:21:01.840" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.920" end="01:21:01.840" style="s2">thanks that was great</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.159" end="01:21:07.440" style="s2">okay so uh i feel like um</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.920" end="01:21:09.120" style="s2">christian sawyer had an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.440" end="01:21:11.040" style="s2">question uh to</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.120" end="01:21:14.000" style="s2">follow after this one christian do you</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.040" end="01:21:17.679" style="s2">wanna mute and ask daniel your question</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.000" end="01:21:19.920" style="s2">can you hear me which question i put two</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.679" end="01:21:23.600" style="s2">in there</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.920" end="01:21:25.520" style="s2">feel free to choose okay um</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.600" end="01:21:26.800" style="s2">i&#39;ll ask both and i&#39;ll let daniel choose</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.520" end="01:21:28.800" style="s2">then um</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.800" end="01:21:30.080" style="s2">the first is why does the tantric path</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.800" end="01:21:33.440" style="s2">tend towards</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.080" end="01:21:36.719" style="s2">this cult like bs and is there</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.440" end="01:21:39.120" style="s2">another way to contain or manage that</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.719" end="01:21:42.000" style="s2">process of surrendering into the</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.120" end="01:21:43.920" style="s2">eroticism which doesn&#39;t rely upon</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.000" end="01:21:46.239" style="s2">the external framework of the cult or</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.920" end="01:21:49.760" style="s2">the guru</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.239" end="01:21:51.679" style="s2">and then the other question is</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.760" end="01:21:54.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t it also possible to work from</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.679" end="01:21:55.280" style="s2">transcendence to eroticism or to do a</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.000" end="01:21:58.000" style="s2">lot of back and forth</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.280" end="01:21:58.800" style="s2">where the transcendence you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.000" end="01:22:02.000" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.800" end="01:22:05.440" style="s2">spaciousness detachment gives one</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.000" end="01:22:05.840" style="s2">the freedom to approach the the wounds</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.440" end="01:22:07.679" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.840" end="01:22:10.560" style="s2">traumas that are keeping them from</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.679" end="01:22:11.920" style="s2">touching into their eroticism uh so that</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.560" end="01:22:14.000" style="s2">they can heal them and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.920" end="01:22:15.360" style="s2">you know get more deeply in touch with</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.000" end="01:22:18.880" style="s2">just their spontaneous</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.360" end="01:22:21.840" style="s2">creativity yes very very good</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.880" end="01:22:23.520" style="s2">um so i&#39;m gonna have to try to answer</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.840" end="01:22:24.000" style="s2">both because they&#39;re so important so so</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.520" end="01:22:27.679" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.000" end="01:22:30.000" style="s2">one um why and</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.679" end="01:22:31.040" style="s2">well there&#39;s a gen there&#39;s the general</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.000" end="01:22:34.480" style="s2">cult mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.040" end="01:22:37.280" style="s2">which uh which we do which we uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.480" end="01:22:38.719" style="s2">describe in our first hansi book and</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.280" end="01:22:41.920" style="s2">it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.719" end="01:22:43.600" style="s2">it says basically that whenever we try</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.920" end="01:22:47.120" style="s2">to create hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.600" end="01:22:50.639" style="s2">on uh not on complexity or code</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.120" end="01:22:53.679" style="s2">like not on stuff that is visible and</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.639" end="01:22:54.880" style="s2">content but on object banana subjective</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.679" end="01:22:57.440" style="s2">experiences oh</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.880" end="01:22:58.480" style="s2">this we should be listening to this uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.440" end="01:23:01.440" style="s2">guy or woman</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.480" end="01:23:03.040" style="s2">because we imagine that they have these</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.440" end="01:23:06.159" style="s2">inner experiences which we can</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.040" end="01:23:09.280" style="s2">verify and then sooner or later</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.159" end="01:23:10.560" style="s2">um like it doesn&#39;t really mix like</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.280" end="01:23:12.400" style="s2">social hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.560" end="01:23:14.000" style="s2">and subjective experiences because we</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.400" end="01:23:17.040" style="s2">can never verify them</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.000" end="01:23:18.320" style="s2">so people will be tempted to and be</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.040" end="01:23:21.840" style="s2">socially pressured</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.320" end="01:23:24.000" style="s2">a little bit lie about what</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.840" end="01:23:25.199" style="s2">experience they&#39;re actually having at</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.000" end="01:23:28.400" style="s2">the moment</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.199" end="01:23:31.280" style="s2">and uh and being roles where they</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.400" end="01:23:32.639" style="s2">are expected to embody a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.280" end="01:23:36.159" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.639" end="01:23:37.040" style="s2">being or or suchness and so on and these</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.159" end="01:23:40.400" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.040" end="01:23:44.719" style="s2">vary a lot and people have ups and downs</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.400" end="01:23:44.719" style="s2">and and well</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.199" end="01:23:48.480" style="s2">and and then of course there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.199" end="01:23:50.080" style="s2">about a person</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.480" end="01:23:52.480" style="s2">just because they happen to frequent</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.080" end="01:23:54.719" style="s2">high states and</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.480" end="01:23:57.360" style="s2">and develop great depth which we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.719" end="01:23:59.440" style="s2">talked about a lot today</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.360" end="01:24:00.560" style="s2">that makes them write about other topics</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.440" end="01:24:02.719" style="s2">it just</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.560" end="01:24:04.400" style="s2">gets them this intuition maybe they can</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.719" end="01:24:06.000" style="s2">have uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.400" end="01:24:08.000" style="s2">be more proficient at getting other</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.000" end="01:24:10.159" style="s2">people into higher states but</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.000" end="01:24:11.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not right about other things</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.159" end="01:24:13.280" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.440" end="01:24:14.880" style="s2">nothing is a stronger experience than</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.280" end="01:24:16.639" style="s2">the states themselves</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.880" end="01:24:18.320" style="s2">so when somebody gets you into a high</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.639" end="01:24:21.280" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.320" end="01:24:23.440" style="s2">uh not least in a very vulnerable place</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.280" end="01:24:27.360" style="s2">which has to do with sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.440" end="01:24:29.840" style="s2">then you you</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.360" end="01:24:30.560" style="s2">naturally experience that this person is</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.840" end="01:24:33.199" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.560" end="01:24:33.600" style="s2">and you should be listening to them and</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.199" end="01:24:37.360" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.600" end="01:24:40.560" style="s2">give away your own your own capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.360" end="01:24:45.920" style="s2">inner checking and experience</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.560" end="01:24:48.800" style="s2">and yeah and then if you mix in</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.920" end="01:24:49.360" style="s2">uh if you mix in uh sexuality in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.800" end="01:24:52.560" style="s2">midst</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.360" end="01:24:54.880" style="s2">in the mix which has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.560" end="01:24:57.679" style="s2">well you know stuff like self do selfish</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.880" end="01:25:01.040" style="s2">desire and all of that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.679" end="01:25:02.080" style="s2">this slide is just so simple i mean it</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.040" end="01:25:04.560" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.080" end="01:25:07.199" style="s2">just statistically over time you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.560" end="01:25:10.880" style="s2">going to slide into situations where</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.199" end="01:25:14.960" style="s2">uh people misuse their standing in power</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.880" end="01:25:16.800" style="s2">in this extremely intimate connection</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.960" end="01:25:19.679" style="s2">and extremely hierarchical connection</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.800" end="01:25:21.520" style="s2">which it naturally becomes</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.679" end="01:25:24.400" style="s2">to fulfill their own sexual</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.520" end="01:25:24.400" style="s2">gratification</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.800" end="01:25:28.320" style="s2">at the expense of a profound violation</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.440" end="01:25:32.800" style="s2">of another</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.320" end="01:25:35.920" style="s2">uh person&#39;s integrity uh so</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.800" end="01:25:36.719" style="s2">it&#39;s just a very very simple way of</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.920" end="01:25:41.840" style="s2">saying it</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.719" end="01:25:44.239" style="s2">is uh we don&#39;t as social beings</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.840" end="01:25:45.199" style="s2">these energies are so strong and so</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.239" end="01:25:47.440" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.199" end="01:25:48.239" style="s2">that if we don&#39;t contain them and spread</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.440" end="01:25:53.120" style="s2">them out</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.239" end="01:25:55.920" style="s2">and decentralize them the wires blow up</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.120" end="01:25:56.480" style="s2">we we just put too much energy in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.920" end="01:26:00.000" style="s2">wire</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.480" end="01:26:03.360" style="s2">blows up right um</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.000" end="01:26:04.400" style="s2">so so that&#39;s the first part but the</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.360" end="01:26:08.960" style="s2">second part</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.400" end="01:26:12.159" style="s2">um about um</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.960" end="01:26:14.960" style="s2">you actually wrote this down right um</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.159" end="01:26:16.800" style="s2">yes can we work from iran from</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.960" end="01:26:20.080" style="s2">transcendence towards iran this is</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.800" end="01:26:23.280" style="s2">actually yes um so on the one hand</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.080" end="01:26:24.159" style="s2">we should keep this this transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.280" end="01:26:28.480" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.159" end="01:26:33.360" style="s2">in mind but on the other</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.480" end="01:26:35.520" style="s2">uh we should also be in um</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.360" end="01:26:38.239" style="s2">we should also be aware of we have these</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.520" end="01:26:43.520" style="s2">four quadrants right</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.239" end="01:26:43.520" style="s2">so um by going</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.560" end="01:26:49.120" style="s2">into for instance the causal and</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.280" end="01:26:52.560" style="s2">meditating on that a lot</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.120" end="01:26:52.560" style="s2">whether passing or whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.800" end="01:26:56.800" style="s2">we can um</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.520" end="01:27:05.280" style="s2">we can have a leverage point from which</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.120" end="01:27:08.719" style="s2">we can access a more direct experience</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.280" end="01:27:12.400" style="s2">of the deeper layers and from there on</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.719" end="01:27:12.400" style="s2">change things at the lower layers</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.560" end="01:27:16.639" style="s2">but there there&#39;s nothing automatic</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.120" end="01:27:19.600" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.639" end="01:27:22.719" style="s2">so uh so we can also risk doing a</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.600" end="01:27:24.220" style="s2">spiritual bypassing when we do so</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.719" end="01:27:26.639" style="s2">meaning that um</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.220" end="01:27:29.679" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.639" end="01:27:32.880" style="s2">meaning that um</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.679" end="01:27:35.280" style="s2">well if our traumas are too big</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.880" end="01:27:36.639" style="s2">and too hidden to us and we&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.280" end="01:27:40.000" style="s2">unaware of them</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.639" end="01:27:43.040" style="s2">uh like no mind-blowing</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.000" end="01:27:45.920" style="s2">psychedelic experience is gonna help</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.040" end="01:27:47.600" style="s2">uh to to get past them we actually have</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.920" end="01:27:48.080" style="s2">to wrestle the lower states and so i</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.600" end="01:27:51.440" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.080" end="01:27:55.120" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.440" end="01:27:56.480" style="s2">yes we can it&#39;s more like an instrument</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.120" end="01:27:58.480" style="s2">we can play it right</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.480" end="01:28:00.320" style="s2">uh we have to find the keys and find the</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.480" end="01:28:03.280" style="s2">melodies on it so</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.320" end="01:28:04.719" style="s2">it all depends on where we&#39;re at and</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.280" end="01:28:06.320" style="s2">sometimes we have to go a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.719" end="01:28:07.840" style="s2">higher to go a little bit lower</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.320" end="01:28:09.520" style="s2">sometimes we have to go a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.840" end="01:28:11.840" style="s2">sometimes you have to go a lot higher to</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.520" end="01:28:15.120" style="s2">go a lot lower sometimes we have to go</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.840" end="01:28:17.199" style="s2">really really deep down to be careful to</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.120" end="01:28:20.080" style="s2">back up</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.199" end="01:28:20.800" style="s2">so it&#39;s a more dynamic process and i</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.080" end="01:28:24.639" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.800" end="01:28:28.480" style="s2">that would be my intuition as well um</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.639" end="01:28:31.199" style="s2">just saying that we shouldn&#39;t opt for</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.480" end="01:28:33.280" style="s2">either or that uh either the</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.199" end="01:28:36.239" style="s2">transcendent or the descent</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.280" end="01:28:37.280" style="s2">or either the ascender or the trans</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.239" end="01:28:40.480" style="s2">descender</p>

<p begin="01:28:59.199" end="01:29:06.800" style="s2">well spirals are popular right</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.120" end="01:29:10.320" style="s2">so if we&#39;re we start in the matrix</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.800" end="01:29:12.159" style="s2">and then at the seven it&#39;s somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.320" end="01:29:14.000" style="s2">somewhat uneasy and we travel up and</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.159" end="01:29:17.280" style="s2">down a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.000" end="01:29:22.400" style="s2">we this spiritual path um</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.280" end="01:29:25.840" style="s2">is usually a kind of a kind of</p>

<p begin="01:29:25.840" end="01:29:29.360" style="s2">uh so we go up to the more transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.480" end="01:29:32.880" style="s2">we go down</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.360" end="01:29:36.560" style="s2">uh to the more visceral</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.880" end="01:29:39.679" style="s2">and and uh and painful uh we</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.560" end="01:29:40.400" style="s2">we work through very very real and</p>

<p begin="01:30:52.880" end="01:30:58.159" style="s2">our transcendence and all this</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.960" end="01:30:59.840" style="s2">can be done like is there uh what have</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.159" end="01:31:01.440" style="s2">we learned from the past maybe</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.840" end="01:31:03.120" style="s2">that will inform the way we come</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.440" end="01:31:06.560" style="s2">together so that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.120" end="01:31:08.719" style="s2">form cults um is there some type of like</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.560" end="01:31:10.239" style="s2">you know decentralized way that this is</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.719" end="01:31:12.159" style="s2">going to happen that you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.239" end="01:31:13.520" style="s2">prevents that what are your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.159" end="01:31:16.960" style="s2">that idea</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.520" end="01:31:20.880" style="s2">yeah so so we&#39;re getting into the</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.960" end="01:31:21.360" style="s2">into um the topic of future religion</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.880" end="01:31:24.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.360" end="01:31:27.159" style="s2">um but yes uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.880" end="01:31:28.320" style="s2">something in the in the direction of</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.159" end="01:31:31.440" style="s2">democratizing</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.320" end="01:31:33.920" style="s2">the guru becomes</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.440" end="01:31:35.520" style="s2">maybe a little bit more fictional but we</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.920" end="01:31:37.199" style="s2">admit that it&#39;s fictional</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.520" end="01:31:39.040" style="s2">just kind of like we&#39;re admitting that</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.199" end="01:31:42.560" style="s2">god is fictional that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.040" end="01:31:45.199" style="s2">alexander bart and his friend uh</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.560" end="01:31:46.000" style="s2">john arguing in this book right uh</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.199" end="01:31:49.600" style="s2">cynthia&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.000" end="01:31:52.320" style="s2">that we have to create god from scratch</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.600" end="01:31:55.120" style="s2">again and again in the internet age</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.320" end="01:31:56.639" style="s2">um and in the same way we have to</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.120" end="01:32:00.000" style="s2">recreate the sangha</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.639" end="01:32:03.600" style="s2">in a way that is democratizing</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.000" end="01:32:04.960" style="s2">now that is a very very very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.600" end="01:32:08.560" style="s2">thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.960" end="01:32:12.320" style="s2">for this reason eroticism</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.560" end="01:32:15.000" style="s2">um has to do with transcendence and</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.320" end="01:32:16.480" style="s2">and ascendance but also has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.000" end="01:32:20.320" style="s2">exceptionality</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.480" end="01:32:21.040" style="s2">with chosenness um with specialness</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.320" end="01:32:24.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.040" end="01:32:29.040" style="s2">uh and also actually with submission</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.800" end="01:32:32.159" style="s2">and and and uh and power</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.040" end="01:32:35.600" style="s2">so the sexiest of the ideologies</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.159" end="01:32:38.639" style="s2">uh political ideologies is fascism uh</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.600" end="01:32:41.679" style="s2">because uh and i mean this is</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.639" end="01:32:44.800" style="s2">we might not think that but</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.679" end="01:32:47.679" style="s2">when we see our elected politicians</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.800" end="01:32:48.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t scream at them as if they were</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.679" end="01:32:51.600" style="s2">rock stars</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.480" end="01:32:53.040" style="s2">and fantasize about them at home uh but</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.600" end="01:32:56.800" style="s2">that is what happened</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.040" end="01:33:00.239" style="s2">when fascist leaders came to power</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.800" end="01:33:04.400" style="s2">because the power is sexy and hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.239" end="01:33:07.920" style="s2">is sexy and spurs eroticism</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.400" end="01:33:11.440" style="s2">whereas democracy is uh</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.920" end="01:33:11.440" style="s2">well it&#39;s the bland nice guy</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.600" end="01:33:19.520" style="s2">and um diffusing power</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.239" end="01:33:21.520" style="s2">is inherently unsexy</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.520" end="01:33:23.600" style="s2">and we can&#39;t help ourselves from from</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.520" end="01:33:26.880" style="s2">this uh from this dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.600" end="01:33:28.960" style="s2">nevertheless then we have to create</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.880" end="01:33:30.239" style="s2">a democratized spirituality we have to</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.960" end="01:33:33.520" style="s2">deal with</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.239" end="01:33:36.719" style="s2">this inherent uh</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.520" end="01:33:40.719" style="s2">with this inherent paradox</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.719" end="01:33:42.800" style="s2">so i mean i think you really nailed it</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.719" end="01:33:45.199" style="s2">we have to democratize your child we</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.800" end="01:33:48.159" style="s2">have to decentralize</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.199" end="01:33:49.840" style="s2">this spiritual authority we have to make</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.159" end="01:33:53.440" style="s2">it more</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.840" end="01:33:55.840" style="s2">shared and experiential and exploratory</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.440" end="01:33:56.560" style="s2">and i think the way to do that is a lot</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.840" end="01:33:58.159" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.560" end="01:33:59.679" style="s2">what we talked about last time in</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.159" end="01:34:02.560" style="s2">aesthetics</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.679" end="01:34:05.280" style="s2">to create these transcendent aesthetics</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.560" end="01:34:08.719" style="s2">at the crossroads of fact and fiction</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.280" end="01:34:12.320" style="s2">um and and gather around those</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.719" end="01:34:14.560" style="s2">and i guess a positive example i i mean</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.320" end="01:34:15.679" style="s2">certainly not one without its problems</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.560" end="01:34:18.960" style="s2">but it is</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.679" end="01:34:21.280" style="s2">the burning man culture in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.960" end="01:34:24.239" style="s2">that people are coming together</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.280" end="01:34:25.679" style="s2">they&#39;re there as equals in many regards</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.239" end="01:34:29.440" style="s2">at least</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.679" end="01:34:34.320" style="s2">and they create artwork together</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.440" end="01:34:36.560" style="s2">and interact in a</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.320" end="01:34:39.120" style="s2">in a setting where you try to lock out</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.560" end="01:34:42.639" style="s2">the the hierarchies of</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.120" end="01:34:45.760" style="s2">the world outside however</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.639" end="01:34:46.080" style="s2">all of that is dependent on a fairly</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.760" end="01:34:50.080" style="s2">high</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.080" end="01:34:53.679" style="s2">threshold where people who show up there</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.080" end="01:34:57.040" style="s2">already are interesting people they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.679" end="01:35:00.239" style="s2">abundant in different in different</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.040" end="01:35:03.040" style="s2">ways and uh and and</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.239" end="01:35:03.840" style="s2">uh often uh sexually attractive and so</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.040" end="01:35:06.239" style="s2">on and</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.840" end="01:35:08.080" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t might be less inclined</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.239" end="01:35:11.440" style="s2">to show up there</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.080" end="01:35:17.040" style="s2">so um um</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.440" end="01:35:20.719" style="s2">so i mean can we can we stretch</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.040" end="01:35:24.320" style="s2">our eroticism um can we</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.719" end="01:35:27.679" style="s2">become more open to new experiences</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.320" end="01:35:30.800" style="s2">um not necessarily in the sexual sense</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.679" end="01:35:33.760" style="s2">but uh just in the general sense</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.800" end="01:35:34.719" style="s2">more open to appreciating one another</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.760" end="01:35:38.080" style="s2">and thus</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.719" end="01:35:39.199" style="s2">creates like and i think hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.080" end="01:35:42.000" style="s2">important here</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.199" end="01:35:43.199" style="s2">but i think the more multimodal our</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.000" end="01:35:45.760" style="s2">hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.199" end="01:35:46.880" style="s2">the more democratic they are so so that</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.760" end="01:35:48.880" style="s2">we can admire</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.880" end="01:35:50.560" style="s2">different qualities in one another and</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.880" end="01:35:53.840" style="s2">then have um</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.560" end="01:35:54.560" style="s2">like the tools to see those different</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.840" end="01:35:57.840" style="s2">strings</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.560" end="01:36:00.239" style="s2">and be blown away by each other</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.840" end="01:36:01.520" style="s2">because that&#39;s ultimately what it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.239" end="01:36:04.159" style="s2">what it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.520" end="01:36:06.400" style="s2">uh so so we don&#39;t want a situation where</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.159" end="01:36:08.159" style="s2">everybody is sitting in the sangha</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.400" end="01:36:09.679" style="s2">and this stuff literally happens in a</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.159" end="01:36:12.400" style="s2">place in portugal</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.679" end="01:36:14.320" style="s2">and they then they sing about how much</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.400" end="01:36:16.320" style="s2">they want to kiss the feet of the guru</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.320" end="01:36:18.480" style="s2">and the guru just sits there and nods</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.320" end="01:36:20.080" style="s2">and there&#39;s something profoundly sick</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.480" end="01:36:22.800" style="s2">about that of course</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.080" end="01:36:24.159" style="s2">uh we should be kissing the feet of just</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.800" end="01:36:27.040" style="s2">any other person</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.159" end="01:36:28.159" style="s2">um because we think they&#39;re so awesome</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.040" end="01:36:31.119" style="s2">no we shouldn&#39;t kiss me</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.159" end="01:36:32.400" style="s2">that&#39;s silly but uh yeah but you see</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.119" end="01:36:35.520" style="s2">what i mean that</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.400" end="01:36:39.199" style="s2">um that somehow</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.520" end="01:36:41.199" style="s2">we need and to well these these five</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.199" end="01:36:43.920" style="s2">qualities and the last one is opening up</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.199" end="01:36:44.880" style="s2">the more we open up the more we can open</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.920" end="01:36:48.639" style="s2">up to</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.880" end="01:36:51.840" style="s2">uh different uh interesting</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.639" end="01:36:53.600" style="s2">unique genuinely powerful qualities of</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.840" end="01:36:55.360" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.600" end="01:36:57.520" style="s2">and and that&#39;s kind of the things we</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.360" end="01:36:58.000" style="s2">have to create rituals and structures</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.520" end="01:36:59.679" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.000" end="01:37:01.199" style="s2">so i don&#39;t have the answers here but i</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.679" end="01:37:04.560" style="s2">think the direction is</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.199" end="01:37:08.719" style="s2">fairly clear exploratory</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.560" end="01:37:12.000" style="s2">the deep co-created um</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.719" end="01:37:15.040" style="s2">spiritual sanghas which are perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.000" end="01:37:18.560" style="s2">much more modal and much less</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.040" end="01:37:19.280" style="s2">rigid in their structures still creates</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.560" end="01:37:22.400" style="s2">a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.280" end="01:37:25.040" style="s2">a lot of space for faults</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.400" end="01:37:27.040" style="s2">sure the point is that we would have</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.040" end="01:37:29.600" style="s2">shorter feedback cycles so we can</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.040" end="01:37:32.840" style="s2">correct the faults or correct the errors</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.600" end="01:37:35.840" style="s2">uh more quickly and self-correct</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.840" end="01:37:35.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.800" end="01:37:42.320" style="s2">yeah so the relation of tomorrow would</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.639" end="01:37:45.040" style="s2">probably be something in that direction</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.320" end="01:37:47.040" style="s2">great great response i appreciate that</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.040" end="01:37:49.360" style="s2">thanks</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.040" end="01:37:50.719" style="s2">awesome fascinating thank you so much i</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.360" end="01:37:51.679" style="s2">think uh that&#39;s gonna have to be our</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.719" end="01:37:53.600" style="s2">last question</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.679" end="01:37:57.040" style="s2">uh because we&#39;re out of time uh daniel</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.600" end="01:37:57.040" style="s2">did you have anything to close us out</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.840" end="01:38:05.760" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.119" end="01:38:06.960" style="s2">this thing that didn&#39;t make it into the</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.760" end="01:38:12.080" style="s2">into this one</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.960" end="01:38:12.080" style="s2">into the powerpoint just um</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.239" end="01:38:23.119" style="s2">qualities and these come in a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.440" end="01:38:26.159" style="s2">so going more directly for transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.119" end="01:38:28.719" style="s2">one of the most powerful meditations uh</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.159" end="01:38:30.239" style="s2">is awareness meditation a very direct</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.719" end="01:38:32.800" style="s2">form of awareness meditation</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.239" end="01:38:33.760" style="s2">which i feel marries these qualities of</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.800" end="01:38:36.800" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.760" end="01:38:39.840" style="s2">and uh ascendance and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.800" end="01:38:42.400" style="s2">an open eye meditation</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.840" end="01:38:43.760" style="s2">and as you sit down with open eyes and</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.400" end="01:38:44.560" style="s2">you look at stuff i don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.760" end="01:38:46.960" style="s2">invented this</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.560" end="01:38:47.840" style="s2">i came across the ring of course a while</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.960" end="01:38:51.119" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.840" end="01:38:54.000" style="s2">and and you sit down and you grab</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.119" end="01:38:55.199" style="s2">a nice object hopefully nicer than this</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.000" end="01:38:59.360" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.199" end="01:39:02.080" style="s2">and um and you look at it very closely</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.360" end="01:39:04.800" style="s2">and and then you look for the quality of</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.080" end="01:39:04.800" style="s2">perfection</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.199" end="01:39:10.880" style="s2">and once you&#39;ve found details like</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.320" end="01:39:12.320" style="s2">subtle little details in it then you</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.880" end="01:39:15.360" style="s2">look for the quality</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.320" end="01:39:18.719" style="s2">of delight in yourself</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.360" end="01:39:18.719" style="s2">over that perfection</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.880" end="01:39:23.600" style="s2">and after a while when you&#39;ve delighted</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.400" end="01:39:26.719" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.600" end="01:39:29.280" style="s2">the color of this thing</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.719" end="01:39:31.600" style="s2">how it shines etcetera glass these are</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.280" end="01:39:34.320" style="s2">actually pretty fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.600" end="01:39:36.960" style="s2">then you can have a sense of wonder and</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.320" end="01:39:38.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the third quality</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.960" end="01:39:40.159" style="s2">and once and if you&#39;ve been in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.880" end="01:39:42.080" style="s2">of wonder for a while</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.159" end="01:39:44.000" style="s2">and this only happens every now and then</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.080" end="01:39:49.119" style="s2">but i i can see it on</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.000" end="01:39:52.320" style="s2">on the eeg meter that i get a spike in</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.119" end="01:39:52.320" style="s2">in gamma waves</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.560" end="01:39:56.800" style="s2">you get a sense of euphoric happiness it</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.719" end="01:40:00.080" style="s2">just kind of flows up</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.800" end="01:40:03.360" style="s2">through you and in that</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.080" end="01:40:03.679" style="s2">euphoric happiness once you&#39;ve sat there</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.360" end="01:40:05.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.679" end="01:40:07.679" style="s2">looked for a little while with that you</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.760" end="01:40:10.719" style="s2">have the sense of equanimity</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.679" end="01:40:12.239" style="s2">and imperative imperturbability and</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.719" end="01:40:12.960" style="s2">nothing can move you because you are</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.239" end="01:40:16.080" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.960" end="01:40:19.280" style="s2">euphorically happy and</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.080" end="01:40:23.840" style="s2">when you have equanimity</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.280" end="01:40:26.080" style="s2">and imperturbability ability then</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.840" end="01:40:26.080" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.360" end="01:40:34.840" style="s2">then there is a space for of safety</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.440" end="01:40:39.199" style="s2">and you just feel a basic</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.840" end="01:40:39.199" style="s2">safety or okayness</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.520" end="01:40:47.679" style="s2">and once you&#39;re safe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.719" end="01:40:48.480" style="s2">when you start to have a quality of</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.679" end="01:40:51.920" style="s2">innocence</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.480" end="01:40:55.920" style="s2">just direct childlike innocence</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.920" end="01:40:58.320" style="s2">and in that sense of innocence</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.920" end="01:40:59.360" style="s2">you sit there and you&#39;re innocently</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.320" end="01:41:02.480" style="s2">enjoying</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.360" end="01:41:02.719" style="s2">the safety and safety the the perfection</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.480" end="01:41:05.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.719" end="01:41:07.199" style="s2">light the wonder the foreign happiness</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.600" end="01:41:11.360" style="s2">you&#39;re equanimous</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.199" end="01:41:14.800" style="s2">you feel safe feel innocent</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.360" end="01:41:18.880" style="s2">then there is a sense of immediacy</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.800" end="01:41:22.880" style="s2">that just is-ness or being</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.880" end="01:41:25.600" style="s2">it takes you perhaps to stage 11</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.880" end="01:41:25.600" style="s2">vast open</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.000" end="01:41:29.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s well cartel has this power of</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.480" end="01:41:32.719" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.440" end="01:41:36.800" style="s2">and i think he he emphasizes</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.719" end="01:41:36.800" style="s2">the power of an albert prematurely</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.119" end="01:41:40.800" style="s2">um because the power of now it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.159" end="01:41:44.400" style="s2">going to be there</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.800" end="01:41:47.440" style="s2">unless we have the safety so</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.400" end="01:41:50.480" style="s2">and actually all of the other qualities</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.440" end="01:41:53.840" style="s2">so uh i uh</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.480" end="01:41:58.000" style="s2">posit that in the future</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.840" end="01:42:01.360" style="s2">forms of aesthetically driven</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.000" end="01:42:03.600" style="s2">spirituality will uh</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.360" end="01:42:05.600" style="s2">partake in this kind of open eye</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.600" end="01:42:08.320" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.600" end="01:42:10.080" style="s2">and uh and travel through these</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.320" end="01:42:14.080" style="s2">qualities</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.080" end="01:42:15.600" style="s2">and from and particularly then the most</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.080" end="01:42:18.719" style="s2">difficult of all which is</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.600" end="01:42:21.920" style="s2">safety and then safety</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.719" end="01:42:23.440" style="s2">is uh actually where we can play and be</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.920" end="01:42:26.239" style="s2">innocent together</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.440" end="01:42:28.000" style="s2">um so so that that&#39;s kind of my vision</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.239" end="01:42:30.320" style="s2">for for the future of</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.000" end="01:42:32.159" style="s2">spirituality and i think if this</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.320" end="01:42:35.040" style="s2">meditation i don&#39;t know who invented it</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.159" end="01:42:37.679" style="s2">but i think it&#39;s absolutely genius</p>
