<p begin="00:00:02.610" end="00:00:09.269" style="s2">on men&#39;s behavior what&#39;s strange is how</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.980" end="00:00:12.120" style="s2">similar it feels to the 1970s where what</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.269" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">forty years on the original men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.120" end="00:00:15.330" style="s2">movement that the way that the women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">movement and feminism has kind of given</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:19.350" style="s2">women consciousness and men need to step</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:20.820" style="s2">up and respond to it feels very very</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.350" end="00:00:23.250" style="s2">contemporary feels like it could have</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.820" end="00:00:25.619" style="s2">been written yesterday yeah so it feels</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.250" end="00:00:29.689" style="s2">like we&#39;re in the same yes thing and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.619" end="00:00:32.450" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of led by women coming out and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.689" end="00:00:35.160" style="s2">finding their voice in addressing and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.450" end="00:00:37.040" style="s2">challenging the masculine and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.160" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">sometimes called the patriarchy or</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.040" end="00:00:45.480" style="s2">patriarchal behavior or unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:47.670" style="s2">things in the mail maybe even set or</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.480" end="00:00:49.890" style="s2">kind of kick-started a little bit by at</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.670" end="00:00:52.829" style="s2">the political situation by somebody like</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.890" end="00:00:54.840" style="s2">Trump being elected I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.829" end="00:00:57.090" style="s2">all the factors that bring it up right</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.840" end="00:00:59.399" style="s2">now but it&#39;s I&#39;m happy that it comes up</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.090" end="00:01:01.829" style="s2">you know it&#39;s great for women to really</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.399" end="00:01:03.809" style="s2">speak up and to tell the truth and with</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.829" end="00:01:06.450" style="s2">the meet you thing and you know to not</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.809" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">swallow it and the level of denial</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.450" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">that&#39;s been there for so long it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:14.250" style="s2">really exposed right now what you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:16.530" style="s2">so many men have presumed is okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.250" end="00:01:19.590" style="s2">just not okay and so there&#39;s a real like</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.530" end="00:01:21.210" style="s2">whoa gotta check myself out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.590" end="00:01:22.890" style="s2">really great and then that brings a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.210" end="00:01:25.080" style="s2">response from the men but if we come</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:30.290" style="s2">back with like oh my god it&#39;s terrible</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.080" end="00:01:33.600" style="s2">person and I&#39;m a male and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.290" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">nothing can happen nothing good from</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.600" end="00:01:39.390" style="s2">that space yeah I am let me face those</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">places inside of myself where I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.390" end="00:01:44.310" style="s2">those distortions where I might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:48.710" style="s2">misogynist misogynistic where I might</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.310" end="00:01:51.479" style="s2">have unconscious you know sexual</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.710" end="00:01:52.710" style="s2">projections onto women and look at that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.479" end="00:01:54.780" style="s2">and I feel like that&#39;s what we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.710" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">doing back in the 70s also you know that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.780" end="00:01:59.670" style="s2">whole concept of objectifying women was</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">completely unknown at that point our</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.670" end="00:02:02.729" style="s2">thought about you really what oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:06.060" style="s2">god I do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.729" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">I do that all the time you know what</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.060" end="00:02:10.590" style="s2">happens if I go into that and look at</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:12.590" style="s2">how I do that does that change how I see</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.590" end="00:02:14.870" style="s2">women and how I relate to women</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.590" end="00:02:17.090" style="s2">yes it does you know but it&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.870" end="00:02:21.580" style="s2">owned you know so right now we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.090" end="00:02:24.319" style="s2">called on to look again you know and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.580" end="00:02:26.150" style="s2">it&#39;s not to please the women though we</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">have to do it for ourselves because</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.150" end="00:02:29.540" style="s2">there&#39;s something comes up and if</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:30.709" style="s2">there&#39;s a reaction there inside to it</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.540" end="00:02:33.019" style="s2">it&#39;s telling us something about</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.709" end="00:02:35.660" style="s2">ourselves and to do it for ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.019" end="00:02:37.430" style="s2">how would you summarize the work that</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.660" end="00:02:41.450" style="s2">men need to do in the simplest possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.430" end="00:02:44.390" style="s2">way is it to really look at themselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.450" end="00:02:46.069" style="s2">look at the distortions look at the look</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.390" end="00:02:48.079" style="s2">at the ways that because what because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.069" end="00:02:49.579" style="s2">say there&#39;s a kind of integration that a</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.079" end="00:02:53.959" style="s2">lot of these negative behaviors of men</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.579" end="00:02:57.110" style="s2">are are disintegrated parts of the male</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.959" end="00:02:57.860" style="s2">psyche that on their own are very can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.110" end="00:02:59.660" style="s2">very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.860" end="00:03:03.890" style="s2">like the aggression left to itself or</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.660" end="00:03:05.739" style="s2">rage or any of these like there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.890" end="00:03:08.060" style="s2">tools and they&#39;re part of what makes</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.739" end="00:03:10.489" style="s2">like they&#39;re part of the male psyche but</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.060" end="00:03:12.470" style="s2">they have to be integrated healthily</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.489" end="00:03:17.329" style="s2">within within the personality that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.470" end="00:03:19.850" style="s2">I how I see it yeah well it is my</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.329" end="00:03:22.940" style="s2">observation that most of the work that</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.850" end="00:03:24.410" style="s2">men have to do on themselves has to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.940" end="00:03:26.389" style="s2">with getting grounded in their</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.410" end="00:03:29.329" style="s2">masculinity and most of the work that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.389" end="00:03:32.359" style="s2">women have to do on themselves it kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.329" end="00:03:34.760" style="s2">of relaxed confident grounded in their</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.359" end="00:03:36.709" style="s2">femininity and then of course we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.760" end="00:03:39.260" style="s2">this inner polarity I have a feminine</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.709" end="00:03:41.660" style="s2">side a woman as a masculine side but</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.260" end="00:03:44.150" style="s2">those sides rather than be problematic</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.660" end="00:03:45.980" style="s2">which they are and you&#39;re not relaxed</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.150" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">and confident in your biological sex</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.980" end="00:03:52.280" style="s2">become very easy to integrate as well as</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:56.209" style="s2">the external relationships with opposite</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.280" end="00:03:58.489" style="s2">sex so it seems to me that it is my</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.209" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">experience that the work that people</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.489" end="00:04:04.459" style="s2">need to doing themselves is to really</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:06.769" style="s2">look at why do I not feel relaxed and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.459" end="00:04:08.630" style="s2">confident grounded in the mask and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.769" end="00:04:11.870" style="s2">another word for that on the male side</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.630" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">was castrated so this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.870" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">castration wound usually that keeps man</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:22.130" style="s2">from feeling that he&#39;s really got what</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:23.870" style="s2">it takes you know to do the job and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.130" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">instead of being relaxed and confident</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.870" end="00:04:28.039" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to compensate for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:30.139" style="s2">feeling of deficiency in these efforting</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.039" end="00:04:33.949" style="s2">and it brings him up and in this head</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.139" end="00:04:36.889" style="s2">and you know turns him into a dickhead</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.949" end="00:04:39.830" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of talk at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.889" end="00:04:41.870" style="s2">about wanting men to be more vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.830" end="00:04:45.020" style="s2">like there&#39;s something definitely in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.870" end="00:04:47.710" style="s2">in the culture now about men being asked</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.020" end="00:04:50.449" style="s2">out from their open up to be more</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.710" end="00:04:52.129" style="s2">revealing about their feelings but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.449" end="00:04:53.659" style="s2">seems to me there&#39;s a kind of danger if</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.129" end="00:04:57.470" style="s2">that&#39;s not balanced by some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.659" end="00:04:59.210" style="s2">respect for the healthy masculine which</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.470" end="00:05:00.440" style="s2">is which is more than just vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.210" end="00:05:02.900" style="s2">because that whole narrative sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.440" end="00:05:04.610" style="s2">feeds into an idea that men are faulty</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.900" end="00:05:07.009" style="s2">masculinity is faulty there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.610" end="00:05:11.630" style="s2">wrong with with the masculine it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.009" end="00:05:13.699" style="s2">helpful for a man to go to vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.630" end="00:05:16.840" style="s2">if there&#39;s not a respect for the mascot</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.699" end="00:05:19.400" style="s2">and to go to a kind of feminized</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.840" end="00:05:21.830" style="s2">personality type out of a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.400" end="00:05:24.289" style="s2">guilt and shame for the mask on what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.830" end="00:05:27.949" style="s2">masculine is done and what it&#39;s capable</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.289" end="00:05:29.449" style="s2">of and all of that there is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.949" end="00:05:32.810" style="s2">horror shows that have happened from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.449" end="00:05:34.310" style="s2">mess Khun Danai ibly but the healing of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.810" end="00:05:37.060" style="s2">that is not for the men to become</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.310" end="00:05:39.590" style="s2">feminine it&#39;s for the men to grow up</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.060" end="00:05:42.110" style="s2">embrace their masculinity face the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.590" end="00:05:44.180" style="s2">distortions that have been given to them</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.110" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">by the culture and by their families</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.180" end="00:05:48.740" style="s2">face the castration this happened that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:50.599" style="s2">taking away their confidence in their</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.740" end="00:05:53.029" style="s2">power the personal wounding that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.599" end="00:05:54.500" style="s2">happened and show up in presence and</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.469" end="00:06:04.969" style="s2">what does that look like and what is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.120" end="00:06:08.690" style="s2">work that gets us there as a man as men</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.969" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2">the work is before I think going through</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.690" end="00:06:12.860" style="s2">one thing is that collective place</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:15.560" style="s2">that&#39;s held in the masculine where it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.860" end="00:06:17.180" style="s2">really distorted and owning them and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.560" end="00:06:19.550" style="s2">that means facing your own personal</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.180" end="00:06:21.500" style="s2">shadow and the collective masculine</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.550" end="00:06:24.740" style="s2">shadow and the impulses towards</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.500" end="00:06:28.310" style="s2">dominance and violence and anger and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.740" end="00:06:30.919" style="s2">all of the horror stuff that&#39;s happening</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.610" end="00:07:02.069" style="s2">the embracing of the distortion it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.069" end="00:07:07.289" style="s2">to come through and and the irony of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.949" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">is that so many men have come to work on</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.289" end="00:07:11.939" style="s2">themselves made a decision at some point</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:14.699" style="s2">that they want to be anything but like</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.939" end="00:07:17.669" style="s2">those guys you know pointing to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.699" end="00:07:20.490" style="s2">family pointing to the distorted men in</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.669" end="00:07:22.259" style="s2">our culture and stuff and so they reject</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.490" end="00:07:24.210" style="s2">the mask and it&#39;s a kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.259" end="00:07:27.029" style="s2">castration you know they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.210" end="00:07:29.189" style="s2">anything but like that and they can feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.029" end="00:07:31.259" style="s2">in sense that they have that inside of</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.189" end="00:07:33.060" style="s2">them they have the violence they have</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.259" end="00:07:37.139" style="s2">the distortion we have the aggression</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.060" end="00:07:40.229" style="s2">and yet my experience is is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.139" end="00:07:43.409" style="s2">not that big it&#39;s like it&#39;s a barrier</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.229" end="00:07:46.229" style="s2">you have to go through and so I often</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.409" end="00:07:48.330" style="s2">take men right into that in a really</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.229" end="00:07:52.589" style="s2">strong way and encourage them to really</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.330" end="00:07:55.289" style="s2">feel and and share and experience all</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.589" end="00:07:57.419" style="s2">the aggression inside all the distortion</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.289" end="00:07:59.279" style="s2">to own and to feel it to feel even the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.419" end="00:08:02.639" style="s2">tendency towards violence the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.279" end="00:08:03.959" style="s2">frustration that&#39;s there inside and when</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:05.399" style="s2">they do that they come in to they they</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.959" end="00:08:07.499" style="s2">go through you go through it and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.399" end="00:08:09.449" style="s2">come into a relaxed place underneath it</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.499" end="00:08:11.249" style="s2">which is really like the roots of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.449" end="00:08:13.439" style="s2">mask um you know and that&#39;s what holds</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.249" end="00:08:14.699" style="s2">the body afterwards but you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.439" end="00:08:16.379" style="s2">there if you don&#39;t pass through the</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.389" end="00:08:26.849" style="s2">how it plays out in me and I find men</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.149" end="00:08:29.249" style="s2">are very very kind with each other when</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.849" end="00:08:31.740" style="s2">we share our shadow and we share our</p>

<p begin="00:09:06.180" end="00:09:14.580" style="s2">this grounded presence that is as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:18.330" style="s2">strong sense of discriminating</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.580" end="00:09:21.270" style="s2">intelligence can see what&#39;s needed in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.330" end="00:09:24.180" style="s2">particular situation and take action an</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.270" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">appropriate action without going over</p>

<p begin="00:09:27.960" end="00:09:31.260" style="s2">and we talk about the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.940" end="00:09:33.510" style="s2">masculine the essence of feminine</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.260" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s very easy to say oh well</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.510" end="00:09:37.800" style="s2">think of a quality like receptivity well</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:40.170" style="s2">men should be receptive as well or women</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.800" end="00:09:42.140" style="s2">can be strong so when you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.170" end="00:09:44.460" style="s2">people sometimes get a bit touchy about</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.140" end="00:09:46.950" style="s2">using the word masculine and feminine to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.460" end="00:09:48.420" style="s2">mean certain qualities what do you see</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.950" end="00:09:52.050" style="s2">is the essence of the masculine for</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.420" end="00:09:54.420" style="s2">example well I people do get really</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.050" end="00:09:56.990" style="s2">touchy about that and and sometimes I</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.420" end="00:10:00.180" style="s2">think that&#39;s really a pity because there</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.990" end="00:10:02.070" style="s2">there there&#39;s an implicit judgement in</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.180" end="00:10:04.860" style="s2">there and I&#39;d offensiveness and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.070" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">whole thing you know it&#39;s like yes I can</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.860" end="00:10:10.410" style="s2">be really receptive and soft and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:13.590" style="s2">are typically called feminine qualities</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.410" end="00:10:16.260" style="s2">but I think in that the essence and real</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.590" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">embodiment of the mascot it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.260" end="00:10:22.860" style="s2">it&#39;s just to say it&#39;s different than the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:25.290" style="s2">feminine is absolutely equal absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.860" end="00:10:27.110" style="s2">equal in levels of power absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.290" end="00:10:31.740" style="s2">equal and levels of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.110" end="00:10:33.930" style="s2">telchines absolutely equal down through</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.740" end="00:10:37.020" style="s2">the whole list but completely different</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.930" end="00:10:39.990" style="s2">you know and my embodiment in my and my</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.020" end="00:10:42.720" style="s2">expression of myself as a man is</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.990" end="00:10:44.850" style="s2">different than a woman in the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.720" end="00:10:47.220" style="s2">and her expression through the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.850" end="00:10:48.960" style="s2">and as the feminine but does she have</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.220" end="00:10:51.720" style="s2">masculine qualities of course she does</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.960" end="00:10:56.700" style="s2">and she can be as assertive strong and</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:01.720" style="s2">into trouble is when her masculine side</p>
