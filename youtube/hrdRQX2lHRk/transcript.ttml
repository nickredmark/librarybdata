<p begin="00:00:01.760" end="00:00:06.319" style="s2">yeah so so last night</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.280" end="00:00:10.240" style="s2">i i noticed that my mind was turning to</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.319" end="00:00:13.360" style="s2">a a frame of making sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.240" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">of the the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.360" end="00:00:16.880" style="s2">is sometimes referred to as culture ward</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:18.960" style="s2">2.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.880" end="00:00:20.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a phenomenon in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.960" end="00:00:22.160" style="s2">that phenomenon there&#39;s of course lots</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.320" end="00:00:24.160" style="s2">of different things that are going on</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.160" end="00:00:25.439" style="s2">and one way of naming it has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.160" end="00:00:28.240" style="s2">culture war 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.439" end="00:00:29.359" style="s2">and it has a lot of attention i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.240" end="00:00:31.840" style="s2">think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.359" end="00:00:34.000" style="s2">maybe most people um certainly most</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.840" end="00:00:38.079" style="s2">people involved in social media</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.000" end="00:00:39.680" style="s2">um have a sense of attending to it a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.079" end="00:00:43.120" style="s2">sense of concern</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.680" end="00:00:44.239" style="s2">a sense that there&#39;s a problem there um</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.120" end="00:00:45.520" style="s2">maybe even more than just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.239" end="00:00:46.960" style="s2">of like a big problem like a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.520" end="00:00:49.760" style="s2">like something bad is happening</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.960" end="00:00:51.680" style="s2">and also not only do i not have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.760" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">of what to do about it but i have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.680" end="00:00:55.760" style="s2">distinct felt sense that nobody does</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">like this like a therefore a poor tent</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">that will just get worse</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">right which leads i think oftentimes to</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.760" end="00:01:02.320" style="s2">to kind of two or three strategies right</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:04.799" style="s2">one strategy is</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.320" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">just helplessness and hopelessness the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:06.799" style="s2">second strategy which is just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:08.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.799" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">with higher agency which would be kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.240" end="00:01:13.760" style="s2">of cynicism and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">you know participation in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.760" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">progressive badness by virtue of making</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.159" end="00:01:19.759" style="s2">small local wins</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">yeah right would they say like</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.759" end="00:01:23.439" style="s2">millennials won&#39;t own</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:25.119" style="s2">any properties so then they could do his</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.439" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">own people online like that kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.119" end="00:01:28.640" style="s2">sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:30.159" style="s2">and then the third of course is even</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.640" end="00:01:33.520" style="s2">that is the worst which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.159" end="00:01:35.119" style="s2">highly strategic uh local games</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.520" end="00:01:36.560" style="s2">so in the context of this how do i</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.119" end="00:01:39.520" style="s2">actually grab and make you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.560" end="00:01:40.400" style="s2">steal or take territory for myself which</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.520" end="00:01:42.640" style="s2">of course is</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.400" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">pervasive among the most engented groups</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:44.960" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:47.200" style="s2">what i was thinking about was i think i</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.960" end="00:01:49.600" style="s2">was thinking i&#39;m not sure what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.200" end="00:01:52.399" style="s2">orient what the origin was but</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.600" end="00:01:53.119" style="s2">greg&#39;s the the paper greg sent me</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.399" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.119" end="00:01:56.960" style="s2">which was this russian mathematician who</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">was taking multiple different</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.960" end="00:02:00.399" style="s2">uh data points like different people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">had done data points similar to the one</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.399" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">that kurzweil based his curves on</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:06.399" style="s2">right right um but but very distinctly</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:07.600" style="s2">from actually different cultures and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.399" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">different languages and so for very</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.600" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">different models</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:11.599" style="s2">but as it turns out all very similar</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">curves and the russian mathematicians</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.599" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">did in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">i can give you one formula that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">describes all of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">um and the deeper point was</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">the the thing that&#39;s under investigation</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s changing in time</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:28.160" style="s2">is is actually the rate of paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:30.080" style="s2">shifts</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.160" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">so the paradigm a particular phase</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:34.160" style="s2">transition in</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:35.120" style="s2">quality at the end of emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.160" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.120" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">um are happening faster and faster</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">they&#39;re happening closer and closer</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">so the the thing that i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">about was like okay one frame that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">might use to explain what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">is something like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">singularity is happening it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">unevenly distributed</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">that what we&#39;re seeing as culture war</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:03:03.519" style="s2">is actually just the high the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">the specific response</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.519" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">of structures psychological structures</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">political structures</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">in the context of um</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.480" end="00:03:20.480" style="s2">this kind of a warping or a shaping i</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.800" end="00:03:21.519" style="s2">think something will seem like a tornado</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.519" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">a vortex of change that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">is happening differentially so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">happening in different places at</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">different rates so for example one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:34.159" style="s2">the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">um say like the west coast of the us</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.159" end="00:03:38.480" style="s2">or the big cities um happen to be hot</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">spots of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">these super intense culture war type</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">forces</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">in this frame is in fact actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">that&#39;s where the effect of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:50.480" style="s2">singularity is at its most</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:52.319" style="s2">advanced like that&#39;s where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.480" end="00:03:55.599" style="s2">happening the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.319" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">um so are you using singularity in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.599" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">kurzweil sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">well i mean i&#39;m using it in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:02.080" style="s2">this particular russian</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">theorist so it has to do with something</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:07.439" style="s2">like an accelerating rate of change</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">in the in this in the paradigmatic sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.439" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:12.840" style="s2">uh deep change and deep change now</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">happening at a rate that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.840" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">inside uh our psychological capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">respond so by the time we&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:22.880" style="s2">begun to re-cohere some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">paradigm the paradigm itself is actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.880" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">shifting right so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">the story the story that this guy tells</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:29.440" style="s2">um is</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:30.800" style="s2">well i&#39;ll superimpose it the story tells</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.440" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">zooming in on like the last thousand</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.800" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">um or i guess post bronze age um</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:38.479" style="s2">after the after the post bronze age</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:41.199" style="s2">collapse after the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.479" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">that dark age um i guess the axial age</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.199" end="00:04:44.320" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">the invention of paradigmatic mind a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.320" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">particular mind that had a capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:50.000" style="s2">generate</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">models largely in the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">layer to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">coordinate behavior across large</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:57.360" style="s2">populations by using these models</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">and then mechanisms for disseminating it</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.360" end="00:05:02.000" style="s2">and holding the models as having</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:03.199" style="s2">a certain level of uh ideological</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.000" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2">integrity</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.199" end="00:05:07.280" style="s2">okay so so formal meaning structures uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">and then and then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.280" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">a time frame a period of time where the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:12.639" style="s2">paradigms would</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">s curve right they would begin the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.639" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">process of formation they would actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">become relatively effective they would</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">manifest as</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">emergent practical capacities in reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">which would show up in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:24.639" style="s2">economy and military and things like</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">that which would then lead to expansive</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.639" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">civilizations uh then they would reach</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">uh with anomaly i&#39;m doing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:36.320" style="s2">tainter and coon at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:37.600" style="s2">yeah yeah i get it um anomalies would</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.320" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">start getting thrown you would start</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">meaning our meaning making structures</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">and then you would have some new</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:57.759" style="s2">paradigm emerge</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:59.600" style="s2">um and the singularity hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.759" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">proposes that this is actually something</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.600" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">which is happening more rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">as you go like a thousand years and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">500 years and now 250 i&#39;m just using</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">havoc but it&#39;s not that&#39;s not the actual</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">curve and the point is that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">the if you think about the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:16.000" style="s2">developmental</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">capacity of homo sapiens right it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.000" end="00:06:22.160" style="s2">much embedded in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">in generational cycles meaning that uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">eight-year-olds can divorce can develop</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.840" end="00:06:26.160" style="s2">a paradigm much more rapidly than</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.360" end="00:06:27.840" style="s2">80-year-olds</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.160" end="00:06:29.680" style="s2">or can adapt to a new paradigm more</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:31.919" style="s2">rapidly so there&#39;s like a rate limiter</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.680" end="00:06:33.039" style="s2">of as long as the rate of change of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.919" end="00:06:36.319" style="s2">paradigms is happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.039" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">outside outside of that rate you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.319" end="00:06:39.440" style="s2">the boomers you remember the generation</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:40.919" style="s2">gap</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.440" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">yeah the boomers are literally</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.919" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">developmentally responding to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:47.440" style="s2">completely different</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">paradigm than their parents so it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.440" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">that their parents you know were</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">developmentally in paradigm eight</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">and boomers were actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">developmentally in paradigm nine because</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:56.800" style="s2">the paradigm had shifted</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">inside that that art within the lasting</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.800" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">within that 50 year period</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">um but the boomers were in fact in some</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">sense well adapted</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">to the paradigm in which they were in</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:08.479" style="s2">the paradigm itself you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">suffers from this from change and cooney</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.479" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">and problems but the boomers are well</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">adapted to it</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">but by the time you start getting into</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">the 70s what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">in inside a developmental arc like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">generation x is characterized by kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">like having a half step</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:27.039" style="s2">so the mid-century paradigm was already</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:29.680" style="s2">broken by the time that we were</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">coming of age but a new paradigm hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.680" end="00:07:32.639" style="s2">yet shifted so we were caught</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">but then with the millennials again in</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">this theory what happens to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">millennials is</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">as they show up in a paradigm you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:40.720" style="s2">they develop into a paradigm by the time</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:42.880" style="s2">they&#39;re you know 14</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.720" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">that paradigm is already collapsing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">by the time they&#39;re 28</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">the next paradigm is already collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:48.800" style="s2">so now inside the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.120" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">developmental space of a single human</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:50.960" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">if you start getting paradigm shifts</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.960" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">happening at that rate that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:55.520" style="s2">completely different game</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got a you know a game where</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.520" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">the periodic structure has a set of</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">characteristic problems having to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">with tantrums</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">and whatnot but then you&#39;ve got another</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2">game or another</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">set of characteristics that matter that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">you when when the when a paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">is happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:11.840" style="s2">inside four generations</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">so that you&#39;ve got a generation gap that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.840" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">creates a a</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:16.720" style="s2">a dynamic then when it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">inside a single human</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.720" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">psychological developmental time frame</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">that&#39;s another dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">and so the proposition would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">something like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">so to explain like a phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">explanation from one of the things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">i have like these fingers of of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.360" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">instability like if i have a field</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:33.760" style="s2">effective like</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">what&#39;s like a think of like a science</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.760" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">fiction movie where</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">you know over there time is actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">moving faster than over there</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">and so in certain places like certain</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">places are literally</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">uh because of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">well i don&#39;t talk about that just yet</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">but for reasons um</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">are are more immersed in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">uh paradigm evolution or paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">that are operating at a currently at a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">higher rate and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">you know something like say some areas</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">in silicon valley are operating at a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">pace where</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">they&#39;re already on the other side of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">particular paradigm change where say</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">like kansas</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:15.920" style="s2">isn&#39;t so you&#39;ve got the generation gap</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.920" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">but and also more importantly because</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">the different the rate of change is</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">higher you&#39;ve actually got a breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:27.200" style="s2">in mind to break down</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">the psychology that is on the premise on</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.200" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">the notion of having a paradigm to run</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.560" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">um so that was the thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">and just to bring it back around to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:36.959" style="s2">original proposal the original proposal</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.959" end="00:09:40.160" style="s2">that the culture wars are symptomatic of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">the fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.160" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">that these rates of paradigmatic change</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:46.720" style="s2">are not evenly distributed</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:48.240" style="s2">is that the idea yeah exactly and in</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.720" end="00:09:50.720" style="s2">some sense it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.240" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">we&#39;re actually perceiving them as</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.720" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">culture wars</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">but in fact they&#39;re not there&#39;s a better</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">way to understand what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">happening is that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:09:59.680" style="s2">the choices that are showing up like</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">what&#39;s actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.680" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">is literally just a local response to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">the level of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:06.480" style="s2">paradigm change that&#39;s going on in your</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.480" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">um that&#39;s more it&#39;s a more uh how do i</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">say this right like</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">imagine i have a uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">a bunch of iron filings and i noticed</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.760" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">that the iron filings are moving</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">and so i i i sort of look at them and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">say well the iron filings are moving for</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">reasons having to do with the iron</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:27.440" style="s2">violence</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">and somebody else comes along and says</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.440" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">no i&#39;ve actually got a magnet under the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:32.800" style="s2">table</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:36.560" style="s2">right so yeah what you&#39;re saying is uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.800" end="00:10:39.600" style="s2">to use sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.560" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">experimental lingo is i&#39;ve seen you</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.600" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">the people in the culture wars think</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">there&#39;s a causal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">uh but there&#39;s act but it&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">correlation and there&#39;s an underlying</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">third variable</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:52.079" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right both of them so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.720" end="00:10:54.000" style="s2">not the filings are not</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.079" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">impacting on each other it only looks</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.000" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">that way it&#39;s because of the magnet</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">underneath where the magnet is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:01.680" style="s2">the paradigmatic chain is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:02.959" style="s2">yeah more specifically the rate the rate</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.680" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">of the paramedic change</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.959" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">and and and the and the implications of</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">a rate of paradigmatic change that&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:13.839" style="s2">inside the capacity of minds</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.519" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">the way that our psychological coherence</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.839" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">systems operates</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">that creates the paradigmatic mind is no</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">longer able to actually respond to its</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">own context</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">so the context is changing faster than</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:26.560" style="s2">the mind&#39;s ability to generate this</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:28.160" style="s2">particular form of response to context</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:30.800" style="s2">okay that sounds that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">interesting proposal it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re sort of facing perpetual</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:37.680" style="s2">future shock</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">of you know tougher&#39;s notion yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.680" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s not equally distributed now</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">what&#39;s the main explanation for why the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:45.360" style="s2">distribution isn&#39;t equal does it have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:48.399" style="s2">do something like with</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.360" end="00:11:50.800" style="s2">access to technology um</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.399" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">you know population density what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.800" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">variables</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.440" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">are would account for uh the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">heterogeneous distribution</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">of the future shock um i would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.200" end="00:12:02.240" style="s2">there&#39;s probably three</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:03.519" style="s2">um so and i think it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.240" end="00:12:05.360" style="s2">straightforward actually so</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:06.560" style="s2">what i would say is it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.360" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.560" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">i think we do a very simple model which</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.920" end="00:12:14.560" style="s2">looks at it</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">in the in the language of computation</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.560" end="00:12:18.720" style="s2">right in information processing sure and</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">so the notion is</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.720" end="00:12:24.079" style="s2">and and searching the the search for</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">the search of the space of dj is</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">impossible right and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.839" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">so change happens as a consequence of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:31.920" style="s2">combination between</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">the space of the adjacent possible the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.920" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">search through that space of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:38.720" style="s2">and then the apparently somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">stochastic discovery of</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.720" end="00:12:42.240" style="s2">real uh things that are enduring inside</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">the space it then</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.240" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">generates the new space right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">like that&#39;s the move you go from</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:49.600" style="s2">what we have the adjacent possible you</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">find things the adjacent possible to</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.600" end="00:12:52.320" style="s2">create new reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">that new reality now becomes the new</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.320" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">reality and then you kind of iterate</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:57.760" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the base</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">now the notion is that you can define</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.760" end="00:13:02.079" style="s2">the the key characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:03.760" style="s2">is the the search through the adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:05.040" style="s2">possible what&#39;s the search algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.760" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">the search algorithm of course is</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.040" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">distributed cognition right right</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:12.160" style="s2">recognition is governed by cognition i.e</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">each individual mind and its current</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.160" end="00:13:15.360" style="s2">capacity to operate in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">fashion so</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.360" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">a mind that has the capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.440" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">symbolic compression at a very high</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:23.279" style="s2">level and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:26.160" style="s2">engage in trans symbolic translations</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.279" end="00:13:27.600" style="s2">like we like we often do yeah yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">we just did in that moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.600" end="00:13:31.360" style="s2">um has a higher facility for distributed</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">cognition than a mind that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.360" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">that has doesn&#39;t have that capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">i think might be typological certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">neurologies may be affordable to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:41.920" style="s2">and also</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.880" end="00:13:43.519" style="s2">uh educational certain uh techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.920" end="00:13:44.720" style="s2">practices just</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.519" end="00:13:47.040" style="s2">in that direction obviously if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.720" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">you know done a lot of studying in</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.040" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">higher mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the techniques empire</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:53.519" style="s2">mathematics is precisely that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">software does a very similar thing so</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.519" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">different capacities in particular minds</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:13:59.920" style="s2">then of course you&#39;ve got the specific</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:02.639" style="s2">relationality between those months which</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.920" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">will be governed largely by their um</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.639" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">embodied relationships so population</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">density and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">and the great sort you know silicon</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">valley happened to have become an</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">attractor for particular typologies with</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.760" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">particular experiences and capacities</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:17.440" style="s2">and put them into close proximity</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:18.959" style="s2">physically</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.440" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">and then of course you have social media</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.959" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">right and so uh presencing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.279" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">interacting in in telecommunications</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">which which enables this sort of weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">dysfunctional disembodied but</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">very high-end metcalf interaction in</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">abstract space</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">so if i have that i basically have</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">created a search algorithm of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.839" end="00:14:41.120" style="s2">adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.399" end="00:14:42.959" style="s2">governed by from the bottom up governed</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.120" end="00:14:44.959" style="s2">by the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.959" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">the relevance realization mechanism of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.959" end="00:14:50.720" style="s2">each individual human</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:53.760" style="s2">right and by the topology of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.720" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">search system itself yeah i get that</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.760" end="00:15:00.079" style="s2">right um and that&#39;s unevenly distributed</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">and so what ends up happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.079" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">the propagation of the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:07.760" style="s2">extracted from the adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">has some almost like uh it moves</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.760" end="00:15:10.880" style="s2">at the very least it moves at the speed</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.880" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">of light and so uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.880" end="00:15:14.079" style="s2">but in fact he practically was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">slower than that and so it emerges in</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.079" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">some location it propagates through that</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:18.639" style="s2">location</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">but its propagation through that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.639" end="00:15:23.440" style="s2">location actually changes</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.639" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">the search capacity in the area through</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.440" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">which it is propagated right so if</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">you&#39;re closer to</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:30.800" style="s2">um open ai you know if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:33.279" style="s2">closer to open air meaning</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.800" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">you actually have the capacity to use</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.279" end="00:15:37.120" style="s2">the technology</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">you&#39;re closer right where somebody has</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.120" end="00:15:40.880" style="s2">the capacity to like be aware of it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">further than you but close it up as</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.880" end="00:15:43.360" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s not even heard of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:45.839" style="s2">can&#39;t even make sense it&#39;s further away</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.360" end="00:15:46.399" style="s2">so if you&#39;re closer to to open and gpt</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.839" end="00:15:49.440" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.399" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">you&#39;re now like one more step further in</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.440" end="00:15:51.680" style="s2">terms of the search algorithm of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">because that&#39;s part of the invention of</p>

<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">its presence in the world is a result as</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">an expansion in the json possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">right a big chunk of the adjacent</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:06.800" style="s2">and our reality has just changed if</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.120" end="00:16:07.120" style="s2">you&#39;re closer to it you have access to</p>

<p begin="00:16:07.120" end="00:16:10.079" style="s2">and you&#39;re by the way just by the very</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:11.680" style="s2">nature of being closer to it you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">social field of relationships that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.680" end="00:16:14.399" style="s2">all closer to it</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">and therefore are already playing in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.399" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">different playing field of a different</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:18.560" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">and a big part of that context is</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.560" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">simultaneously more potential</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:24.800" style="s2">more adjacent possible and a more</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:26.639" style="s2">sophisticated or more</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.800" end="00:16:28.720" style="s2">higher bandwidth distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.639" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">using those tools on themselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.720" end="00:16:32.000" style="s2">right so you get that recursive that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">recursion</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.000" end="00:16:36.399" style="s2">begins to pull my that area and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">people who are in that location</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.399" end="00:16:39.839" style="s2">further in a certain like further down</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:43.600" style="s2">the rabbit hole</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.839" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">of possibility right subject to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.600" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">various constraints</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">of things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:52.000" style="s2">the necessity to maintain some level of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:54.320" style="s2">continuity with other</p>

<p begin="00:16:54.320" end="00:16:56.800" style="s2">of the day</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:58.639" style="s2">and this is where we then show us having</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.800" end="00:17:03.040" style="s2">culture wars yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">right so that&#39;s that was very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.040" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to think about i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">map</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">especially the one i&#39;m more familiar</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:10.160" style="s2">with the kunian sense of paradigm into</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.199" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying here</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.160" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about parasitic shift</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">because it&#39;s it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">that there&#39;s something in there that has</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">to do with the coordination between</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.039" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">those levels</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:22.799" style="s2">the individual cognition the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:26.079" style="s2">cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.799" end="00:17:27.600" style="s2">uh the cyber enhanced cognition</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.079" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">you know all the enhanced relevance</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.600" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">realization which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">basically what&#39;s going on here in</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">various configurations so i mean kuhn&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.720" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">idea is that&#39;s exactly what a paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:40.160" style="s2">was right a paradigm gives us</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">it gives us uh because</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.160" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">the search is neither arbitrary because</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:45.520" style="s2">it&#39;ll be combinatorial explosive</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">or algorithmic because that would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.520" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">exhaustive and then combinatorially</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">explosive</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:51.280" style="s2">right we we what we get are we get</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:53.840" style="s2">exemplars</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:54.640" style="s2">that give us uh sort of constellation of</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.840" end="00:17:56.960" style="s2">heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.640" end="00:17:57.760" style="s2">so we get the we get the exemplar</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.960" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">experiment</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">we get the exemplar scientific question</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">right and then we get the exemplar</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">theorist and then though that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:08.240" style="s2">constellation of exemplars</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:09.919" style="s2">gives us this sort of toolkit for</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.240" end="00:18:11.360" style="s2">managing the relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.919" end="00:18:13.120" style="s2">there it&#39;s ultimately heuristic and</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.360" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">eventually over time it breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.120" end="00:18:17.039" style="s2">so what i&#39;m trying to when i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">fit them into the picture here is</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.039" end="00:18:21.200" style="s2">like like what so what do you mean more</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">precisely by a paradigmatic shift</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.200" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">do you mean something like analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">cune</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">that are the the set of exemplars that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">we use</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">as a source of heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">for trying to deal with the new search</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:38.640" style="s2">through the search base is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:40.720" style="s2">changing so</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.640" end="00:18:42.160" style="s2">people are more and more rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.720" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">appealing to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.160" end="00:18:46.559" style="s2">different paradigmatic individuals</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.559" end="00:18:51.520" style="s2">problems right so let me let me see if i</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">can provide a more fundamental language</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.520" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">let&#39;s see let&#39;s see if i can if we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:55.440" style="s2">do it because we can and it gets really</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.320" end="00:18:58.799" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.440" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">um i&#39;m pretty sure this is i&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.799" end="00:19:02.480" style="s2">this up</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">so uh well that&#39;s often that&#39;s often a</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.480" end="00:19:04.720" style="s2">very been a very successful strategy for</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.720" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">yes which is why i keep doing it all</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">right so so here&#39;s the thing um</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.240" end="00:19:13.280" style="s2">as you said you&#39;ve got these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:14.880" style="s2">these challenges of combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.280" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2">explosion because this this</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:18.400" style="s2">that vastness and vastness of territory</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.280" end="00:19:20.880" style="s2">and what i&#39;m going to say is</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.400" end="00:19:23.120" style="s2">what i would propose is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.880" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">language of the space</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.120" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">the possibility space inside the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:30.880" style="s2">adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">um is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.880" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">is the problem of the combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">explosion right so the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:38.799" style="s2">n inside the possibility space the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:41.039" style="s2">adjacent possible is super large</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.799" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">right or extraordinarily large</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.039" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">particularly now</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">right by the way not infinite but just</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:48.000" style="s2">very very very very large</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">yeah yeah um and and so the the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.000" end="00:19:50.320" style="s2">challenge</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">to use the language we just are using of</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.320" end="00:19:55.200" style="s2">the search</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">um is to</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.200" end="00:19:58.480" style="s2">use this constellation of heuristics and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:00.400" style="s2">exemplars</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">which if i in my mind what i&#39;m seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">is that is that i&#39;m engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">a what&#39;s the right it&#39;s again i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:13.039" style="s2">i&#39;m actually imposing a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.600" end="00:20:14.400" style="s2">um my modification to the shape of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">possibility space</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:18.480" style="s2">to effectively print pardon me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">soft constraints the exemplar gives you</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.480" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">sets of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:22.880" style="s2">construction right and i&#39;m creating</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">low-hanging fruit</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.880" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">right i&#39;m i&#39;m using that mechanism to</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">generate</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">low-hanging fruit okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">which then means that i can actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">reach them using my resources using</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:35.919" style="s2">using the the finite capacity for search</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">that i can actually do</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.919" end="00:20:39.280" style="s2">i do two moves right the paradigm of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">paradigm does is it creates</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">a constraint landscape a constraint on</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:45.200" style="s2">my search which is to say that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">it does the job of surfacing low-hanging</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.200" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">fruit</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">and then of course i actually harvest</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">the hanging fruit okay so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:51.919" style="s2">like the deeper i think the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.919" end="00:20:57.760" style="s2">um which describes the phenomenon and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:20:57.760" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.080" end="00:21:01.520" style="s2">what happens in the context of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.520" end="00:21:05.520" style="s2">is at the level of those constraints</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">any given paradigm is</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">uh how do i say this</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">it the the the constraints constraints</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.440" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">right so so while it while it surfaces</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">certain things it</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">it uh moves other things further away</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">every heuristic is a bias</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">every heuristic is a bias there you go</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">thank you and so what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:31.919" style="s2">to say a paradigm shift all we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">talking about is we&#39;re actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.919" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">modulating</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:36.559" style="s2">the set of constraints which um</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:38.320" style="s2">generates a different exposure to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.559" end="00:21:39.120" style="s2">certain areas territories of the</p>

<p begin="00:21:39.120" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">and in particular in in the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:44.080" style="s2">of a real change in the possibility</p>

<p begin="00:21:44.080" end="00:21:47.200" style="s2">and a real change in our searching</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">capacity right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:50.320" style="s2">you know some particular thing we use a</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">very concrete example like</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.320" end="00:21:55.520" style="s2">the laser which you were never going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:56.240" style="s2">find before quantum mechanics because</p>

<p begin="00:21:56.240" end="00:22:00.720" style="s2">the heuristic the heuristics of the even</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">general relativity but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.720" end="00:22:05.440" style="s2">of newtonian physics the distance to</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:07.360" style="s2">to laser through just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:10.400" style="s2">engineering trial and error</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:12.799" style="s2">was effectively infinite sure and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.400" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">the level of distributed cognition in</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">was you know relatively tiny in in</p>

<p begin="00:22:18.240" end="00:22:21.600" style="s2">and so then the the innovation of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.320" end="00:22:24.880" style="s2">quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.600" end="00:22:28.320" style="s2">uh you know suddenly radically shifts</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.880" end="00:22:28.799" style="s2">the the surface area of the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.320" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.799" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">moving laser much closer to the surface</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:35.039" style="s2">like bubbling up this sort of diamond</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">from the</p>

<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:41.679" style="s2">and then of course these the set of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.320" end="00:22:43.679" style="s2">telecommunications and urban</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.679" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">environments and educational processes</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:47.919" style="s2">meaningfully upgraded our distributed</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.640" end="00:22:49.600" style="s2">cognition by the time you get into the</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:53.440" style="s2">you get a cross-function that actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.039" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">breaches the laser as is now available</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.440" end="00:22:57.440" style="s2">within the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:59.600" style="s2">landscape right um and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">and of course the the proposition is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.600" end="00:23:02.880" style="s2">that these constraints</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">and these biases are biases that are</p>

<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:07.039" style="s2">distributed cognition like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.679" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">talking about so</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.039" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">you know as an individual i&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">i was going to say they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:14.159" style="s2">shared and coordinated so part of what</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.159" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">seeing i&#39;m sorry to interrupt but i just</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">want to make sure i&#39;m getting it</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">a paradigm is something like an</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">overarching</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:24.159" style="s2">met a set of medic constraints that</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">coordinate right they curate and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.159" end="00:23:26.799" style="s2">coordinate the strip the constraints at</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:28.480" style="s2">various levels</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.799" end="00:23:30.080" style="s2">so that they&#39;re operating in some</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.480" end="00:23:31.520" style="s2">fashion so you&#39;re getting some</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.080" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">optimization on</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.520" end="00:23:34.960" style="s2">your harvesting exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:36.640" style="s2">particularly what they do is they</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">radically reduce the communications</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.640" end="00:23:39.280" style="s2">cross that enables distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">to be functional</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.280" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">right if you&#39;re operating with an</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">entirely different set of axioms a</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">different set of constraints than i am</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">then what happens is the cost of simply</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">coming into the point where our</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:51.039" style="s2">coordination is possible at all</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.880" end="00:23:52.400" style="s2">is super hot but it&#39;s very very heavy</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.039" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">and so what happens is what the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.400" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">does is it simplifies coordination costs</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">and it enables a you know a physicist in</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">germany to have a conversation with a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:02.080" style="s2">physicist in spain</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:03.360" style="s2">um and they&#39;re more that&#39;s on the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.080" end="00:24:05.679" style="s2">page where they have a whole a</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.360" end="00:24:06.960" style="s2">whole set of set of a huge set of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">assumptions they&#39;re sitting on top of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.960" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">and they&#39;re just working on the very</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:11.440" style="s2">the top level um so it has the bad</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:13.760" style="s2">advantage</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:14.720" style="s2">it radically upgrades our distributed</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.760" end="00:24:17.279" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.720" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">in effectiveness you probably have much</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.279" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">better language for</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">this it&#39;s basically an optimization</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">process right it enables us to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">extremely effective at searching using</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:26.000" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:27.200" style="s2">using the space that has been bound by</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.000" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">those constraints</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.200" end="00:24:30.799" style="s2">yeah right but it&#39;s also a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">closure it closes that space so that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.799" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">enter and enter into kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">thermodynamic problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.760" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to say so</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:39.840" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">i mean the the the functionality of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.840" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">heuristic is also</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">um you know the the self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">aspect to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">in that right we get locked into we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:51.760" style="s2">biased</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:53.440" style="s2">and if you&#39;re if we&#39;re optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">is are you suggesting that something</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">like um</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">the rate at which we hit so let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:24:59.360" style="s2">back to your harvesting metaphor because</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:02.480" style="s2">it&#39;s helpful here</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.360" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">right so initially you know my</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.480" end="00:25:06.400" style="s2">standard economic model i put in so much</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">effort and the low the low-hanging fruit</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.400" end="00:25:10.559" style="s2">means with little effort i get it</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:12.720" style="s2">the problem is if i if i harvest the low</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.559" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">if i if i can harvest the low-hanging</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.720" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">fruit</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">faster and faster i hit diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:19.200" style="s2">returns</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">faster and faster is that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.200" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what happens so remember</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got two things going on</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:24.240" style="s2">simultaneously one is the constraints</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:27.520" style="s2">surface a new landscape that has low</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">hanging fruit</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.520" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">the second is it also gives rise to a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">uh a set of low-hanging fruit in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:38.080" style="s2">domain of the of distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">right right so in so i&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.080" end="00:25:40.799" style="s2">different i&#39;ve got two s curves that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:42.720" style="s2">happening simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.799" end="00:25:44.080" style="s2">one is the rate at which i&#39;m harvesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.720" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">low-hanging fruit in the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.080" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">and turning that into effectiveness in</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">under this set of constraints right so</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.200" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">so when i move to new paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">i kind of like have a whole lot of new</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">low-hanging fruit and a new</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">potential distributed cognition but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:00.480" style="s2">just kind of done</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:01.919" style="s2">because we&#39;re having to we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">starting over at kindergarten in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.919" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">new distributed cognition model</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:07.600" style="s2">um but but i can i can get the lowest</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:08.559" style="s2">singing fruit even at a low level</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.600" end="00:26:10.960" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.559" end="00:26:12.960" style="s2">but as i harvest them they get harder</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.960" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">but i&#39;m also simultaneously getting</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.960" end="00:26:15.520" style="s2">smarter in my new distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">so there&#39;s kind of this really</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:20.159" style="s2">interesting feedback curve between the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.480" end="00:26:22.480" style="s2">degree the rate at which</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.159" end="00:26:24.400" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m making the problem of finding</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.480" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">fruit harder by harvesting the lowest</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.400" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">hanging ones and getting up</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">you know whatever the topology that</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">looks like and the rate at which i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">actually harvesting the specific living</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">fruit and integrating them into</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">improving cognition which is going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">have an s curve</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:38.240" style="s2">right and so i get this tainter now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">kind of now we get we flip back to</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.240" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">tainter</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">i get a process of crossover where my</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">rate of advance in distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">is slowing down</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">and also my rate of the degree of</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">difficulty of harvesting is continuing</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">to go up right so there&#39;s a crossover</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">point where that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">that s-curve in a uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:27:00.320" style="s2">right in a paradigm is when i&#39;ve still</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">got a pretty sizable number of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.320" end="00:27:03.679" style="s2">low-hanging fruit but i&#39;m getting really</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">good at harvesting them</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.679" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">right right right then i&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">reaching diminishing returns on</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:08.480" style="s2">harvesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.799" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">but now that all the food are hard hard</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.480" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">to get now things get really expensive</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">really fast</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:14.480" style="s2">and now i&#39;m kind of the tail end of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:16.559" style="s2">paradigm but um</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.480" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">i&#39;ve made a huge investment so i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.559" end="00:27:19.840" style="s2">a degree of change</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:21.919" style="s2">you know i&#39;m hyper my distributed</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.840" end="00:27:27.039" style="s2">cognition is extremely effective</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.919" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">um relative to any location next to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.039" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">so any move in terms of sort of abstract</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.520" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">sorry it&#39;s a hill climbing valley</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.919" end="00:27:34.159" style="s2">crossing exercise right i&#39;ve reached the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:36.240" style="s2">top of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.159" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">a local hill in the context of the set</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.240" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">of constraints defined by the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:41.919" style="s2">right right right any move is perceived</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">as a down a downward movement</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.919" end="00:27:46.840" style="s2">and that hill yeah it keeps you trapped</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:49.919" style="s2">in attracting the local minimum</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.840" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">okay and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.919" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which the inaudible</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because the anomalies</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:27:59.039" style="s2">are are are our evidence right so in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">cuny sense the anomalies are just</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:01.440" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:03.440" style="s2">that your particular paradigm can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">account for a certain amount of data</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.440" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">but you&#39;ve also got if i&#39;m following</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:08.960" style="s2">your argument correctly</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:10.799" style="s2">the anomalies as the anomalies start to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.960" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">pile up that&#39;s also a marker</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">that you&#39;re you&#39;re hitting this</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:14.799" style="s2">crossover point right that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.600" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">hitting the point where</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.799" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">um the ability to improve</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">um um our ability to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">diminishing returns is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">self-diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:26.080" style="s2">right uh and so at some point we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:28.559" style="s2">we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">we can&#39;t improve how we harvest the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.559" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">higher hanging fruit fast enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:33.440" style="s2">for how high the food is getting right</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:36.320" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">right right yeah and um and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.320" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">anomalies actually show</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">as having a positive value because they</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:43.760" style="s2">provide the um</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">sort of subtle vague but orienting basis</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.760" end="00:28:46.480" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">what a shift might look like right so</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.480" end="00:28:49.520" style="s2">we&#39;re not operating in complete</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">randomness it&#39;s like okay well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.520" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">whole bunch of open questions</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">that inside the bias the set of biases</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">and constraints that i&#39;m operating i</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:28:58.799" style="s2">can&#39;t actually give good answers</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">but they&#39;re questions they&#39;re real</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.799" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">things they&#39;re things out there in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">and so it gives you it&#39;s actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">interesting handoff</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">um so then you have remember going back</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">to neuroplasticity</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:14.960" style="s2">right as you know right as you and i</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">know all too well as you reach certain</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.960" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">developmental stages as a human being</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">your uh your willingness and capacity</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">to kind of in at the neurological level</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.360" end="00:29:29.919" style="s2">and also at the motivational level um</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:32.399" style="s2">god even at the social level</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.919" end="00:29:33.520" style="s2">uh that is of course to to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.399" end="00:29:36.799" style="s2">that level of change goes</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:38.480" style="s2">down this is the eric weinstein i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:40.559" style="s2">you know keeps calling out but can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.480" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">quite get over the threshold which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:46.320" style="s2">you know in the contemporary context um</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.399" end="00:29:47.520" style="s2">everybody who&#39;s in charge of all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.320" end="00:29:50.399" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.520" end="00:29:51.360" style="s2">is at a you know at the very tail end of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.399" end="00:29:54.480" style="s2">an escrow</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.360" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">so the intrinsic conservativism</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.480" end="00:29:58.159" style="s2">is kind of being reinforced to all three</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:30:01.600" style="s2">levels right the individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.159" end="00:30:03.200" style="s2">is incapable of actually shifting</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.600" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">at a neurological level the degree of</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.200" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">change necessary to actually unload</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">those constraints and move to new ones</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">is very high sort of neural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.080" end="00:30:11.760" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">they&#39;re also unwilling to shift because</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.760" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">such a shift is hard and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">they don&#39;t have the level of youthful</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">enthusiasm to go into that kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:22.480" style="s2">adventure</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">and sociologically it implies for sure</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.480" end="00:30:25.520" style="s2">a reduction of their local authority and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">influence</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.520" end="00:30:28.240" style="s2">this is kind of funny i can actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:29.919" style="s2">take the influence piece from from</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.240" end="00:30:31.919" style="s2">greg&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.919" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">way down right they&#39;re no longer like</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.919" end="00:30:34.559" style="s2">the master of this domain just another</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">schmuck trying to figure out how to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.559" end="00:30:38.480" style="s2">it in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:39.200" style="s2">new space um and of course that also has</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.480" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">the direct</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.200" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">interpersonal like the actual reality of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:44.480" style="s2">the people who they know</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">are positioned just like this just like</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.480" end="00:30:48.240" style="s2">a game theoretic and i&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">like come on dude don&#39;t go into the new</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.240" end="00:30:50.080" style="s2">paradigm you&#39;re gonna fuck things up for</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:51.120" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.080" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to need a pair of</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:58.559" style="s2">um and that&#39;s like that that very last</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">piece it&#39;s almost like this um</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.559" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">it feels like it&#39;s like the second</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">decision point on the tainter curve</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:05.519" style="s2">which is really interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">actually correlates with the second</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.519" end="00:31:08.159" style="s2">decision point that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">carol quigley talks about his book the</p>

<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">which is basically like you get a uh</p>

<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">so the rate of change is slowing down in</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.440" end="00:31:22.240" style="s2">your s curve</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:23.679" style="s2">is the first decision point and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">where things actually are the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.679" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">meaningful if you make the choice there</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:28.799" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:30.320" style="s2">shift you&#39;re you&#39;re okay but you also</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.799" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">are giving up the golden age</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.320" end="00:31:36.240" style="s2">of maximum excel maximum extraction</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:37.279" style="s2">second decision point is when the actual</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.240" end="00:31:39.919" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.279" end="00:31:40.880" style="s2">when velocity is going down right right</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:42.320" style="s2">right you&#39;ve got acceleration is</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.880" end="00:31:43.760" style="s2">decreasing velocity is decreasing your</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.320" end="00:31:45.440" style="s2">different decision points</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.760" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">um you know so when you&#39;re actually in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.440" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">recession as opposed to just a</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.360" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">slower and slower growth um</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.159" end="00:31:55.039" style="s2">why did i say that oh yeah probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.679" end="00:31:56.080" style="s2">being part of the challenge here has to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">do with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.080" end="00:31:59.760" style="s2">because there&#39;s kind of a stickiness</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.760" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">a lack of fluidity uh an intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">conservativism</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">in in the nature of the paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">model itself right the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:11.039" style="s2">grows and extends and the way it extends</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">by the way both into the human</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">psychological</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:17.200" style="s2">and into the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">massive investments in institutional</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.200" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">fabric i remember talking about it in</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:22.480" style="s2">the context of um</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:23.440" style="s2">like just oil as a function yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.480" end="00:32:24.640" style="s2">remember that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.440" end="00:32:26.720" style="s2">if you just look at like the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.640" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">investment in say like the educational</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.720" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">infrastructure of teaching this huge</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.960" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">population of people how to run and</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">operate the technology and institutions</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.120" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">of the oil industry at the financial</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:38.640" style="s2">level at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">mining level the technical level and to</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.640" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">shift away from oil</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">obsoletes that entire kind of capital</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">investment</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:46.559" style="s2">and obsoletes the capital of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">like the deeper capital investment in</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:49.360" style="s2">the underlying infrastructure that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:50.559" style="s2">produces that as you&#39;ve got all these</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.360" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">things that are kind of massively</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.559" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">invested</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:55.760" style="s2">stock versus flow on on x</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:32:58.240" style="s2">and so what happens is that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.760" end="00:32:59.679" style="s2">counterweight the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.240" end="00:33:01.440" style="s2">pressure for change the number of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:02.320" style="s2">anomalies that are now showing up in all</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.440" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">these different ways like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.320" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">anomalies that are showing up in terms</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.679" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">questions that we can&#39;t answer using the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:12.399" style="s2">model structures that we operate in but</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">also anomalies that are showing up in</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.399" end="00:33:17.760" style="s2">terms of um</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">like conflicts that happen between</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.760" end="00:33:20.240" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:21.840" style="s2">like emergent institutions and classical</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:24.399" style="s2">institutions or</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.840" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">um psychological dissonance between</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.399" end="00:33:26.240" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:27.440" style="s2">identity structures like these are all</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.240" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">the novels so if they&#39;re happening</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.440" end="00:33:31.120" style="s2">throughout the entire system dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:32.240" style="s2">um you get stronger and stronger and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.120" end="00:33:33.519" style="s2">stronger and it kind of breaks an</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.240" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">elegant this is one of the problems with</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.519" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">the paratrooper models it tends it tends</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:38.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:40.799" style="s2">not almost never break elegantly</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.960" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">it almost never just says okay cool it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.799" end="00:33:43.840" style="s2">time to you know hand off the keys to</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:45.120" style="s2">the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.840" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">so this is this is that point i was</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.120" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">trying to make about generations is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:50.640" style="s2">when paradigm shifts happened over a</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:53.039" style="s2">period of time</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.640" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">or there actually was a sort of natural</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.039" end="00:33:57.039" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.919" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">clock you know the the victorians as</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:33:59.919" style="s2">they got</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:00.640" style="s2">you know past a certain age the you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.919" end="00:34:03.440" style="s2">the young</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.640" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">kind of mid-century types they could</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.440" end="00:34:07.200" style="s2">just kind of like take over</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">and they would be operating in in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.200" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.840" end="00:34:12.000" style="s2">uh set of sensibilities and so the</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:15.440" style="s2">natural transition</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.000" end="00:34:17.359" style="s2">from you know elder to to younger</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.440" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">worked but when the paradigm change is</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.359" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">actually happening inside that cycle</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">then you don&#39;t have any natural</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:24.320" style="s2">transition like there&#39;s nothing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">enables it to happen</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.320" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">um or so sorry that</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">that fluid mechanism for transfer</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen so now the transfer</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:34.800" style="s2">actually has to be even harder</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">right i mean that&#39;s kuhn&#39;s idea that uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.800" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">you paradigm shift often just works by</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.720" end="00:34:40.879" style="s2">waiting for the old guys to die</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">um but um right and now if you have like</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">three paradigm shifts happening inside a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">single person&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">what happens yeah you can so so the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">you see the culture wars now what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:53.919" style="s2">trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">now is there&#39;s two possible ways</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.919" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">interpreting this is the other culture</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:34:58.960" style="s2">wars</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:35:01.200" style="s2">are you saying that various groups are</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.960" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">on different places on the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.200" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">the curve of the paradigm shift or are</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:08.160" style="s2">you saying that all of the groups</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">share certain characteristics of trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.160" end="00:35:12.079" style="s2">to retreat into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:14.240" style="s2">over stabilization function through</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.079" end="00:35:17.599" style="s2">tribal identity etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.240" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">right both okay yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.599" end="00:35:21.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s why it&#39;s challenging i</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">said well it&#39;s challenging in both cases</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">and the fact that it&#39;s both is why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:27.599" style="s2">really challenging to get a hold of</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:29.040" style="s2">um and so um</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:31.040" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s just focus on the second part</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.040" end="00:35:32.640" style="s2">so i think a video went around a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.040" end="00:35:33.920" style="s2">bit about mcluhan actually talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.640" end="00:35:35.119" style="s2">how when you hit a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.920" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">information overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.119" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">we default to simple pattern recognition</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:39.839" style="s2">right so we&#39;ve got a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:40.720" style="s2">basic strategies of how to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.839" end="00:35:42.079" style="s2">certain levels of information</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.720" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">overwhelmed as you said like you default</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.079" end="00:35:44.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">try things have to get simpler you just</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.640" end="00:35:48.800" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t deal so</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">things get simpler and so i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.800" end="00:35:53.040" style="s2">problematize this</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">in in like three ways now so</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.040" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">the the first way is okay we&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:35:58.720" style="s2">reached</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">uh information overwhelm which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:03.359" style="s2">that the velocity</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">and and magnitude of anomalies has</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.359" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">reached a point</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:07.599" style="s2">where our ordinary mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:10.280" style="s2">ignoring them and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.599" end="00:36:12.160" style="s2">rationalizing in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.280" end="00:36:13.839" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.160" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">i can no longer continue to bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.839" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">myself enough to just continue to slog</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:18.640" style="s2">through things</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:20.000" style="s2">yeah so then what happens is i start</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.640" end="00:36:20.800" style="s2">kicking into this next mode right so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.000" end="00:36:22.960" style="s2">basic mode</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.800" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">is my paradigm is working pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:28.240" style="s2">and anomalies i just kind of ignore and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:31.280" style="s2">proceed forward 19 1980s in america</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.240" end="00:36:31.599" style="s2">all right model so that when that starts</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.280" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.599" end="00:36:34.800" style="s2">break down then i have to shift to model</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:37.280" style="s2">2. model 2 is where i start going</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.800" end="00:36:39.119" style="s2">click and i drop into some sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:40.720" style="s2">basic strategy</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.119" end="00:36:42.400" style="s2">now of course this is this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.720" end="00:36:43.359" style="s2">what drives the culture of course is</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.400" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.359" end="00:36:47.040" style="s2">people who maybe were compatible inside</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:48.560" style="s2">a paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.040" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">may have very different more simple</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.560" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">strategies exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">say drop out yeah local idiosyncratic</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:36:58.640" style="s2">histories are going to be magnified when</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">you drop out of a shared paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.640" end="00:37:01.920" style="s2">so people are going to default to more</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:04.560" style="s2">primitive earlier</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.920" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">forms within their own you know local</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.560" end="00:37:06.880" style="s2">developmental trajectories so this</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">worked</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.880" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">and so when they when they when they</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:10.480" style="s2">when they do the regression strategy</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.480" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">psychologically that&#39;s what it is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">regressive strategy right</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:18.720" style="s2">when you know if you grew up somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:19.839" style="s2">else than i did and et cetera when we</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.720" end="00:37:21.440" style="s2">regress we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.839" end="00:37:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s going to tend to highlight our</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:24.880" style="s2">differences it&#39;s going to differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.960" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.880" end="00:37:28.560" style="s2">in a powerful way and it&#39;s also at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:30.320" style="s2">same time going to reduce our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.560" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">flexibility to manage those difference</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.320" end="00:37:34.079" style="s2">because we&#39;re moving to more</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">scarcity mentality right yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.079" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">funny because</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">also in exactly that context more</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">regressive strategies</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">happen to be more oriented around more</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">presenting of scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:48.320" style="s2">yes the notion of can&#39;t we all get along</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">is a relatively modern</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.320" end="00:37:54.000" style="s2">innovation the notion of like fuck you</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">is a law it&#39;s been around a lot longer</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.000" end="00:37:57.200" style="s2">um so that so since that second level</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">gets very you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">is kind of like a good solid chunk of</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:04.079" style="s2">okay problematization but then i want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">introduce that third level which is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.079" end="00:38:06.480" style="s2">you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">actually happening it&#39;s unevenly</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:10.880" style="s2">distributed so you actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">uh like a jerk so it&#39;s not just velocity</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.880" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">accelerations velocity acceleration and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">jerk</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:19.359" style="s2">so the actual rate of change um is</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">different in different locations and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.359" end="00:38:24.240" style="s2">uh this creates all kinds of weird</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:24.880" style="s2">uh impedance uh at even at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.240" end="00:38:26.560" style="s2">response</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.880" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">so there may actually it&#39;s quite likely</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.560" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">actually that many people are operating</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:31.520" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:32.960" style="s2">like a third response mode you know if</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.520" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">you can&#39;t deal with with the vote with</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.960" end="00:38:35.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">volume or the you get information</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.520" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">overwhelmed right you you operate one</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.680" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">but if in fact the the that set of</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">default modes are themselves breaking</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:46.720" style="s2">because the rate of change is actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">accelerating beyond</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.720" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">anything that any structure&#39;s ever dealt</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">with which is the reality that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:52.640" style="s2">actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:54.400" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.640" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">thing going on um</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.400" end="00:38:58.560" style="s2">and you you so that the regression is</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:39:00.960" style="s2">kind of regressive acceleration i</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.560" end="00:39:03.599" style="s2">suppose is</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.960" end="00:39:05.119" style="s2">right um and differential regressive</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.599" end="00:39:06.880" style="s2">acceleration so it&#39;s almost like one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.119" end="00:39:07.760" style="s2">these crazy sci-fi movies where you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.880" end="00:39:10.320" style="s2">got like</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.760" end="00:39:12.240" style="s2">cavemen sitting you know right next to</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.320" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">like 1950s people and like people from</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.240" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">the future they&#39;re all kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:16.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:17.920" style="s2">show about that right a book a book that</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.800" end="00:39:20.000" style="s2">had like a river</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.920" end="00:39:21.119" style="s2">and the river had this weird like</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:24.560" style="s2">conjunction yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.119" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah um and that&#39;s uh i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.560" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:28.400" style="s2">like an interesting frame to be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:34.160" style="s2">um okay so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">let me see i get this uh we get the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.160" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">regression in which locks people down</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:40.160" style="s2">and they they then right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">happening but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.160" end="00:39:43.599" style="s2">also being locked at different places on</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:46.560" style="s2">the time river</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.599" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">right and so not only are they locked</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:50.560" style="s2">also incommensurably placed on the prime</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:52.400" style="s2">river</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.560" end="00:39:54.000" style="s2">is that yeah something like that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.400" end="00:39:55.040" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:57.440" style="s2">if you think about it in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.040" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">way that a black hole works where</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.440" end="00:40:01.440" style="s2">um if i&#39;m on the other side of the event</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">horizon communication is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.440" end="00:40:04.079" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">light actually can&#39;t you know move</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.079" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">across it</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:08.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit like that right where</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:09.920" style="s2">if we were all sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.160" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">if we were all changing at roughly the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.920" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">same rate then there would be some way</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:14.319" style="s2">of generating effectively a meta</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">protocol</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.319" end="00:40:17.920" style="s2">that could try to find something that</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:21.520" style="s2">uh able to be communicated horizontally</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:22.480" style="s2">at that rate</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.520" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">but if what&#39;s happening is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.480" end="00:40:26.000" style="s2">actually all changing at different rates</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:27.200" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like um you&#39;re looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.000" end="00:40:29.520" style="s2">stick in the water</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">and trying to grab it yeah yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.520" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">actually a warp</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">so you know i say x but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:36.160" style="s2">actually basically operating a different</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">time signature that i&#39;m operating in</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">then you know i i have to actually begin</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:41.599" style="s2">to learn</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.839" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">is there is there enough regularity at</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.599" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">all is there enough constancy at all</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">to actually be able to kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:49.920" style="s2">coherence</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:51.920" style="s2">work in communication can we communicate</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.920" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">or is there like a redshift doppler kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.920" end="00:40:58.079" style="s2">of thing going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">between between us where there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.079" end="00:41:03.839" style="s2">so much i guess delta</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:04.720" style="s2">so much change to that yeah so much</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.839" end="00:41:07.200" style="s2">distortion</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.720" end="00:41:08.400" style="s2">that the the communication well one</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.200" end="00:41:09.680" style="s2">possibility is communication is</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.400" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">impossible right in which case you would</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.680" end="00:41:12.560" style="s2">actually have effectively a speciation</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:15.280" style="s2">effect it would be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:17.440" style="s2">shift like a pulling away literally just</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.280" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">begin the process of something that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.440" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">increasingly not part of something else</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s plausible i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">many people who actually have thought</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:26.720" style="s2">about that as something that has been</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:28.560" style="s2">happening and you say okay well that</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.720" end="00:41:31.040" style="s2">would be a natural consequence</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.560" end="00:41:32.480" style="s2">um and okay and so what happens is you</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.040" end="00:41:34.079" style="s2">have this weird</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.480" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">um how do i say this like it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.079" end="00:41:40.480" style="s2">viscosity challenge where</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">the front end god this language is rough</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.480" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">so what i&#39;m trying to say is like if i</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:46.800" style="s2">happen to be a guy working on ai</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:48.400" style="s2">in silicon valley some part of me is</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">like the front end of something right</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.400" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">next to the edge of the black hole</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:53.599" style="s2">right the part of me that is right at</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">the bleeding edge of of ai</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.599" end="00:41:56.319" style="s2">is like right at the event horizon it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">like you haven&#39;t like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.319" end="00:42:00.880" style="s2">stretching effect</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">yeah but i also like buy food and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.880" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">you know walk around and see buildings</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:07.040" style="s2">and interact with just people that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">around me</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.040" end="00:42:11.119" style="s2">um maybe right undercover less and less</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:13.040" style="s2">bizarrely enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.119" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">um so i have something else another</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.040" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">another aspect of my experience and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:18.000" style="s2">aspect to my identity and</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:19.599" style="s2">my relationships are operating in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.000" end="00:42:20.800" style="s2">other boat right so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.599" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">another piece right it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:23.920" style="s2">stretching it&#39;s not just unevenly</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:25.280" style="s2">distributed in terms of geography it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.920" end="00:42:28.800" style="s2">actually unevenly distributed in terms</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.280" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">of identity and cognition and psychology</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.800" end="00:42:32.160" style="s2">and that stretching piece i think is</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:36.000" style="s2">another key element</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:36.000" style="s2">like to think about um</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.880" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">yeah and maybe to make it a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.720" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">simple science fiction story</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:44.240" style="s2">just think what happens so let me assume</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.800" end="00:42:46.240" style="s2">that elon musk is telling the truth</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.240" end="00:42:49.280" style="s2">about what he&#39;s doing with neural ways</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.240" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">so what it can do is as reported</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">right no no more no less and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">know if that&#39;s true right he could be</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:54.960" style="s2">totally lying and it can&#39;t do any of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">anything else be totally lying and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.960" end="00:42:57.359" style="s2">actually way ahead of that he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:42:59.680" style="s2">kind of giving us the their</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.359" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">adopted piece of it even then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.680" end="00:43:02.480" style="s2">massive right</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">other than the most recent thing he</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.480" end="00:43:06.079" style="s2">talked about was how like they expect to</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">soon be able to stream music directly to</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:10.560" style="s2">your brain</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">and so that level of intimacy but i just</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.560" end="00:43:13.440" style="s2">i it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">but that&#39;s we&#39;ll talk about that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.440" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">another time me too</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">but let&#39;s just as a simple kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:22.640" style="s2">science fiction example</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">there&#39;s like these as soon as somebody</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.640" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">actually does the neural lace thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.680" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">right and so we can that&#39;s very concrete</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.359" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">but the point is that that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">in less that&#39;s obvious ways yeah yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">get that yeah for sure i mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:39.680" style="s2">doing it right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re doing it right now and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.680" end="00:43:43.280" style="s2">we could actually if we publish this and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">we look at the comments</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.280" end="00:43:46.560" style="s2">we&#39;ll actually see that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2">stretching or</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.560" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">differential right some people will just</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:52.160" style="s2">like bounce the fuck off</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:53.200" style="s2">everything they just said would be so</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:54.800" style="s2">you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.200" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">and then their response will be whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.800" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">regressive strategy happens to be their</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">local</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.880" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">location right which you know is like 50</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">that i&#39;ve seen so far</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:07.839" style="s2">so it&#39;s getting harder and harder</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">to get a common denature a common</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.839" end="00:44:11.200" style="s2">denominator of quality</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">we can never have the beetles again so</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.200" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">the thing about the beatles</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.400" end="00:44:18.000" style="s2">is right they were at that point where</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">they tapped into you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.000" end="00:44:20.480" style="s2">broadcasting ability and and the you</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:22.319" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.480" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">the the ability to stamp out final</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.319" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">records but</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:26.720" style="s2">right they&#39;re at that point where they</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">could they could create a</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.720" end="00:44:30.480" style="s2">something analogous to a paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:32.319" style="s2">popular culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.480" end="00:44:33.680" style="s2">we can never have the beatles again and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.319" end="00:44:34.560" style="s2">that&#39;s not because there aren&#39;t talented</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.680" end="00:44:36.960" style="s2">people out there</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.560" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">it&#39;s because the proliferation of genres</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.960" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">right is just</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:41.599" style="s2">is accelerated it&#39;s like a protestantism</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.400" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.599" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">it&#39;s proliferating and proliferating and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:49.359" style="s2">what you get i mean i i notice it myself</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">is i&#39;m now stuck in time with it come</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.359" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">when it comes to popular music</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.520" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2">no not because not because i&#39;m a luddite</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.680" end="00:44:57.839" style="s2">or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:45:00.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just i think i can&#39;t keep up and</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.839" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">not only can i can&#39;t keep up</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.079" end="00:45:03.359" style="s2">because we have to remember there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">is not a contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.359" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">there is more information out there but</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">it&#39;s also more impoverished</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:10.400" style="s2">it&#39;s less diagnostic like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:12.079" style="s2">around in the time of the beatles there</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.400" end="00:45:14.720" style="s2">was a chance that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.079" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">all of the genres could it could reach</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.720" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:20.319" style="s2">the genres can&#39;t all reach me now right</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">no right no matter how much they pump</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.319" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:26.960" style="s2">right right there&#39;s genres i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:27.839" style="s2">up there now and you know i see i see i</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.960" end="00:45:29.280" style="s2">see my kids and</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.839" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">you know you know and my partner&#39;s kids</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.280" end="00:45:32.640" style="s2">and those</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.040" end="00:45:34.079" style="s2">what i don&#39;t even know what that is i</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.640" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">don&#39;t even know who that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:37.280" style="s2">right and then it&#39;s not and at first i</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.280" end="00:45:41.760" style="s2">well is it because i&#39;m just i&#39;m like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:43.520" style="s2">like turning into my parents</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.760" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">part of it&#39;s that uh you know but the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.520" end="00:45:48.400" style="s2">part of it is what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:50.400" style="s2">here no you know it&#39;s not like i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">encountered these genres like my parents</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.400" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">did and then rejected them</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:56.400" style="s2">they are not even on my radar that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the me that&#39;s the thing to me</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.400" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">paradoxical i&#39;ve been trying to get this</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:02.079" style="s2">across to some of my students</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">that we have simultaneously and i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.079" end="00:46:05.119" style="s2">maybe daniel</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:06.640" style="s2">schmeichenberg is trying to get this</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.119" end="00:46:09.119" style="s2">right we have simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.640" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">way more information but there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.119" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">sense in which each piece of information</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">is less diagnostically valuable because</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">it can&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">is not as diagnostic it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:21.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t rule out as many alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:22.400" style="s2">as clearly and as effectively because it</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.040" end="00:46:24.640" style="s2">gets overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.400" end="00:46:25.839" style="s2">by the sea of information it&#39;s in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.640" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">also corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.839" end="00:46:29.599" style="s2">that the signal is corrupted because of</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:30.640" style="s2">the all of the competition do you</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.599" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">understand what i&#39;m trying to do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.640" end="00:46:34.640" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:36.079" style="s2">well uh well i&#39;m kind of not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">do the thing right so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.079" end="00:46:40.319" style="s2">the point is so what we&#39;re just talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:41.920" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.319" end="00:46:43.680" style="s2">i noticed like a bunch of connections to</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.920" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">previous conversations that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.680" end="00:46:49.760" style="s2">individually and collectively have had</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.079" end="00:46:49.760" style="s2">is something along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.079" end="00:46:56.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve reached the limits of a particular</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.200" end="00:46:57.280" style="s2">um fundamental mode of being in relation</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.800" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.280" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">distributed cognition which is to say of</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">being in relationship with dj is</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">impossible which is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:06.319" style="s2">describing because</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:07.839" style="s2">um each genre in some sense is a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.319" end="00:47:10.319" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.839" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">mode of distributed cognition particular</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.319" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">meta node</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:14.400" style="s2">that is exploring the possibility space</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:15.280" style="s2">within a particular set of constraints</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.400" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">in music space</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.280" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">right that&#39;s exactly that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">what i&#39;m intending to analogy</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:22.640" style="s2">and your point is that uh the graph is</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">no longer connected</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">meaning that the the propagation uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:31.680" style="s2">in i don&#39;t know like genre n</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.760" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">uh isn&#39;t connected like it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.680" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">not connected what&#39;s going on over here</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:35.359" style="s2">in genre m</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:36.800" style="s2">and in some sense they&#39;re actually we</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.359" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2">might imagine actually moving apart</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.800" end="00:47:39.680" style="s2">further</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">so that like the light cone they may</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.680" end="00:47:43.520" style="s2">never connect</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">yeah proliferation of genres genres</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.520" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:50.880" style="s2">they are biased based the genres also</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">isolate each like like if i have more</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.880" end="00:47:54.559" style="s2">piercing genres right and if i get more</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:56.640" style="s2">and more genres between them</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.559" end="00:47:58.079" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s an accelerating isolation</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.640" end="00:47:59.839" style="s2">function because the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.079" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">number of bias thresholds i have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.839" end="00:48:04.559" style="s2">cross to get that information</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">is also going up exactly so to put it</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.559" end="00:48:07.520" style="s2">very specifically so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">the efficiency of the advantage of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.520" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">paradigm has</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:14.400" style="s2">comes with the concomitant cost which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.000" end="00:48:16.079" style="s2">it radically reduces coordinating costs</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.400" end="00:48:18.400" style="s2">inside the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.079" end="00:48:19.119" style="s2">it radically increases coordinating</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.400" end="00:48:21.119" style="s2">cross</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">coordination costs outside of or between</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.400" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">right so if you are in the same paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">it becomes relatively easy for us to</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">before actually operating outside of</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:30.960" style="s2">paradigms if you&#39;re in a different</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:34.319" style="s2">paradigm than me</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.960" end="00:48:36.720" style="s2">we&#39;re almost impeachable you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.319" end="00:48:37.440" style="s2">the the amount of delta because the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.720" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">whole point because</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.440" end="00:48:39.920" style="s2">the paradigm is collaborative it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:41.760" style="s2">distributed cognition so it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.920" end="00:48:43.280" style="s2">being the innovation the paradigm is</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.760" end="00:48:44.240" style="s2">being held in many many many many many</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.280" end="00:48:46.000" style="s2">different minds</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:47.680" style="s2">no given mind can actually go through</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.000" end="00:48:49.119" style="s2">and say like okay i can hold the whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.680" end="00:48:50.480" style="s2">of my paradigm and so i can translate to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.119" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">the whole of your paradigm that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.480" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">starter</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.200" end="00:48:54.880" style="s2">so what happens of course is that as the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">genres themselves actually become</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.880" end="00:48:57.920" style="s2">paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:48:58.720" style="s2">unto themselves and are exploring</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.920" end="00:49:00.880" style="s2">musical space</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.720" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">unto themselves the interoperability</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.880" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">cost between them</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:06.480" style="s2">is actually going up and so actually i</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.119" end="00:49:08.640" style="s2">experienced this myself like i</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.480" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">would listen to my daughters play music</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.640" end="00:49:12.319" style="s2">um and we and we&#39;re not like</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:13.599" style="s2">in tight sync right so they&#39;ll kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.319" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">they&#39;ll show up and they they will have</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.599" end="00:49:16.559" style="s2">drifted the way they</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.640" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">drift and they&#39;ll play music and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.559" end="00:49:20.960" style="s2">listen to it going</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:21.520" style="s2">you know wow i actually have a very hard</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.960" end="00:49:23.359" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.520" end="00:49:25.520" style="s2">knowing what&#39;s going on there i can kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.359" end="00:49:27.119" style="s2">of i can i can hear actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.520" end="00:49:28.720" style="s2">it&#39;s funny the way my mind works i can</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.119" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">actually hear a lot of the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.720" end="00:49:31.599" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:32.400" style="s2">like oh that particular move that</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.599" end="00:49:33.839" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.400" end="00:49:35.119" style="s2">set of sounds like i remember hearing</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.839" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">that as certain other sounds i could</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.119" end="00:49:38.480" style="s2">hear how this particular musician was</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:40.559" style="s2">a brico lot you know greek lodging but</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.480" end="00:49:42.400" style="s2">the technique and the aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.559" end="00:49:44.160" style="s2">that leads to this actually coming</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.400" end="00:49:45.520" style="s2">together as a kind of music and by the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.160" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">way even the tools</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.520" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">um i&#39;m not i i don&#39;t i don&#39;t really i</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">don&#39;t connect to and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:52.640" style="s2">whatever&#39;s going on there it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">difficult for me to be part of that flow</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.640" end="00:49:55.200" style="s2">in lineage and the distance is getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:59.280" style="s2">further and further</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.200" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">um so so at some point</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.280" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">i mean sorry this this might sound like</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:05.920" style="s2">a pedantic point but</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a conceptual point i mean if it</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.920" end="00:50:09.920" style="s2">fragments to that point</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:11.200" style="s2">isn&#39;t i mean the whole point about a</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.920" end="00:50:13.599" style="s2">paradigm is it&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.200" end="00:50:16.079" style="s2">give an overarching integration i mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.599" end="00:50:18.559" style="s2">are we getting to a place</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.079" end="00:50:19.920" style="s2">where paradigms are now impossible</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.559" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">because there has been so</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.920" end="00:50:22.960" style="s2">much the metaphor that&#39;s running around</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">in my mind is how</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.960" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">you know sexual selection can so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">know niche construct you</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:30.559" style="s2">so that you actually stop to be via you</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">stop being viable in terms of natural</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:33.280" style="s2">selection</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.200" end="00:50:34.480" style="s2">right you know the peacock&#39;s tail is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.280" end="00:50:38.160" style="s2">classic example</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.480" end="00:50:39.839" style="s2">yeah right that&#39;s a dead right um</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.160" end="00:50:41.920" style="s2">and so like are we getting to the place</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.839" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">where paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:47.040" style="s2">are not possible but if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.200" end="00:50:49.599" style="s2">then what we&#39;re getting is variation</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.040" end="00:50:52.880" style="s2">without without selection right</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.599" end="00:50:54.480" style="s2">yes okay so and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.880" end="00:50:55.680" style="s2">like i think this is another way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.480" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">saying the thing that i keep saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.680" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">which is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">there&#39;s like a bifurcation event you</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:03.200" style="s2">know so the the regressive move</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:04.240" style="s2">continues to have to regress to find</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.200" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.240" end="00:51:07.280" style="s2">checksum against which selection finally</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">occurs</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.280" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">yeah okay that generally speaking will</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:12.640" style="s2">show but the energetic domain</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:14.400" style="s2">you know at the end of the day if i</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.640" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">cannot communicate with you in any way</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.400" end="00:51:17.359" style="s2">linguistically i can definitely punch</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.079" end="00:51:19.440" style="s2">you in the face</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.359" end="00:51:20.800" style="s2">yes right and so that&#39;s what i meant</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.440" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2">about you</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">the quality of the common denominator is</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:28.319" style="s2">going to continue to drop</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:30.319" style="s2">because right the trying to get what can</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.319" end="00:51:32.960" style="s2">cross all that fragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.319" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">is going to have to go into something um</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.960" end="00:51:36.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:39.040" style="s2">is yeah i guess sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.960" end="00:51:41.040" style="s2">that has been preserved the longest</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.040" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">through through the evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.040" end="00:51:43.520" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">right exactly preserve the longest the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.520" end="00:51:47.040" style="s2">evolutionary process exactly</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.040" end="00:51:48.400" style="s2">it&#39;s the most basic or most primitive i</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.040" end="00:51:51.200" style="s2">guess the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.400" end="00:51:51.680" style="s2">longest um and then and and or right</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:51:53.599" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.680" end="00:51:55.119" style="s2">this direction and then you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.599" end="00:51:56.480" style="s2">direction right and it&#39;s funny because i</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.119" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">think we started this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.480" end="00:52:00.000" style="s2">sort of noticing that we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">talking with greg soon</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.000" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">and i&#39;m seeing a lot of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:06.400" style="s2">he and i talked about coming back which</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:08.960" style="s2">is great greg enriquez henry yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.400" end="00:52:09.920" style="s2">yeah sorry to make it more uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.960" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">explicit</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.920" end="00:52:13.359" style="s2">um so so john gregon and i are going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:17.119" style="s2">have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.359" end="00:52:17.920" style="s2">soon a week and john and i were just</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.119" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">talking about some of</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.920" end="00:52:20.960" style="s2">our our encounters with greg&#39;s stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">so you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.960" end="00:52:24.640" style="s2">the last time that he and i talked i</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:28.079" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we shared so</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.640" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">i apologize if we did or didn&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.079" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">was that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.280" end="00:52:34.319" style="s2">what does he call it he calls it but</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">there&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.319" end="00:52:38.640" style="s2">the series of cones that are nested in</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.000" end="00:52:39.839" style="s2">each other and at the surface area</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.640" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s a point at which</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.839" end="00:52:44.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a juncture between</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.000" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">one level and the next level and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.640" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">know his proposition is that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:48.480" style="s2">witnessing is at the juncture of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">culture level as it</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.480" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">you know gives rise to the next level</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:55.920" style="s2">and the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:59.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a the thing that&#39;s on the upside</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.920" end="00:53:02.240" style="s2">is now i can name it</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.559" end="00:53:03.599" style="s2">transparadigmatic right and what does</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.240" end="00:53:06.880" style="s2">that mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.599" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">uh well that means something</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.880" end="00:53:13.599" style="s2">that has the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:14.079" style="s2">enable selection enable interoperability</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.599" end="00:53:17.119" style="s2">enable</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.079" end="00:53:21.599" style="s2">communication relationship um</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.119" end="00:53:23.920" style="s2">in a context of um also enabling</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.599" end="00:53:23.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">niches or or</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.160" end="00:53:32.640" style="s2">not diversity what was it</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:34.880" style="s2">diversification yeah speciation</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.640" end="00:53:36.640" style="s2">um and so it&#39;s like it is a it&#39;s a meta</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.880" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">culture the whole point is that it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.640" end="00:53:40.960" style="s2">be of the same sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">as paradigm and and the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.960" end="00:53:44.319" style="s2">cognition can&#39;t be of the same sort as</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2">the distributed cognition that operates</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.319" end="00:53:47.440" style="s2">in paradigm space</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.760" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">so we can we can kind of do the negative</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.440" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">space like the negative space is</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:52.640" style="s2">all this stuff not it right and and a</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:54.319" style="s2">little bit of the positive space it has</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.640" end="00:53:56.160" style="s2">to be able to do these sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.319" end="00:53:57.599" style="s2">and then that ink that thing right there</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.160" end="00:53:59.200" style="s2">like figuring out how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.599" end="00:54:00.800" style="s2">that ends up being a lot of what you and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.200" end="00:54:02.960" style="s2">me and john are</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.800" end="00:54:04.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a big a good description of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.960" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">space that we&#39;re trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:09.839" style="s2">is yeah what&#39;s this trans-paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:11.599" style="s2">uh metaculture right that has the</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.839" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">ability to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.599" end="00:54:15.119" style="s2">interoperability communicability</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.599" end="00:54:17.040" style="s2">capacity to be in relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.119" end="00:54:18.800" style="s2">therefore selection that is not</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.040" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">primitive selection but at a much higher</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.800" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">level um</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">while of course realizing the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:27.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">in that context the notion of paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.599" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">has now become</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:32.160" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a lot it&#39;s like happening at a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">lower level</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.160" end="00:54:35.520" style="s2">or yeah like a cell instead of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:37.920" style="s2">multicellular organism</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.520" end="00:54:39.359" style="s2">no i yeah i get that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.920" end="00:54:43.040" style="s2">anachronistic in in</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.359" end="00:54:47.119" style="s2">in an important way um but</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.040" end="00:54:47.920" style="s2">so so that maybe this helps to sharpen a</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.920" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">i mean the point of a paradigm is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.079" end="00:54:56.720" style="s2">same as like what an individual frame</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.160" end="00:54:57.680" style="s2">is right for an individual the point is</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.720" end="00:54:59.280" style="s2">we we can never</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.680" end="00:55:01.520" style="s2">we can&#39;t do algorithmic we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.280" end="00:55:04.160" style="s2">arbitrary so we use constraints</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.520" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">and what we&#39;ve been trying to do i mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.160" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">paradigm was one solution to that</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">because what you had was sets of soft</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:10.640" style="s2">constraints you had</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:12.319" style="s2">you know various paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.640" end="00:55:13.119" style="s2">individuals you didn&#39;t have like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.319" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">recipe</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.119" end="00:55:17.119" style="s2">right like always ask questions and it</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:18.960" style="s2">has to have this syntactic formula</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.119" end="00:55:21.200" style="s2">it was it was it was it was more</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.960" end="00:55:24.160" style="s2">flexible was be like einstein</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.200" end="00:55:25.839" style="s2">be like right right right and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.160" end="00:55:28.079" style="s2">similarity function gives you</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.839" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">right the similarity function is right a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.079" end="00:55:33.359" style="s2">similar similarity to a prototype</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:34.240" style="s2">is a way is a is a very powerful way of</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.359" end="00:55:36.640" style="s2">sliding between</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.240" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">algorithmic and arbitrary right because</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.640" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">i can&#39;t just do do anything to be like</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.400" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">einstein</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:43.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s not there&#39;s no algorithm right</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.200" end="00:55:47.200" style="s2">it&#39;s similarity so what the question i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">working towards is</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.200" end="00:55:51.440" style="s2">right we have to get between algorithmic</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:54.000" style="s2">and arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.440" end="00:55:56.000" style="s2">we need something like what paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.000" end="00:55:58.319" style="s2">prototypes did for us</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.000" end="00:56:00.559" style="s2">but what are those going to be like</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.319" end="00:56:02.559" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.559" end="00:56:04.640" style="s2">one of the one of the advantages of</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.559" end="00:56:06.880" style="s2">prototypes especially prototypical</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.640" end="00:56:08.400" style="s2">individuals is we&#39;re sociocultural</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.880" end="00:56:10.799" style="s2">beings and we have this</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.400" end="00:56:12.160" style="s2">machinery of internalizing other people</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.799" end="00:56:14.559" style="s2">that we can exact</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.160" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">for purposes of scientific inquiry i</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.559" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">know what it&#39;s like to be like einstein</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:19.599" style="s2">even though i can&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:21.839" style="s2">because i know what it&#39;s like to be like</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.599" end="00:56:24.000" style="s2">my mom or my dad or my friends</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.839" end="00:56:25.440" style="s2">right i know what that function is like</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.000" end="00:56:27.040" style="s2">and so paradigms had</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.440" end="00:56:29.359" style="s2">you see what i&#39;m saying there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:32.720" style="s2">why they emerge</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.359" end="00:56:34.960" style="s2">they seem like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.720" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">well i&#39;m going to do this just to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.960" end="00:56:37.760" style="s2">deliberately provocative they seem like</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:40.799" style="s2">the final solution</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:43.680" style="s2">uh to the problem of how do</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.799" end="00:56:45.280" style="s2">you steer right how do you steer between</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.680" end="00:56:48.079" style="s2">algorithmic and arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.280" end="00:56:49.599" style="s2">so if we can&#39;t do that anymore if right</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.079" end="00:56:52.720" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.599" end="00:56:56.079" style="s2">so what what do we do who do we hold up</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:57.440" style="s2">right so okay so let&#39;s let&#39;s reconnect</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.079" end="00:56:59.680" style="s2">this so let&#39;s just wire wiring back into</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.440" end="00:57:01.280" style="s2">the notion of the culture war and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.680" end="00:57:03.839" style="s2">early sensibilities so the notion is</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.280" end="00:57:05.760" style="s2">like part of the idea of the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.839" end="00:57:06.480" style="s2">has this characteristic of almost having</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.760" end="00:57:09.280" style="s2">a uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.480" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">a partisan sensibility and it&#39;s yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.280" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">a given point in culture space has a</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2">but a war it&#39;s a sexual war right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:17.440" style="s2">conflict and and part of the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:19.359" style="s2">partisan sensibility is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.440" end="00:57:21.359" style="s2">any given point in culture space is</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.359" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">endeavoring to identify that notion of</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.359" end="00:57:26.480" style="s2">what is a good model like what is a good</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.359" end="00:57:28.640" style="s2">person exactly exactly exactly um okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.480" end="00:57:29.680" style="s2">so the question is something like it and</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.640" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">all right so you got kind of two</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.680" end="00:57:32.480" style="s2">responses</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.559" end="00:57:34.480" style="s2">one response is it&#39;s a competition of</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.480" end="00:57:36.240" style="s2">prototypes that&#39;s that&#39;s how i would say</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.480" end="00:57:37.920" style="s2">right it&#39;s a competition of prototypes</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.240" end="00:57:40.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.920" end="00:57:44.319" style="s2">okay hold on and and in that context</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.960" end="00:57:47.280" style="s2">it&#39;s and it&#39;s a competition between the</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.319" end="00:57:48.640" style="s2">the context models that allow the answer</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.280" end="00:57:49.839" style="s2">to what is a good prototype to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.640" end="00:57:51.599" style="s2">right both are happening in really</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.839" end="00:57:53.280" style="s2">interesting tension with each other</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.599" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s what i&#39;m going to say the</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.280" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">the thing about prototypes right is</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">um right is you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:02.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole point there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:05.040" style="s2">higher in terms of which you can compare</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.880" end="00:58:05.040" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.359" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">yeah okay so let&#39;s see um this also</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.359" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">feels very real time</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.480" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.319" end="00:58:18.319" style="s2">yeah so if it if it sits at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:18.319" style="s2">culture war</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.280" end="00:58:22.799" style="s2">then it grounds out in energy it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.280" end="00:58:25.359" style="s2">war right</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.799" end="00:58:26.960" style="s2">um and the and that&#39;s not what we want</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.359" end="00:58:30.319" style="s2">we want something other than that</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.960" end="00:58:31.599" style="s2">right then that isn&#39;t and we can say we</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.319" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">don&#39;t want it for lots of reasons like</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.599" end="00:58:34.480" style="s2">not least which is that i&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:36.240" style="s2">i can prove that that just ends with</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.480" end="00:58:39.280" style="s2">everybody dying like there&#39;s not a yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.240" end="00:58:40.880" style="s2">necessary exactly exactly ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.280" end="00:58:41.839" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to reduce suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.880" end="00:58:44.160" style="s2">pain</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.839" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">yeah and keep it like below existential</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.160" end="00:58:48.559" style="s2">or catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">yeah um so let&#39;s see how does this work</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.559" end="00:58:51.280" style="s2">it&#39;s actually it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:54.480" style="s2">interesting you just kind of shift it to</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.280" end="00:58:54.480" style="s2">the individual level</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.160" end="00:59:03.760" style="s2">can i say something that i&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.760" end="00:59:06.799" style="s2">at the individual level yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.760" end="00:59:08.640" style="s2">what i mean i i mean i because this</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.799" end="00:59:11.680" style="s2">comes up with the people who have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.640" end="00:59:12.480" style="s2">the the way purists like you should only</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.680" end="00:59:14.240" style="s2">do buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.480" end="00:59:16.400" style="s2">and i i propose like the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.240" end="00:59:18.559" style="s2">practices and i also propose the</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.400" end="00:59:21.920" style="s2">plurality of sages</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.559" end="00:59:24.160" style="s2">and the idea is i&#39;m not gonna have right</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.920" end="00:59:24.960" style="s2">the the single paradigmatic figure</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.160" end="00:59:27.359" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.960" end="00:59:28.480" style="s2">what i have is a dynamic small world</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.359" end="00:59:30.720" style="s2">network in which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.480" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">in it so the thing in my mind is like</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.720" end="00:59:34.480" style="s2">what the scientists do who are</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:36.079" style="s2">moving the rovers around on mars right</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.480" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">what you do is you you have a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.079" end="00:59:39.040" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.880" end="00:59:40.160" style="s2">and and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a dynamic small</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.040" end="00:59:41.359" style="s2">world network in which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.160" end="00:59:44.319" style="s2">constantly shifting</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.359" end="00:59:45.040" style="s2">who has priority at that time and</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.319" end="00:59:46.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.040" end="00:59:48.720" style="s2">right and and they and they do that sort</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.880" end="00:59:52.480" style="s2">of in a dynamic fashion</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.720" end="00:59:54.559" style="s2">yeah in terms of the content so for me</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.480" end="00:59:55.839" style="s2">the idea is you know i&#39;m an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.559" end="00:59:57.520" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.839" end="00:59:58.880" style="s2">and then i develop an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.520" end="01:00:02.079" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.880" end="01:00:04.160" style="s2">and then what i have is i don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.079" end="01:00:07.359" style="s2">single paradigmatic individual</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.160" end="01:00:08.880" style="s2">i have a pragmatic in the philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.359" end="01:00:12.000" style="s2">sense of pragmatism</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.880" end="01:00:12.720" style="s2">uh relationship between a plurality of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.000" end="01:00:14.720" style="s2">sages</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.720" end="01:00:16.079" style="s2">and they&#39;re constantly shifting who gets</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.720" end="01:00:16.880" style="s2">to be foregrounded who gets to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.079" end="01:00:20.960" style="s2">backgrounded</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.880" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">the the temporary alliances they form</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.960" end="01:00:24.319" style="s2">so it itself is never stable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.520" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">constantly</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.319" end="01:00:28.640" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that i have the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:30.799" style="s2">came up chaotic sense of normativity</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.640" end="01:00:32.640" style="s2">instead what i seem to have is a fairly</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.799" end="01:00:34.720" style="s2">continuous sense of normativity</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.640" end="01:00:36.400" style="s2">but what it&#39;s constantly changing and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.720" end="01:00:38.640" style="s2">adapting and growing</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.400" end="01:00:39.599" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;ve been trying to do yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.640" end="01:00:41.920" style="s2">i think this is right</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.599" end="01:00:43.040" style="s2">um so let me say it back to you in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.920" end="01:00:44.319" style="s2">different language i&#39;m going to shift</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.040" end="01:00:46.000" style="s2">actually shift modes because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.319" end="01:00:47.920" style="s2">something deeper there that i ca</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.000" end="01:00:48.960" style="s2">i couldn&#39;t quite get to i could almost</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.920" end="01:00:50.160" style="s2">get it and it&#39;s funny because like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.960" end="01:00:50.880" style="s2">language the words that want to come out</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.160" end="01:00:52.640" style="s2">of my mouth</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.880" end="01:00:54.160" style="s2">i had to bite them off because they felt</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.640" end="01:00:58.000" style="s2">like they were a little bit too</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.160" end="01:00:58.240" style="s2">um not pithy but not powerful enough to</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.000" end="01:00:59.680" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.240" end="01:01:02.160" style="s2">to contain what was being talked about</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:03.920" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to use um</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.160" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">uh tyson yonko portrays notion of</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.920" end="01:01:07.920" style="s2">distinction from growth and increase</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:08.960" style="s2">yep yep right and so what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.920" end="01:01:10.160" style="s2">about is is</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.960" end="01:01:12.400" style="s2">we&#39;re solving for the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.160" end="01:01:13.920" style="s2">increase and if you think about the</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.400" end="01:01:14.799" style="s2">problem of increase in the very human</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.920" end="01:01:17.440" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.799" end="01:01:19.040" style="s2">um there&#39;s you know a small number of</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.440" end="01:01:23.839" style="s2">basic questions</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.040" end="01:01:27.680" style="s2">one question is uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.839" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">sage says who of all the possible</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.680" end="01:01:30.720" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:32.400" style="s2">which are the ones that i will actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.720" end="01:01:35.599" style="s2">attend to</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.400" end="01:01:37.520" style="s2">um second</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.599" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">is in the context of a given sage a</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.520" end="01:01:41.359" style="s2">given relationship what is the content</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.839" end="01:01:43.280" style="s2">and so it was in the universe of</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.359" end="01:01:44.799" style="s2">possibility of a given relationship</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.280" end="01:01:46.720" style="s2">what is the subset of that possibility</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.799" end="01:01:48.160" style="s2">that we collected that the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.720" end="01:01:49.839" style="s2">will attend</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.160" end="01:01:51.839" style="s2">and then finally the third is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.839" end="01:01:52.640" style="s2">our capacity our relational capacity</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.839" end="01:01:55.680" style="s2">what is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.640" end="01:01:58.160" style="s2">the greatest uh gradient of which we are</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.680" end="01:01:58.160" style="s2">capable of</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.880" end="01:02:04.160" style="s2">as in the relationship yeah you you</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.480" end="01:02:06.799" style="s2">up for a second i lost the last two</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.160" end="01:02:08.799" style="s2">sentences you said um</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.799" end="01:02:10.559" style="s2">you got a gradient and then you went</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.799" end="01:02:11.680" style="s2">silent you&#39;re back yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.559" end="01:02:12.559" style="s2">i want to make sure because it looks</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.680" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">like there&#39;s a little bit of dropping</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.559" end="01:02:18.240" style="s2">back and forth</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.000" end="01:02:21.920" style="s2">just make sure am i back still</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.240" end="01:02:23.200" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re yes now you&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.920" end="01:02:25.200" style="s2">okay yeah so the thing i&#39;m seeing is</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.200" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">that that last move has to do with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.200" end="01:02:29.280" style="s2">you know it&#39;s almost like the size of</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.400" end="01:02:30.640" style="s2">the pipe or the the quality of capacity</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.280" end="01:02:32.640" style="s2">of relationality</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.640" end="01:02:34.480" style="s2">in the most in this deeply fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.640" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">sense that increases that the person</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.480" end="01:02:37.760" style="s2">the versatility or the the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:38.880" style="s2">of what could flow through the</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.760" end="01:02:40.559" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.880" end="01:02:42.720" style="s2">right which of course is is an</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.559" end="01:02:44.640" style="s2">individual capacity level</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.720" end="01:02:46.720" style="s2">um it&#39;s funny in my mind i&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.640" end="01:02:49.359" style="s2">seeing like this</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.720" end="01:02:50.799" style="s2">you could imagine two musicians and like</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.359" end="01:02:52.640" style="s2">the jazz metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.799" end="01:02:54.720" style="s2">but you know the more skillful the</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.640" end="01:02:55.359" style="s2">musician the more you can actually move</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.720" end="01:02:57.119" style="s2">away from</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.359" end="01:02:58.400" style="s2">any pre-existing constraints like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.119" end="01:03:01.680" style="s2">not doing jazz anymore</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.400" end="01:03:05.359" style="s2">but doing meta jazz your background</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.680" end="01:03:08.640" style="s2">is in like indian you know traditional</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.359" end="01:03:09.440" style="s2">indian drumming and my background is in</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.640" end="01:03:12.880" style="s2">um like</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.440" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">opera and yet we&#39;re so good at what we</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.880" end="01:03:15.920" style="s2">do that we can actually begin the</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.240" end="01:03:17.599" style="s2">process of just beginning with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.920" end="01:03:19.200" style="s2">possibility of sound</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.599" end="01:03:20.960" style="s2">and begin moving from there and just</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.200" end="01:03:22.640" style="s2">create incredible stuff in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.960" end="01:03:24.880" style="s2">right so the idea is like the</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.640" end="01:03:26.480" style="s2">more this is this is the inverse of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.880" end="01:03:29.039" style="s2">problem of paradigm difference</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.480" end="01:03:30.720" style="s2">right you know obviously physics the</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.039" end="01:03:32.079" style="s2">more the gradient or the more the delta</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.720" end="01:03:34.160" style="s2">between two points the more the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.079" end="01:03:35.280" style="s2">possibilities that can flow through them</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.160" end="01:03:37.760" style="s2">but the challenge of course you actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.280" end="01:03:40.240" style="s2">have the capacity to enable a connection</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.760" end="01:03:42.240" style="s2">and then allow that connection to be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.240" end="01:03:44.160" style="s2">kind of a self-authorizing protocol like</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.240" end="01:03:46.720" style="s2">you have to have some way of creating a</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.160" end="01:03:50.400" style="s2">connection at all communication channel</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.720" end="01:03:52.559" style="s2">and then the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.400" end="01:03:54.240" style="s2">inside each node to expand the</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.559" end="01:03:55.839" style="s2">communication channel bespoke to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.240" end="01:03:57.359" style="s2">quality of the relationship and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.839" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">content that needs to flow through it</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.359" end="01:04:00.720" style="s2">right that&#39;s the minimum viable content</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.839" end="01:04:02.720" style="s2">at each node</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.720" end="01:04:04.400" style="s2">is that as a basic capacity you know so</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.720" end="01:04:06.240" style="s2">like you know you and i</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.400" end="01:04:08.079" style="s2">interact the first thing we do is able</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.240" end="01:04:10.160" style="s2">to establish just</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.079" end="01:04:11.599" style="s2">you know pain remember the old dial-up</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.160" end="01:04:12.319" style="s2">modems like we start making those funny</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.599" end="01:04:13.839" style="s2">noises until</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.319" end="01:04:15.520" style="s2">okay we now have a communications</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.839" end="01:04:17.599" style="s2">channel and then what we do is we have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.520" end="01:04:20.480" style="s2">capacity to to</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.599" end="01:04:22.640" style="s2">from bespoke from just the fact of</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.480" end="01:04:24.000" style="s2">communication at all</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.640" end="01:04:26.240" style="s2">can begin the process of actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.000" end="01:04:28.400" style="s2">building the size of building the</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.240" end="01:04:31.359" style="s2">capacity of that channel to hold</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.400" end="01:04:32.319" style="s2">more and more um it&#39;s really quite</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.359" end="01:04:33.760" style="s2">interesting because if you think about</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.319" end="01:04:35.599" style="s2">this really like this holistic</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.760" end="01:04:41.039" style="s2">experience of like</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.599" end="01:04:43.520" style="s2">it has to be joyful right is it a good</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.039" end="01:04:44.799" style="s2">yeah like is it the question of who is</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.520" end="01:04:46.319" style="s2">omnipresent</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.799" end="01:04:47.839" style="s2">you know so i can&#39;t just kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.319" end="01:04:49.039" style="s2">grab a hold of you and say fuck this now</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.839" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna spend the next three years</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.039" end="01:04:51.680" style="s2">building a channel</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:52.720" style="s2">because maybe it&#39;s not the right who</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.680" end="01:04:53.760" style="s2">there&#39;s eight billion people maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.720" end="01:04:55.200" style="s2">there&#39;s some other who that we should be</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.760" end="01:04:56.319" style="s2">in relationship with so this is really</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.200" end="01:04:58.079" style="s2">interesting like</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.319" end="01:05:01.039" style="s2">meta sensibility of like is this the</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.079" end="01:05:01.039" style="s2">right place to attend</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.599" end="01:05:05.359" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting the the thing you</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.760" end="01:05:06.880" style="s2">were doing with joy and the way you were</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.359" end="01:05:08.799" style="s2">talking about this</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.880" end="01:05:10.000" style="s2">i&#39;m going to be talking to him soon it</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.799" end="01:05:12.160" style="s2">reminds me of uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.000" end="01:05:13.440" style="s2">jim carson&#39;s distinction between playing</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.160" end="01:05:15.680" style="s2">finite and infinite games</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.440" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">cool good call jim carson&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.680" end="01:05:18.319" style="s2">person to bring it into this</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:20.000" style="s2">exactly this moment because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.319" end="01:05:21.359" style="s2">talking about a lot of stuff that lives</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:22.559" style="s2">proper at the level of the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.359" end="01:05:24.319" style="s2">like we&#39;re definitely</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.559" end="01:05:25.920" style="s2">walking in those waters right now yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.319" end="01:05:28.079" style="s2">yeah yeah and uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.920" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">you know and i&#39;m i&#39;m actually you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.079" end="01:05:30.799" style="s2">the religious case against belief who</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:32.960" style="s2">has had a huge impact</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.799" end="01:05:34.559" style="s2">on me i&#39;m actually reading finite</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.960" end="01:05:36.880" style="s2">infinite games right now because</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.559" end="01:05:37.920" style="s2">i see dialectic as an infinite game that</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.880" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">is replacing</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.920" end="01:05:43.920" style="s2">uh debate which is a finite game right</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:44.480" style="s2">and so and and and the interesting</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.920" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.480" end="01:05:47.920" style="s2">that what you&#39;re talking about there</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:50.960" style="s2">right is because like</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.920" end="01:05:52.880" style="s2">the meta jazz musician is</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.960" end="01:05:54.799" style="s2">like the point of playing the music is</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.880" end="01:05:55.839" style="s2">to also change the rules by which the</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.799" end="01:05:58.240" style="s2">music is played</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.839" end="01:05:59.599" style="s2">as you&#39;re playing it which is right</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.240" end="01:06:00.319" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the defining</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.599" end="01:06:01.920" style="s2">features</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.319" end="01:06:03.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s what that&#39;s what i was trying</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.920" end="01:06:05.520" style="s2">to get and you were doing it with like</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.440" end="01:06:09.039" style="s2">you did with sort of a plurality of</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.520" end="01:06:12.240" style="s2">genres and then the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.039" end="01:06:12.240" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to get something here</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.599" end="01:06:23.119" style="s2">you you you have to get it such that</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.039" end="01:06:26.079" style="s2">they can make a priority</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.119" end="01:06:27.359" style="s2">for what cars calls and i i i he means</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.079" end="01:06:28.799" style="s2">this differently than rory so</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.359" end="01:06:31.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to confuse them but the</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.799" end="01:06:34.640" style="s2">ability to continue right</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.680" end="01:06:35.680" style="s2">the infinite game player wants the game</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.640" end="01:06:37.599" style="s2">to continue</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.680" end="01:06:40.000" style="s2">right that&#39;s the overarching normativity</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.599" end="01:06:42.640" style="s2">right openness open versus closed</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:44.160" style="s2">right the finite player wants it to come</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.640" end="01:06:46.480" style="s2">uh to conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.160" end="01:06:48.079" style="s2">so that they become entitled like in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.480" end="01:06:51.599" style="s2">literal sense of being given a title</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.079" end="01:06:53.200" style="s2">right right right and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.599" end="01:06:55.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve got it going up literally a couple</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.200" end="01:06:58.880" style="s2">of minutes so there there but there is</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.200" end="01:07:01.760" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s there&#39;s there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.880" end="01:07:04.000" style="s2">part of the change then is a change it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.760" end="01:07:07.520" style="s2">got to be a fundamental change</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.000" end="01:07:10.240" style="s2">in to understanding deeply</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.520" end="01:07:11.359" style="s2">the normative requirements we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.240" end="01:07:12.000" style="s2">talking a lot about the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.359" end="01:07:13.920" style="s2">requirements</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.000" end="01:07:15.280" style="s2">but the normative requirements on people</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.920" end="01:07:17.280" style="s2">such that they&#39;re willing to play</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.280" end="01:07:18.799" style="s2">infinite games you you and i have</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.280" end="01:07:19.280" style="s2">reached the same exact point completely</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.799" end="01:07:20.640" style="s2">granted</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.280" end="01:07:22.720" style="s2">i was like puzzling all over that like</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.640" end="01:07:24.240" style="s2">there&#39;s so many specific like that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.720" end="01:07:26.400" style="s2">the number of requirements such that</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.240" end="01:07:26.880" style="s2">people are ready willing and able to</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.400" end="01:07:30.319" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.880" end="01:07:32.160" style="s2">infinite games yeah exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.319" end="01:07:33.920" style="s2">yeah if you&#39;re ready and willing then</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.160" end="01:07:35.920" style="s2">you&#39;re in the educational mode</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.920" end="01:07:37.680" style="s2">great let us begin to build in you the</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.920" end="01:07:38.960" style="s2">capacity to durably</p>
