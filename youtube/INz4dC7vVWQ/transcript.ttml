<p begin="00:00:03.319" end="00:00:07.440" style="s2">so welcome everybody to voices with</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.790" end="00:00:10.590" style="s2">rebecky it&#39;s my great pleasure to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.440" end="00:00:13.170" style="s2">Mark Vernon on again some of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.590" end="00:00:16.250" style="s2">probably had the privilege of seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.170" end="00:00:18.949" style="s2">previous discussion I had with Mark</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.250" end="00:00:21.449" style="s2">especially are connected to the work of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.949" end="00:00:25.369" style="s2">Barfield and transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.449" end="00:00:29.189" style="s2">participatory knowing very good dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.369" end="00:00:31.890" style="s2">but I thought I&#39;d give mark a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.189" end="00:00:34.320" style="s2">introduce himself to you guys yet so you</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.890" end="00:00:36.149" style="s2">know who he is where it&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.320" end="00:00:38.579" style="s2">so mark welcome again it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.149" end="00:00:40.489" style="s2">pleasure to have you here again Thank</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.579" end="00:00:43.530" style="s2">You Joan as well and I&#39;m very glad to</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.489" end="00:00:45.570" style="s2">come back and pick up some of the themes</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.530" end="00:00:47.610" style="s2">perhaps which we discussed before but in</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.570" end="00:00:51.420" style="s2">a way I asked you about a number of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.610" end="00:00:54.059" style="s2">things and how you feel they fit in with</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.420" end="00:00:55.770" style="s2">your work yeah and but maybe just to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.059" end="00:00:58.859" style="s2">something as you&#39;re suggesting and Who I</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.770" end="00:01:02.789" style="s2">am so I work as a psychotherapist I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.859" end="00:01:05.250" style="s2">based in London I have a background in</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.789" end="00:01:08.400" style="s2">philosophy as well as physics I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.250" end="00:01:10.710" style="s2">matured a PhD on Plato and in somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.400" end="00:01:13.290" style="s2">in some ways what really interests me</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.710" end="00:01:17.250" style="s2">and maybe this is a good way into what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.290" end="00:01:19.380" style="s2">hope to ask you a bit about today I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.250" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">very influenced by this chap Owen</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.380" end="00:01:25.770" style="s2">Barfield who we talked about the floor</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">and one of his key insights was that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.770" end="00:01:30.540" style="s2">human experience of being alive their</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:33.390" style="s2">participation in the world and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.540" end="00:01:35.729" style="s2">even perceptual capacities has</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.390" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">profoundly changed over time</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.729" end="00:01:41.790" style="s2">and I got into this because when I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:44.700" style="s2">doing my my PhD on Plato</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.790" end="00:01:46.740" style="s2">I spent the whole time feeling I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:49.259" style="s2">quite get to grips with what plato was</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.740" end="00:01:54.060" style="s2">talking about I could sort of make sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.259" end="00:01:56.310" style="s2">of Plato within the sort of logic if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.060" end="00:01:58.829" style="s2">like a particular American philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.310" end="00:02:01.460" style="s2">and so I examined this dialogue and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.829" end="00:02:05.180" style="s2">made it stack up and so I got the PhD</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.460" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">but I felt the whole time that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.180" end="00:02:10.440" style="s2">couldn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t I was really having to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:12.300" style="s2">sort of strip away aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">dialogue in order to make some sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.300" end="00:02:17.640" style="s2">it rather than treat</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:19.290" style="s2">as a whole and it was when I started</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.640" end="00:02:21.659" style="s2">reading Barfield that I realized what</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.290" end="00:02:23.939" style="s2">this party might be about and because</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.659" end="00:02:26.700" style="s2">both Phil bases big point that when you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.939" end="00:02:29.189" style="s2">read someone like Plato yes be very</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.700" end="00:02:31.170" style="s2">careful because it it feels a bit like</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.189" end="00:02:34.140" style="s2">they share the same worldview or life</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.170" end="00:02:36.329" style="s2">form as you and in some measure they do</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.140" end="00:02:39.030" style="s2">but in important measures they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.329" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">yeah and he actually got of this through</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.030" end="00:02:44.120" style="s2">words so he some quiet arresting</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:46.889" style="s2">observations he makes are for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.120" end="00:02:51.000" style="s2">you know Plato just doesn&#39;t have words</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.889" end="00:02:53.129" style="s2">like analysis or like quantity words</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.000" end="00:02:55.590" style="s2">which you&#39;d think would just be basic</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.129" end="00:02:59.310" style="s2">for any philosopher certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.590" end="00:03:00.599" style="s2">philosopher who&#39;s popular popular you</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.310" end="00:03:03.769" style="s2">imagined to be one of the most of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.599" end="00:03:06.389" style="s2">rational philosophers who&#39;s ever lived</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.769" end="00:03:09.359" style="s2">and then you realize that he weaves</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.389" end="00:03:12.930" style="s2">things like myth into his dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.359" end="00:03:16.680" style="s2">rituals in vacations are there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.930" end="00:03:19.169" style="s2">whole kind of richness going on and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.680" end="00:03:20.669" style="s2">only after reading Barfield that I began</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.169" end="00:03:23.069" style="s2">to be able to make some more sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.669" end="00:03:25.290" style="s2">this particularly through this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.069" end="00:03:28.260" style="s2">our consciousness you know meaning our</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.290" end="00:03:30.419" style="s2">perceptual capacities do radically</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.260" end="00:03:33.239" style="s2">change over time now he Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.419" end="00:03:34.739" style="s2">develops a kind of there&#39;s a reason for</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.239" end="00:03:37.079" style="s2">this in the sense of there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.739" end="00:03:41.909" style="s2">unfolding or purpose which would be one</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.079" end="00:03:43.409" style="s2">way of taking it but I the thing I sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.909" end="00:03:49.440" style="s2">of was thinking about after we spoke</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.409" end="00:03:52.979" style="s2">last was in a way can some sense be made</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.440" end="00:03:56.389" style="s2">of these changes through thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.979" end="00:03:59.819" style="s2">the notion of spiritual intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.389" end="00:04:01.409" style="s2">whether the idea that there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.819" end="00:04:04.709" style="s2">spiritual intelligence that say is</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.409" end="00:04:06.540" style="s2">different from other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.709" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">intelligence certainly different from</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.540" end="00:04:10.859" style="s2">artificial intelligence as it&#39;s normally</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:12.540" style="s2">conceived if you&#39;re nervous at this</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.859" end="00:04:14.340" style="s2">point I know that I&#39;m speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.540" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">someone who&#39;s very much at the vanguard</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:18.510" style="s2">of expanding the notion of artificial</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:21.239" style="s2">intelligence but you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.510" end="00:04:25.620" style="s2">customized get to speak to you yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.239" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s also a real question because</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.620" end="00:04:30.030" style="s2">I&#39;m partly involved in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.600" end="00:04:32.670" style="s2">project at Cambridge University and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.030" end="00:04:38.180" style="s2">we&#39;re working on how artificial</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.670" end="00:04:40.740" style="s2">intelligence tends to sort of eliminate</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.180" end="00:04:43.290" style="s2">various kinds of intelligence which are</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.740" end="00:04:46.410" style="s2">actually basic and we use all day every</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.290" end="00:04:49.920" style="s2">day but spiritual intelligence if we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.410" end="00:04:53.490" style="s2">define such a thing would be the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.920" end="00:04:55.620" style="s2">the the outlier and that but that would</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.490" end="00:04:59.850" style="s2">be really important to try and get hold</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.620" end="00:05:01.320" style="s2">off if we can yeah so that&#39;s so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.850" end="00:05:03.480" style="s2">something of what I wondered if we could</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.320" end="00:05:06.270" style="s2">talk about today this is fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.480" end="00:05:10.920" style="s2">oh wow what a great set okay well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.270" end="00:05:13.290" style="s2">see how it goes well first of all I want</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.920" end="00:05:15.180" style="s2">to dress both of these and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.290" end="00:05:17.790" style="s2">dress them in the situation you did so</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.180" end="00:05:20.130" style="s2">I&#39;ve just been I&#39;m actually on</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.790" end="00:05:25.620" style="s2">somebody&#39;s area committee</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.130" end="00:05:27.630" style="s2">I&#39;m the external laminar and he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.620" end="00:05:29.730" style="s2">work basically tracing the connections</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.630" end="00:05:32.790" style="s2">between good far field and Steiner</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.730" end="00:05:33.570" style="s2">and so this is opera most in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.790" end="00:05:35.430" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.570" end="00:05:36.690" style="s2">and to the end of the dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.430" end="00:05:39.000" style="s2">cognitive science I think is really</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.690" end="00:05:41.970" style="s2">important but but</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.000" end="00:05:43.350" style="s2">so one thing we there&#39;s two things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.970" end="00:05:45.300" style="s2">they come up with that you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.350" end="00:05:47.550" style="s2">Garfield&#39;s particular argument and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.300" end="00:05:49.710" style="s2">the more general claim that we can you</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.550" end="00:05:51.780" style="s2">know that there are you know deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.710" end="00:05:53.430" style="s2">fundamental changes and what I often</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.780" end="00:05:57.540" style="s2">call the cultural cognitive grammar by</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.430" end="00:06:00.420" style="s2">which people make sense and so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.540" end="00:06:05.040" style="s2">talk about back that&#39;s great and then as</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.420" end="00:06:08.090" style="s2">you said this idea that because of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.040" end="00:06:11.400" style="s2">particular history and our particular</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.090" end="00:06:13.590" style="s2">default mode which I would typify by</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.400" end="00:06:17.340" style="s2">what I call the three Manos so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.590" end="00:06:19.080" style="s2">it&#39;s a monolithic mode in which all</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.340" end="00:06:19.620" style="s2">knowing is reduced to propositional</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.080" end="00:06:21.870" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.620" end="00:06:24.330" style="s2">it&#39;s a monophasic mode that says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.870" end="00:06:27.480" style="s2">only one state of consciousness it gives</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.330" end="00:06:29.430" style="s2">you access to reality and it&#39;s mono</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.480" end="00:06:31.230" style="s2">logic that reason is proto typically</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.430" end="00:06:33.390" style="s2">something you do in your head on your</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.230" end="00:06:35.190" style="s2">own and the prototypical example is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.390" end="00:06:37.560" style="s2">writing the treatments right and of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.190" end="00:06:39.810" style="s2">course plato violates all of those right</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.560" end="00:06:40.639" style="s2">Plato clearly violates all of those and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.810" end="00:06:46.030" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.639" end="00:06:48.590" style="s2">so you know and degree to which that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.030" end="00:06:51.409" style="s2">historical view of mind is being taken</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.590" end="00:06:52.789" style="s2">up unquestionably into the project</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.409" end="00:06:54.139" style="s2">that&#39;s called artificial and talk this</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.789" end="00:06:56.120" style="s2">is an argument I&#39;ve actually made</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.139" end="00:07:01.099" style="s2">explicitly I&#39;ve got to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.120" end="00:07:03.830" style="s2">about you know that we are we are we</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.099" end="00:07:06.229" style="s2">fail to take into account what we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.830" end="00:07:08.150" style="s2">embodying in these machines that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.229" end="00:07:10.009" style="s2">think we are just that there is just</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.150" end="00:07:11.900" style="s2">this thing almost like a substance</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.009" end="00:07:15.669" style="s2">intelligence that we just know what it</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.900" end="00:07:19.340" style="s2">is and we can put it in and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.669" end="00:07:21.250" style="s2">particularly think that what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.340" end="00:07:24.529" style="s2">in Florrie cognitive science is showing</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.250" end="00:07:26.439" style="s2">well the inadequacies of you know are</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.529" end="00:07:28.759" style="s2">very strictly computational</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.439" end="00:07:30.379" style="s2">propositional modeling of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.759" end="00:07:32.810" style="s2">intelligence is and intelligence less so</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.379" end="00:07:34.819" style="s2">I have a lot to say about that and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.810" end="00:07:36.110" style="s2">you have really I mean this in a good</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.819" end="00:07:37.159" style="s2">way there&#39;s usually something meant to</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.110" end="00:07:38.779" style="s2">be something negative but I need it</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.159" end="00:07:45.289" style="s2">really positive you pushed a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.779" end="00:07:48.139" style="s2">buttons and the first day I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.289" end="00:07:50.300" style="s2">interested in the 4e approach and how</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.139" end="00:07:51.979" style="s2">that is reaching out and where the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.300" end="00:07:55.759" style="s2">connections can be made as much as</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.979" end="00:07:58.490" style="s2">weather very much so let&#39;s start with</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.759" end="00:08:01.099" style="s2">the I did the wonderful example because</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.490" end="00:08:05.419" style="s2">as I indicated I think Plato clearly</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.099" end="00:08:07.250" style="s2">violates this cognitive grammar cultural</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.419" end="00:08:09.620" style="s2">cognitive grammar that we have that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.250" end="00:08:11.990" style="s2">locks us into this there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.620" end="00:08:12.740" style="s2">dimensional models above mind if I could</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.990" end="00:08:17.479" style="s2">put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.740" end="00:08:19.490" style="s2">and and this is a question you know that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.479" end="00:08:20.990" style="s2">people like gadamer they&#39;ve got but also</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.490" end="00:08:23.029" style="s2">people and you know it some of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.990" end="00:08:27.289" style="s2">people within the Platonic literature</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.029" end="00:08:29.810" style="s2">like Gonzalez and I&#39;ve RFA and I&#39;ll into</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.289" end="00:08:32.390" style="s2">Harlan right you know this was back to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.810" end="00:08:35.449" style="s2">clear marker that the the weight Plato</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.390" end="00:08:36.740" style="s2">wrote the mix of myth and the drama and</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.449" end="00:08:39.579" style="s2">the dialogue and not just the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.740" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">argumentation is actually central to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.579" end="00:08:44.300" style="s2">Plato&#39;s philosophy that if you if you do</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:46.399" style="s2">the project and abstracting the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.300" end="00:08:49.220" style="s2">arguments out and then treating that as</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.399" end="00:08:51.550" style="s2">what philosophers care about in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.220" end="00:08:54.050" style="s2">dialogues that I think you miss it</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.550" end="00:08:59.240" style="s2">platonic dialogue that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.050" end="00:09:00.500" style="s2">I am so engaged in this project so just</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.240" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">let me make this one point now I&#39;ll turn</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.500" end="00:09:03.560" style="s2">it back to you I&#39;m so engaged in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:06.620" style="s2">project that I&#39;m calling the project a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.560" end="00:09:08.470" style="s2">dialectic which is the psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.620" end="00:09:12.500" style="s2">both intrapersonal and interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.470" end="00:09:17.630" style="s2">that allows us to realize via logos and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.500" end="00:09:21.769" style="s2">that takes it to the point which is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.630" end="00:09:23.630" style="s2">degree to which we can like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.769" end="00:09:25.459" style="s2">think we can get back to the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.630" end="00:09:28.279" style="s2">world or anything anachronistic like</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.459" end="00:09:32.329" style="s2">that but the degree to which we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.279" end="00:09:34.220" style="s2">reconfigure practices that do what</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.329" end="00:09:37.790" style="s2">gadamer calls the bridging of horizons</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.220" end="00:09:40.550" style="s2">right that we set the text within a set</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.790" end="00:09:42.890" style="s2">of practices and that transform us in</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.550" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">ways that we can say are at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.890" end="00:09:47.899" style="s2">proportionally analogical to what Plato</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:50.660" style="s2">was talking about so that like that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.899" end="00:09:53.240" style="s2">see things exactly as Socrates those are</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.660" end="00:09:55.850" style="s2">played over the best but you know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.240" end="00:09:57.529" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get out there there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.850" end="00:10:00.100" style="s2">well there&#39;s a bridging of horizons</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.529" end="00:10:02.899" style="s2">there&#39;s a people there&#39;s at least a deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.100" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">existential resin resonance possible</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.899" end="00:10:10.730" style="s2">between us and so part of what that then</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.360" end="00:10:14.029" style="s2">brings out right it is exactly the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.730" end="00:10:16.670" style="s2">Barfield endpoint is how deep is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.029" end="00:10:19.010" style="s2">evolution of consciousness is there such</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.670" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">a thing how deep is it does it forever</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.010" end="00:10:24.770" style="s2">make the previous places inaccessible to</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:29.450" style="s2">us right or is there something more like</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.770" end="00:10:30.770" style="s2">a deep continuity between and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.450" end="00:10:33.230" style="s2">what I&#39;d like to start exploring with</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.770" end="00:10:36.200" style="s2">you yeah well I mean just on that last</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.230" end="00:10:39.860" style="s2">point and then I try to come back to how</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.200" end="00:10:42.970" style="s2">Plato&#39;s working I mean I think actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.860" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">that the last points relatively</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.970" end="00:10:48.620" style="s2">straightforwardly answered actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:50.390" style="s2">myself it&#39;s that far field and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.620" end="00:10:52.760" style="s2">people like Steiner and so on as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.390" end="00:10:56.570" style="s2">they haven&#39;t basically a u-shape yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.760" end="00:10:58.940" style="s2">yeah of kind of you know consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.570" end="00:11:03.290" style="s2">development and so the point is not the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.940" end="00:11:06.190" style="s2">oldest states of perception become</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.290" end="00:11:08.359" style="s2">completely impenetrable but that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.190" end="00:11:11.839" style="s2">contemplating them</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.359" end="00:11:13.009" style="s2">actually sparks a kind of new version of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.839" end="00:11:16.249" style="s2">them if you like</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.009" end="00:11:21.259" style="s2">in fact as up all this happens in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.249" end="00:11:26.779" style="s2">between times and so expands the present</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.259" end="00:11:29.889" style="s2">in relation to the past so yep they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.779" end="00:11:33.709" style="s2">bridges of a sort but they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.889" end="00:11:37.699" style="s2">there I know that they have a catalytic</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.709" end="00:11:40.249" style="s2">quality I think oh yeah so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.699" end="00:11:43.429" style="s2">idea is that I know I was I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.249" end="00:11:45.499" style="s2">and Roberto Colossus latest book the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.429" end="00:11:50.749" style="s2">celestial hunter I didn&#39;t read him he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.499" end="00:11:52.849" style="s2">a wonderful kind of cultural writer and</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.749" end="00:11:55.369" style="s2">he he writes these these long books that</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.849" end="00:11:58.639" style="s2">we&#39;ve ancient myth you know modern</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.369" end="00:12:01.099" style="s2">perceptions and this this one he eats he</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.639" end="00:12:02.599" style="s2">focuses on the idea of hunting and how</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.099" end="00:12:05.419" style="s2">the notion of hunting might have changed</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.599" end="00:12:08.720" style="s2">over time and he starts off with</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.419" end="00:12:11.239" style="s2">imagining our Paleolithic ancestors and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.720" end="00:12:13.249" style="s2">you know the old question of why they</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.239" end="00:12:16.309" style="s2">painted bison and Oryx and everything on</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.249" end="00:12:18.649" style="s2">cave walls and his assumption is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.309" end="00:12:20.509" style="s2">because back then and this fitted very</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.649" end="00:12:22.339" style="s2">nicely with their ball field bar field</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.509" end="00:12:27.139" style="s2">in perception of things and there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.339" end="00:12:29.949" style="s2">really a sense of difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.139" end="00:12:32.509" style="s2">animal and the human and they were both</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.949" end="00:12:34.220" style="s2">beings of a sort maybe spirits of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.509" end="00:12:36.439" style="s2">thought maybe they could metamorphosize</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.220" end="00:12:40.249" style="s2">and change so there was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.439" end="00:12:41.659" style="s2">continuity of being and so and when</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.249" end="00:12:44.869" style="s2">you&#39;re in hunting it was a religious</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.659" end="00:12:48.859" style="s2">event because um it was about a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.869" end="00:12:52.339" style="s2">an encounter with being and rather than</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.859" end="00:12:54.289" style="s2">you know say a modern factory farm which</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.339" end="00:12:57.079" style="s2">clearly rests on a very very different</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.289" end="00:12:59.749" style="s2">experience between what is to be human</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.079" end="00:13:02.239" style="s2">and what it is to eat meat and I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.749" end="00:13:04.729" style="s2">the point about that and to imagined</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.239" end="00:13:07.039" style="s2">past is can we imagine a new</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.729" end="00:13:10.069" style="s2">relationship to animals in the present</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.039" end="00:13:11.959" style="s2">and going into the future you know and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.069" end="00:13:13.189" style="s2">it feels like it&#39;s that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.959" end="00:13:17.569" style="s2">straightforward question to answer at</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.189" end="00:13:19.429" style="s2">all but it feels like it&#39;s worth doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.569" end="00:13:21.319" style="s2">because it opens up possibilities that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.429" end="00:13:22.100" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t do the imaginative</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.319" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">engagement</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.100" end="00:13:26.660" style="s2">you would never begin to conceive really</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:28.400" style="s2">you just go around in kind of every time</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.660" end="00:13:30.380" style="s2">to epicycles strike trying to stretch</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.400" end="00:13:32.420" style="s2">what you kind of knew already maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.380" end="00:13:34.130" style="s2">bringing in this case ton of ethics that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.420" end="00:13:37.610" style="s2">just makes you feel guilty doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.130" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">really feel very creative you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.610" end="00:13:43.940" style="s2">just about managing your exploitation a</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:46.640" style="s2">bit better perhaps so it yeah but so</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.940" end="00:13:48.290" style="s2">there&#39;s something about I always forget</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.640" end="00:13:51.080" style="s2">where I started and make off along these</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.290" end="00:13:51.950" style="s2">riffs but yeah and yeah that business</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.080" end="00:13:53.270" style="s2">about what the you know the ratio</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.950" end="00:13:55.820" style="s2">between the past and the present and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.270" end="00:13:59.050" style="s2">on anyway and the youth shape that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.820" end="00:14:00.950" style="s2">going on so that&#39;s interesting because I</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.950" end="00:14:09.410" style="s2">with my proposal that you have to engage</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.810" end="00:14:11.960" style="s2">in a set what I often call an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.410" end="00:14:16.940" style="s2">transformative practices if in order to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.960" end="00:14:19.700" style="s2">read these texts you very much</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.940" end="00:14:21.470" style="s2">can&#39;t read them just by being informed</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.700" end="00:14:23.420" style="s2">by pushing care about telling people</p>

<p begin="00:14:23.420" end="00:14:28.760" style="s2">can meet but if you just read them to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.060" end="00:14:31.670" style="s2">informed by the propositions rather than</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.760" end="00:14:34.760" style="s2">being transformed by the set of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.670" end="00:14:36.470" style="s2">practices that but they were it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.760" end="00:14:38.090" style="s2">least analogous to the set of practices</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.470" end="00:14:40.280" style="s2">in which they were embedded that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.090" end="00:14:43.460" style="s2">actually not going to get what the text</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.280" end="00:14:45.650" style="s2">is genuinely trying to say so that seems</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.460" end="00:14:48.710" style="s2">to be landing ok with you that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.650" end="00:14:53.840" style="s2">general idea because then because then</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.710" end="00:14:55.550" style="s2">because because because I want to I want</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.840" end="00:14:59.930" style="s2">to link that to the possibility that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.550" end="00:15:01.940" style="s2">might have resources a very powerful at</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.930" end="00:15:06.910" style="s2">our disposal the years since I want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.940" end="00:15:10.430" style="s2">sort of put 40 coxide into dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.910" end="00:15:13.990" style="s2">Barfield because another part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.430" end="00:15:16.870" style="s2">Barfield he does the phonological</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.990" end="00:15:23.390" style="s2">examination looks at certain terms</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.870" end="00:15:26.480" style="s2">he says notice how you know new map</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.390" end="00:15:28.340" style="s2">right which we can either translate a</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.480" end="00:15:30.410" style="s2">spirit or wind but we can&#39;t mean someone</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.340" end="00:15:33.280" style="s2">can you sleep are the same thing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.410" end="00:15:35.690" style="s2">then he uses that as kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.280" end="00:15:38.090" style="s2">something like a fossil to argue</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.690" end="00:15:39.590" style="s2">what what like that&#39;s been left in</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.090" end="00:15:42.350" style="s2">language I think he uses that metaphor a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.590" end="00:15:43.490" style="s2">couple times even right to try and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.350" end="00:15:44.090" style="s2">explicate with the previous state of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.490" end="00:15:46.340" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.090" end="00:15:48.830" style="s2">so let me be clear what a nonsense I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.340" end="00:15:51.050" style="s2">not saying that that there haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.830" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">fundamental differences in our cultural</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.050" end="00:15:55.190" style="s2">cognitive grammar but I wonder if and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:15:55.910" style="s2">this is why I talk about participatory</p>

<p begin="00:15:55.910" end="00:16:03.740" style="s2">I wonder if we&#39;re really cut off from</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.530" end="00:16:06.470" style="s2">participatory knowing so let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.740" end="00:16:08.360" style="s2">try and explain what I mean let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.470" end="00:16:10.490" style="s2">look at I know you know you&#39;re familiar</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.360" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">with a bit of this work here let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.490" end="00:16:15.470" style="s2">together so on one hand the world world</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:18.470" style="s2">of the work of Leacock and Johnson which</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.470" end="00:16:20.060" style="s2">I criticized in print so I I&#39;m not like</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.470" end="00:16:22.850" style="s2">an unquestioning supporter if it were</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.060" end="00:16:25.400" style="s2">and then the work of Michael Anderson</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.850" end="00:16:30.200" style="s2">and Dehaene and others and the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.400" end="00:16:33.830" style="s2">is the is the idea that we are all we</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.200" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">also often use many terms that have</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.830" end="00:16:41.090" style="s2">double meanings without making a clear</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">distinction between them so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.090" end="00:16:46.790" style="s2">classical classic example of you know I</p>

<p begin="00:16:47.270" end="00:16:52.910" style="s2">one is ones that are physical thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.340" end="00:16:55.550" style="s2">wanted but it&#39;s not really clearly</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.910" end="00:16:59.480" style="s2">distinct in people&#39;s mind right and they</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.550" end="00:17:01.040" style="s2">sort of lead between them and now laid</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.480" end="00:17:02.450" style="s2">off in Johnson have a particular theory</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:03.890" style="s2">about that that&#39;s metaphorical and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.450" end="00:17:07.970" style="s2">think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.890" end="00:17:10.610" style="s2">because what Anderson&#39;s idea is and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.970" end="00:17:13.430" style="s2">it&#39;s really challenging they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.610" end="00:17:17.660" style="s2">sort of penology quick cartography model</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.430" end="00:17:20.150" style="s2">of the brain this idea is that we either</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.660" end="00:17:22.939" style="s2">in biological evolution but also by</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.150" end="00:17:24.560" style="s2">their hand and by oldman and others also</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.939" end="00:17:26.780" style="s2">within our own development we can do</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.560" end="00:17:31.730" style="s2">something like excitation we can take</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.780" end="00:17:32.750" style="s2">circuits that and that have evolved or</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.730" end="00:17:34.670" style="s2">have been learned for doing one thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.750" end="00:17:38.030" style="s2">and we can exact them for doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.670" end="00:17:40.370" style="s2">something else so notice what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.030" end="00:17:44.179" style="s2">I&#39;m doing all this good gesture well</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.370" end="00:17:46.340" style="s2">that&#39;s because Broca&#39;s area which we we</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.179" end="00:17:47.690" style="s2">we we originally labeled it what does</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.340" end="00:17:49.340" style="s2">language syntax</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.690" end="00:17:52.960" style="s2">all originally</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.340" end="00:17:56.840" style="s2">was for doing fine control and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.960" end="00:17:59.330" style="s2">coordination right now I haven&#39;t lost</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.840" end="00:18:02.270" style="s2">that use of Broca&#39;s area yeah I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.330" end="00:18:05.090" style="s2">it but I&#39;m also using it right now when</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.270" end="00:18:08.180" style="s2">I&#39;m speaking and is that a metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.090" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">relation no but notice and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.180" end="00:18:15.170" style="s2">golden meadow shows my use of gesture is</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">not an ornament like I can&#39;t I there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.170" end="00:18:19.670" style="s2">certain problems I can&#39;t solve or solve</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:22.580" style="s2">as well if you prevent me from gesturing</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.670" end="00:18:24.350" style="s2">the rest the gesturing is not an</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.580" end="00:18:28.850" style="s2">ornament and it&#39;s not just a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.350" end="00:18:30.710" style="s2">right it&#39;s the two things are Co acting</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.850" end="00:18:33.830" style="s2">together almost like distributed</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.710" end="00:18:36.590" style="s2">cognition and that that Co action</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.830" end="00:18:38.120" style="s2">actually enables me to solve many</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.590" end="00:18:40.700" style="s2">problems and to learn many things I</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.120" end="00:18:43.100" style="s2">couldn&#39;t solve now that seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.700" end="00:18:45.710" style="s2">be something no at least deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.100" end="00:18:47.600" style="s2">analogous to what bar feels talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.710" end="00:18:50.360" style="s2">about but this is this is not this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.600" end="00:18:52.850" style="s2">not something that we used to do in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.360" end="00:18:54.500" style="s2">past you&#39;re doing it right now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.850" end="00:18:58.640" style="s2">gesturing and I&#39;m just you see what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.500" end="00:19:00.860" style="s2">and that&#39;s just one example for how you</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.640" end="00:19:03.650" style="s2">know the cerebellum has been exacted</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.860" end="00:19:06.500" style="s2">from physical balance to managing any</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.650" end="00:19:08.390" style="s2">complex set of contingencies and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.500" end="00:19:09.980" style="s2">why we use it well that&#39;s why we use</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.390" end="00:19:12.050" style="s2">balance when we&#39;re talking about justice</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.980" end="00:19:14.290" style="s2">but we might actually be activating the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.050" end="00:19:16.550" style="s2">cerebellum because it&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.290" end="00:19:18.560" style="s2">managing the complex interactions</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.550" end="00:19:21.710" style="s2">between many contingent variable begin</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.560" end="00:19:23.510" style="s2">that&#39;s not a metaphor but it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.710" end="00:19:26.270" style="s2">seems to be a different kind of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.510" end="00:19:29.330" style="s2">than just propositional and you see what</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.270" end="00:19:30.920" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get at so let&#39;s be clear</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.330" end="00:19:32.840" style="s2">when we&#39;re done I&#39;m not disputing that</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.920" end="00:19:34.280" style="s2">there are historical differences that</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.840" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">are cultural causing of grammar I agree</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.280" end="00:19:40.070" style="s2">with that but I&#39;m wondering I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:43.070" style="s2">to like you know it&#39;s like other stages</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.070" end="00:19:46.550" style="s2">like piagetian stages junk junk to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.070" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">Barfield or is it much more well like</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.550" end="00:19:52.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a layering right and we still</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:55.730" style="s2">have a lot of participation in fact for</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.910" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">a cognitive sciences emphasizing right</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.730" end="00:20:00.890" style="s2">how much our cognition is actually per</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:03.140" style="s2">spekt fireball and participatory and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.890" end="00:20:04.850" style="s2">enacted in just the way I&#39;m describing</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.140" end="00:20:08.600" style="s2">so that was a lot I hope that wasn&#39;t too</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.850" end="00:20:15.410" style="s2">much yeah well the thought that I have</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.600" end="00:20:18.890" style="s2">is whether or not Homo sapiens say has</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.410" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">developed a new cognitive methods or not</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.890" end="00:20:25.100" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s quite a question</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:27.830" style="s2">that Barfield asks it&#39;s more what is has</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.100" end="00:20:31.810" style="s2">Homo sapiens become more or less aware</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.830" end="00:20:38.570" style="s2">of over time it would be more like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.810" end="00:20:42.550" style="s2">so yeah so you know so for example if</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.570" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">you look back to ancient Athens again</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.550" end="00:20:46.610" style="s2">all things that&#39;s really quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:48.740" style="s2">surprising is the amount of time and</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.610" end="00:20:51.140" style="s2">effort that was put into what we would</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.740" end="00:20:53.780" style="s2">call religious practices yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.140" end="00:20:56.030" style="s2">whether they be personal rituals that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.780" end="00:20:57.680" style="s2">shaped all day every day and whether</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.030" end="00:21:00.740" style="s2">they be the great festivals of the city</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.680" end="00:21:02.510" style="s2">you know the extraordinary effort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.740" end="00:21:07.970" style="s2">putting up building and buildings like</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.510" end="00:21:10.220" style="s2">the Parthenon you know which way seemed</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.970" end="00:21:13.850" style="s2">completely excessive compared to</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.220" end="00:21:15.590" style="s2">anything that we would do now you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.850" end="00:21:19.460" style="s2">with no kind of financial return and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.590" end="00:21:22.520" style="s2">on and and so I you know you I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.460" end="00:21:24.890" style="s2">it&#39;s you could say you know that like 40</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.520" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">or 50 percent of the activity of an</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.890" end="00:21:29.570" style="s2">ancient Athenian it&#39;s more or less</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:31.520" style="s2">incomprehensible to us it just seems</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.570" end="00:21:34.520" style="s2">like it would normally call just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.520" end="00:21:36.260" style="s2">like superstition and but that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.520" end="00:21:38.120" style="s2">seems to me to be not very satisfactory</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.260" end="00:21:39.920" style="s2">way of approaching it and it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.120" end="00:21:41.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a sort of it&#39;s a parallel of when</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.920" end="00:21:43.730" style="s2">you read the platonic dialogue and thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.480" end="00:21:45.920" style="s2">why is he described you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.730" end="00:21:46.970" style="s2">whole tenth of this dialogue has got</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.920" end="00:21:49.460" style="s2">what we would call a near-death</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.970" end="00:21:52.280" style="s2">experience in it I think bother doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.460" end="00:21:55.850" style="s2">that and so for me that the challenge is</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.280" end="00:21:59.420" style="s2">more you know have we really lost a</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.850" end="00:22:03.110" style="s2">perception of a great chunk of the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.420" end="00:22:05.750" style="s2">if you like and if that is so what does</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.110" end="00:22:07.730" style="s2">that mean now if you don&#39;t just say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.750" end="00:22:09.710" style="s2">just superstition and you know thank God</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.730" end="00:22:11.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve said it all okay that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.710" end="00:22:16.470" style="s2">good so that&#39;s really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.080" end="00:22:20.850" style="s2">and so let&#39;s pick up on this so</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.470" end="00:22:24.059" style="s2">so part I mean so it strikes me that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.850" end="00:22:25.770" style="s2">two things that are not actually even</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.059" end="00:22:27.030" style="s2">like whether you were it wasn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.770" end="00:22:29.250" style="s2">presenting them as in conflict but</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.030" end="00:22:31.890" style="s2">they&#39;re not even text opposed because it</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.250" end="00:22:35.490" style="s2">strikes me that a lot of what we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.890" end="00:22:37.049" style="s2">seeing is what like I did it called</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.490" end="00:22:40.970" style="s2">ready hair that&#39;s what I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.049" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">about but we&#39;re not actually seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.970" end="00:22:45.510" style="s2">gestural nature of our cognition we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:49.620" style="s2">seeing through it but we&#39;re not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.510" end="00:22:52.890" style="s2">it and so it&#39;s there&#39;s a large degree</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.620" end="00:22:54.780" style="s2">and what you&#39;re saying is I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.890" end="00:22:57.179" style="s2">something they have to correspond to</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.780" end="00:22:59.610" style="s2">each other and simultaneously losing</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.179" end="00:23:02.280" style="s2">awareness of aspects of reality in</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.610" end="00:23:06.510" style="s2">conjunction with losing awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.280" end="00:23:08.280" style="s2">identity with various faculties it</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.510" end="00:23:11.909" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean those faculties have sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.280" end="00:23:16.260" style="s2">of biologically ceased to exist but that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.909" end="00:23:19.830" style="s2">they are not properly taken up into my</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.260" end="00:23:21.840" style="s2">awareness or into my sense of self is</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.830" end="00:23:24.390" style="s2">that their way to sort of try and stitch</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.840" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">these two together yeah maybe it is I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.390" end="00:23:28.140" style="s2">mean again perhaps it is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:29.820" style="s2">identify what Colin was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.140" end="00:23:31.710" style="s2">but as you were talking there and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.820" end="00:23:34.049" style="s2">actually a bit of William Blake came to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.710" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">my mind and this phrase Blake&#39;s uses</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.049" end="00:23:38.280" style="s2">about the doors of perception yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:41.370" style="s2">you know this is often now read as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.280" end="00:23:42.780" style="s2">kind of hippie you know psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.370" end="00:23:45.270" style="s2">aspiration or hope that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.780" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">something will you know come into your</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.270" end="00:23:50.190" style="s2">mind I think Blake actually meant it</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:51.720" style="s2">really quite precisely because you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.190" end="00:23:52.980" style="s2">as that famous encounter when he was</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.720" end="00:23:55.980" style="s2">asked what he sees when he sees the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.980" end="00:23:58.440" style="s2">sunrise you know do you see am affari</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.980" end="00:24:00.150" style="s2">ball about the size of the Guinea and he</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.440" end="00:24:02.580" style="s2">says no no no I see the heavenly host</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.150" end="00:24:05.520" style="s2">singing holy holy holy and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.580" end="00:24:08.760" style="s2">um what he understood was that when he</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.520" end="00:24:13.559" style="s2">looked through his eyes he could see a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.760" end="00:24:17.909" style="s2">whole lot more because of his acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.559" end="00:24:19.260" style="s2">really of his imaginative capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.909" end="00:24:20.520" style="s2">that&#39;s what it was for him to step</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.260" end="00:24:22.020" style="s2">through the door that&#39;s why he said</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.520" end="00:24:23.880" style="s2">doors of perception not just like</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.020" end="00:24:26.940" style="s2">windows of the set yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.880" end="00:24:30.130" style="s2">yeah and yeah and so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.940" end="00:24:32.710" style="s2">about well</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.130" end="00:24:34.990" style="s2">I mean let me let me put another example</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.710" end="00:24:38.590" style="s2">and see what you make this I mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.990" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">recently reading plato&#39;s the Phaedo you</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.590" end="00:24:43.210" style="s2">know which is the one in it where</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:45.910" style="s2">Socrates dies and I wanted to read it</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.210" end="00:24:47.380" style="s2">again because death is quite presents to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.910" end="00:24:48.760" style="s2">many of us right now with the global</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.380" end="00:24:51.610" style="s2">crisis and I was thinking you know what</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.760" end="00:24:54.550" style="s2">what does this what is reading the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.610" end="00:24:56.530" style="s2">dialogue in this present moment show me</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.550" end="00:25:00.430" style="s2">that I maybe wouldn&#39;t have seen if I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.530" end="00:25:02.770" style="s2">read it you know 10 years ago and there</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.430" end="00:25:05.590" style="s2">was I what I realized was that um what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.770" end="00:25:08.620" style="s2">took Plata to be doing was he realized</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.590" end="00:25:11.050" style="s2">that if if death itself is present which</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.620" end="00:25:12.460" style="s2">it literally is in the dialogue and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.050" end="00:25:13.630" style="s2">know it&#39;s sort of set up in the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.460" end="00:25:15.460" style="s2">because you know that by the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.630" end="00:25:16.990" style="s2">Sox is going to be dead and he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.460" end="00:25:19.960" style="s2">stop breathing there&#39;s gonna be a kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.990" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">of cold waxy body there and what does</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.960" end="00:25:24.310" style="s2">that enable you to perceive that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:27.990" style="s2">perhaps just couldn&#39;t have perceived in</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.310" end="00:25:31.630" style="s2">any other way so there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.990" end="00:25:34.660" style="s2">both our imagination and perhaps our</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.630" end="00:25:36.760" style="s2">awareness of what&#39;s present that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.660" end="00:25:38.800" style="s2">takes off in a whole new direction and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.760" end="00:25:40.570" style="s2">the possibility there and I could say</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.800" end="00:25:41.980" style="s2">more about what how I think Beto&#39;s feed</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.570" end="00:25:44.620" style="s2">is actually working there but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.980" end="00:25:48.570" style="s2">that&#39;s enough to to be going on there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.620" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">enough that&#39;s very helpful so any</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.570" end="00:25:54.580" style="s2">reading this thesis and no Blackman</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">talks about it they forget this book</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.580" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:08.340" style="s2">you&#39;d probably read this mark I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.629" end="00:26:10.259" style="s2">read it but it was in the thesis and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.340" end="00:26:11.700" style="s2">I&#39;m intending to read it I think taking</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.259" end="00:26:13.859" style="s2">appearance seriously the dynamic way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.700" end="00:26:16.859" style="s2">seeing in good debt and European pot by</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.859" end="00:26:19.169" style="s2">barckhoff or a hundred a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.859" end="00:26:23.519" style="s2">actually no yeah yeah and so this whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.169" end="00:26:26.009" style="s2">way of seeing uh and and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.519" end="00:26:29.070" style="s2">resident and you know and because the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.009" end="00:26:31.889" style="s2">what you were talking about there came</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.070" end="00:26:34.710" style="s2">out in the thesis was you know how how</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.889" end="00:26:38.419" style="s2">good job rejects the content distinction</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.710" end="00:26:42.619" style="s2">right so car cars right sensations are</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.419" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">like we were passive in their face and</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.619" end="00:26:49.590" style="s2">and then thought is spontaneous and free</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:51.389" style="s2">but right it has no content so when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.590" end="00:26:53.159" style="s2">on its own it just as empty metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.389" end="00:26:56.220" style="s2">and sensations</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.159" end="00:26:58.049" style="s2">we&#39;re completely passive with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.220" end="00:27:00.179" style="s2">them and that passivity actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.049" end="00:27:02.570" style="s2">guarantees their realness although it</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.179" end="00:27:05.279" style="s2">content really doesn&#39;t but whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.570" end="00:27:08.879" style="s2">that what good to see to and you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.279" end="00:27:10.139" style="s2">and then it just seemed to argue I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.879" end="00:27:12.869" style="s2">you probably know more about this than I</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.139" end="00:27:15.539" style="s2">do you know for know know that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.869" end="00:27:17.970" style="s2">way of seeing in which that dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.539" end="00:27:20.879" style="s2">between imagination and perception is</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.970" end="00:27:24.690" style="s2">completely transcendent and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.879" end="00:27:27.019" style="s2">interesting is again that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.690" end="00:27:30.210" style="s2">that 4ee cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.019" end="00:27:31.349" style="s2">particularly enacted with you know an</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.210" end="00:27:33.570" style="s2">active versions of what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.349" end="00:27:36.509" style="s2">predictive processing is showing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.570" end="00:27:39.419" style="s2">the machinery so let&#39;s talk first for a</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.509" end="00:27:40.979" style="s2">sort of you know somewhat pedantically</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.419" end="00:27:42.929" style="s2">and then let&#39;s break it back up to this</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.979" end="00:27:44.970" style="s2">existential phenomenological level but</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.929" end="00:27:47.729" style="s2">pedantically what it is is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.970" end="00:27:49.109" style="s2">machinery that you engage when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.729" end="00:27:52.109" style="s2">seeing something and I need visual</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.109" end="00:27:53.669" style="s2">perception a very similar machinery is</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.109" end="00:27:58.950" style="s2">being engaged and activated when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.669" end="00:28:01.649" style="s2">imagining seeing and that imagination is</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.950" end="00:28:06.090" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a separate thing it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.649" end="00:28:07.759" style="s2">more like the top down so the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.090" end="00:28:10.979" style="s2">this values is bottom-up and top-down</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.759" end="00:28:15.320" style="s2">it&#39;s more like the way to top down you</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.979" end="00:28:17.230" style="s2">know sensitizes you and the bottom up is</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.320" end="00:28:19.750" style="s2">more how</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.230" end="00:28:23.620" style="s2">the world is challenging you it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.750" end="00:28:26.830" style="s2">more dialogic so the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.620" end="00:28:30.279" style="s2">imagination and perception goes away</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.830" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">such that it makes good sense to say you</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.279" end="00:28:33.100" style="s2">know you should practice doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:35.529" style="s2">imagination because it will actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.100" end="00:28:40.450" style="s2">transform your perception down the road</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.529" end="00:28:42.070" style="s2">you know things like that in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.450" end="00:28:43.840" style="s2">often use that phrase when I&#39;m teaching</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.070" end="00:28:46.269" style="s2">Tai Chi Chuan I said we use imagination</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.840" end="00:28:47.860" style="s2">to Train perception right and and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.269" end="00:28:50.470" style="s2">gets much work imagination and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.860" end="00:28:53.769" style="s2">imaginal sense rather than imaginary and</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.470" end="00:28:56.110" style="s2">so I think all of that makes a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.769" end="00:28:59.130" style="s2">tremendous amount of sense and so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.110" end="00:29:01.809" style="s2">guess what&#39;s worth I take it back up</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.130" end="00:29:04.090" style="s2">when you&#39;re reading these things it</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.809" end="00:29:05.620" style="s2">seems like what you&#39;re now saying is</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.090" end="00:29:06.669" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re trying to and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.620" end="00:29:12.340" style="s2">brought the book up you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.669" end="00:29:14.110" style="s2">invoke this way of seeing that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.340" end="00:29:15.309" style="s2">difficult to realize because we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.110" end="00:29:18.519" style="s2">this cognitive grammar that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.309" end="00:29:22.419" style="s2">cartomizers subjective objective your</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.519" end="00:29:24.639" style="s2">imagination perception mind and body me</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.419" end="00:29:27.010" style="s2">in the world like all this or and but</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.639" end="00:29:30.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a state if I understand you</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.010" end="00:29:33.190" style="s2">correctly that is kind of between that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.850" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">even the wrong predicate it&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.190" end="00:29:38.500" style="s2">adjectives between and beyond right</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:40.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way of seeing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.500" end="00:29:42.519" style="s2">also a way of realizing it&#39;s also a way</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.990" end="00:29:44.590" style="s2">of sensitizing that&#39;s also a way of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.519" end="00:29:46.539" style="s2">attending that&#39;s also a way of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.590" end="00:29:47.230" style="s2">conceptualizing but not as a distinct in</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.539" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">your head thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.230" end="00:29:55.510" style="s2">it might is that yeah yeah and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:30:01.210" style="s2">again the thought the case when I just</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.510" end="00:30:02.380" style="s2">we&#39;re talking there is I don&#39;t know to</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.210" end="00:30:03.970" style="s2">bring in something else that I hope was</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.380" end="00:30:06.279" style="s2">illuminating you know in in the medieval</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.970" end="00:30:07.960" style="s2">world and and I think it&#39;s even in in</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.279" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">the ancient world as well it was quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.960" end="00:30:12.549" style="s2">standard to realize there were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:13.419" style="s2">several levels of knowing and maybe with</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.549" end="00:30:15.610" style="s2">this you know there&#39;s the literal</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.419" end="00:30:16.899" style="s2">knowing the allegorical knowing the one</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.610" end="00:30:18.399" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting me now is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.899" end="00:30:21.760" style="s2">topological the one where something</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.399" end="00:30:27.960" style="s2">starts to turn and change to to gain the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.760" end="00:30:27.960" style="s2">kind of an ego get yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.930" end="00:30:35.460" style="s2">I suppose the other the other thought I</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.570" end="00:30:38.440" style="s2">have is that um I you know I wonder how</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.460" end="00:30:40.840" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to track as you say the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.440" end="00:30:44.110" style="s2">kind of the various cognitive systems</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.840" end="00:30:46.770" style="s2">and I you know I noticed the metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.110" end="00:30:49.780" style="s2">of the Machine sort of come in and so on</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.770" end="00:30:51.940" style="s2">and and so and see how there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.780" end="00:30:56.290" style="s2">parallels and how they even the same and</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.940" end="00:30:58.660" style="s2">but I mean terms of your perception of</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.290" end="00:31:01.020" style="s2">the world things can be very completely</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.660" end="00:31:04.030" style="s2">different you know dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.020" end="00:31:06.180" style="s2">transformed and so it for me it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.030" end="00:31:11.230" style="s2">a kind of metaphysical question as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.180" end="00:31:14.770" style="s2">which is you know will tell you you take</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.230" end="00:31:17.590" style="s2">something like death you know death can</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.770" end="00:31:19.960" style="s2">be something about which you can&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.590" end="00:31:21.490" style="s2">what to say at all it&#39;s bewildering you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.960" end="00:31:22.930" style="s2">know and so you get a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.490" end="00:31:24.610" style="s2">analytical philosophy will say well you</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.930" end="00:31:26.200" style="s2">know why you even buried about death you</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.610" end="00:31:27.730" style="s2">weren&#39;t worried about being alive before</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.200" end="00:31:29.560" style="s2">you were born so why would you worry</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.730" end="00:31:31.060" style="s2">about not being alive after you died you</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.560" end="00:31:33.850" style="s2">know which feels like a completely</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.060" end="00:31:35.830" style="s2">misses the point although no no satisfy</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.850" end="00:31:37.210" style="s2">some people and but they may be</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.830" end="00:31:40.630" style="s2">satisficing because they have to stay in</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.210" end="00:31:42.100" style="s2">a certain level of kind of awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.630" end="00:31:43.780" style="s2">then you might get a second level which</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.100" end="00:31:46.030" style="s2">says that I&#39;m you know death must be</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.780" end="00:31:47.620" style="s2">kind of avoided at all costs I can I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.030" end="00:31:51.280" style="s2">feel it&#39;s a real thing it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.620" end="00:31:53.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a monstrosity and you know we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.280" end="00:31:54.970" style="s2">use all medical science you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.500" end="00:31:57.220" style="s2">trying to build computers that we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.970" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">download it load ourselves onto whatever</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.220" end="00:32:01.810" style="s2">it might be you know and to try and</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:02.950" style="s2">avoid it that might be another level a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.810" end="00:32:05.010" style="s2">third level might be</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.950" end="00:32:09.790" style="s2">I know death is the kind of is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.010" end="00:32:11.830" style="s2">terrible tragedy and we it intensifies</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.790" end="00:32:13.840" style="s2">life because of the tragedy the tragic</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.830" end="00:32:15.640" style="s2">experience of it we want to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.840" end="00:32:17.950" style="s2">celebrate the lives of people we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.640" end="00:32:19.510" style="s2">known and that you know that this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.950" end="00:32:22.510" style="s2">very different from saying death is</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.510" end="00:32:24.160" style="s2">nothing at all but then you might get</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.510" end="00:32:27.930" style="s2">the kind of an aggregate level which</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.160" end="00:32:27.930" style="s2">would say well actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.350" end="00:32:32.920" style="s2">treating death as just a kind of moment</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.270" end="00:32:35.650" style="s2">at the end of your life that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.920" end="00:32:37.810" style="s2">mistake yes that life is and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.650" end="00:32:39.640" style="s2">continual was as TS eloquent you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.810" end="00:32:42.190" style="s2">I&#39;m the time of death is every moment</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.640" end="00:32:42.880" style="s2">and and that and the reason why that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.190" end="00:32:44.440" style="s2">appealing</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.880" end="00:32:47.170" style="s2">not just because it reconciles you to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.440" end="00:32:50.710" style="s2">death but because you realize that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.170" end="00:32:53.100" style="s2">constant stepping into new life yes now</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.710" end="00:32:57.280" style="s2">that is a very different perception from</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.100" end="00:32:59.920" style="s2">you know more sunny from the silence and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.280" end="00:33:03.460" style="s2">you know this this matters I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.920" end="00:33:08.740" style="s2">because people it completely changes</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.460" end="00:33:10.120" style="s2">people&#39;s lives and you know and I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.740" end="00:33:13.300" style="s2">you can even say there are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.120" end="00:33:15.160" style="s2">different outputs that this this arises</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.300" end="00:33:17.350" style="s2">from like for example Plato&#39;s Phaedo I</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.160" end="00:33:20.350" style="s2">think if Plato hadn&#39;t himself had that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.350" end="00:33:21.670" style="s2">perception which you know by the end of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.350" end="00:33:24.580" style="s2">by the end of the dialogue I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.670" end="00:33:28.690" style="s2">basically has Socrates saying look if</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.580" end="00:33:30.400" style="s2">you um sit before death and try and come</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.690" end="00:33:33.730" style="s2">up with your arguments that say you</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.400" end="00:33:35.470" style="s2">survive beyond death and watch them fall</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.730" end="00:33:36.670" style="s2">which is essentially what happens for</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.470" end="00:33:38.740" style="s2">the first sort two thirds of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.670" end="00:33:40.570" style="s2">dialogue and they say you know maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.740" end="00:33:42.190" style="s2">soul floats off from the body well no</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.570" end="00:33:44.140" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t make sense and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.190" end="00:33:45.790" style="s2">maybe the soul is like the music and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.140" end="00:33:46.870" style="s2">lyre but you still need the lyre</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.790" end="00:33:48.700" style="s2">you know they come they have all these</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.870" end="00:33:50.950" style="s2">dip kind of and he all of them falls so</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.700" end="00:33:52.660" style="s2">much oh they kind of reach a panic you</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.950" end="00:33:54.190" style="s2">know just over halfway through thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.660" end="00:33:56.290" style="s2">my god you know the greatest forces ever</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.190" end="00:33:58.300" style="s2">lived is about to be unable to answer</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.290" end="00:34:01.390" style="s2">the greatest question even as he&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.300" end="00:34:02.890" style="s2">to die but that it&#39;s that kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.390" end="00:34:06.460" style="s2">precipitous moment that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.890" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">topological and eventually you know I</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.460" end="00:34:09.520" style="s2">think in a way in a nutshell what</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.840" end="00:34:11.379" style="s2">Socrates are saying that is now what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.520" end="00:34:14.649" style="s2">see if I never possessed life to start</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.379" end="00:34:16.629" style="s2">with it possessed me and you know my</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.649" end="00:34:22.419" style="s2">intelligence was just a sharing him but</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.629" end="00:34:25.149" style="s2">the divine log or say you know and so at</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.419" end="00:34:27.070" style="s2">every moment that I&#39;ve let go of my own</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.149" end="00:34:31.030" style="s2">perception of my life I&#39;ve been stepping</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.070" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">into that wider perception so now that</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.030" end="00:34:35.669" style="s2">I&#39;m about to die that is just continuing</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:38.669" style="s2">what&#39;s been going on all my life anyway</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.669" end="00:34:41.230" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to say something like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.669" end="00:34:45.399" style="s2">and the truth of that I mean I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.230" end="00:34:46.929" style="s2">to express it in you know sentences but</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.399" end="00:34:50.919" style="s2">I think the truth that ultimately is</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.929" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">something that is felt and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.919" end="00:34:55.929" style="s2">it directly and you I know you mean you</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:56.710" style="s2">know very much wantonness of course but</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.929" end="00:34:58.869" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.710" end="00:35:05.650" style="s2">well I guess all that point yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.869" end="00:35:07.930" style="s2">about this it&#39;s not just how to how can</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.650" end="00:35:10.569" style="s2">we understand cognitive processes if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.930" end="00:35:12.430" style="s2">like it&#39;s about what do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.569" end="00:35:17.200" style="s2">again I suppose I&#39;ve said this you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.430" end="00:35:19.390" style="s2">what do we actually perceive and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.200" end="00:35:21.490" style="s2">why I think I&#39;m altima interested in</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.390" end="00:35:24.670" style="s2">this this this evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.490" end="00:35:28.119" style="s2">consciousness because uh yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.670" end="00:35:29.859" style="s2">wanted to reach sort of reservoir expand</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.119" end="00:35:34.240" style="s2">enable me to step through the doors of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.859" end="00:35:39.910" style="s2">perception like yeah so that that&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:42.490" style="s2">that&#39;s great like I mean I like that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.910" end="00:35:46.569" style="s2">mean I&#39;m actually been teaching in my</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.490" end="00:35:48.490" style="s2">meditation class lecture Davina this way</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.569" end="00:35:54.040" style="s2">of read it that is not about information</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.490" end="00:35:56.859" style="s2">is about transformation and the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.040" end="00:35:59.530" style="s2">a great relationship with being with</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.859" end="00:36:01.569" style="s2">yourself rather than having the right</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.530" end="00:36:04.180" style="s2">answer which it&#39;s a very different thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.569" end="00:36:06.730" style="s2">and I think what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.180" end="00:36:08.049" style="s2">yeah the fatal event properly because I</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.730" end="00:36:09.990" style="s2">think all of the arguments for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.049" end="00:36:12.790" style="s2">immortality of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.990" end="00:36:14.799" style="s2">they&#39;re all questionable and the ones</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.790" end="00:36:17.020" style="s2">that Plato says well they might work</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.799" end="00:36:19.240" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re not what we typically</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.020" end="00:36:20.920" style="s2">want immortality they&#39;re not personal</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.240" end="00:36:23.260" style="s2">immortality they&#39;re sort of maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.920" end="00:36:27.069" style="s2">part of you that is conforms to eternal</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.260" end="00:36:28.650" style="s2">truths is eternal it&#39;s like so in that</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.069" end="00:36:30.369" style="s2">sense it&#39;s not going to answer right</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.650" end="00:36:32.410" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to give you the right</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.369" end="00:36:34.150" style="s2">answer but I think what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.410" end="00:36:35.440" style="s2">it&#39;s more like no and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.150" end="00:36:37.930" style="s2">wrestling with this idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.440" end="00:36:40.089" style="s2">no not Facebook the idea of you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.930" end="00:36:43.170" style="s2">being faithful to reality entering into</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.089" end="00:36:47.410" style="s2">right relationship with it and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.170" end="00:36:48.609" style="s2">transforming and I did not intend and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.410" end="00:36:51.040" style="s2">don&#39;t think you mad at that buddy but</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.609" end="00:36:54.609" style="s2">just to be clear I did not intend the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.040" end="00:36:56.710" style="s2">cognitive science to be exclusive and to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.609" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">say this is what I was trying to say is</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.710" end="00:37:01.839" style="s2">could we instead of it instead of these</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:04.540" style="s2">tube discourses taking place separately</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.839" end="00:37:06.430" style="s2">from each other I think they come</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.540" end="00:37:09.160" style="s2">together and precise the end as I said</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.430" end="00:37:09.580" style="s2">that this new way of seeing is a new way</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.160" end="00:37:12.490" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.580" end="00:37:14.200" style="s2">and that gets me in to write this</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.490" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a connection but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.200" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">self-knowledge there&#39;s a self knowing</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:20.230" style="s2">until knowing more about knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:22.090" style="s2">again not just in the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.230" end="00:37:24.760" style="s2">sense but in the kind of knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.090" end="00:37:27.570" style="s2">affords by relationship that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.760" end="00:37:30.250" style="s2">or the participatory transformation I</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.570" end="00:37:32.920" style="s2">think that could only help I think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.250" end="00:37:36.010" style="s2">could only help so that I wasn&#39;t yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.920" end="00:37:37.750" style="s2">wasn&#39;t and I completely get by yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.010" end="00:37:39.610" style="s2">I am that&#39;s precisely why you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:37:39.610" end="00:37:43.660" style="s2">on yes exactly I mean I think the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.980" end="00:37:44.740" style="s2">ultimate motivation at least for many of</p>

<p begin="00:37:57.640" end="00:38:06.490" style="s2">existential it&#39;s ultimately about can we</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.500" end="00:38:10.510" style="s2">transform our account of what what it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.490" end="00:38:14.740" style="s2">to know the world and know ourselves in</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.930" end="00:38:45.940" style="s2">would say that for example this is a</p>

<p begin="00:38:45.940" end="00:38:51.370" style="s2">ultimately think about not machines in</p>

<p begin="00:41:25.650" end="00:41:29.700" style="s2">also bound up with a metaphysics of mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.140" end="00:41:32.420" style="s2">of metaphysics of self-knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.700" end="00:41:34.660" style="s2">metaphysics of being that is actually an</p>

<p begin="00:41:34.660" end="00:41:43.160" style="s2">yeah so a thought in response I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.490" end="00:41:47.000" style="s2">that for making juicy to that and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.160" end="00:41:48.440" style="s2">thought that occurred to me is how you</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.000" end="00:41:50.359" style="s2">know what you&#39;re talking about the above</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.440" end="00:41:52.700" style="s2">and below I think when you get these</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.359" end="00:41:55.609" style="s2">kind of trop illogical moments and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.700" end="00:41:58.250" style="s2">see this in as in psychotherapy in my</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.609" end="00:42:00.500" style="s2">own practice and let alone just by sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.250" end="00:42:05.570" style="s2">of personal observation or or personal</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.500" end="00:42:08.359" style="s2">practices it&#39;s the moments of of real</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.570" end="00:42:10.460" style="s2">change that whole think as it were comes</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.359" end="00:42:12.800" style="s2">together it&#39;s both it&#39;s a both an</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.460" end="00:42:15.560" style="s2">important moment and a kind of lift of</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.800" end="00:42:17.180" style="s2">consciousness yes yes it&#39;s a Eureka</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.560" end="00:42:19.670" style="s2">moment it&#39;s not incidental that</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.180" end="00:42:21.470" style="s2">Archimedes you know leaps out of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.670" end="00:42:23.390" style="s2">bath and runs down the street yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.470" end="00:42:25.700" style="s2">not that it&#39;s not incidental to his</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.390" end="00:42:32.300" style="s2">shift of consciousness in that moment I</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.700" end="00:42:34.640" style="s2">think I exactly what Celia even his</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.300" end="00:42:36.890" style="s2">self-image even his public persona all</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.640" end="00:42:41.599" style="s2">of that has now been radically refute</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.890" end="00:42:43.369" style="s2">yeah yeah I think that that moment when</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.599" end="00:42:44.270" style="s2">you get right and that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.369" end="00:42:47.900" style="s2">what I mean when I&#39;m trying to talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.270" end="00:42:51.500" style="s2">about that dialectic isn&#39;t just its</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.900" end="00:42:53.330" style="s2">importantly interpersonal but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.500" end="00:42:56.510" style="s2">interpersonal and getting that stack</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.330" end="00:42:57.859" style="s2">right like he just did you know then</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.510" end="00:42:59.930" style="s2">when all those things click together</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.859" end="00:43:03.339" style="s2">this way that you and I are clicking</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.930" end="00:43:05.540" style="s2">together this way right and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.339" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a third thing that opens up</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.540" end="00:43:09.320" style="s2">between them this is work that Chris and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:11.089" style="s2">I are going but when this if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.320" end="00:43:14.210" style="s2">allow me these gestural metaphors to</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.089" end="00:43:16.220" style="s2">them right and this resident are</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.210" end="00:43:18.890" style="s2">starting to mutually important resonate</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.220" end="00:43:22.580" style="s2">then a third turn opens up between them</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.890" end="00:43:24.380" style="s2">and and that that is I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.580" end="00:43:27.410" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of like the Annunaki field</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.380" end="00:43:28.820" style="s2">that&#39;s where like because this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.410" end="00:43:30.830" style="s2">exactly happening when you have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.820" end="00:43:33.230" style="s2">horizontal and the vertical then you get</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.830" end="00:43:35.150" style="s2">the ear afford it and a Gog and a</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.230" end="00:43:38.390" style="s2">powerful powerful way and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.150" end="00:43:40.670" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in because I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.390" end="00:43:42.080" style="s2">whole network of practices one forget</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.670" end="00:43:45.859" style="s2">Socrates is also going to the gymnasium</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.080" end="00:43:47.610" style="s2">let&#39;s just take a man&#39;s it right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.859" end="00:43:50.460" style="s2">done martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.610" end="00:43:52.590" style="s2">literally that&#39;s also taken for granted</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.460" end="00:43:54.840" style="s2">he&#39;s something new like music that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.590" end="00:43:56.550" style="s2">taken for granted right so there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.840" end="00:43:58.920" style="s2">of this stuff and all these practices</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.550" end="00:44:04.290" style="s2">and then trying to get up you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.920" end="00:44:07.700" style="s2">well can I understand what dialectic is</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.290" end="00:44:10.230" style="s2">so that I can read the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.700" end="00:44:12.870" style="s2">dialectically so that that third factor</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.230" end="00:44:14.550" style="s2">opens up yeah it won&#39;t be it what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.870" end="00:44:16.290" style="s2">not I&#39;m not claiming what it will be for</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.550" end="00:44:18.180" style="s2">me is exactly what it would be in</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.290" end="00:44:20.430" style="s2">Plato&#39;s place but I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.180" end="00:44:22.620" style="s2">proportional analogy between them so</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.430" end="00:44:24.720" style="s2">that I&#39;m reading Plato at least look in</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.620" end="00:44:26.940" style="s2">that deeply transformative equally</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.720" end="00:44:28.200" style="s2">relevant manner other than just whether</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.940" end="00:44:30.840" style="s2">or not have been agree with certain</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.200" end="00:44:33.510" style="s2">propositions so let me add something</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.840" end="00:44:36.120" style="s2">then because I think that another thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.510" end="00:44:39.620" style="s2">that&#39;s intelligence would adds again to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.120" end="00:44:42.570" style="s2">put it rather crudely but would be that</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.620" end="00:44:44.520" style="s2">that those protocol moments are also</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.570" end="00:44:46.680" style="s2">receptive moments put it like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.520" end="00:44:48.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason why they change you</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.680" end="00:44:51.870" style="s2">it&#39;s not because suddenly is that were</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.210" end="00:44:54.360" style="s2">your neurons reorganized and another</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.870" end="00:44:56.930" style="s2">fantasy becomes possible but because you</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.360" end="00:44:59.730" style="s2">become more resonant with wider reality</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.930" end="00:45:01.290" style="s2">you know so actually let me just reach</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.730" end="00:45:06.570" style="s2">for a book if I can just find it quickly</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.290" end="00:45:09.060" style="s2">I&#39;m so and we thought last time about</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.570" end="00:45:12.750" style="s2">I&#39;m Gregory shores book on theology in</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.060" end="00:45:17.670" style="s2">the soul oh I wonder if you&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.750" end="00:45:21.260" style="s2">eventually our divine double I talked</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.670" end="00:45:21.260" style="s2">about it repeatedly in the series I</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.650" end="00:45:26.580" style="s2">didn&#39;t well I didn&#39;t have the consent</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.880" end="00:45:29.430" style="s2">the perceptual I&#39;m gonna use read it</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.580" end="00:45:30.840" style="s2">myself yeah I thought was really</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.430" end="00:45:34.740" style="s2">fascinating book I really just come</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.840" end="00:45:37.170" style="s2">across it and but this idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.740" end="00:45:40.200" style="s2">divine double it seems to me to be one</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.170" end="00:45:43.160" style="s2">way of thinking about how it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.200" end="00:45:47.490" style="s2">reception of intelligence you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.160" end="00:45:49.220" style="s2">experience and so on as rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.490" end="00:45:52.590" style="s2">sort of other self</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.220" end="00:45:55.020" style="s2">yeah a big fabrication or something or</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.590" end="00:45:57.000" style="s2">and you know in the richest but then in</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.020" end="00:45:59.550" style="s2">the poesis sense the author paresis</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.000" end="00:46:01.060" style="s2">sense but they also although all that</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.550" end="00:46:05.080" style="s2">auto pieces has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.060" end="00:46:07.480" style="s2">and but ultimately in order that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.080" end="00:46:09.990" style="s2">know the metaphor might be you know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.480" end="00:46:12.970" style="s2">like a tuning in the radio or something</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.990" end="00:46:15.580" style="s2">the law frequency can come down or</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.970" end="00:46:18.730" style="s2">whatever it might be but that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.580" end="00:46:21.640" style="s2">one of the me I talk about divided</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.730" end="00:46:24.550" style="s2">double a lot in the episode and and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.640" end="00:46:28.750" style="s2">try to integrate it with Agnes coloreds</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.550" end="00:46:35.830" style="s2">work on aspiration this little again is</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.750" end="00:46:37.450" style="s2">funny but you don&#39;t know his stuff are</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.830" end="00:46:39.610" style="s2">now Dionysius</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.450" end="00:46:42.280" style="s2">I highly recommend as well Dionysius the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.610" end="00:46:44.800" style="s2">Areopagite but let&#39;s look at this point</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.280" end="00:46:47.890" style="s2">about a 2 min and resonance but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.800" end="00:46:49.900" style="s2">exactly again I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.890" end="00:46:52.030" style="s2">sound like I&#39;m just beating a drum but</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.900" end="00:46:53.470" style="s2">this is one of the central moves that</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.030" end="00:46:57.280" style="s2">for any cognitive science is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.470" end="00:47:00.100" style="s2">say your mind isn&#39;t in your head right</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.280" end="00:47:03.030" style="s2">through that lid back right right you</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.100" end="00:47:06.090" style="s2">the mind is pregnant well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.030" end="00:47:08.350" style="s2">cognition is actually the ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.090" end="00:47:10.420" style="s2">attunement me of all the achievement</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.350" end="00:47:12.970" style="s2">between you in the world its co-created</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.420" end="00:47:14.380" style="s2">by you in order says that&#39;s what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.970" end="00:47:16.840" style="s2">about that&#39;s going back to the winter</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.380" end="00:47:19.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not just spontaneous projection</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.840" end="00:47:22.060" style="s2">it&#39;s not just passive reception it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.780" end="00:47:23.740" style="s2">it&#39;s the to earn right the the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.060" end="00:47:24.880" style="s2">resonance picks up on both of those</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.740" end="00:47:26.500" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.880" end="00:47:29.260" style="s2">get out with the whole notion of trans</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.500" end="00:47:30.700" style="s2">Jack tivity that like you have your I</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.260" end="00:47:33.430" style="s2">think that&#39;s what good was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.700" end="00:47:36.100" style="s2">but you&#39;re simultaneously right you</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.430" end="00:47:39.460" style="s2">simultaneously reaching out with it but</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.100" end="00:47:43.150" style="s2">with the autopoietic change as afforded</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.460" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">you by a new way of seeing them but that</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.150" end="00:47:47.260" style="s2">is inseparably bound up with a new way</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.280" end="00:47:49.900" style="s2">in which the world is disclosing itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.260" end="00:47:52.360" style="s2">to you and challenging you and you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:48:08.040" end="00:48:14.310" style="s2">right and you&#39;re getting different</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.360" end="00:48:15.630" style="s2">aspects to disclose themselves to so</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.310" end="00:48:18.060" style="s2">this is one of the fundamental that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.630" end="00:48:24.570" style="s2">what the that&#39;s what the embedded you</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.060" end="00:48:28.580" style="s2">know yeah yeah yeah to knit metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.570" end="00:48:31.020" style="s2">right and that cognition is much more a</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.580" end="00:48:33.510" style="s2">self-organizing process of attuning</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.020" end="00:48:35.730" style="s2">yourself to the environment that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.510" end="00:48:38.310" style="s2">often happening some representationally</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.730" end="00:48:39.420" style="s2">sub propositioning who then it is inside</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.310" end="00:48:41.340" style="s2">your head to running all these</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.420" end="00:48:43.170" style="s2">calculations and then you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.340" end="00:48:45.270" style="s2">sending out motor commands and receiving</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.170" end="00:48:46.920" style="s2">sensory postcards from your senses or</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.270" end="00:48:49.220" style="s2">something like that they&#39;re very very</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.920" end="00:48:52.770" style="s2">different you it&#39;s it&#39;s deeply embedded</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.220" end="00:48:54.570" style="s2">deeply did I mean better so I mean so</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.770" end="00:48:55.710" style="s2">you know that the book the divine double</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.570" end="00:48:57.240" style="s2">is you&#39;ll know that talks a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.710" end="00:49:01.950" style="s2">amends are talking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.240" end="00:49:05.370" style="s2">betweenness yeah who&#39;s intact shoot up</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.950" end="00:49:09.630" style="s2">my leg alright things I really enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.370" end="00:49:12.300" style="s2">about the book was the the seeming</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.630" end="00:49:15.570" style="s2">metaphysics in patinas about the one</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.300" end="00:49:17.520" style="s2">becoming to and so on he I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.570" end="00:49:20.670" style="s2">exciting this is that this really should</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.520" end="00:49:22.800" style="s2">be understood as a myth and a difference</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.670" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">it would be is that it&#39;s a way of trying</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:31.500" style="s2">to capture the experience of being part</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:34.380" style="s2">of this movement from warm yes I really</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.500" end="00:49:36.840" style="s2">like that yeah so one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.380" end="00:49:40.350" style="s2">things that&#39;s exemplary for me about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.840" end="00:49:41.550" style="s2">tires is again how all of these</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.350" end="00:49:42.510" style="s2">dimensions that are talked about a</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.550" end="00:49:44.810" style="s2">dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.510" end="00:49:47.760" style="s2">are present so when you&#39;re reading -</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.810" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">you&#39;re reading an argument but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.760" end="00:49:53.670" style="s2">also going through a spiritual exercise</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:59.190" style="s2">I mean so those are similar - right but</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.670" end="00:50:01.740" style="s2">in Plutonia said so like and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.190" end="00:50:04.740" style="s2">interweaving of argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.740" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">conceptual analysis that&#39;s a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.740" end="00:50:08.670" style="s2">anachronism Aziz doesn&#39;t do analysis</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:11.220" style="s2">something like that working with you</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.670" end="00:50:16.460" style="s2">know conceptual intelligibility and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.220" end="00:50:19.860" style="s2">the invoking of transformative practices</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.460" end="00:50:22.230" style="s2">so for that&#39;s why it&#39;s on my life but</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.860" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">especially because basically Theory X</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.230" end="00:50:27.750" style="s2">thesis the gnosis the OREA right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:29.630" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.750" end="00:50:32.849" style="s2">there&#39;s no deep distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.630" end="00:50:34.890" style="s2">theorizing and theoria and then and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.849" end="00:50:37.680" style="s2">purpose comes on and adds on and also</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.890" end="00:50:41.970" style="s2">fear chip right and so those three are</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.680" end="00:50:46.320" style="s2">just yeah and so when you see that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.970" end="00:50:48.740" style="s2">the in it&#39;ll happen now just gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.320" end="00:50:51.240" style="s2">so in you know in Plato&#39;s Phaedo the</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.740" end="00:50:52.740" style="s2">reason why the arguments for the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.240" end="00:50:54.740" style="s2">immortality of the soul fail is</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.740" end="00:50:58.190" style="s2">precisely so you can have the kenosis</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.740" end="00:51:00.780" style="s2">you know to the more sort of Fratto</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.190" end="00:51:02.250" style="s2">rational mind it looks like a failure it</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.780" end="00:51:04.200" style="s2">looks like a disaster and those around</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.250" end="00:51:05.310" style="s2">Socrates start to panic a bit and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.200" end="00:51:07.170" style="s2">they realize that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.310" end="00:51:15.590" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely crucial about that</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.170" end="00:51:15.590" style="s2">happening to come and this lead to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.050" end="00:51:21.300" style="s2">where we got to on that did you yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.790" end="00:51:25.050" style="s2">get that</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.300" end="00:51:26.609" style="s2">just say the last thing you said I was</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.050" end="00:51:30.630" style="s2">just really wise who he was jumping in</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.609" end="00:51:32.700" style="s2">and saying this is as were the the am</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.630" end="00:51:35.580" style="s2">agog ik realization about the way the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.700" end="00:51:38.580" style="s2">dialogue the Phaedo is functioning that</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.580" end="00:51:41.070" style="s2">what seemed at first like a crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.580" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">rationality like it can&#39;t answer the big</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.070" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">question about life or in death in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:47.640" style="s2">middle point of the dialogue they</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:49.170" style="s2">realize it&#39;s the cannot account yes in</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.640" end="00:51:51.359" style="s2">return us you know and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.170" end="00:51:53.790" style="s2">necessary that it happens in a way the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.359" end="00:51:57.270" style="s2">reason itself has to kind of die in</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.790" end="00:52:03.300" style="s2">order the this new perception can have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.270" end="00:52:06.420" style="s2">space to come through yeah and so yeah -</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.300" end="00:52:07.770" style="s2">I think what kind of side views is</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.420" end="00:52:09.599" style="s2">continuous with Plato</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.770" end="00:52:12.420" style="s2">of course there&#39;s four scholars would</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.599" end="00:52:16.940" style="s2">dispute that but I think there&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.420" end="00:52:16.940" style="s2">continuity a real tradition their</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.960" end="00:52:21.599" style="s2">tradition in the Catholic Church or the</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.490" end="00:52:23.250" style="s2">Eastern Orthodox Church</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.599" end="00:52:24.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re identical but</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.250" end="00:52:27.180" style="s2">they&#39;re but there&#39;s a continuity and a</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.960" end="00:52:29.339" style="s2">tradition binding them together I</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.180" end="00:52:32.730" style="s2">dislike the way the knee replacements</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.339" end="00:52:34.320" style="s2">are often dismissed on terribly - I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.730" end="00:52:35.940" style="s2">I agree I think that you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.320" end="00:52:40.140" style="s2">the evolution of consciousness idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.940" end="00:52:41.480" style="s2">helps me understand that because it took</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.140" end="00:52:45.930" style="s2">as it were</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.480" end="00:52:47.910" style="s2">five six centuries for what had begun to</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.930" end="00:52:49.770" style="s2">become clear to Plato to really become</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.910" end="00:52:52.500" style="s2">clear for betweenness which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.770" end="00:52:54.300" style="s2">precisely the one you know there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.500" end="00:52:55.650" style="s2">kind of obvious place I can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.300" end="00:52:57.390" style="s2">the gue beauty from the true and wonder</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.650" end="00:52:59.910" style="s2">about how they all relate and do they</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.390" end="00:53:02.310" style="s2">kind of it really one form at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.910" end="00:53:04.440" style="s2">the days that were but it&#39;s only becomes</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.310" end="00:53:06.330" style="s2">possible for katanas to really see it</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.440" end="00:53:08.780" style="s2">and so therefore begin to articulate it</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.330" end="00:53:12.000" style="s2">in the way that he does and what place</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.780" end="00:53:17.640" style="s2">constantly reminds and exemplifies and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.000" end="00:53:20.910" style="s2">affords is that realization is something</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.640" end="00:53:23.580" style="s2">that can&#39;t be undertaken just with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.910" end="00:53:24.740" style="s2">dying you know but it kept me at it</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.580" end="00:53:27.510" style="s2">guess within discursive reason</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.740" end="00:53:30.180" style="s2">description he&#39;s not anti intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.510" end="00:53:30.890" style="s2">that would be a big mistake right defect</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.180" end="00:53:34.470" style="s2">he says</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.890" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">so he&#39;s internalizing the point is you</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.470" end="00:53:40.200" style="s2">take the description reasoning as far as</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.440" end="00:53:42.360" style="s2">it will go because it&#39;s like what you</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.200" end="00:53:45.260" style="s2">did with door son of window you look</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.360" end="00:53:48.050" style="s2">it&#39;s a portal there portends that</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.260" end="00:53:51.240" style="s2">transports you into something beyond I</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.050" end="00:53:53.490" style="s2">and so what you have and then what kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.240" end="00:53:55.680" style="s2">of says is well it&#39;s like it&#39;s like in</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.490" end="00:53:58.110" style="s2">it&#39;s like in the Republic yet you go up</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.680" end="00:54:00.870" style="s2">but he consciously goes out to them goes</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.110" end="00:54:03.210" style="s2">up to or out to the Sun but then he</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.870" end="00:54:05.790" style="s2">returns but I even turns back to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.210" end="00:54:09.150" style="s2">text back to the argument so like</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.790" end="00:54:12.150" style="s2">there&#39;s that that constant movement back</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.150" end="00:54:17.910" style="s2">and forth between the OREA to get your</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.150" end="00:54:19.770" style="s2">diagnosis and and theorizing and I find</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.910" end="00:54:22.890" style="s2">out really really exemplary in a very</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.770" end="00:54:24.810" style="s2">powerful way yeah yeah well I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.890" end="00:54:26.550" style="s2">often missed but it easy it is in very</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.810" end="00:54:29.310" style="s2">and Plato again I think partly because</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.550" end="00:54:30.900" style="s2">the details are often over you know read</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.310" end="00:54:33.090" style="s2">over but you know the Republic for</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.900" end="00:54:34.920" style="s2">example yeah you know well-known for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.090" end="00:54:36.990" style="s2">myth of the cave which seems like an</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.920" end="00:54:39.720" style="s2">ascending metaphor but of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.990" end="00:54:42.510" style="s2">opening words are I went down to</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.720" end="00:54:45.690" style="s2">glorious yes the point is right for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.510" end="00:54:48.630" style="s2">word go and go to inter and that young</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.690" end="00:54:50.870" style="s2">and so that&#39;s wonderful cause that that</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.630" end="00:54:54.589" style="s2">afford to be circling back to something</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.870" end="00:54:56.390" style="s2">so we&#39;re 22 the cave and this for</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.589" end="00:55:00.380" style="s2">this sort of resonates with something</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.390" end="00:55:02.900" style="s2">else right you know I&#39;m off repeated and</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.380" end="00:55:05.440" style="s2">I think therefore it might be getting a</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.900" end="00:55:07.849" style="s2">little bit cliched and I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.440" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">revitalize it think from Zeena&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.849" end="00:55:11.299" style="s2">know when I first started studying Zen</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:13.900" style="s2">thousands were mountains and rivers and</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.299" end="00:55:15.950" style="s2">rivers and when I was doing Zen</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.900" end="00:55:18.589" style="s2">mountains weren&#39;t mountains and rivers</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.950" end="00:55:21.200" style="s2">weren&#39;t rivers and then when I was done</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.589" end="00:55:23.660" style="s2">Zen mountains were mountains and rivers</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.200" end="00:55:25.279" style="s2">were rivers but you know that although</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.660" end="00:55:27.200" style="s2">it&#39;s the same it&#39;s also totally</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.279" end="00:55:30.499" style="s2">different than the first time all right</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.200" end="00:55:33.619" style="s2">and so that brings me around to you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.499" end="00:55:35.809" style="s2">that you returned back into the cave you</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.619" end="00:55:37.759" style="s2">go through disclosing aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.809" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">world but the point isn&#39;t for them</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.759" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">ultimately to be special or different or</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:47.029" style="s2">weird right and this is what this seems</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:48.380" style="s2">to put - the point is like go out but</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.029" end="00:55:56.960" style="s2">you also have to know how to come back</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.380" end="00:55:58.190" style="s2">in yeah yeah I mean so this is different</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.960" end="00:56:00.259" style="s2">I mean I think you know that that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.190" end="00:56:01.849" style="s2">personís and again another thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.259" end="00:56:03.229" style="s2">often not remembered about Patronus is</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.849" end="00:56:05.239" style="s2">that he was quite active in politics</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.229" end="00:56:09.910" style="s2">even was to build a city named after him</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.239" end="00:56:12.109" style="s2">and all that kind of thing yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.910" end="00:56:14.059" style="s2">make maybe put this so slightly</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.109" end="00:56:15.769" style="s2">differently so really better Dante here</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.059" end="00:56:17.390" style="s2">because that you reminded me of data</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.769" end="00:56:18.799" style="s2">with you up with it with the dissent in</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.390" end="00:56:21.259" style="s2">the a sense because of course the whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.799" end="00:56:25.819" style="s2">of the Divine Comedy is structured on a</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.259" end="00:56:28.309" style="s2">dissent and then an assent and I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.819" end="00:56:29.960" style="s2">that again if you the more you&#39;ve I read</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.309" end="00:56:32.269" style="s2">it the more I realized that and a</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.960" end="00:56:36.079" style="s2">descending moment is also an ascending</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.269" end="00:56:38.690" style="s2">moment yeah and it&#39;s something about its</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.079" end="00:56:41.900" style="s2">activity sort of psychologically I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.690" end="00:56:46.069" style="s2">it&#39;s not until Dante has a sin has</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.900" end="00:56:47.329" style="s2">descended too so you know so the point</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.069" end="00:56:49.069" style="s2">where he can&#39;t really descend any</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.329" end="00:56:50.599" style="s2">further and because all those he would</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.069" end="00:56:53.170" style="s2">in a near photonic sense he would just</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.599" end="00:56:56.989" style="s2">sort of drop out of being altogether</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.170" end="00:57:03.559" style="s2">but he he does that because then he</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.989" end="00:57:06.650" style="s2">becomes increasingly aware of what as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.559" end="00:57:08.600" style="s2">world lies outside of the descent that</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.650" end="00:57:11.810" style="s2">the holes and contains</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.600" end="00:57:14.300" style="s2">what he is descending into so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.810" end="00:57:16.340" style="s2">partly you know he realizes the extent</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.300" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">of his own darkness which at first feels</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.340" end="00:57:23.540" style="s2">overwhelming and but then gives him this</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:25.780" style="s2">sense that well you know for for Dante</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.540" end="00:57:28.370" style="s2">as well for modern psychotherapy that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.780" end="00:57:31.220" style="s2">the love that keeps things in motion is</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.370" end="00:57:32.900" style="s2">actually bigger than the hate or</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.220" end="00:57:35.780" style="s2">whatever else that would stop these</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.900" end="00:57:39.230" style="s2">things turning over and that would trap</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.780" end="00:57:44.690" style="s2">people I see I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.230" end="00:57:47.090" style="s2">also again about the the the topological</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.690" end="00:57:49.130" style="s2">the unanswered Romeo moment as you all</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.090" end="00:57:52.130" style="s2">put it you know because it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.130" end="00:57:54.200" style="s2">striking that in the narrative at least</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.130" end="00:57:59.000" style="s2">which of course has a narrative as well</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.200" end="00:58:00.980" style="s2">as things repeating in every moment they</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.000" end="00:58:02.150" style="s2">don&#39;t find their way out of hell by sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.980" end="00:58:03.980" style="s2">of is that were walking back the way</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.150" end="00:58:06.650" style="s2">they came and they find it where I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.980" end="00:58:09.920" style="s2">held like climbing onto Satan&#39;s body</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.650" end="00:58:11.930" style="s2">yeah you know it&#39;s very dramatic and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.920" end="00:58:13.370" style="s2">suddenly thanks they realize it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.930" end="00:58:15.110" style="s2">as their own</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.370" end="00:58:17.870" style="s2">you know Satan&#39;s left buttock or</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.110" end="00:58:20.600" style="s2">something but they&#39;ve they&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.870" end="00:58:22.520" style="s2">actually they started to ascend um even</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.600" end="00:58:25.520" style="s2">as they&#39;re still climbing across Satan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.520" end="00:58:30.010" style="s2">body and I think you know that there is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.520" end="00:58:32.570" style="s2">a deep psychological truth about that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.010" end="00:58:34.160" style="s2">mean when it Donald Winnicott who we</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.570" end="00:58:35.450" style="s2">mentioned before who I&#39;m very influenced</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.160" end="00:58:38.120" style="s2">by I think he understood these things</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.450" end="00:58:39.950" style="s2">and he did he did make comments like you</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.120" end="00:58:43.610" style="s2">can&#39;t really know about love and so you</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.950" end="00:58:44.990" style="s2">know about the extent of hate or um you</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.610" end="00:58:46.670" style="s2">can&#39;t really know about interdependence</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.990" end="00:58:50.320" style="s2">until you know about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.670" end="00:58:52.640" style="s2">between competition and cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.320" end="00:58:55.310" style="s2">again you mentioned thirds and I love</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.640" end="00:58:56.900" style="s2">the idea of thirds appearing and you</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.310" end="00:58:58.220" style="s2">know this would be the in other way</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.900" end="00:59:01.100" style="s2">pretty would be the conjunction of</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.220" end="00:59:03.950" style="s2">opposites yeah yeah the new the new</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.100" end="00:59:05.750" style="s2">possibility so you know that&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.950" end="00:59:07.850" style="s2">one take I think on what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.750" end="00:59:10.690" style="s2">about there and again I you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.850" end="00:59:12.080" style="s2">the point is that it is literally</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.690" end="00:59:15.650" style="s2">imperceptible</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.080" end="00:59:17.570" style="s2">until you&#39;ve gone on the journey once</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.650" end="00:59:20.570" style="s2">you&#39;ve gone on it as you come back to</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.570" end="00:59:21.380" style="s2">your point and the world I think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.570" end="00:59:23.870" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.380" end="00:59:27.440" style="s2">you know the mountain in the river far</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.870" end="00:59:31.430" style="s2">more extensively I would I would I would</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.440" end="00:59:33.080" style="s2">put that but it but you you but you are</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.430" end="00:59:35.570" style="s2">you know with the mountain in the river</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.080" end="00:59:38.630" style="s2">from something like that I would say</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.570" end="00:59:42.140" style="s2">it&#39;s something like I think it that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.630" end="00:59:45.770" style="s2">more expensive or the deeper seeing was</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.140" end="00:59:49.580" style="s2">always but that&#39;s not a new thing about</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.770" end="00:59:53.330" style="s2">the mountain and the river nor is it a</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.580" end="00:59:56.540" style="s2">new thing about you there&#39;s the idea you</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.330" end="01:00:00.380" style="s2">know there you don&#39;t all totally achieve</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.540" end="01:00:02.600" style="s2">Buddhahood in nature that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.380" end="01:00:04.490" style="s2">wrong way of thinking about it you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.600" end="01:00:06.380" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a difficult one to wrestle</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.490" end="01:00:09.290" style="s2">with but I think part of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.380" end="01:00:11.870" style="s2">trying to get at is this sense of you</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.290" end="01:00:13.190" style="s2">know and this is very clear and because</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.870" end="01:00:14.450" style="s2">the finest are use the whole structure</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.190" end="01:00:16.610" style="s2">of realities like that</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.450" end="01:00:18.020" style="s2">that the procession from the wine and</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.610" end="01:00:23.000" style="s2">the return from what these are not</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.020" end="01:00:25.940" style="s2">historical moments these are eternal</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.000" end="01:00:30.080" style="s2">these are eternal structures right that</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.940" end="01:00:32.510" style="s2">are like the grounding principles I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.080" end="01:00:34.520" style="s2">struggling for words here for</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.510" end="01:00:39.200" style="s2">intelligibility and being itself because</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.520" end="01:00:40.550" style="s2">the one is beyond beer so I take it that</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.200" end="01:00:43.730" style="s2">that&#39;s what they&#39;re trying to get out</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.550" end="01:00:46.040" style="s2">there that notion yeah well I mean again</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.730" end="01:00:49.130" style="s2">I think there are there are parallel</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.040" end="01:00:52.100" style="s2">experiences in psychotherapy so you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.130" end="01:00:54.260" style="s2">you saw might come to you and you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.100" end="01:00:56.990" style="s2">with very tangible struggles with life</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.260" end="01:00:59.690" style="s2">of one sort or another and you go for a</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.990" end="01:01:01.520" style="s2">long process of engagement with that</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.690" end="01:01:03.440" style="s2">maybe even be quite so long as sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.520" end="01:01:05.300" style="s2">it is you know we are learning how to</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.440" end="01:01:06.440" style="s2">get the body more involved and so on</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.300" end="01:01:08.960" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt about that but</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.440" end="01:01:09.410" style="s2">nonetheless you know a long old process</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.960" end="01:01:12.170" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.410" end="01:01:14.150" style="s2">and sure enough things change but then</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.170" end="01:01:16.190" style="s2">you asked a person so what made the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.150" end="01:01:18.680" style="s2">difference and they might say to you</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.190" end="01:01:21.650" style="s2">something like well I just know myself a</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.680" end="01:01:25.640" style="s2">bit better yeah anything is but why did</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.650" end="01:01:27.590" style="s2">it take so long you know but it takes it</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.640" end="01:01:30.410" style="s2">takes a long time just to know yourself</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.590" end="01:01:33.320" style="s2">sort of marginally better yeah but that</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.410" end="01:01:35.089" style="s2">in a way that marginal difference means</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.320" end="01:01:39.380" style="s2">that for example the anxiety or</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.089" end="01:01:42.710" style="s2">something has a whole load more space to</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.380" end="01:01:44.900" style="s2">be held with in yellow and so decreases</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.710" end="01:01:47.269" style="s2">I would imagine that it also means that</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.900" end="01:01:49.519" style="s2">aspects of the world are now disclosed</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.269" end="01:01:51.529" style="s2">to them and possibilities of relating</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.519" end="01:01:55.609" style="s2">are now disclosed to them that were</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.529" end="01:01:57.589" style="s2">weren&#39;t available to perform yes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.609" end="01:01:59.599" style="s2">trying to get out what it means when</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.589" end="01:02:03.979" style="s2">people say you know what changes they</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.599" end="01:02:07.369" style="s2">know how to feel stop right yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.979" end="01:02:10.190" style="s2">it can I mean you might be that people</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.369" end="01:02:11.839" style="s2">trust part of their experience more and</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.190" end="01:02:16.400" style="s2">they know them particularly unbolted</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.839" end="01:02:19.369" style="s2">experience they know it&#39;s got meaning um</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.400" end="01:02:21.380" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not just incidental and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.369" end="01:02:24.319" style="s2">think their experience of time expands</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.380" end="01:02:25.940" style="s2">right yeah and they go that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.319" end="01:02:28.849" style="s2">thing that is really crucial in Dante is</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.940" end="01:02:31.009" style="s2">that he starts to realize that all the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.849" end="01:02:33.710" style="s2">souls in hell don&#39;t have a present</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.009" end="01:02:37.160" style="s2">moment and they&#39;re fixated on the past</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.710" end="01:02:39.039" style="s2">or the future because it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.160" end="01:02:41.420" style="s2">present moment that change is possible</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.039" end="01:02:43.400" style="s2">which is another thing that&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.420" end="01:02:46.819" style="s2">embedded in spiritual practices of</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.400" end="01:02:48.920" style="s2">course you know the Zen question and</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.819" end="01:02:52.819" style="s2">what is this or something like that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.920" end="01:02:55.549" style="s2">caps on to the present moment so I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.819" end="01:02:58.539" style="s2">time changes I think just the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.549" end="01:03:01.640" style="s2">trust in a life actually as well changes</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.539" end="01:03:05.509" style="s2">that people are prepared to they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.640" end="01:03:08.119" style="s2">they&#39;re more they&#39;re more able to dis</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.509" end="01:03:10.130" style="s2">identify with a narrow sense of self and</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.119" end="01:03:14.150" style="s2">identify with the wider sense of flow in</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.130" end="01:03:22.789" style="s2">life for example so that&#39;s an extended</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.150" end="01:03:33.200" style="s2">mind idea I guess so I mean we&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.789" end="01:03:36.589" style="s2">at a time for me to go yeah so you wait</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.200" end="01:03:38.930" style="s2">your truck before we start recording I</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.589" end="01:03:40.640" style="s2">have sort of issues with the idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.930" end="01:03:42.140" style="s2">use of the term intelligence here</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.640" end="01:03:44.749" style="s2">although I I think you&#39;re trying to use</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.140" end="01:03:47.450" style="s2">it the way the plane is used in</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.749" end="01:03:49.180" style="s2">collection which is a very different</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.450" end="01:03:52.059" style="s2">thing for my modern meaning</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.180" end="01:03:55.940" style="s2">I&#39;m not very happy with them that</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.059" end="01:03:58.039" style="s2">terminology which is not to say again</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.940" end="01:04:00.799" style="s2">that I&#39;m disputing the phenomenon of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.039" end="01:04:04.069" style="s2">year referring to and so but it is is it</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.799" end="01:04:08.630" style="s2">what is the capacity for undergoing this</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.069" end="01:04:12.589" style="s2">is the capacity for I don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.630" end="01:04:15.109" style="s2">doing it participating right this moment</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.589" end="01:04:18.289" style="s2">of transition where you move into an</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.109" end="01:04:20.719" style="s2">agog it and things are opened up is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.289" end="01:04:22.249" style="s2">is the capacity you&#39;re trying to put</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.719" end="01:04:23.569" style="s2">your finger on with the term spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.249" end="01:04:27.650" style="s2">intelligence is that what you&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.569" end="01:04:31.190" style="s2">your finger on with that term you know I</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.650" end="01:04:39.019" style="s2">think I think it would be one way into a</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.190" end="01:04:41.599" style="s2">kind of cluster of elements say that</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.019" end="01:04:43.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve you&#39;ve you say you come across</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.599" end="01:04:44.809" style="s2">routinely in figures like a scientist so</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.640" end="01:04:47.959" style="s2">for example you know another one would</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.809" end="01:04:49.670" style="s2">be simplicity and and one thing that one</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.959" end="01:04:52.430" style="s2">thing that the the topological the</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.670" end="01:04:55.369" style="s2">cannot ik moves into when it moves into</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.430" end="01:05:00.369" style="s2">the am agog occurs also what the x would</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.369" end="01:05:03.319" style="s2">call simplicity and that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.369" end="01:05:05.719" style="s2">breaking down into parts it&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.319" end="01:05:08.719" style="s2">the opposite and where the whole has a</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.719" end="01:05:10.880" style="s2">kind of cogent see and that can be seen</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.719" end="01:05:14.420" style="s2">now can be experienced I mean if they</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.880" end="01:05:17.779" style="s2">kind of say the ecology of the cosmos</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.420" end="01:05:19.219" style="s2">might be able to be perceived the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.779" end="01:05:21.849" style="s2">experience you know in other way pretty</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.219" end="01:05:26.989" style="s2">would be subspecies its own its artists</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.849" end="01:05:29.930" style="s2">you know a timeless view of the moving</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.989" end="01:05:32.199" style="s2">images of eternity you know as Blake</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.930" end="01:05:34.219" style="s2">puts their I love Blake&#39;s for expression</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.199" end="01:05:36.650" style="s2">eternities in love with the productions</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.219" end="01:05:39.529" style="s2">of time you know knowing what that</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.650" end="01:05:41.660" style="s2">really is about so there&#39;ll be the Trop</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.529" end="01:05:45.380" style="s2">illogical would certainly be part of it</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.660" end="01:05:48.729" style="s2">but and I think the idea of a unity a</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.380" end="01:05:50.989" style="s2">simplicity would be really important</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.729" end="01:05:53.799" style="s2">which again you know that they have</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.989" end="01:05:57.589" style="s2">their parallels in spiritual practices</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.799" end="01:06:00.440" style="s2">they you know the in the non-dual sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.589" end="01:06:02.460" style="s2">of decided the turnover of thoughts and</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.440" end="01:06:04.380" style="s2">becoming more identified with</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.460" end="01:06:07.680" style="s2">and the awareness itself the presents</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.380" end="01:06:12.030" style="s2">itself you know I think that there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.680" end="01:06:13.650" style="s2">it&#39;s that kind of cluster and that word</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.030" end="01:06:15.480" style="s2">the phrase spiritual intelligence which</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.650" end="01:06:17.339" style="s2">I agree with you is I mean it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.480" end="01:06:18.690" style="s2">used because there&#39;s artificial</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.339" end="01:06:20.849" style="s2">intelligence though it&#39;s just a foreign</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.690" end="01:06:23.040" style="s2">suggests which run a tease something out</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.849" end="01:06:24.960" style="s2">here you know there may be as in</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.040" end="01:06:28.400" style="s2">captured certainly by regular</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.960" end="01:06:34.020" style="s2">problem-solving artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.400" end="01:06:36.450" style="s2">in that state because a lot of courses</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.020" end="01:06:40.140" style="s2">you know Spinoza especially the like</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.450" end="01:06:43.170" style="s2">version that you just quoted thanks for</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.140" end="01:06:46.109" style="s2">L ative to Co determining with you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.170" end="01:06:48.119" style="s2">scanty Intuit Eva which is again this</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.109" end="01:06:49.290" style="s2">because the simplicity is you said it</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.119" end="01:06:55.830" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean homogeneity</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.290" end="01:06:58.109" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean singularity because you</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.830" end="01:07:00.420" style="s2">know the one is also you know the</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.109" end="01:07:03.260" style="s2">pregnancy for all of the forearms and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.420" end="01:07:08.099" style="s2">for all of the extension right</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.260" end="01:07:10.710" style="s2">and so it&#39;s one yeah it&#39;s getting to</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.099" end="01:07:11.820" style="s2">denote crushed nor there&#39;s a lot of goes</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.710" end="01:07:15.210" style="s2">back to what we&#39;re saying about this way</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.820" end="01:07:17.460" style="s2">of seeing in which you know each part</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.210" end="01:07:21.869" style="s2">you see the whole in each part and you</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.460" end="01:07:23.720" style="s2">see right the part in terms of both both</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.869" end="01:07:27.330" style="s2">like there&#39;s complete there&#39;s a complete</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.720" end="01:07:30.060" style="s2">interpenetration of the parts and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.330" end="01:07:32.640" style="s2">whole I mean that&#39;s what it is in</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.060" end="01:07:35.339" style="s2">Spinoza and again it&#39;s comes back to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.640" end="01:07:36.390" style="s2">new way you&#39;re reading the ethics and</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.339" end="01:07:38.280" style="s2">it&#39;s very tempting because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.390" end="01:07:39.930" style="s2">reading your here&#39;s a theorem and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.280" end="01:07:41.970" style="s2">an act and you&#39;re reading through all</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.930" end="01:07:45.060" style="s2">this argument and you just get caught up</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.970" end="01:07:48.450" style="s2">in the sequential sequence and but what</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.060" end="01:07:50.580" style="s2">happens is you get to a moment where you</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.450" end="01:07:52.320" style="s2">get it like you you see and then you see</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.580" end="01:07:54.000" style="s2">each premise in terms of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.320" end="01:07:56.460" style="s2">argument and then you see the full</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.000" end="01:07:58.800" style="s2">argument right impregnating each premise</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.460" end="01:08:01.770" style="s2">and and you get to enter into atiba and</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.800" end="01:08:03.210" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s more work for those is</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.770" end="01:08:05.520" style="s2">after than any of the particulars</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.210" end="01:08:07.320" style="s2">inclusions on keep something you get</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.520" end="01:08:11.460" style="s2">that moment and it&#39;s like it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.320" end="01:08:15.299" style="s2">really powerful moment um and so I I</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.460" end="01:08:16.949" style="s2">think I mean I&#39;m very interested in that</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.299" end="01:08:18.809" style="s2">sorry that means in selling a specimen I</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.949" end="01:08:20.609" style="s2">don&#39;t mean it that way at all right hi I</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.809" end="01:08:21.329" style="s2">am interested in the cognitive scientist</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.609" end="01:08:24.269" style="s2">but I&#39;m also good</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.329" end="01:08:27.539" style="s2">I&#39;m deeply I do Sophie I&#39;m deeply in</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.269" end="01:08:29.369" style="s2">love with what is it but is the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.539" end="01:08:31.469" style="s2">within us and the capacity the</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.369" end="01:08:33.569" style="s2">corresponding capacity and being that</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.469" end="01:08:34.380" style="s2">affords this that makes this possible</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.569" end="01:08:36.210" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.380" end="01:08:38.789" style="s2">that&#39;s question I keep circling back to</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.210" end="01:08:40.529" style="s2">again and again and again and again and</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.789" end="01:08:43.889" style="s2">again not in thought but how to like</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.529" end="01:08:46.619" style="s2">what are the practices that go with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.889" end="01:08:49.650" style="s2">thoughts that make this that make me</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.619" end="01:08:51.150" style="s2">sensitive to their supporters yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.650" end="01:08:52.589" style="s2">here&#39;s another thought that I wonder how</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.150" end="01:08:54.539" style="s2">fit how it fits in because I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.589" end="01:08:56.400" style="s2">another key thing the spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.539" end="01:08:58.920" style="s2">intelligence for Negreanu expression</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.400" end="01:09:01.130" style="s2">with would say which again comes from</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.920" end="01:09:03.750" style="s2">many different wisdom traditions is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.130" end="01:09:07.559" style="s2">you actually know something better by</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.750" end="01:09:22.559" style="s2">loving it despite of knowing it yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.559" end="01:09:24.029" style="s2">have that then but in terms of you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.559" end="01:09:28.679" style="s2">the experience of that is it means that</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.029" end="01:09:30.809" style="s2">you your stance towards life is one of</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.679" end="01:09:33.359" style="s2">more about noticing and waiting and</p>
