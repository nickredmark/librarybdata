<p begin="00:01:50.350" end="00:01:55.610" style="s2">just because it means he&#39;s got a stand</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.729" end="00:01:58.400" style="s2">up the whole time and it&#39;ll slow down</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.610" end="00:02:00.530" style="s2">the flow but he is very happy to be</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.280" end="00:02:19.310" style="s2">doing that during the dedication because</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.640" end="00:02:21.080" style="s2">it&#39;ll really slow everything down I</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.310" end="00:02:23.690" style="s2">think the three things that you can take</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.690" end="00:02:28.250" style="s2">judge is first of all be inspired by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.730" end="00:02:33.650" style="s2">talk secondly read the book and thirdly</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.250" end="00:02:39.620" style="s2">marry a Canadian I feel rather fortunate</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.650" end="00:02:42.799" style="s2">to have now done all three also if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.620" end="00:02:45.799" style="s2">would like to tweet its hashtag the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.799" end="00:02:47.690" style="s2">rules of twelve rules of life so without</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.799" end="00:02:49.810" style="s2">further ado please welcome one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.690" end="00:02:51.930" style="s2">world&#39;s great public intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.810" end="00:02:55.319" style="s2">Jordan Peterson thank you</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.930" end="00:02:55.319" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.060" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.510" end="00:03:43.950" style="s2">well that was nice so I thought I&#39;d I</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:45.870" style="s2">talk about my book tonight I give him</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.950" end="00:03:47.550" style="s2">two talks now and I didn&#39;t actually talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.870" end="00:03:50.340" style="s2">directly about it I sort of talked</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.550" end="00:03:53.099" style="s2">around it and so I thought I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:55.769" style="s2">to give the same talk twice so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.099" end="00:03:58.410" style="s2">I&#39;d actually walked through it and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.769" end="00:04:00.030" style="s2">and outline it a little bit and so I had</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.410" end="00:04:01.530" style="s2">to spend most of the day memorizing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.030" end="00:04:03.390" style="s2">rules you know you&#39;d think if you worked</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.530" end="00:04:04.739" style="s2">on something for three years or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.390" end="00:04:07.590" style="s2">been five years I guess you&#39;d actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.739" end="00:04:08.880" style="s2">have it memorized but memory is a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.590" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">strange thing and it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.880" end="00:04:13.019" style="s2">particular and goal-oriented and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:14.459" style="s2">actually didn&#39;t have the rules memorized</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.019" end="00:04:16.889" style="s2">and certainly not their numbers so</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.459" end="00:04:18.690" style="s2">hopefully I do by now so I guess we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.889" end="00:04:21.690" style="s2">gonna find out but I have a copy of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.690" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">book here in case I in case I forget so</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.690" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">I think we&#39;ll go through them one by one</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:30.750" style="s2">and we&#39;ll see how see how that goes</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.919" end="00:04:33.450" style="s2">seven o&#39;clock so all right good the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.750" end="00:04:35.789" style="s2">first rule which is kind of a comical</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.450" end="00:04:38.070" style="s2">rule is stand up straight with your</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.789" end="00:04:40.289" style="s2">shoulders back and it&#39;s a meditation</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.070" end="00:04:43.200" style="s2">among other things on the habits of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.289" end="00:04:46.380" style="s2">lobsters I read some papers on lobsters</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.200" end="00:04:48.600" style="s2">well must be ten years ago I guess and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.380" end="00:04:50.130" style="s2">it they just absolutely blew me away and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.600" end="00:04:52.020" style="s2">one of the things I&#39;ve really loved</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.130" end="00:04:53.789" style="s2">about being a psychologist there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.020" end="00:04:55.830" style="s2">things but I&#39;ve really loved</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.789" end="00:04:57.900" style="s2">psychoanalytic theory and and the great</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.830" end="00:05:01.130" style="s2">clinicians the behaviorists as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.900" end="00:05:04.680" style="s2">I mean Freud Jung addler Carl Rogers</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.130" end="00:05:06.419" style="s2">Abraham Maslow that behaviors like</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.680" end="00:05:07.770" style="s2">skinner and and and the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.419" end="00:05:09.419" style="s2">behaviors I mean I&#39;ve learned a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.770" end="00:05:10.950" style="s2">tremendous amount from reading the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.419" end="00:05:13.200" style="s2">clinicians and so if any of you are</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.950" end="00:05:15.900" style="s2">interested in psychology I would really</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.200" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">recommend reading the great clinicians</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.900" end="00:05:20.070" style="s2">because they know they&#39;ve learned so</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:22.470" style="s2">much about life it&#39;s crazy by reading</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.070" end="00:05:24.900" style="s2">them so that&#39;s been fun but then on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.470" end="00:05:26.580" style="s2">entirely other end of the spectrum where</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.900" end="00:05:30.180" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned most about psychology is</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.580" end="00:05:32.909" style="s2">from the really low what would you call</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.180" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">them the really science oriented animal</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.909" end="00:05:36.330" style="s2">behaviors that&#39;s where they would they</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">turned into the neuroscientists right</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.330" end="00:05:38.580" style="s2">they were the animal behaviorist first</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:40.110" style="s2">of all and then they turned into the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.580" end="00:05:41.580" style="s2">neuroscientists I&#39;ve learned a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.110" end="00:05:44.220" style="s2">tremendous amount from them there&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.580" end="00:05:45.750" style="s2">clear thinkers the best of the bunch I</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.220" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">think there&#39;s two of them one named</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.750" end="00:05:49.050" style="s2">Jeffrey gray who wrote a book called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:51.240" style="s2">neural psychology of anxiety which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.050" end="00:05:53.069" style="s2">just a deadly book it&#39;s impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.240" end="00:05:57.090" style="s2">read it takes like six months to read it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.069" end="00:05:58.680" style="s2">because I think he he read like 1,800</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.090" end="00:06:00.389" style="s2">papers to write it or something like</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.680" end="00:06:02.550" style="s2">that and he actually read them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.389" end="00:06:04.379" style="s2">the cool thing and he understood them</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.550" end="00:06:06.090" style="s2">which is really something then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.379" end="00:06:07.229" style="s2">another guy named yakky egg Ceph who</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.090" end="00:06:09.900" style="s2">wrote a book called how affective</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.229" end="00:06:11.460" style="s2">neuroscience which outlines his studies</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.900" end="00:06:14.190" style="s2">for example of rats he was the guy who</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.460" end="00:06:15.780" style="s2">learned that rats laugh if you tickle</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.190" end="00:06:18.389" style="s2">them with the end of a pencil eraser but</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.780" end="00:06:20.129" style="s2">they laugh ultrasonically like bats so</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.389" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">you have to salute you have to slow down</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.129" end="00:06:24.659" style="s2">the ultrasonic vocalizations before you</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:25.800" style="s2">can hear them giggle and you think why</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.659" end="00:06:27.870" style="s2">the hell when you spend your time</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.800" end="00:06:29.969" style="s2">tickling rats with a pencil and making</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.870" end="00:06:31.830" style="s2">them laugh but see what he demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.969" end="00:06:33.810" style="s2">there was that that there was a play</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.830" end="00:06:36.090" style="s2">circuit in mammals that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.810" end="00:06:37.500" style="s2">actual there&#39;s a psycho biological basis</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.090" end="00:06:39.449" style="s2">for rough-and-tumble play for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.500" end="00:06:41.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a bloody big deal you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.449" end="00:06:43.169" style="s2">discovering a whole new circuit in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.279" end="00:06:45.180" style="s2">brain that&#39;s like discovering a</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.169" end="00:06:47.400" style="s2">continent it&#39;s Nobel prize-winning stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.180" end="00:06:49.740" style="s2">and panksepp so effective neuroscience I</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.400" end="00:06:51.210" style="s2">would highly recommend that so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.740" end="00:06:52.680" style="s2">this other book I know about - which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.210" end="00:06:57.180" style="s2">twelve rules for life which you could</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.680" end="00:06:59.310" style="s2">also look into if you want anyways I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.180" end="00:07:03.889" style="s2">reading these these articles on lobsters</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.310" end="00:07:07.139" style="s2">and I came across this this finding that</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.889" end="00:07:10.620" style="s2">lobsters lobsters governed their</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.139" end="00:07:12.330" style="s2">postural flexion with serotonin and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.620" end="00:07:14.460" style="s2">thought god that&#39;s so interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.330" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">so in deflection is this is to stand up</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.460" end="00:07:18.360" style="s2">straight wow that&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.800" end="00:07:19.979" style="s2">because you know depressed people</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.360" end="00:07:22.259" style="s2">crouched over I wonder if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.979" end="00:07:25.020" style="s2">link between those two things and then I</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.259" end="00:07:28.169" style="s2">went and read a whole pile of papers on</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.020" end="00:07:29.460" style="s2">lobster lobster neural chemistry lobster</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.169" end="00:07:30.690" style="s2">neuro chemistry is actually quite well</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.460" end="00:07:33.210" style="s2">understood because they have a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.690" end="00:07:34.830" style="s2">simple nervous system right and so if</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.210" end="00:07:37.169" style="s2">you want to understand a complex nervous</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.830" end="00:07:38.729" style="s2">system it&#39;s a good idea to understand a</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.169" end="00:07:41.180" style="s2">simple one first and then sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.729" end="00:07:46.770" style="s2">elaborate upwards and it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.180" end="00:07:49.229" style="s2">serotonin governs status governs status</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.770" end="00:07:50.139" style="s2">emotional regulation and posture in</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.229" end="00:07:51.969" style="s2">lobsters just</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.139" end="00:07:54.580" style="s2">like it does in human beings and so that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.969" end="00:07:56.770" style="s2">would just blew me away and so one one</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.580" end="00:07:58.539" style="s2">one thing that the chapter one is about</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.770" end="00:08:01.719" style="s2">is the fact that if a lobster is</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.539" end="00:08:03.909" style="s2">defeated in a dominance battle you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.719" end="00:08:06.669" style="s2">give it essentially antidepressants and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.909" end="00:08:08.770" style="s2">it will fight again now that just blew</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.669" end="00:08:10.719" style="s2">me away you know it&#39;s so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.770" end="00:08:12.900" style="s2">remarkable because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.719" end="00:08:18.490" style="s2">that tells you is that so if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.900" end="00:08:20.199" style="s2">imagine that you could be lobster top</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.490" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">dog or bottom dog imagine there&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.199" end="00:08:24.219" style="s2">strata in the lobster hierarchy and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:26.469" style="s2">you could be number one right top</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.219" end="00:08:28.449" style="s2">lobster number ten bottom lobster if</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.469" end="00:08:30.250" style="s2">your bottom Lobster you have low</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.449" end="00:08:31.930" style="s2">serotonin levels than high octopamine</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.250" end="00:08:34.029" style="s2">levels that&#39;s the neurochemical that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.930" end="00:08:36.219" style="s2">human beings don&#39;t produce and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.029" end="00:08:38.229" style="s2">a top lobster you have high serotonin</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.219" end="00:08:41.229" style="s2">levels and lower top amine levels and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.229" end="00:08:43.750" style="s2">you can move a lobster in its dominance</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.229" end="00:08:45.550" style="s2">hierarchy by moderating its levels of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.750" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">serotonin and I thought that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.550" end="00:08:49.029" style="s2">interesting because what it means is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:51.519" style="s2">that the counter that keeps track of our</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.029" end="00:08:52.870" style="s2">status when we have a counter in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.519" end="00:08:55.750" style="s2">in our minds that keeps track of our</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.870" end="00:08:59.500" style="s2">status is a third of a billion years old</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.750" end="00:09:01.810" style="s2">and what that also means is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.500" end="00:09:03.790" style="s2">idea of the hierarchy let&#39;s call it a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.810" end="00:09:05.350" style="s2">dominance hierarchy because it within</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.790" end="00:09:07.120" style="s2">lobsters it&#39;s kind of like a physical</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.350" end="00:09:09.220" style="s2">prowess hierarchy something like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.120" end="00:09:12.370" style="s2">the idea of the hierarchy is at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.220" end="00:09:14.920" style="s2">350 million years old and so I read that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.370" end="00:09:17.170" style="s2">and I think well so much for the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.920" end="00:09:19.240" style="s2">that human hierarchies are a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.170" end="00:09:22.149" style="s2">socio-cultural construct it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.240" end="00:09:24.699" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong it&#39;s not just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.149" end="00:09:28.410" style="s2">wrong it&#39;s unbelievably wrong it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.699" end="00:09:31.899" style="s2">mind-boggling ly wrong right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.410" end="00:09:33.370" style="s2">right and so so hierarchies hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.899" end="00:09:35.140" style="s2">have been around for a third of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.370" end="00:09:37.720" style="s2">billion years and and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.140" end="00:09:40.510" style="s2">neurochemical system that modulates our</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.720" end="00:09:41.649" style="s2">our understanding of those hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.510" end="00:09:42.850" style="s2">and then also and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.649" end="00:09:44.620" style="s2">interesting thing too and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.850" end="00:09:46.660" style="s2">people&#39;s reputations are so important to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.620" end="00:09:50.260" style="s2">them among there&#39;s lots of reasons but</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.660" end="00:09:52.449" style="s2">this is one of them is that where this</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.260" end="00:09:55.089" style="s2">counter that you share with lobsters</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.449" end="00:09:57.640" style="s2">rates you in terms of your hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.089" end="00:09:59.589" style="s2">position determines the ratio of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.640" end="00:10:01.720" style="s2">negative emotion to positive emotion</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.589" end="00:10:03.550" style="s2">that you feel and that&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.720" end="00:10:06.010" style="s2">absolutely mind-boggling</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.550" end="00:10:07.810" style="s2">idea for two reasons one is it tells you</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.010" end="00:10:10.600" style="s2">why it&#39;s so hard on people to be put</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.810" end="00:10:13.090" style="s2">down because it doesn&#39;t just upset them</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.600" end="00:10:15.460" style="s2">in the moment it changes the way their</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.090" end="00:10:16.960" style="s2">entire system responds to the world so</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.460" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">that they now experience more positive</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.960" end="00:10:20.170" style="s2">emotion and less than eight less</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:23.020" style="s2">negative emotion so that&#39;s really rough</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.170" end="00:10:25.840" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a corollary to that too</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.020" end="00:10:27.850" style="s2">which is like there&#39;s a very tight</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.840" end="00:10:29.380" style="s2">relationship between your belief system</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.850" end="00:10:31.030" style="s2">and your dominance hierarchy position</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.380" end="00:10:33.790" style="s2">it&#39;s complicated but it&#39;s worth going</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.030" end="00:10:35.800" style="s2">through like let&#39;s say that so I have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.790" end="00:10:39.870" style="s2">certain amount of status as a professor</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.800" end="00:10:42.310" style="s2">and and and I have the let&#39;s call it the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.870" end="00:10:44.170" style="s2">what would you say I&#39;ve been granted the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.310" end="00:10:46.420" style="s2">entitlement to a certain position in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.170" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">in a social hierarchy now the question</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.420" end="00:10:51.310" style="s2">is why do I have a valid claim to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:53.230" style="s2">position and the answer hypothetically</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.310" end="00:10:55.330" style="s2">is because I know enough so that my</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.230" end="00:10:56.890" style="s2">claim to the position is valid so then</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.330" end="00:10:59.110" style="s2">if you stand up in the audience and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.890" end="00:11:01.030" style="s2">challenge my beliefs and show that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.110" end="00:11:02.860" style="s2">wrong you might you might say well I get</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.030" end="00:11:04.780" style="s2">upset because I&#39;m wrong but the more</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.860" end="00:11:06.610" style="s2">accurate reason that I get upset is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.780" end="00:11:09.670" style="s2">because you&#39;re indicating to the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.610" end="00:11:12.280" style="s2">that my my position in the hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.670" end="00:11:13.900" style="s2">authority is invalid and by doing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.280" end="00:11:15.310" style="s2">you lower me in the hierarchy and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.900" end="00:11:17.500" style="s2">mess around with the neurochemical</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.310" end="00:11:19.900" style="s2">systems that are regulating my emotions</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.500" end="00:11:22.690" style="s2">and so if you&#39;re interested at least in</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.900" end="00:11:24.790" style="s2">part in why people are so prone to</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.690" end="00:11:26.950" style="s2">defend themselves and their beliefs in</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.790" end="00:11:28.960" style="s2">the service of their position then</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.950" end="00:11:31.270" style="s2">that&#39;s why and so that&#39;s a great example</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.960" end="00:11:32.980" style="s2">of how you can learn these unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.270" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">things by stumbling across a rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.980" end="00:11:37.870" style="s2">obscure biological fact it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:40.420" style="s2">just what would you say it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.870" end="00:11:42.310" style="s2">it&#39;s like a series of dominoes and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.420" end="00:11:44.500" style="s2">that&#39;s also why biological facts are so</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.310" end="00:11:47.200" style="s2">useful it&#39;s like we don&#39;t have to argue</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.500" end="00:11:48.670" style="s2">about whether or not haha social</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.200" end="00:11:50.980" style="s2">hierarchies as I said or or or</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.670" end="00:11:53.740" style="s2">hierarchies are social constructs a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.980" end="00:11:56.470" style="s2">given hierarchy is influenced in its</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.740" end="00:11:58.420" style="s2">structure by socio cultural conditioning</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.470" end="00:12:00.280" style="s2">let&#39;s say but the fact of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.420" end="00:12:03.160" style="s2">so like the part of your brain that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.280" end="00:12:04.810" style="s2">detects and regulates your response to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.160" end="00:12:07.390" style="s2">hierarchies is older than the part of</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.810" end="00:12:09.880" style="s2">your brain that recognizes trees like</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.390" end="00:12:12.430" style="s2">it&#39;s old it&#39;s really really fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.880" end="00:12:13.930" style="s2">and so and almost all social animals</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.430" end="00:12:16.690" style="s2">organize themselves and social in</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.930" end="00:12:17.450" style="s2">hierarchies because now the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.690" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">that chapter one</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.450" end="00:12:20.870" style="s2">is a bit of a meditation on what might</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:22.850" style="s2">constitute a hierarchy one of my</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.870" end="00:12:24.650" style="s2">business colleagues a former student of</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.850" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">mine from Harvard very very smart guy</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.650" end="00:12:29.150" style="s2">it&#39;s got a graduate degree in</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.720" end="00:12:30.530" style="s2">engineering from MIT and a PhD in</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.150" end="00:12:32.450" style="s2">psychology from Harvard so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.530" end="00:12:35.180" style="s2">one of him in the whole world and he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.450" end="00:12:37.010" style="s2">very smart guy and he helped me design</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.180" end="00:12:38.510" style="s2">the self authoring suite by the way and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.010" end="00:12:41.240" style="s2">he&#39;s been working for about 20 years on</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.510" end="00:12:42.680" style="s2">that that&#39;s the suite of programs that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.240" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">helps people write about their lives and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.680" end="00:12:46.400" style="s2">straighten them out he told me to stop</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:48.500" style="s2">using the word dominance hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.400" end="00:12:50.050" style="s2">he said the reason for that was that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.500" end="00:12:52.160" style="s2">was infested with Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.050" end="00:12:53.390" style="s2">presuppositions and it really bothered</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:55.250" style="s2">me when he first said that because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.390" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">been using the word for years dominance</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.250" end="00:12:58.730" style="s2">hierarchy he said we had a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.200" end="00:13:00.530" style="s2">about that he said well it&#39;s predicated</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.730" end="00:13:02.510" style="s2">on the idea that you climb up the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.530" end="00:13:04.100" style="s2">hierarchy human hierarchy as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.510" end="00:13:05.930" style="s2">consequence of the expression of power</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.100" end="00:13:08.030" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s wrong you climb up</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.930" end="00:13:10.370" style="s2">valid hierarchies as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.030" end="00:13:11.750" style="s2">the expression of competence and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.370" end="00:13:13.280" style="s2">actually technically right he was</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.750" end="00:13:14.990" style="s2">exactly the right person to tell me that</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.280" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">because he had done his PhD on what</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.990" end="00:13:20.150" style="s2">predicts success in Western hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:22.190" style="s2">and the answer is quite clear general</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.150" end="00:13:23.630" style="s2">cognitive ability some prefrontal</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.190" end="00:13:26.570" style="s2">ability as well which was what he</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.630" end="00:13:28.610" style="s2">specifically tested so intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.570" end="00:13:30.080" style="s2">roughly speaking although it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.610" end="00:13:31.490" style="s2">bit more elaborate than intelligence but</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.080" end="00:13:33.860" style="s2">that&#39;s close enough and trait</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.490" end="00:13:35.300" style="s2">conscientiousness accounts for about 50</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.860" end="00:13:37.610" style="s2">percent of the variance in long term</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.300" end="00:13:39.920" style="s2">success and you think well hey how do</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.610" end="00:13:41.750" style="s2">you want your society be structured it</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.920" end="00:13:44.180" style="s2">seems pretty good to me that smart</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.750" end="00:13:45.860" style="s2">hardworking people are the ones most</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.180" end="00:13:47.690" style="s2">likely to succeed that&#39;s not a bad</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.860" end="00:13:50.060" style="s2">empirical test of the validity of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.690" end="00:13:52.220" style="s2">structure now especially given how much</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.060" end="00:13:54.050" style="s2">vagary there is in life lots of random</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.220" end="00:13:55.400" style="s2">things happen to people but it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.050" end="00:13:57.830" style="s2">to be born three standard deviations</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.400" end="00:13:59.210" style="s2">above the mean in intelligence in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.830" end="00:14:00.860" style="s2">West than it is to be born three</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.210" end="00:14:03.770" style="s2">standard deviations above the mean in</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.860" end="00:14:06.590" style="s2">wealth in relationship to where you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.770" end="00:14:08.210" style="s2">end up when you&#39;re 40 so he said to use</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.590" end="00:14:09.560" style="s2">the word competence hierarchy or we</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.210" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">decided that and I think that&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.560" end="00:14:13.430" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:15.050" style="s2">so chapter one as a bit of a meditation</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.430" end="00:14:16.790" style="s2">on the nature of hierarchies and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.050" end="00:14:18.980" style="s2">biochemistry of hierarchy but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.790" end="00:14:22.610" style="s2">an injunction about how to present</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.980" end="00:14:24.470" style="s2">yourself because you don&#39;t you want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.610" end="00:14:28.280" style="s2">present yourself to the world in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.470" end="00:14:29.810" style="s2">manner that that doesn&#39;t disgrace you in</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.280" end="00:14:30.810" style="s2">some sense that that might be a good way</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.810" end="00:14:32.010" style="s2">to think about it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.810" end="00:14:33.690" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to disgrace yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.010" end="00:14:36.060" style="s2">because the consequence of disgrace is</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.690" end="00:14:39.000" style="s2">its emotional dysregulation more pain</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.060" end="00:14:41.090" style="s2">less positive emotion and so the best</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.000" end="00:14:43.830" style="s2">way to present yourself is to stand up</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.090" end="00:14:47.130" style="s2">forthrightly and to stretch out you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.830" end="00:14:48.930" style="s2">and to occupy some space and to to to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.130" end="00:14:50.130" style="s2">you make yourself sort of vulnerable by</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.930" end="00:14:51.960" style="s2">doing that because you open up the front</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.130" end="00:14:54.300" style="s2">of your body right but it&#39;s a sign of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.960" end="00:14:56.310" style="s2">confidence and that way people are most</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.300" end="00:14:58.650" style="s2">likely to give you the benefit of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.310" end="00:15:00.510" style="s2">doubt and that&#39;s a good way to start</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.650" end="00:15:02.279" style="s2">regulating your mood but not only does</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.510" end="00:15:04.850" style="s2">it directly regulate your mood to stand</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.279" end="00:15:07.230" style="s2">up because it&#39;s so tightly associated</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.850" end="00:15:08.640" style="s2">like posture reflection is associated</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.230" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">with serotonin and emotional regulation</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.640" end="00:15:14.279" style="s2">but also because if you straighten up</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:16.080" style="s2">and you present yourself in that manner</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.279" end="00:15:18.180" style="s2">then other people are more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.080" end="00:15:19.560" style="s2">take you seriously and that means</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.180" end="00:15:21.420" style="s2">they&#39;ll start treating you as if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.560" end="00:15:23.310" style="s2">a number one lobster instead of a number</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.420" end="00:15:25.770" style="s2">ten lobster and that&#39;s another way that</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.310" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">you can at least give yourself the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.770" end="00:15:31.080" style="s2">bloody benefit of the doubt right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:32.790" style="s2">and and and and and and confront the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.080" end="00:15:36.540" style="s2">world in a courageous manner and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.790" end="00:15:38.370" style="s2">a really good way of also of of figuring</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.540" end="00:15:39.990" style="s2">out how to establish yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.370" end="00:15:42.300" style="s2">multiple competence hierarchies because</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.990" end="00:15:45.270" style="s2">one of the general rules of thumb about</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.300" end="00:15:47.010" style="s2">how to be successful is to confront</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.270" end="00:15:49.200" style="s2">things that frighten you forthrightly</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.010" end="00:15:51.810" style="s2">and with courage and that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.200" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">universal strategy for success and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.810" end="00:15:55.560" style="s2">that&#39;s what the first chapter is about</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:57.600" style="s2">so that&#39;s quite fun my graduate students</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.560" end="00:15:58.950" style="s2">I told them these lobsters stories a my</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.600" end="00:16:00.420" style="s2">graduate students when we used to go out</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.950" end="00:16:02.220" style="s2">for breakfast and they were very</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.420" end="00:16:04.290" style="s2">competitive Bunch very fractious and</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.220" end="00:16:06.060" style="s2">witty and they were always trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.290" end="00:16:07.980" style="s2">one over on each other a hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.060" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">some witty put down or something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.980" end="00:16:11.250" style="s2">that and it got to the point in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:13.110" style="s2">restaurants where they put their claws</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.250" end="00:16:14.940" style="s2">in the urns click like this when they</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.110" end="00:16:16.830" style="s2">you know got one over on one of their</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.940" end="00:16:20.700" style="s2">colleagues which was very peculiar and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.830" end="00:16:24.360" style="s2">strange and very funny as well so so</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.700" end="00:16:28.860" style="s2">that&#39;s rule number one rule number two</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.360" end="00:16:31.650" style="s2">is uh treat yourself like you&#39;re someone</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.860" end="00:16:33.779" style="s2">that you care about and that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.650" end="00:16:35.790" style="s2">deeper chapter I would say like chapter</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.779" end="00:16:38.100" style="s2">one is kind of comical but it&#39;s also got</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.790" end="00:16:39.570" style="s2">this serious scientific end for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.100" end="00:16:40.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s practical like most of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.570" end="00:16:42.490" style="s2">rules are</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.120" end="00:16:45.640" style="s2">chapter 2 is a bit of a meditation on</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.490" end="00:16:48.580" style="s2">why see I read this I read this site</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.640" end="00:16:51.460" style="s2">this piece of work by Jung a long while</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.580" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">back and it was a meditation on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.460" end="00:16:55.330" style="s2">injunction to treat your neighbor as as</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:56.890" style="s2">you would like to be treated</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.330" end="00:16:58.420" style="s2">something like that and what Jung</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.890" end="00:17:00.070" style="s2">pointed out which I really liked was</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.420" end="00:17:02.380" style="s2">that that wasn&#39;t an injunction to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.070" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">nice to other people it was an</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.380" end="00:17:06.339" style="s2">invitation to reciprocity it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:07.990" style="s2">something like this is like you should</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.339" end="00:17:10.300" style="s2">figure out how you would like to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.990" end="00:17:11.920" style="s2">treated like you were taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.300" end="00:17:13.689" style="s2">yourself not how you would like people</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.920" end="00:17:14.679" style="s2">to respond to you it&#39;s more important</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.689" end="00:17:16.230" style="s2">than that it&#39;s like imagine you had a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.679" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">child that you really cared for and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.230" end="00:17:22.780" style="s2">someone said well people will treat this</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:24.490" style="s2">child exactly like you want them to but</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.780" end="00:17:25.780" style="s2">you have to figure out what that is and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.490" end="00:17:27.640" style="s2">so then you&#39;d have to sit down for like</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.780" end="00:17:28.900" style="s2">a month and you think okay well how do</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.640" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">you want your child to be treated you</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.900" end="00:17:31.450" style="s2">don&#39;t want everyone just to be nice to</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:32.920" style="s2">him you know you want people to</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.450" end="00:17:34.510" style="s2">challenge them and you want people to</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.920" end="00:17:36.280" style="s2">discipline them and you want people to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.510" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">tell him when he&#39;s wrong it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.280" end="00:17:39.429" style="s2">don&#39;t just want everyone to be nice</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:41.830" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s pathetic it&#39;s pathetic</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.429" end="00:17:45.130" style="s2">isn&#39;t there&#39;s no challenge in that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.830" end="00:17:46.809" style="s2">so well you want to treat other people</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.130" end="00:17:47.800" style="s2">like you would like to be treated well</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.809" end="00:17:49.900" style="s2">then you have to figure out how would</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.800" end="00:17:51.309" style="s2">you like to be treated and while you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.900" end="00:17:52.840" style="s2">like people to fawn all over you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.309" end="00:17:54.820" style="s2">just lay everything at your feet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.840" end="00:17:56.230" style="s2">like no that&#39;s that&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.820" end="00:17:58.570" style="s2">you&#39;d wish for for someone that you were</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.230" end="00:18:00.820" style="s2">taking care of and then then there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.570" end="00:18:02.140" style="s2">additional problem which is it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.820" end="00:18:03.880" style="s2">the case that people will treat other</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.140" end="00:18:07.450" style="s2">people better than they treat themselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.880" end="00:18:08.980" style="s2">that happens extremely frequently so one</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.450" end="00:18:11.530" style="s2">of the things I pointed out chapter 2</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.980" end="00:18:13.570" style="s2">was that if you have a dog and you take</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.530" end="00:18:15.580" style="s2">him to a vet and the vet gives you your</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.570" end="00:18:17.530" style="s2">prescription medicine you&#39;ll go buy the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.580" end="00:18:19.900" style="s2">medicine and you will give it to the dog</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.530" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">and you will do it properly but if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.900" end="00:18:24.490" style="s2">go yourself to a doctor and you get a</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:26.110" style="s2">prescription there&#39;s one that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.490" end="00:18:29.020" style="s2">30% chance you won&#39;t even pick up the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.110" end="00:18:30.460" style="s2">medication and if you do there&#39;s a 50%</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.020" end="00:18:32.980" style="s2">chance that you won&#39;t administer it to</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.460" end="00:18:34.210" style="s2">yourself properly and so I really</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.980" end="00:18:35.770" style="s2">thought about that when I first came</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.210" end="00:18:37.090" style="s2">across that statistic it really it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.770" end="00:18:38.650" style="s2">another one of those little facts I</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.090" end="00:18:40.900" style="s2">thought what the hell&#39;s up with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.650" end="00:18:43.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;ll do it for your dog</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.900" end="00:18:45.820" style="s2">so obviously you&#39;ll do it for something</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.480" end="00:18:47.920" style="s2">you care about and you&#39;re conscientious</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.820" end="00:18:49.929" style="s2">enough so you&#39;ll actually do it so like</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.920" end="00:18:51.950" style="s2">why wouldn&#39;t you do it for you your dog</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.929" end="00:18:53.570" style="s2">likes you you know even your dog would</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.950" end="00:18:55.909" style="s2">rather that you did but but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.570" end="00:18:57.049" style="s2">you don&#39;t and and it&#39;s it&#39;s actually one</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.909" end="00:18:58.970" style="s2">of the reasons that modern medicine</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.049" end="00:19:00.289" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work nearly as well as it could</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.970" end="00:19:02.179" style="s2">because people just don&#39;t take their</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.289" end="00:19:03.409" style="s2">medication and it&#39;s not only because</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.179" end="00:19:05.659" style="s2">they don&#39;t take care of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.409" end="00:19:07.490" style="s2">there&#39;s some skepticism about doctors</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.659" end="00:19:10.789" style="s2">but you could be just as skeptical about</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.490" end="00:19:12.649" style="s2">the vet so it&#39;s a deep meditation I</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.789" end="00:19:14.510" style="s2">would say and it&#39;s what I&#39;ve done with</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.649" end="00:19:15.919" style="s2">these rules is they&#39;re very simple rules</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.510" end="00:19:17.750" style="s2">and they&#39;re kind of comical and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.919" end="00:19:19.850" style="s2">tongue-in-cheek in some ways but what</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.750" end="00:19:22.429" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to do is like pull them apart</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.850" end="00:19:24.529" style="s2">and show what&#39;s underneath them and to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.429" end="00:19:26.659" style="s2">go down as deep as I possibly can and in</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.529" end="00:19:29.240" style="s2">rural too it&#39;s a bit of a meditation on</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.659" end="00:19:31.610" style="s2">why people don&#39;t like themselves very</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.240" end="00:19:33.799" style="s2">much and I think there&#39;s two reasons</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.610" end="00:19:37.039" style="s2">really and one is that we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.799" end="00:19:39.549" style="s2">fragile and damageable and imperfect in</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.039" end="00:19:42.200" style="s2">multiple dimensions all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.549" end="00:19:43.730" style="s2">that often just gets worse it gets lots</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.200" end="00:19:45.710" style="s2">of things get worse as you get old for</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.730" end="00:19:48.620" style="s2">example so it&#39;s not necessarily that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.710" end="00:19:50.990" style="s2">easy for a self-conscious being who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.620" end="00:19:55.419" style="s2">extraordinarily aware of his or her own</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.990" end="00:19:58.130" style="s2">fragility and but not just fragility um</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.419" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">foolishness and errors his like you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.130" end="00:20:01.789" style="s2">yourself better than anyone else knows</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:04.130" style="s2">you and you know you you might have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.789" end="00:20:05.269" style="s2">certain amount of dislike for someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.130" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">you know because of something they did</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.269" end="00:20:09.649" style="s2">but you know everything you did Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:11.389" style="s2">that&#39;s a drag man you know you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.649" end="00:20:13.669" style="s2">carry that along behind like really I</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.389" end="00:20:16.010" style="s2">did that you know and then so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.669" end="00:20:18.080" style="s2">that it&#39;s like you&#39;re you&#39;re weak and</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.010" end="00:20:20.600" style="s2">kind of useless and prone to temptation</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.080" end="00:20:22.039" style="s2">and you know all those things you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.600" end="00:20:23.929" style="s2">that just shouldn&#39;t be that way and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.039" end="00:20:26.269" style="s2">you&#39;re also capable of pretty vicious</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.929" end="00:20:28.250" style="s2">acts of malevolence and so you also know</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.269" end="00:20:30.139" style="s2">that about yourself and so it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.250" end="00:20:31.940" style="s2">existential question for people&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.139" end="00:20:33.830" style="s2">why the hell should you take care of</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.940" end="00:20:36.019" style="s2">something as sorry and wretched as you</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.830" end="00:20:37.850" style="s2">are and that&#39;s really what the chapter</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.019" end="00:20:39.409" style="s2">is about it&#39;s because the answer in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.850" end="00:20:41.269" style="s2">chapter is yeah yeah yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.409" end="00:20:43.070" style="s2">you&#39;re first of all yes you&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.269" end="00:20:44.929" style="s2">useless and terrible but so is everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.070" end="00:20:47.149" style="s2">else and that&#39;s actually an existential</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.929" end="00:20:49.010" style="s2">problem right and what I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.149" end="00:20:51.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a problem that every human being</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.010" end="00:20:53.929" style="s2">has always had and always will so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.620" end="00:20:56.510" style="s2">not just you it&#39;s a universal problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.929" end="00:20:59.299" style="s2">and that there&#39;s there&#39;s an answer to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.510" end="00:21:01.190" style="s2">that and one of them is to what is it to</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.299" end="00:21:03.260" style="s2">say love the sinner but hate the sin</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.190" end="00:21:04.639" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that is that despite</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.260" end="00:21:05.540" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;re not all that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.639" end="00:21:07.309" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.540" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">the proper attitude to have towards</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.309" end="00:21:10.820" style="s2">yourself is the attitude that you would</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:13.520" style="s2">have towards someone that you genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.820" end="00:21:15.500" style="s2">cared for and that it&#39;s incumbent on you</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.520" end="00:21:18.799" style="s2">to act as if you genuinely care for</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.500" end="00:21:20.179" style="s2">yourself just like you would act towards</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.799" end="00:21:22.190" style="s2">someone that you actually cared about</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.179" end="00:21:23.960" style="s2">some other person and so it&#39;s a reversal</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.190" end="00:21:27.080" style="s2">in some sense of the golden rule right</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.960" end="00:21:29.210" style="s2">and and it&#39;s a discussion of why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.080" end="00:21:31.850" style="s2">necessary and also more than that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.210" end="00:21:34.160" style="s2">discussion of why why you have a moral</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.850" end="00:21:35.330" style="s2">obligation to do that it&#39;s not just that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.160" end="00:21:36.710" style="s2">you should because it would be better</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.330" end="00:21:38.299" style="s2">for you it&#39;s you actually have a moral</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.710" end="00:21:40.040" style="s2">obligation to do that I think because</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.299" end="00:21:42.260" style="s2">you make the world a much better place</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.040" end="00:21:44.390" style="s2">it much worse place if you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.260" end="00:21:45.799" style="s2">care of yourself so you should bloody</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.390" end="00:21:48.770" style="s2">well take care of yourself you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.799" end="00:21:50.660" style="s2">because well that&#39;s what the chapters</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.770" end="00:21:52.010" style="s2">about it&#39;s partly because you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.660" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">something valuable to bring into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.010" end="00:21:56.059" style="s2">world that&#39;s the thing about being an</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:21:57.919" style="s2">individual it&#39;s the thing that Western</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.059" end="00:22:00.440" style="s2">civilization has always recognized that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.919" end="00:22:02.179" style="s2">as an individual you have a light that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.440" end="00:22:03.320" style="s2">you have to bring into the world and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.179" end="00:22:05.330" style="s2">that if you don&#39;t bring it into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.320" end="00:22:07.010" style="s2">world the world is a dimmer place and</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.330" end="00:22:08.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a bad thing because when the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.010" end="00:22:13.240" style="s2">world is a dim place it can get very</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:13.240" style="s2">very very dark and so it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:17.900" style="s2">number one lobster now none of those</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.950" end="00:22:19.370" style="s2">things you need to take care of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.900" end="00:22:21.500" style="s2">because you&#39;re in the best position to</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.370" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">do that and it&#39;s necessary for you to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.500" end="00:22:25.880" style="s2">take care of yourself despite the fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:27.890" style="s2">that we&#39;re mortal and vulnerable and</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.880" end="00:22:29.720" style="s2">self-conscious and capable not only</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.890" end="00:22:32.330" style="s2">capable of doing terrible things but</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.720" end="00:22:34.250" style="s2">actually do them despite all that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.330" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">you&#39;re still you still have that</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.250" end="00:22:39.410" style="s2">responsibility and so I wanted to you</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:41.179" style="s2">know hit the question as hard as I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.410" end="00:22:44.090" style="s2">to try to figure out well why people are</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.179" end="00:22:46.100" style="s2">have our contemptuous of themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.090" end="00:22:49.040" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of reason that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.100" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">but the reasons do not justify the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.040" end="00:22:53.540" style="s2">mistreatment of yourself it&#39;s as simple</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:55.880" style="s2">as that it&#39;s not a good strategy and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.540" end="00:22:58.700" style="s2">next rule is make friends with people</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.880" end="00:23:00.500" style="s2">who want the best for you and that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.870" end="00:24:14.950" style="s2">in their interest and so it&#39;s a tricky</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.419" end="00:24:16.419" style="s2">argument to make because I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.950" end="00:24:18.429" style="s2">you know whenever anyone&#39;s in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.419" end="00:24:19.720" style="s2">you should you know push them into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.429" end="00:24:22.659" style="s2">ditch and then give them a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.720" end="00:24:25.000" style="s2">kicks that&#39;s that&#39;s not the idea the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.659" end="00:24:27.210" style="s2">idea is that but I had a couple of rules</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.000" end="00:24:29.890" style="s2">I didn&#39;t write about one was be careful</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.210" end="00:24:31.419" style="s2">be careful about whom you share good</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.890" end="00:24:33.669" style="s2">news with and another was be careful</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.419" end="00:24:35.950" style="s2">about whom you share bad news with and</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.669" end="00:24:37.929" style="s2">everyone those rules ring in people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.950" end="00:24:39.490" style="s2">minds quite quickly a friend is someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.929" end="00:24:41.110" style="s2">you can share good news with you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.490" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">you go to them and you say hey look this</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.110" end="00:24:45.070" style="s2">good thing happened to me and they say</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.880" end="00:24:46.570" style="s2">look I&#39;m so happy that that happened to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.070" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">you like way to be and they don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.570" end="00:24:50.350" style="s2">god damn it why didn&#39;t that happen to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:51.850" style="s2">and like you know you didn&#39;t deserve it</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.350" end="00:24:53.470" style="s2">here&#39;s a bunch of reasons you&#39;re stupid</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.850" end="00:24:55.900" style="s2">and why it won&#39;t work it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.470" end="00:24:58.270" style="s2">not helpful and so I would say like if</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.900" end="00:24:59.500" style="s2">people are you know what the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.270" end="00:25:01.059" style="s2">people are doing if they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.500" end="00:25:02.590" style="s2">drag you down let&#39;s say is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.059" end="00:25:04.360" style="s2">trying to see if you&#39;ll put up with it</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.590" end="00:25:05.950" style="s2">because they have this idea that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.360" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">life isn&#39;t worth living and things</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.950" end="00:25:09.970" style="s2">aren&#39;t good and then if they can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:12.039" style="s2">smirch let&#39;s say to use an archaic term</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.970" end="00:25:13.419" style="s2">something that&#39;s pristine and good then</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.039" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">they demonstrate to themselves that</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.419" end="00:25:17.799" style="s2">there is no true ideal and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.520" end="00:25:19.450" style="s2">no necessary reason to be responsible</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.799" end="00:25:21.940" style="s2">and to strive forward and so they</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.450" end="00:25:24.100" style="s2">usually what&#39;s a test case you know I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.940" end="00:25:25.870" style="s2">just push you down into the low lobster</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.100" end="00:25:27.940" style="s2">bin and see how you respond and if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.870" end="00:25:29.980" style="s2">put up with it then yeah my cynicism is</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.940" end="00:25:31.640" style="s2">fully justified and so well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.980" end="00:25:33.830" style="s2">Chapter three</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.640" end="00:25:35.570" style="s2">and it&#39;s a painful chapter because it</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.830" end="00:25:37.220" style="s2">also details the suicide of one of my</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.570" end="00:25:39.590" style="s2">friends which occurred over a very long</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.220" end="00:25:42.230" style="s2">period of time not the actual suicide</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.590" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">but all the prodrome a--to it and so and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.230" end="00:25:49.160" style="s2">it&#39;s get sick it&#39;s a contentious chapter</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:52.040" style="s2">number four is comparing yourself to who</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.160" end="00:25:54.830" style="s2">you were yesterday not to who someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.040" end="00:25:57.620" style="s2">else is today and the reason I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.830" end="00:25:59.390" style="s2">that was because I had this client ten</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.620" end="00:26:02.450" style="s2">young clinical psychologists and I spent</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.390" end="00:26:04.429" style="s2">20 hours a week for 25 years listening</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.450" end="00:26:06.260" style="s2">to people listening to people tell me</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.429" end="00:26:07.790" style="s2">about their lives you know and and those</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.260" end="00:26:10.070" style="s2">people were people who were just barely</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.790" end="00:26:11.780" style="s2">hanging on to the bottom of the world up</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.070" end="00:26:13.520" style="s2">to people who were so successful you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.780" end="00:26:16.520" style="s2">hardly believe it like the entire gamut</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:18.590" style="s2">of people and and that&#39;s been absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.520" end="00:26:20.059" style="s2">fascinating it&#39;s like it&#39;s like being a</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.590" end="00:26:22.190" style="s2">clinical psychologist if you really</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.059" end="00:26:24.740" style="s2">listen is like being immersed in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.190" end="00:26:26.570" style="s2">Dostoyevsky novel all the time you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.740" end="00:26:28.850" style="s2">because it&#39;s amazing what people will</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.570" end="00:26:30.559" style="s2">tell you if you listen to them they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.850" end="00:26:31.880" style="s2">people are so interesting if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:33.740" style="s2">actually listen to them because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.880" end="00:26:35.510" style="s2">so peculiar like they&#39;re like penguins</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.740" end="00:26:39.250" style="s2">are writing on sources and ostriches</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.510" end="00:26:46.790" style="s2">they&#39;re unlikely creatures and anyways</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.250" end="00:26:48.620" style="s2">with regards to to comparing yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.790" end="00:26:51.890" style="s2">who you were yesterday and not to who</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.620" end="00:26:54.260" style="s2">someone else is today this old client of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.890" end="00:26:56.390" style="s2">mine he was about 85 when he came to see</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.260" end="00:26:57.940" style="s2">me and he was a financier in a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.390" end="00:27:01.700" style="s2">mathematical genius he made these little</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.940" end="00:27:03.470" style="s2">pendants out of a mathematical symbol</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.700" end="00:27:04.970" style="s2">for the most beautiful mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.470" end="00:27:06.350" style="s2">equation that was ever written he made</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.970" end="00:27:08.840" style="s2">them out of gold and he would hand those</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.350" end="00:27:11.450" style="s2">out and and he he&#39;d studied psychology</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.840" end="00:27:13.340" style="s2">as a young man and he introduced me to</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.450" end="00:27:15.380" style="s2">this concept that I didn&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.340" end="00:27:17.299" style="s2">called the Pareto distribution which see</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.380" end="00:27:20.299" style="s2">I&#39;d been taught it as a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.299" end="00:27:22.700" style="s2">that most human characteristics were</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.299" end="00:27:24.530" style="s2">normally distributed right so most</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.700" end="00:27:26.570" style="s2">people were average and some people were</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.530" end="00:27:28.400" style="s2">extreme that that&#39;s a priori our normal</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.570" end="00:27:30.290" style="s2">distribution intelligence is like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.400" end="00:27:32.210" style="s2">and height there&#39;s more people of</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.290" end="00:27:34.220" style="s2">average height than very tall or very</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.210" end="00:27:35.630" style="s2">short and and weight is like that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.220" end="00:27:37.490" style="s2">lots of things are normally distributed</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.630" end="00:27:40.669" style="s2">and psychologists tend to assume that</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.490" end="00:27:43.010" style="s2">everything is but they didn&#39;t creative</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.669" end="00:27:44.390" style="s2">products are distributed in a Pareto</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.010" end="00:27:45.110" style="s2">distribution and that&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.390" end="00:27:46.610" style="s2">different thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.110" end="00:27:49.010" style="s2">and it&#39;s really important to know this</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.610" end="00:27:51.080" style="s2">it&#39;s another fundamental fact the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.010" end="00:27:53.240" style="s2">knowledge of which can sort of transform</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.080" end="00:27:55.640" style="s2">the way you conceptualize let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.240" end="00:27:57.890" style="s2">political landscape so here&#39;s an example</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.640" end="00:27:59.660" style="s2">of the Pareto distribution huh</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.890" end="00:28:01.280" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a rule of thumb that if</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.660" end="00:28:03.980" style="s2">you run a company that 20% of your</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.280" end="00:28:05.750" style="s2">employees do 80% of the work or the 20%</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.980" end="00:28:08.450" style="s2">of your customers are responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.750" end="00:28:10.400" style="s2">80% of your sales or the 20% of them are</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.450" end="00:28:12.740" style="s2">responsible for 80% of the customer</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.400" end="00:28:14.690" style="s2">service calls same thing but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.740" end="00:28:19.429" style="s2">exactly the rule the rule is worse than</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.690" end="00:28:21.230" style="s2">that the rule is in a given domain the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.429" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">square root of the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.230" end="00:28:25.549" style="s2">operating in that domain do half the</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:26.900" style="s2">productive work so you think well you</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.549" end="00:28:29.240" style="s2">have 10 employees three of them do half</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.900" end="00:28:31.669" style="s2">the work it&#39;s like yeah okay what if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.240" end="00:28:33.860" style="s2">have a hundred employees then ten of</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.669" end="00:28:36.530" style="s2">them do half the work what if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.860" end="00:28:39.470" style="s2">thousand employees well then it&#39;s thirty</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.530" end="00:28:41.660" style="s2">and if it&#39;s 10,000 employees then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.470" end="00:28:44.510" style="s2">hundred and this actually turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.660" end="00:28:46.580" style="s2">be a rather ironclad rule it applies</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.510" end="00:28:49.400" style="s2">across very very many situations it</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.580" end="00:28:52.070" style="s2">applies for example to the mass of stars</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.400" end="00:28:54.440" style="s2">and the size of cities so you can see</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.070" end="00:28:56.570" style="s2">how universal it is as a law ditz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.440" end="00:28:58.580" style="s2">something like those that have more get</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.570" end="00:29:00.500" style="s2">more and those that have less get less</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.580" end="00:29:01.850" style="s2">that&#39;s the Matthieu principle right to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.500" end="00:29:03.260" style="s2">those who have everything more will be</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.850" end="00:29:05.510" style="s2">given from those who have nothing</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.260" end="00:29:07.070" style="s2">everything will be taken away and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.510" end="00:29:09.500" style="s2">economists sometimes call that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.070" end="00:29:11.480" style="s2">Matthieu principle and so what that lays</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.500" end="00:29:13.190" style="s2">out is a world that&#39;s rife with</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.480" end="00:29:15.530" style="s2">inequality so you know you you hear this</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.530" end="00:29:19.490" style="s2">people in the world have more money than</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.270" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">the bottom 2 billion that&#39;s a Pareto</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.490" end="00:29:25.220" style="s2">distribution phenomena and you might say</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:26.929" style="s2">to hell with capitalism for producing</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.910" end="00:29:47.720" style="s2">partly because as you start to become</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.470" end="00:29:49.700" style="s2">successful let&#39;s say people offer you</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.720" end="00:29:51.590" style="s2">more and more opportunities and as you</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.700" end="00:29:54.710" style="s2">start to fail people move away from you</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.590" end="00:29:56.570" style="s2">and you plummet and so okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.710" end="00:29:58.130" style="s2">rough so what it is what it means is</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.570" end="00:29:58.850" style="s2">that there is always a landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.130" end="00:30:00.440" style="s2">inequality</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.850" end="00:30:02.299" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying that we shouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.440" end="00:30:03.919" style="s2">anything about it although I am saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.299" end="00:30:06.289" style="s2">that we don&#39;t know what to do about</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:08.450" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing you know because you</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.289" end="00:30:11.120" style="s2">can modify the purrito distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.450" end="00:30:12.110" style="s2">wealth let&#39;s say but if you but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.120" end="00:30:13.909" style="s2">know how to do it without maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.110" end="00:30:15.769" style="s2">disrupting the system so completely that</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.909" end="00:30:17.929" style="s2">it collapses which is what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.769" end="00:30:20.120" style="s2">the Soviet Union for example and in</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.929" end="00:30:23.240" style="s2">Mao&#39;s China they were trying at least in</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.120" end="00:30:25.070" style="s2">principle to adjust inequality but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.240" end="00:30:26.779" style="s2">cure was far worse than a disease and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.070" end="00:30:29.149" style="s2">the the truth of the matter is we</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.779" end="00:30:31.250" style="s2">actually don&#39;t know technically how much</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.149" end="00:30:33.409" style="s2">inequality there has to be to generate</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.250" end="00:30:34.879" style="s2">wealth we can guess and you could say</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.409" end="00:30:36.350" style="s2">well there should be less and you might</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.879" end="00:30:38.149" style="s2">say well there should be more if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.350" end="00:30:39.320" style="s2">left when you&#39;d say less and if there if</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.149" end="00:30:42.019" style="s2">you&#39;re right we need to say well we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.320" end="00:30:44.750" style="s2">just let the inequality flourish but we</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.019" end="00:30:46.639" style="s2">do know that it&#39;s inevitable and we also</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.750" end="00:30:49.220" style="s2">know that we don&#39;t know how to regulate</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.639" end="00:30:50.570" style="s2">it so there is inequality what that</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.220" end="00:30:52.250" style="s2">means is there&#39;s always gonna be people</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.570" end="00:30:54.769" style="s2">around that are better at something than</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.250" end="00:30:56.690" style="s2">you are and the and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.769" end="00:30:57.950" style="s2">problem because you can get jealous and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.690" end="00:31:00.409" style="s2">you can get bitter and you can get</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.950" end="00:31:01.879" style="s2">resentful and worse you can get hopeless</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.409" end="00:31:04.940" style="s2">you know because you look like looked</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.879" end="00:31:07.940" style="s2">like I have this this friend of mine he</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.940" end="00:31:11.000" style="s2">told me something so funny he was he was</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.940" end="00:31:13.129" style="s2">decrying his his lack of success in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.000" end="00:31:16.129" style="s2">world and he compared himself to his</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.129" end="00:31:17.929" style="s2">roommate and he said you know his</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.129" end="00:31:19.490" style="s2">roommate his cos roommate was doing much</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.929" end="00:31:23.169" style="s2">better than he was and his bloody</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.490" end="00:31:25.610" style="s2">roommate was Elon Musk it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.169" end="00:31:27.860" style="s2">you&#39;re not doing as well as Elon Musk</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.610" end="00:31:29.269" style="s2">well I mean you could see me it would</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.860" end="00:31:30.919" style="s2">take it rather personally because they</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.269" end="00:31:32.809" style="s2">were roommates and everything it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.919" end="00:31:34.970" style="s2">like he was doing badly like he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.809" end="00:31:36.919" style="s2">doing pretty damn well it&#39;s like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.970" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">as good as Elon Musk it&#39;s like yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.919" end="00:31:41.659" style="s2">you and like seven billion other people</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:45.470" style="s2">you know but but I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.659" end="00:31:47.029" style="s2">instructive because well yes you have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.470" end="00:31:49.850" style="s2">be careful who you compare yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.029" end="00:31:51.710" style="s2">now you can&#39;t just not compare yourself</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.850" end="00:31:52.580" style="s2">to others to successful people right</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.710" end="00:31:54.799" style="s2">because then you don&#39;t have anything</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.580" end="00:31:56.750" style="s2">they a map and one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.799" end="00:31:58.429" style="s2">learned from you this was a cool thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.750" end="00:32:00.799" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna make a real lateral move here</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.429" end="00:32:03.110" style="s2">young thought the book of Revelation was</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.799" end="00:32:06.110" style="s2">appended to the Bible because the Christ</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.110" end="00:32:08.389" style="s2">in the Gospels was too merciful he was</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.110" end="00:32:10.460" style="s2">too nice a guy now he&#39;s an ideal right</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.389" end="00:32:12.090" style="s2">and Jung said wait a second an ideal is</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.460" end="00:32:13.470" style="s2">always a judge</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.090" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing about an ideal because</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.470" end="00:32:18.180" style="s2">you&#39;re not as good as your ideal so your</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:20.130" style="s2">ideal as a judge revelation has Christ</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.180" end="00:32:22.170" style="s2">coming back as a judge and that was</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.130" end="00:32:23.940" style="s2">Young&#39;s explanation at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.170" end="00:32:26.130" style="s2">collective unconscious for the pasting</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.940" end="00:32:28.530" style="s2">of that remarkably strange and terrible</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.130" end="00:32:31.980" style="s2">book on to the end of the of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.530" end="00:32:33.810" style="s2">of the Bible so well anyways my point is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.980" end="00:32:35.220" style="s2">is an ideal is it you need an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.810" end="00:32:37.470" style="s2">because you have nothing to aim at but</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.220" end="00:32:39.780" style="s2">an ideal is a judge and you always fall</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.470" end="00:32:41.700" style="s2">short of the ideal so how the hell can</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.780" end="00:32:44.820" style="s2">you have the benefits of having an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.700" end="00:32:46.740" style="s2">without having the crushing blow that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.820" end="00:32:49.080" style="s2">goes along with having the judge that</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.740" end="00:32:50.160" style="s2">always regards you is insufficient so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.080" end="00:32:52.320" style="s2">was trying to work that out in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.160" end="00:32:53.730" style="s2">chapter and this is something I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.320" end="00:32:57.330" style="s2">to work out a lot as a clinical</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.730" end="00:33:00.870" style="s2">psychologist it&#39;s like well let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.330" end="00:33:02.820" style="s2">you need a goal but we don&#39;t want to eat</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.870" end="00:33:05.220" style="s2">let your distance from the goal crush</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.820" end="00:33:07.350" style="s2">you so you got to set up a goal and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.220" end="00:33:09.030" style="s2">you go to make the goal break the goal</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.350" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2">down into parts so that you can move</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.030" end="00:33:12.330" style="s2">towards it you have a fairly high</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:13.260" style="s2">likelihood of doing it so that&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.330" end="00:33:15.630" style="s2">bit of practical</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.260" end="00:33:17.310" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t say advice it&#39;s it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.630" end="00:33:19.020" style="s2">it&#39;s better than advice it&#39;s it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.310" end="00:33:21.060" style="s2">practical knowledge about how to go</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.020" end="00:33:23.460" style="s2">about achieving an aim set a high aim</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.060" end="00:33:25.350" style="s2">but differentiate it down so you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.460" end="00:33:26.040" style="s2">what the next step is and then make the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.350" end="00:33:27.810" style="s2">next step</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.040" end="00:33:30.420" style="s2">difficult enough so you have to push</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.810" end="00:33:32.070" style="s2">yourself past where you are but but also</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.420" end="00:33:34.290" style="s2">provide yourself with a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.070" end="00:33:36.300" style="s2">probability of success it&#39;s also what</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.290" end="00:33:38.220" style="s2">you do with children right you you want</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.300" end="00:33:40.080" style="s2">to push them because they need to grow</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.220" end="00:33:41.190" style="s2">up and be more than they are right but</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.080" end="00:33:43.470" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to crush them with</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.190" end="00:33:45.990" style="s2">constant failure so what you do is aim</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.470" end="00:33:48.840" style="s2">high and make the goal procs difficult</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.990" end="00:33:51.630" style="s2">but proximal so anyways so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.840" end="00:33:55.560" style="s2">one one one way of looking at it but</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.630" end="00:33:58.050" style="s2">then the next thing is you know I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.560" end="00:33:59.940" style="s2">clients many clients in their 30s who</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.050" end="00:34:01.860" style="s2">are trying to this is more true with</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.940" end="00:34:03.000" style="s2">women I would say a lot of women who</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.860" end="00:34:04.830" style="s2">were very high achieving and who</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.000" end="00:34:08.400" style="s2">established their career goals at 30 and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.830" end="00:34:09.360" style="s2">then want a differentiator differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.400" end="00:34:10.860" style="s2">out their life they want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.360" end="00:34:12.150" style="s2">husband they won&#39;t have a family they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.860" end="00:34:13.920" style="s2">trying to figure out how to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.150" end="00:34:16.350" style="s2">one of the things I&#39;ve noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.920" end="00:34:17.940" style="s2">around 30 you really have to stop</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.350" end="00:34:19.860" style="s2">comparing yourself in some ways to other</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.940" end="00:34:21.810" style="s2">people and the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.860" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">the particular tease of your life or so</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.810" end="00:34:25.649" style="s2">I do synchronic that there isn&#39;t anyone</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:27.389" style="s2">really all that much like you you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.649" end="00:34:29.399" style="s2">because the details of your life</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.389" end="00:34:31.049" style="s2">happened to matter and so maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.399" end="00:34:32.759" style="s2">compare yourself to some rock star or</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.049" end="00:34:34.230" style="s2">something like that and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.759" end="00:34:35.669" style="s2">person&#39;s rich and famous and glamorous</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.230" end="00:34:37.349" style="s2">and all that but you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.669" end="00:34:38.819" style="s2">alcoholic and they use too much cocaine</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.349" end="00:34:41.549" style="s2">and they&#39;ve had three divorces and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.819" end="00:34:43.470" style="s2">like how the hell do you make sense out</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.549" end="00:34:45.179" style="s2">of that is that someone that you should</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.470" end="00:34:46.919" style="s2">judge yourself harshly against or not</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.179" end="00:34:48.119" style="s2">the answer is you don&#39;t know because you</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.919" end="00:34:50.519" style="s2">don&#39;t know all the details of their</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.119" end="00:34:53.629" style="s2">lives and who do you know that you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.519" end="00:34:57.210" style="s2">compare yourself to that&#39;s easy you</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.629" end="00:34:59.309" style="s2">yesterday so here&#39;s a good goal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.210" end="00:35:01.499" style="s2">something like well aim high and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.309" end="00:35:03.869" style="s2">really mean that it&#39;s like about that a</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.499" end="00:35:06.749" style="s2">little bit - aim high but use as your</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.869" end="00:35:10.079" style="s2">control yourself it&#39;s like so your goal</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.749" end="00:35:12.089" style="s2">is to make today some tiny increment</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.079" end="00:35:13.769" style="s2">better than yesterday and you can use</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.089" end="00:35:15.960" style="s2">better you can define better yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.769" end="00:35:17.730" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t have to be some imposition</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.960" end="00:35:19.470" style="s2">of external morality you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.730" end="00:35:21.450" style="s2">where you&#39;re weak and insufficient where</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.470" end="00:35:23.430" style="s2">you could improve think okay well this</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.450" end="00:35:26.220" style="s2">is what I&#39;m like yesterday if I did this</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.430" end="00:35:30.239" style="s2">little thing things would be just an</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.220" end="00:35:31.950" style="s2">increment better and well that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.239" end="00:35:34.079" style="s2">thing because you get the ball rolling</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.950" end="00:35:36.269" style="s2">and incremental improvement is</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.079" end="00:35:38.279" style="s2">unstoppable you can actually implement</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.269" end="00:35:40.680" style="s2">it and it starts to generate purrito</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.279" end="00:35:42.779" style="s2">distribution like consequences it starts</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.680" end="00:35:44.130" style="s2">to compound and I&#39;ve seen that happen in</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.779" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">people&#39;s lives over in all people</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.130" end="00:35:46.950" style="s2">writing all the time and tell me that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:49.140" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that but I&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.950" end="00:35:51.779" style="s2">happen in people&#39;s lives continually</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.140" end="00:35:55.140" style="s2">they make a goal a goal that the goal</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.779" end="00:35:57.029" style="s2">should be how could I conceive of my</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.140" end="00:35:58.650" style="s2">life so that if I had that life it would</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.029" end="00:36:01.079" style="s2">clearly be worth living so I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.650" end="00:36:03.869" style="s2">have to be bitter resentful deceitful</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.079" end="00:36:05.670" style="s2">arrogant and vengeful like that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.869" end="00:36:08.309" style="s2">of the bottom line right because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.670" end="00:36:11.609" style="s2">what endless failure does to you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.309" end="00:36:13.349" style="s2">not good and and and that&#39;s what life</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.609" end="00:36:15.119" style="s2">without purpose and the goal does to you</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.349" end="00:36:17.640" style="s2">as well because life is very hard so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:20.279" style="s2">think okay well I need to adopt a mode</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.640" end="00:36:21.960" style="s2">of being that would justify my suffering</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.279" end="00:36:25.349" style="s2">and you can ask yourself that question</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.960" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">what would make this worthwhile need a</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.349" end="00:36:29.849" style="s2">quote Nietzsche I think in that chapter</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.119" end="00:36:31.349" style="s2">he said he who has a why can bear almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.849" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">any how</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.349" end="00:36:35.700" style="s2">that&#39;s a lovely line man I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:38.220" style="s2">lovely line and it&#39;s really worth</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.700" end="00:36:39.269" style="s2">thinking about so you think well how do</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.220" end="00:36:41.069" style="s2">I manage</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.269" end="00:36:43.979" style="s2">this misery and suffering and futility</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.069" end="00:36:46.019" style="s2">it&#39;s like well I need to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.979" end="00:36:47.699" style="s2">I would have to do in order to make that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.019" end="00:36:49.679" style="s2">clearly worthwhile and so then you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.699" end="00:36:51.809" style="s2">your goal and then you think well I need</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.679" end="00:36:53.369" style="s2">to move towards that incremental II</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.809" end="00:36:55.679" style="s2">because I&#39;m kind of useless and can only</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.369" end="00:36:57.390" style="s2">do so much and maybe not even that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.679" end="00:36:59.699" style="s2">but all I have to do is be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.390" end="00:37:02.699" style="s2">better than my my miserable self</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.699" end="00:37:05.189" style="s2">yesterday and that&#39;ll propel you forward</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.699" end="00:37:06.809" style="s2">very rapidly and and you can succeed at</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.189" end="00:37:08.519" style="s2">it which is also really lovely because</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.809" end="00:37:10.349" style="s2">why not send yourself up for success you</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.519" end="00:37:12.390" style="s2">know because otherwise you droop around</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.349" end="00:37:14.130" style="s2">like a number-10 lobster and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.390" end="00:37:16.049" style="s2">that&#39;s just not good you get all pinchy</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.130" end="00:37:19.380" style="s2">when that happens and it&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.049" end="00:37:22.679" style="s2">thing so that was that was chapter 4</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.380" end="00:37:25.259" style="s2">chapter 5 cheese we&#39;re cruising along</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.679" end="00:37:26.609" style="s2">here chapter 5 is the one that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.259" end="00:37:28.319" style="s2">I would get in the most trouble for</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.609" end="00:37:30.359" style="s2">writing you know I figured people would</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.319" end="00:37:33.149" style="s2">be all over me for this and so far they</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.359" end="00:37:33.959" style="s2">haven&#39;t been but they still might be so</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.149" end="00:37:36.299" style="s2">and it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.959" end="00:37:39.089" style="s2">do not let your children do anything</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.299" end="00:37:41.130" style="s2">that makes you dislike them and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.089" end="00:37:43.019" style="s2">thought that would be contentious first</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.130" end="00:37:46.039" style="s2">of all because people would think well I</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.019" end="00:37:50.039" style="s2">never just like my children it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.039" end="00:37:54.119" style="s2">really really you know you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.039" end="00:37:56.159" style="s2">really tell me that God you know and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.119" end="00:37:57.959" style="s2">there&#39;s a more there&#39;s a more horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.159" end="00:37:59.999" style="s2">element to that too because as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.959" end="00:38:01.829" style="s2">clinical psychologist I&#39;ve seen the full</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.999" end="00:38:05.249" style="s2">Freudian nightmare I can tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.829" end="00:38:07.619" style="s2">and you know I&#39;ve seen families where</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.249" end="00:38:09.569" style="s2">it&#39;s like this is like the family</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.619" end="00:38:11.279" style="s2">members are standing in a circle let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.569" end="00:38:13.380" style="s2">say and each of them has their hands</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.279" end="00:38:16.859" style="s2">around each other&#39;s neck and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.380" end="00:38:20.159" style="s2">squeezing hard enough to strangle the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.859" end="00:38:23.249" style="s2">other person in 20 years and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.159" end="00:38:25.039" style="s2">family it&#39;s like and you know if you if</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.249" end="00:38:27.419" style="s2">you haven&#39;t met a family like that or</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.039" end="00:38:29.729" style="s2">well then you&#39;re not paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.419" end="00:38:31.679" style="s2">and there&#39;s some there&#39;s some reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.729" end="00:38:34.559" style="s2">possibility that you&#39;re actually in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.679" end="00:38:37.769" style="s2">family like that so the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.559" end="00:38:40.199" style="s2">parents can&#39;t dislike their children</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.769" end="00:38:43.589" style="s2">it&#39;s like God how naive can you get it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.199" end="00:38:45.569" style="s2">just that&#39;s just if you think that man</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.589" end="00:38:47.549" style="s2">you I don&#39;t even know where you&#39;d start</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.569" end="00:38:50.309" style="s2">to straighten yourself out I could never</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.549" end="00:38:51.509" style="s2">dislike my children&#39;s like yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.309" end="00:38:53.240" style="s2">those are the people who produce the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.509" end="00:38:56.630" style="s2">most monstrous children - I can</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.240" end="00:38:58.490" style="s2">tell you that so mmm so and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.630" end="00:39:00.290" style="s2">this idea that Young had which I really</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.490" end="00:39:01.970" style="s2">love which is the idea of the shadow and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.290" end="00:39:04.730" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it kind of got pop</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.970" end="00:39:07.010" style="s2">psychology and trendy sort of among the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.730" end="00:39:09.080" style="s2">new-age types too but one thing I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.010" end="00:39:11.570" style="s2">tell you about Carl Jung is no matter</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.080" end="00:39:14.450" style="s2">what else someone might say about him he</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.570" end="00:39:16.460" style="s2">is absolutely not new agey if you read</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.450" end="00:39:18.200" style="s2">Carl Jung and you understand him and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.460" end="00:39:19.790" style="s2">you&#39;re not terrified right to the depths</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.200" end="00:39:22.130" style="s2">of your soul you haven&#39;t understood a</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.790" end="00:39:23.780" style="s2">damn thing you&#39;ve read and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.130" end="00:39:25.940" style="s2">things that you said about the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.780" end="00:39:27.650" style="s2">which is the dark side of humanity the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.940" end="00:39:29.450" style="s2">dark side of each individual was that</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.650" end="00:39:31.369" style="s2">its roots reached all the way to hell</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.450" end="00:39:32.450" style="s2">and he meant something he meant</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.369" end="00:39:35.270" style="s2">something very specific</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.450" end="00:39:37.340" style="s2">both metaphysical and practical by that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.270" end="00:39:40.220" style="s2">the metaphysical element was he meant</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.340" end="00:39:42.350" style="s2">hell literally and metaphysically but he</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.220" end="00:39:44.150" style="s2">also meant the more proximal kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.350" end="00:39:46.820" style="s2">Hell and so what he meant was that if</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.150" end="00:39:49.190" style="s2">you were able to understand your dark</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.820" end="00:39:51.380" style="s2">side then you would see in yourself a</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.190" end="00:39:53.360" style="s2">reflection of the behavior that was that</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.380" end="00:39:55.130" style="s2">was present at Auschwitz for example and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.360" end="00:39:57.440" style="s2">that the reason that people don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.130" end="00:39:59.270" style="s2">the dark side of themselves seriously at</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.440" end="00:40:01.130" style="s2">all and even confront the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.270" end="00:40:04.040" style="s2">exists is because no one wants to see</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.130" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">that reflected within them and no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.040" end="00:40:08.930" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:11.240" style="s2">you also believe that that confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.930" end="00:40:13.430" style="s2">with the shadow was an inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.240" end="00:40:16.700" style="s2">barrier to enlightenment that there was</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.430" end="00:40:18.440" style="s2">no you know Joseph Campbell who is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.700" end="00:40:20.570" style="s2">popularizer of you to some degree has</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.440" end="00:40:23.540" style="s2">become well known for saying follow your</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.540" end="00:40:27.560" style="s2">learned virtually everything he knew</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.920" end="00:40:29.900" style="s2">from Jung but Jung that isn&#39;t what Jung</p>

<p begin="00:40:48.530" end="00:40:53.619" style="s2">Horus who was that Egyptian Savior in</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:56.030" style="s2">some sense and when he encountered evil</p>

<p begin="00:41:12.380" end="00:41:16.730" style="s2">this when I had my kids I&#39;d already</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.870" end="00:41:19.160" style="s2">undergone that to some degree and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.730" end="00:41:22.370" style="s2">understood what it meant to be a bad</p>

<p begin="00:41:39.860" end="00:41:44.900" style="s2">in the early 20th century I had seen</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.960" end="00:41:48.350" style="s2">that in many many situations dismal</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.900" end="00:41:51.080" style="s2">brutal awful and I&#39;ve seen parents</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.350" end="00:41:52.730" style="s2">punish their children and you can also</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.080" end="00:41:54.170" style="s2">take a page from Nietzsche if you really</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.730" end="00:41:55.250" style="s2">want to punish your children or anyone</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.170" end="00:41:57.320" style="s2">else if you have someone you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.250" end="00:41:59.300" style="s2">interested in punishing including</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.300" end="00:42:02.450" style="s2">punish someone you really want to punish</p>

<p begin="00:42:02.450" end="00:42:06.590" style="s2">actually a bit of a relief to them you</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.340" end="00:42:09.380" style="s2">know that&#39;s the theme of Dostoyevsky&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.590" end="00:42:10.850" style="s2">crime and punishment the murderer gets</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.380" end="00:42:12.620" style="s2">away with it and it&#39;s a relief to him</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.850" end="00:42:13.730" style="s2">when he gets caught it&#39;s like no if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.620" end="00:42:15.620" style="s2">really want to punish someone you wait</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.730" end="00:42:18.170" style="s2">till they do something good then you</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.620" end="00:42:20.060" style="s2">punish them because that&#39;ll teach them</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.170" end="00:42:21.410" style="s2">that&#39;s you maximize the hurt that way</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.060" end="00:42:22.820" style="s2">you decrease the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.410" end="00:42:24.650" style="s2">they&#39;ll ever do anything good again and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.820" end="00:42:26.330" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you man if you want to have a</p>

<p begin="00:42:26.330" end="00:42:29.780" style="s2">one thing you don&#39;t do you open your</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.460" end="00:42:31.550" style="s2">bloody eyes and if they do something</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.780" end="00:42:34.790" style="s2">that you would like them to do again</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.550" end="00:42:36.410" style="s2">then you tell them how much you</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.790" end="00:42:38.540" style="s2">appreciated the fact that that happened</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.410" end="00:42:42.350" style="s2">and you hope that it replicates you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.540" end="00:42:43.640" style="s2">you see that&#39;s if there&#39;s one thing you</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.350" end="00:42:45.260" style="s2">can take away from tonight&#39;s lecture</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.640" end="00:42:47.510" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s an extraordinarily useful</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.260" end="00:42:48.770" style="s2">thing to know watch and when people do</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.510" end="00:42:50.630" style="s2">something that they should do more of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.770" end="00:42:52.730" style="s2">say look I saw that you did this</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.630" end="00:42:54.530" style="s2">specific thing I saw that it took some</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.730" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">effort here&#39;s what it meant here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.530" end="00:42:58.910" style="s2">here&#39;s how I observed it&#39;s like keep</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:00.170" style="s2">that up and man if you love someone you</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.910" end="00:43:01.790" style="s2">do that to them that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.170" end="00:43:05.210" style="s2">encouragement that&#39;s such a great thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.790" end="00:43:07.100" style="s2">so anyways back to children so I already</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.210" end="00:43:09.280" style="s2">knew that I was pretty decent monster by</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.100" end="00:43:12.140" style="s2">the time I had kids and I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.280" end="00:43:14.540" style="s2">my kid my kids little you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.140" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">baby or two-year-olds like I&#39;m horrible</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.540" end="00:43:19.190" style="s2">monster and so that there&#39;s an uneven</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:19.800" style="s2">power problem here I better not let that</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.190" end="00:43:22.320" style="s2">child do</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.800" end="00:43:23.730" style="s2">that really makes me angry you know now</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.320" end="00:43:25.560" style="s2">you hear now and then you hear about</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.730" end="00:43:27.930" style="s2">something horrible that happens I when I</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.560" end="00:43:29.490" style="s2">was in Boston years ago I read about a</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.930" end="00:43:31.530" style="s2">woman who plunged her two-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.490" end="00:43:33.270" style="s2">daughter&#39;s arms into boiling water you</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.530" end="00:43:36.510" style="s2">think well how in the world can that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.270" end="00:43:38.790" style="s2">happen it&#39;s like well you know she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.510" end="00:43:41.160" style="s2">probably hungover she probably just lost</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.790" end="00:43:42.870" style="s2">her job she was probably desperate in</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.160" end="00:43:44.520" style="s2">six different ways she probably didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.870" end="00:43:46.680" style="s2">have any decent discipline at her</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.520" end="00:43:48.630" style="s2">disciplinary strategies for children she</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.680" end="00:43:50.610" style="s2">probably didn&#39;t have anyone helping her</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.630" end="00:43:53.760" style="s2">she was bitter and resentful and angry</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.610" end="00:43:54.570" style="s2">and the child misbehaved at exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.760" end="00:43:56.130" style="s2">wrong moment</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.570" end="00:43:58.470" style="s2">and like you&#39;re gonna be around your</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.130" end="00:44:00.360" style="s2">children a lot and so you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.470" end="00:44:02.760" style="s2">have it so that they don&#39;t misbehave at</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.360" end="00:44:04.530" style="s2">exactly the wrong moment because all kid</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.760" end="00:44:06.600" style="s2">all hell can break loose if they can and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.530" end="00:44:08.400" style="s2">I didn&#39;t want that to happen so and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.600" end="00:44:10.050" style="s2">knew that it was easy for people to hate</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.400" end="00:44:11.550" style="s2">their children even though they mouth</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.050" end="00:44:13.380" style="s2">the words that they loved them all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.550" end="00:44:16.110" style="s2">time I saw very little evidence of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.380" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">many situations and so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.110" end="00:44:19.950" style="s2">you know you have a natural affinity for</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:21.690" style="s2">children and even more maybe a more</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.950" end="00:44:23.850" style="s2">powerful natural affinity for your own</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.690" end="00:44:26.520" style="s2">children so that&#39;s a good start but you</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.850" end="00:44:28.650" style="s2">don&#39;t want to set them up as an enemy</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.520" end="00:44:30.690" style="s2">against you you don&#39;t want to allow them</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.650" end="00:44:32.550" style="s2">to engage in the kind of hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.690" end="00:44:35.310" style="s2">challenge that makes you irritable and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.550" end="00:44:37.710" style="s2">resentful that&#39;s not a good idea and if</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.310" end="00:44:39.450" style="s2">the things they do make you dislike them</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.710" end="00:44:40.770" style="s2">the probability that they will make</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.450" end="00:44:43.170" style="s2">other people dislike them is</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.770" end="00:44:45.720" style="s2">extraordinarily high and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.170" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">consult your own irritability and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.720" end="00:44:50.070" style="s2">can say look kid I used to tell my kids</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.240" end="00:44:51.480" style="s2">this you know when they were three or</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.070" end="00:44:53.970" style="s2">four I&#39;d say look I&#39;m not in a very good</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.480" end="00:44:55.530" style="s2">mood and I&#39;m likely to be unreasonable</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.970" end="00:44:57.060" style="s2">so it&#39;d be best if you&#39;d go in your room</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.530" end="00:44:58.950" style="s2">and play for a while it&#39;s like I like</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.060" end="00:45:00.450" style="s2">you man you&#39;re a great kid but like get</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.950" end="00:45:02.400" style="s2">the hell out of here for a while you</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.450" end="00:45:04.260" style="s2">know and they were fine with that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.400" end="00:45:05.940" style="s2">trained them already at that point to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.260" end="00:45:07.170" style="s2">able to go play by themselves in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.940" end="00:45:09.330" style="s2">room you know which is something a kid</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.170" end="00:45:10.860" style="s2">should be able to do anyways but but you</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.330" end="00:45:12.390" style="s2">need to know what sort of monster you</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.860" end="00:45:13.950" style="s2">are if you&#39;re gonna be a good parent and</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.390" end="00:45:15.810" style="s2">if you think oh I&#39;m not a monster it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.950" end="00:45:17.910" style="s2">like oh yes you are you&#39;re just an</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.810" end="00:45:20.460" style="s2">unbelievably unconscious monster and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.910" end="00:45:22.050" style="s2">that&#39;s actually the worst kind so and</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.460" end="00:45:24.060" style="s2">then the other thing about that chapter</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.050" end="00:45:25.590" style="s2">is there&#39;s an idea in it and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.060" end="00:45:27.180" style="s2">idea that I think&#39;s well supported by</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.590" end="00:45:29.190" style="s2">the relevant literature which is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.180" end="00:45:30.990" style="s2">your fundamental job as a parent</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.190" end="00:45:33.220" style="s2">especially of a child from zero to four</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.990" end="00:45:36.670" style="s2">is to make that child M&amp;M</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.220" end="00:45:39.700" style="s2">léa desirable socially so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.670" end="00:45:42.670" style="s2">you&#39;re a successful parent if when your</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.700" end="00:45:44.650" style="s2">child is for all sorts of other children</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.670" end="00:45:46.810" style="s2">want to play with him or her that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.650" end="00:45:48.250" style="s2">really the that&#39;s like if you want one</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.810" end="00:45:50.740" style="s2">marker of whether or not you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.250" end="00:45:52.270" style="s2">successful that&#39;s it now some children</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.740" end="00:45:53.890" style="s2">are a lot harder to get along with than</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.270" end="00:45:55.420" style="s2">others and some children have a harder</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.890" end="00:45:58.030" style="s2">time playing and so I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.420" end="00:46:01.480" style="s2">every parent who has a child that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.030" end="00:46:03.250" style="s2">popular at 4 is that fault for that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.480" end="00:46:04.690" style="s2">not saying that I&#39;m saying the reverse</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.250" end="00:46:06.819" style="s2">which is you can be sure that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.690" end="00:46:08.859" style="s2">been successful if your child is not</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.819" end="00:46:11.050" style="s2">popular exactly but desirable as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.859" end="00:46:12.310" style="s2">playmate and so then you think well what</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.050" end="00:46:13.900" style="s2">have you done for your child</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.310" end="00:46:16.060" style="s2">well you&#39;ve opened up the entire world</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.900" end="00:46:18.010" style="s2">of children to them so because they know</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.060" end="00:46:19.839" style="s2">how to play which is a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.010" end="00:46:21.819" style="s2">knowledge and it starts to become</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.839" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">inculcated probably at the breast and</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.819" end="00:46:25.270" style="s2">certainly in the course of</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:26.950" style="s2">rough-and-tumble play at about two years</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.270" end="00:46:28.869" style="s2">of age it&#39;s a deep embodied knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.950" end="00:46:30.700" style="s2">they know how to play like a good</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.869" end="00:46:32.650" style="s2">well-trained dog knows how to play you</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.700" end="00:46:34.450" style="s2">know you meet a new dog and you go like</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.650" end="00:46:36.970" style="s2">this and the dog goes like this you</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.450" end="00:46:38.829" style="s2">think oh that dog I can go like this and</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.970" end="00:46:41.410" style="s2">it won&#39;t bite me right it knows how to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.829" end="00:46:43.420" style="s2">play and a kid who&#39;s awake and alert is</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.410" end="00:46:45.550" style="s2">just like that like a well socialized</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.420" end="00:46:47.079" style="s2">kid if you know anything about kids says</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.550" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2">you can take a four-year-old make a</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.079" end="00:46:49.660" style="s2">little play just you&#39;re at them and</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:51.730" style="s2">they&#39;ll smile right away and start</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.660" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">playing just right now and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.730" end="00:46:55.270" style="s2">you want for your kids and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:57.339" style="s2">everywhere they go other kids like them</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.270" end="00:46:59.650" style="s2">and will include them in their play and</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.339" end="00:47:01.480" style="s2">play is the way the children develop and</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.650" end="00:47:01.960" style="s2">so if other children include them in</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.480" end="00:47:04.240" style="s2">their play</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.960" end="00:47:06.819" style="s2">then the children develop and the poor</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.240" end="00:47:08.740" style="s2">kids that don&#39;t get befriended at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.819" end="00:47:11.170" style="s2">age of four with the literature on this</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.740" end="00:47:13.240" style="s2">is crystal clear if your child is an</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.170" end="00:47:14.980" style="s2">outcast at the age of four the</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.240" end="00:47:17.650" style="s2">probability that anything can be done</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.980" end="00:47:19.930" style="s2">about that is almost zero no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.650" end="00:47:22.060" style="s2">you do and I hate to be so blunt about</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.930" end="00:47:23.890" style="s2">that but I know the literature and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.060" end="00:47:26.349" style="s2">that&#39;s what the literature suggests and</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.890" end="00:47:28.329" style="s2">so and then the other thing is if if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.349" end="00:47:31.060" style="s2">don&#39;t allow your children to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.329" end="00:47:32.619" style="s2">dislikable behavior then adults will</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.060" end="00:47:34.150" style="s2">like them because adults actually like</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.619" end="00:47:36.130" style="s2">kids you know one of the things I loved</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.150" end="00:47:37.720" style="s2">about having little kids in Montreal I</p>

<p begin="00:48:14.170" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">children and to respond to adults</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.000" end="00:48:20.110" style="s2">properly like a puppy that wags its tail</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:21.820" style="s2">instead of growls and you know goes for</p>

<p begin="00:48:21.820" end="00:48:25.420" style="s2">adults welcome them and teach them</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.920" end="00:48:27.610" style="s2">things and Pat them on the head and</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.420" end="00:48:29.470" style="s2">smile at them genuinely instead of</p>

<p begin="00:48:42.190" end="00:48:45.460" style="s2">to someone that&#39;s more terrible than to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.020" end="00:48:47.200" style="s2">put them in a world where all the good</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.460" end="00:48:49.780" style="s2">will directed towards them is false</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.200" end="00:48:52.860" style="s2">that&#39;s a terrible thing so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.780" end="00:48:57.300" style="s2">that&#39;s with chapter let&#39;s chapter 5 and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.860" end="00:49:01.630" style="s2">chapter 6 is about it&#39;s a rough chapter</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.300" end="00:49:04.120" style="s2">it&#39;s about I spend a lot of time reading</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.630" end="00:49:07.150" style="s2">about totalitarianism and about atrocity</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.120" end="00:49:09.100" style="s2">like some brutal many many brutal things</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.150" end="00:49:13.590" style="s2">brutal beyond the capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.100" end="00:49:15.790" style="s2">imagination even and I read a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.590" end="00:49:17.410" style="s2">individual criminals and serial killers</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.790" end="00:49:19.060" style="s2">and those sorts of people - trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.410" end="00:49:20.710" style="s2">get to the bottom off one book I would</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.060" end="00:49:23.260" style="s2">really recommend is a book by carl</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.710" end="00:49:25.510" style="s2">panzram which is a an autobiography a</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.260" end="00:49:27.580" style="s2">panzram is the name of the book and he</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.510" end="00:49:30.580" style="s2">was a here&#39;s a rough guy man</p>

<p begin="00:49:38.530" end="00:49:42.700" style="s2">know he said I wish the human race had</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.810" end="00:49:45.250" style="s2">one neck so that I could put my hands</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.700" end="00:49:47.290" style="s2">around it and squeeze that was carl</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.250" end="00:49:49.120" style="s2">panzram and not many people like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.290" end="00:49:51.310" style="s2">right out of biographies but he did and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.120" end="00:49:53.170" style="s2">he told you why he was like that and why</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.310" end="00:49:55.060" style="s2">he thought that way in case you want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.170" end="00:49:56.350" style="s2">find out which I would recommend by the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.060" end="00:50:00.060" style="s2">way because it&#39;s very useful to know</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.350" end="00:50:00.060" style="s2">such things but um</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.849" end="00:50:12.739" style="s2">now I have to remember why I told you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.049" end="00:50:14.809" style="s2">that panzram story oh yeah chapter 6 is</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.739" end="00:50:17.119" style="s2">about that it&#39;s a boat it&#39;s a boat</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.809" end="00:50:19.249" style="s2">panzram and it&#39;s about the columbine</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.119" end="00:50:21.199" style="s2">kids the kids who showed up the high</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.249" end="00:50:23.809" style="s2">school cuz I read their Diaries no and</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.199" end="00:50:25.339" style="s2">and I understood them too which is even</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.809" end="00:50:26.779" style="s2">better than just reading them and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.339" end="00:50:28.189" style="s2">know you can see these mass shootings</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.779" end="00:50:30.259" style="s2">all the time and everyone does the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.189" end="00:50:31.849" style="s2">thing oh how did that happen why did</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.259" end="00:50:34.309" style="s2">that happen how can it be this way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.849" end="00:50:36.259" style="s2">like well why don&#39;t you read what they</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.309" end="00:50:38.869" style="s2">said about why they did it just assume</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.259" end="00:50:39.349" style="s2">that that&#39;s the reason and if you go if</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.869" end="00:50:46.369" style="s2">you go</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.349" end="00:50:48.469" style="s2">oh other Columbine kids oh yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.369" end="00:50:50.059" style="s2">like oh they must have been bullied oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.469" end="00:50:51.650" style="s2">yes because you know the natural</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.059" end="00:50:54.529" style="s2">response of anyone who&#39;s being bullied</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.650" end="00:50:56.809" style="s2">is to go arm yourself to the teeth to</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.529" end="00:50:59.299" style="s2">plot the destruction of the entire city</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.809" end="00:51:01.429" style="s2">I think it was of detroit to line your</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.299" end="00:51:03.140" style="s2">entire high school avenue with bombs and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.429" end="00:51:04.969" style="s2">then to go and shoot your classmates</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.140" end="00:51:06.619" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens when you&#39;re bullied</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.969" end="00:51:07.909" style="s2">it&#39;s like no that that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.619" end="00:51:09.979" style="s2">happens when you&#39;re bullied that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.909" end="00:51:12.469" style="s2">stupid explanation it&#39;s shallow beyond</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.979" end="00:51:13.819" style="s2">belief and it and it really emerges only</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.469" end="00:51:15.709" style="s2">because people don&#39;t want to contend</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.819" end="00:51:17.299" style="s2">with the real issue and the Columbine</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.709" end="00:51:19.009" style="s2">kids while they were contending with the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.299" end="00:51:21.319" style="s2">real issue you know they basically said</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.009" end="00:51:23.929" style="s2">quite forthrightly that in their own</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.319" end="00:51:25.909" style="s2">arrogant estimation being itself was</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.929" end="00:51:27.679" style="s2">corrupt and unnecessary and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.909" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">best if it was eradicated in the most</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.679" end="00:51:32.329" style="s2">brutal possible way as fast as possible</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.079" end="00:51:35.269" style="s2">and you get to places like that if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.329" end="00:51:37.369" style="s2">dwell on revenge for three or four years</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.269" end="00:51:39.079" style="s2">in your mom&#39;s basement you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.369" end="00:51:41.479" style="s2">go to very dark places and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.079" end="00:51:43.849" style="s2">what chapter six is about and you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.479" end="00:51:46.189" style="s2">panzram who was very brutally treated</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.849" end="00:51:47.929" style="s2">when he was a kid and the Columbine guys</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.189" end="00:51:50.569" style="s2">who you know had their ups and downs but</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.929" end="00:51:54.499" style="s2">nothing compared to carl panzram say</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.569" end="00:51:57.439" style="s2">were we&#39;re judges of being and decided</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.499" end="00:52:00.019" style="s2">that it was flawed and that they were</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.439" end="00:52:03.469" style="s2">the ones to set it right and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.019" end="00:52:05.439" style="s2">rough chapter but it&#39;s more than that</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.469" end="00:52:08.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a meditation on resentment because</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.439" end="00:52:10.819" style="s2">resentment is a key human motivation and</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.150" end="00:52:11.970" style="s2">I would say it&#39;s um it&#39;s a great teacher</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.819" end="00:52:13.619" style="s2">too to</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.970" end="00:52:15.420" style="s2">listen to your resentment is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.619" end="00:52:17.550" style="s2">best things you can possibly do you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.420" end="00:52:19.680" style="s2">to admit that it exists first and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.550" end="00:52:21.900" style="s2">you have to admit to the fantasies that</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.680" end="00:52:24.090" style="s2">it&#39;s generating and you have to admit to</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.900" end="00:52:26.790" style="s2">what you would regard as the way out of</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.090" end="00:52:28.410" style="s2">it so that&#39;s all very difficult because</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.790" end="00:52:29.700" style="s2">it means learning things about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.410" end="00:52:34.440" style="s2">that you probably don&#39;t want to learn</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.700" end="00:52:35.970" style="s2">but resentment only means one of two</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.440" end="00:52:36.480" style="s2">things it means either like shut the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.970" end="00:52:38.340" style="s2">hell up</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.480" end="00:52:41.790" style="s2">grow up quit whining and get on with it</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.340" end="00:52:44.070" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing it means or someone is</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.790" end="00:52:46.260" style="s2">playing the tyrant to you might even be</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.070" end="00:52:48.210" style="s2">you and you have something to say and do</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.260" end="00:52:48.720" style="s2">that you should say and do to put it to</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.210" end="00:52:52.020" style="s2">a stop</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:55.560" style="s2">and so maybe and resentment can show you</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.020" end="00:52:57.930" style="s2">the pathway to doing that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.560" end="00:53:00.990" style="s2">meditation on resentment and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.930" end="00:53:03.180" style="s2">one of the principles that I extracted</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.990" end="00:53:05.970" style="s2">from that is a choral person wants other</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.180" end="00:53:07.560" style="s2">people to change and if you&#39;re resentful</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.970" end="00:53:09.240" style="s2">then your motivations aren&#39;t trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.560" end="00:53:11.070" style="s2">in fact they&#39;re very very dark and</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.240" end="00:53:12.660" style="s2">that&#39;s why I went to the extreme with</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.070" end="00:53:16.589" style="s2">people like panzram and the Columbine</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.660" end="00:53:19.310" style="s2">killers resentful people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.589" end="00:53:21.450" style="s2">change the world are not to be trusted</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.310" end="00:53:23.070" style="s2">what should you do instead how do you</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.450" end="00:53:25.710" style="s2">treat your own resentment I would say</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.070" end="00:53:27.750" style="s2">well there&#39;s a there&#39;s a great I read</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.710" end="00:53:31.050" style="s2">this great line in and TS Eliot play</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.750" end="00:53:32.790" style="s2">called the cocktail party and in it this</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.050" end="00:53:36.060" style="s2">woman comes up to a psychiatrist I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.790" end="00:53:37.200" style="s2">this is in this chapter and she says you</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.060" end="00:53:38.940" style="s2">know I&#39;m having a really rough time of</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.200" end="00:53:41.700" style="s2">it I&#39;m suffering badly my life is not</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.940" end="00:53:43.260" style="s2">going well and and then she says I hope</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.700" end="00:53:47.070" style="s2">that there&#39;s something wrong with me and</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.260" end="00:53:48.750" style="s2">the psychiatrist says she says well</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.070" end="00:53:51.690" style="s2">here&#39;s how I look at it there&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.750" end="00:53:54.060" style="s2">something wrong with the world and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.690" end="00:53:55.740" style="s2">just in it and that&#39;s how it is and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.060" end="00:53:57.900" style="s2">like what am I going to do about that</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.740" end="00:53:59.190" style="s2">because it&#39;s the whole world or maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.900" end="00:54:01.200" style="s2">could be fortunate and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.190" end="00:54:03.480" style="s2">wrong with me that&#39;s causing all this</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.200" end="00:54:05.339" style="s2">unnecessary suffering and if I could</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.480" end="00:54:09.510" style="s2">just set it right I could learn and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.339" end="00:54:10.920" style="s2">could set it right and so well I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.510" end="00:54:12.780" style="s2">thinking about that for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.920" end="00:54:14.430" style="s2">and I think well if your life isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.780" end="00:54:16.830" style="s2">going the way it is you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.430" end="00:54:18.390" style="s2">find someone else to blame which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.830" end="00:54:20.910" style="s2">pretty convenient for you and also</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.390" end="00:54:25.170" style="s2">relatively easy or you could think okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.910" end="00:54:25.910" style="s2">I don&#39;t like life I don&#39;t like the way</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.170" end="00:54:28.670" style="s2">my life is</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.910" end="00:54:30.260" style="s2">folding candy I don&#39;t like life in</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.670" end="00:54:37.340" style="s2">general because it&#39;s tragic and</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.260" end="00:54:40.310" style="s2">untainted with evil how do I know if my</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.340" end="00:54:41.630" style="s2">judgment is accurate and the question is</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.310" end="00:54:43.900" style="s2">well have I really done everything I</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.630" end="00:54:46.220" style="s2">possibly could to set my life straight</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.900" end="00:54:48.590" style="s2">because maybe I shouldn&#39;t be judging it</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.220" end="00:54:50.570" style="s2">its quality or the quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.590" end="00:54:52.790" style="s2">itself or being itself for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.570" end="00:54:57.080" style="s2">if I haven&#39;t done everything I possibly</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.790" end="00:54:59.750" style="s2">could to set my life straight well so</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.080" end="00:55:01.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a task Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.750" end="00:55:03.560" style="s2">who I&#39;m a great I&#39;m a great admirer of</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.820" end="00:55:05.120" style="s2">social Nets in his book The Gulag</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.560" end="00:55:06.950" style="s2">Archipelago was one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.120" end="00:55:08.510" style="s2">brought down the Soviet Union and he</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.950" end="00:55:10.820" style="s2">said that one man who stopped lying</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.510" end="00:55:13.130" style="s2">could bring down a tyranny and you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.820" end="00:55:14.750" style="s2">he said that was some authority I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.130" end="00:55:17.090" style="s2">you could easily make the case that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.750" end="00:55:18.740" style="s2">Gulag Archipelago is the greatest book</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.090" end="00:55:20.900" style="s2">of the 20th century I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.740" end="00:55:22.790" style="s2">another contender so obviously but he</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.900" end="00:55:25.100" style="s2">said when he was in the gulag camps you</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.790" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">know meditating on how the hell he got</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.100" end="00:55:27.980" style="s2">there and he had a rough life man I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:30.170" style="s2">first of all he was on the Russian front</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.980" end="00:55:31.460" style="s2">at the beginning of World War two and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.170" end="00:55:33.230" style="s2">then he was thrown in the gulag camps</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.460" end="00:55:35.390" style="s2">and that was just the beginning of his</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.230" end="00:55:37.280" style="s2">adventures man he had a rough life he</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.390" end="00:55:39.800" style="s2">was in the camps he was thinking what</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.280" end="00:55:42.260" style="s2">the hell like huh what how did I get</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.800" end="00:55:44.870" style="s2">here what&#39;s going on he had Hitler and</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.260" end="00:55:46.910" style="s2">Stalin to blame right so if you have if</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.870" end="00:55:50.030" style="s2">you need someone to blame man Hitler and</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.910" end="00:55:51.890" style="s2">Stalin that that&#39;s great but he he that</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.030" end="00:55:53.630" style="s2">isn&#39;t what he did he said he meditated</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.890" end="00:55:55.880" style="s2">for a while once he realized that he</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.630" end="00:55:57.440" style="s2">might have something to do with in some</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.880" end="00:55:58.940" style="s2">strange way with the way things turned</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.440" end="00:56:01.430" style="s2">out for him and he said he went over his</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.940" end="00:56:04.130" style="s2">life with a fine-tooth comb in his</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.430" end="00:56:06.470" style="s2">memory and thought okay where did I go</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.130" end="00:56:08.540" style="s2">wrong but by my own judgment when when</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.470" end="00:56:11.000" style="s2">when I when there was a path in front of</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.540" end="00:56:12.440" style="s2">me when did I take the path that I knew</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.000" end="00:56:15.230" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t take because you all know</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.440" end="00:56:16.700" style="s2">that right you know sometimes you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.230" end="00:56:19.220" style="s2">know if what you&#39;re doing is good or or</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.700" end="00:56:21.110" style="s2">if it&#39;s bad it&#39;s just ignorance you just</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.220" end="00:56:22.430" style="s2">don&#39;t know but sometimes you bloody well</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.110" end="00:56:24.110" style="s2">know and you do the thing you know you</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.430" end="00:56:28.280" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do anyways that happens a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.110" end="00:56:29.270" style="s2">and why do you do that spiked is part of</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.280" end="00:56:30.500" style="s2">it stupidity</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.270" end="00:56:32.060" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of reasons but you</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.500" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">certainly know you do it Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.060" end="00:56:36.500" style="s2">thought okay well what would happen if I</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:38.870" style="s2">took responsibility for where I am in</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.500" end="00:56:39.680" style="s2">this concentration camp and then I went</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.870" end="00:56:41.450" style="s2">over my whole life</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.680" end="00:56:43.550" style="s2">and tried to figure out all the things I</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.450" end="00:56:45.410" style="s2">did that were wrong by my own estimation</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.550" end="00:56:47.000" style="s2">that increased the probability that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.410" end="00:56:48.440" style="s2">would get here and then what would</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.000" end="00:56:51.470" style="s2">happen if I tried to set them all right</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.440" end="00:56:53.089" style="s2">now in the present and that&#39;s why he</p>

<p begin="00:58:55.230" end="00:58:59.130" style="s2">rewrite rule 7 coincided with one of</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:59:01.740" style="s2">those periods that lasted about a month</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.130" end="00:59:04.260" style="s2">and it was was the hardest chapter by</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.740" end="00:59:06.059" style="s2">far and it went down the deepest by far</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.260" end="00:59:09.329" style="s2">and it was really hard to get right</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.059" end="00:59:10.890" style="s2">it&#39;s called do what is meaningful not</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.329" end="00:59:12.660" style="s2">what is expedient and I&#39;ll just tell you</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.890" end="00:59:15.000" style="s2">a little bit about the chapter because I</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.660" end="00:59:16.559" style="s2">figured something out in it that and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.000" end="00:59:18.450" style="s2">then explained it something that took me</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.559" end="00:59:20.970" style="s2">decades to figure out so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.450" end="00:59:23.190" style="s2">idea it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very deep Christian</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.970" end="00:59:25.380" style="s2">idea that the Messiah is the person who</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.190" end="00:59:27.269" style="s2">takes the world&#39;s sins upon himself</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.380" end="00:59:29.190" style="s2">right that&#39;s a characteristic of Christ</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.269" end="00:59:31.079" style="s2">right it&#39;s something the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.190" end="00:59:33.240" style="s2">something like Christ died for your sins</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.079" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">like what the hell does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.240" end="00:59:37.380" style="s2">exactly you know and partly what it</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:39.240" style="s2">means and I would say a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.380" end="00:59:40.470" style="s2">corrupted form of Christianity is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.240" end="00:59:42.599" style="s2">you just have to believe that that</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.470" end="00:59:45.660" style="s2">happened in the and you&#39;re redeemed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.599" end="00:59:47.339" style="s2">like well that&#39;s we&#39;ll leave that aside</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.660" end="00:59:49.319" style="s2">for a second but there&#39;s an idea there a</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.339" end="00:59:51.569" style="s2">psychological idea and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.319" end="00:59:53.400" style="s2">because the idea doesn&#39;t go away it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.569" end="00:59:56.279" style="s2">lasted for thousands of years it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.400" end="00:59:58.349" style="s2">whoa so the idea signifies something it</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.279" end="01:00:00.299" style="s2">has a psychological reality independent</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.349" end="01:00:01.799" style="s2">of its metaphysical reality whatever</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.299" end="01:00:03.750" style="s2">that might be and so I&#39;ve thought about</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.799" end="01:00:05.460" style="s2">that for a long time it&#39;s like what in</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.750" end="01:00:07.529" style="s2">the world does that possibly mean and</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.460" end="01:00:09.329" style="s2">then I realized and you knew this Carl</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.529" end="01:00:11.910" style="s2">Jung knew this that it was associated</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.329" end="01:00:15.869" style="s2">with this idea of the shadow I had this</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.910" end="01:00:18.299" style="s2">client once who ha her parents man they</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.869" end="01:00:20.759" style="s2">were pieces of work she her parents</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.299" end="01:00:23.339" style="s2">taught her I&#39;m swear to you that this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.759" end="01:00:27.420" style="s2">the truth her parents taught her that</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.339" end="01:00:29.279" style="s2">adults were angels literally and when I</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.420" end="01:00:31.410" style="s2">saw her she was about 30 and she had a</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.279" end="01:00:34.019" style="s2">lot of strange symptoms symptoms of</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.410" end="01:00:38.369" style="s2">sorts I&#39;d never seen psychosomatic</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.019" end="01:00:41.130" style="s2">symptoms she she she had kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.369" end="01:00:42.720" style="s2">quasi epileptic seizures at night and no</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.130" end="01:00:44.160" style="s2">but she stayed conscious during them it</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.720" end="01:00:45.779" style="s2">was very difficult to understand at</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.160" end="01:00:48.200" style="s2">night I won&#39;t walk through it but her</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.779" end="01:00:51.950" style="s2">parents told her that adults were angels</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.200" end="01:00:54.640" style="s2">and and she was like 28 she had a</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.950" end="01:00:59.270" style="s2">university degree and and I said well</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.640" end="01:01:00.890" style="s2">didn&#39;t you ever wonder about that I said</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.270" end="01:01:03.260" style="s2">didn&#39;t you read any history and she said</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.890" end="01:01:04.549" style="s2">yeah what I&#39;d read something about the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.260" end="01:01:06.140" style="s2">terrible things that people did to each</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.549" end="01:01:09.049" style="s2">other and I would just compartmentalize</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.140" end="01:01:11.420" style="s2">it and that was actually the key that I</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.049" end="01:01:13.220" style="s2">used to unlock what was wrong with her</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.420" end="01:01:16.760" style="s2">which was eventually fixed and I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.220" end="01:01:18.319" style="s2">go into that but but I said I gave her</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.760" end="01:01:20.540" style="s2">this book give her two books I gave her</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.319" end="01:01:23.589" style="s2">a book called the terror that comes in</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.540" end="01:01:26.000" style="s2">the night which is a book about about</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.589" end="01:01:27.650" style="s2">sleep paralysis and nightmares because I</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.000" end="01:01:29.180" style="s2">thought that was what might&#39;ve be</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.650" end="01:01:30.589" style="s2">bothering her turned out that wasn&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.180" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">then I gave her this other book called</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.589" end="01:01:34.700" style="s2">ordinary ordinary men and it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:37.040" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.700" end="01:01:40.250" style="s2">that&#39;s a terrible book terrible dark</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:42.950" style="s2">book about about this police battalion</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.250" end="01:01:44.540" style="s2">that was moved into Poland during World</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.950" end="01:01:45.470" style="s2">War two after the Nazis had marched</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.540" end="01:01:47.329" style="s2">through and it was all made of</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.470" end="01:01:50.089" style="s2">middle-aged guys who weren&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.329" end="01:01:51.319" style="s2">victims of Nazi totalitarian propaganda</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.089" end="01:01:53.270" style="s2">when they were kids they were just you</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.319" end="01:01:57.410" style="s2">know burgeois middle class guys kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.270" end="01:02:01.910" style="s2">like all of us let&#39;s say and they went</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.410" end="01:02:03.530" style="s2">to police Poland and they were going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.910" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">have to do some terrible things</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.530" end="01:02:08.630" style="s2">essentially but their commander told</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">them quite forthrightly that if being</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.630" end="01:02:13.210" style="s2">involved in wartime policing was too</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.640" end="01:02:15.230" style="s2">hard on them if they felt that it</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.210" end="01:02:17.119" style="s2">violated the more psychological violence</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.230" end="01:02:19.309" style="s2">they could just go back to policing in</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.119" end="01:02:20.390" style="s2">Germany and very few of them did big</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.309" end="01:02:23.030" style="s2">partly because they didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.390" end="01:02:24.740" style="s2">abandon their comrades let&#39;s say they</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.030" end="01:02:26.780" style="s2">didn&#39;t want them to have to do the dirty</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.740" end="01:02:28.609" style="s2">work you know and they ended up they</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.780" end="01:02:30.230" style="s2">were normal policemen they ended up the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.609" end="01:02:31.760" style="s2">sorts of people who could take naked</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.230" end="01:02:33.109" style="s2">pregnant women out into the middle of</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.760" end="01:02:34.970" style="s2">the field and shoot them in the back of</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.109" end="01:02:37.010" style="s2">the head that&#39;s how the book that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.970" end="01:02:38.990" style="s2">culmination of their training it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.010" end="01:02:41.299" style="s2">interesting to read about their training</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.990" end="01:02:43.130" style="s2">because they were absolutely sickened by</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.299" end="01:02:46.190" style="s2">what they learned to do like physically</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.130" end="01:02:48.619" style="s2">sick and vomiting shaking traumatized</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.190" end="01:02:50.089" style="s2">but they didn&#39;t stop and and if you want</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.619" end="01:02:54.079" style="s2">to know why then you can read the book</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.089" end="01:02:56.119" style="s2">and I said look read this book but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.079" end="01:02:57.650" style="s2">bloody well compartmentalize it enough</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.119" end="01:03:00.530" style="s2">of that it&#39;s like read it like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.650" end="01:03:01.849" style="s2">one of the damn policemen which is how</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.530" end="01:03:03.949" style="s2">you should read history</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.849" end="01:03:06.199" style="s2">right you read about Nazi Germany and</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.949" end="01:03:09.339" style="s2">you think well I&#39;m Oscar Schindler I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.199" end="01:03:12.589" style="s2">saved the Jews it&#39;s like no you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.339" end="01:03:15.349" style="s2">right you wouldn&#39;t because people didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.589" end="01:03:17.269" style="s2">and the probability is very high that</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.349" end="01:03:19.489" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t and all you have to do is</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.269" end="01:03:21.170" style="s2">think it through you know and Frank it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.489" end="01:03:23.839" style="s2">like you&#39;re really gonna put your family</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.170" end="01:03:25.999" style="s2">at risk to hide a group of another</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.839" end="01:03:27.680" style="s2">family in your attic for like multiple</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.999" end="01:03:29.509" style="s2">years while there&#39;s Nazis parading the</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.680" end="01:03:31.809" style="s2">street and where if you get exposed you</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.509" end="01:03:34.729" style="s2">all die you&#39;re gonna do that are you</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.809" end="01:03:36.199" style="s2">it&#39;s like very unlikely and and and no</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.729" end="01:03:37.430" style="s2">wonder it&#39;s not surprising that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.199" end="01:03:39.349" style="s2">unlikely but you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.430" end="01:03:41.390" style="s2">inflating yourself with self you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.349" end="01:03:42.709" style="s2">with with fictional heroism without</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.390" end="01:03:45.049" style="s2">actually knowing the facts on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.709" end="01:03:49.579" style="s2">so I told her to read read it and to</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.049" end="01:03:53.979" style="s2">understand that the policemen were her</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.579" end="01:04:01.459" style="s2">and that&#39;s the thing to understand</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.979" end="01:04:03.799" style="s2">well the idea that the savior is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.459" end="01:04:06.650" style="s2">person who takes the world sins upon</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.799" end="01:04:10.819" style="s2">himself is exactly that it&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.650" end="01:04:13.670" style="s2">same idea it&#39;s like the way that there</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.819" end="01:04:16.729" style="s2">stops being Nazis is for you to know</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.670" end="01:04:19.249" style="s2">that the Nazis were you and for you to</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.729" end="01:04:21.170" style="s2">decide not to do that again but you have</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.249" end="01:04:23.749" style="s2">to know you see this is the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.170" end="01:04:25.999" style="s2">people won&#39;t do you have to understand</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.749" end="01:04:27.619" style="s2">that you could not only do what the Nazi</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.999" end="01:04:29.059" style="s2">camp guards did in office but that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.619" end="01:04:31.910" style="s2">could all actually enjoy it</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.059" end="01:04:33.049" style="s2">and then you have to decide that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.910" end="01:04:35.269" style="s2">not going to do that anymore</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.049" end="01:04:37.489" style="s2">and that&#39;s not an easy thing to figure</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.269" end="01:04:39.829" style="s2">out well then that&#39;s what that chapters</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.489" end="01:04:41.779" style="s2">about so that&#39;s a rough chapter man</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.829" end="01:04:43.579" style="s2">that&#39;s a rough chapter and that&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.779" end="01:04:45.920" style="s2">bit of what it&#39;s about you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.579" end="01:04:50.539" style="s2">a lot of there&#39;s a lot in there and and</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.920" end="01:04:51.640" style="s2">that&#39;s anyway so that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.539" end="01:05:02.479" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.640" end="01:05:04.249" style="s2">chapter Tim oh yes chapter nine is</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.479" end="01:05:06.219" style="s2">assume that the person you are listening</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.249" end="01:05:09.229" style="s2">to might know something you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.219" end="01:05:10.759" style="s2">this is a chapter about conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.229" end="01:05:13.690" style="s2">about the different forms conversation</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.759" end="01:05:15.569" style="s2">takes and it&#39;s a chapter about humility</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.690" end="01:05:18.239" style="s2">and it&#39;s a chapter boat</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.569" end="01:05:20.160" style="s2">listening and humility element is took</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.239" end="01:05:22.410" style="s2">me a long time to understand why there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.160" end="01:05:24.749" style="s2">religious injunctions supporting</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.410" end="01:05:25.859" style="s2">humility to even understand what the</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.749" end="01:05:27.390" style="s2">word really meant and that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.859" end="01:05:29.160" style="s2">technical sense and it means something</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.390" end="01:05:31.069" style="s2">like this it means what you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.160" end="01:05:34.019" style="s2">is more important than what you know and</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.069" end="01:05:35.430" style="s2">that&#39;s a lovely thing too then then what</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.019" end="01:05:37.469" style="s2">you don&#39;t know can start to be your</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.430" end="01:05:39.329" style="s2">friend you see people are very defensive</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.469" end="01:05:41.599" style="s2">about what they know and for the reasons</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.329" end="01:05:44.579" style="s2">we&#39;ve already discussed but the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.599" end="01:05:45.719" style="s2">you don&#39;t know enough and the rete you</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.579" end="01:05:47.640" style="s2">can tell you don&#39;t know enough because</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.719" end="01:05:49.559" style="s2">your life is not what it could be and</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.640" end="01:05:52.410" style="s2">neither is the life of the people around</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.559" end="01:05:54.779" style="s2">you you just don&#39;t know enough and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.410" end="01:05:57.089" style="s2">what that means is that every time you</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.779" end="01:05:59.039" style="s2">encounter some evidence that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.089" end="01:06:00.420" style="s2">ignorant someone points it out you</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.039" end="01:06:02.579" style="s2">should be happy about that because you</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.420" end="01:06:05.640" style="s2">think oh you just told me how I&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.579" end="01:06:07.619" style="s2">it&#39;s like great like maybe I had to sift</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.640" end="01:06:09.479" style="s2">through a lot of nonsense to get through</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.619" end="01:06:10.799" style="s2">the real message that you&#39;re telling me</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.479" end="01:06:12.539" style="s2">but if you could actually tell me</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.799" end="01:06:14.219" style="s2">someway that I&#39;m wrong and then maybe</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.539" end="01:06:15.690" style="s2">give me a hint about how to not be wrong</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.219" end="01:06:17.519" style="s2">like that well then I wouldn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.690" end="01:06:19.619" style="s2">be wrong like that any more that that</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.519" end="01:06:22.140" style="s2">would be a good thing and and you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.619" end="01:06:24.690" style="s2">you can you can embark on that adventure</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.140" end="01:06:26.880" style="s2">by listening to people and if you listen</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.690" end="01:06:28.709" style="s2">to people they will tell you they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.880" end="01:06:30.329" style="s2">tell you amazing things if you listen to</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.709" end="01:06:31.859" style="s2">them and many of those things are little</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.329" end="01:06:33.630" style="s2">tools that you can put in your toolkit</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.859" end="01:06:35.579" style="s2">like Batman and then you can go out into</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.630" end="01:06:37.410" style="s2">the world and use those tools and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.579" end="01:06:39.959" style="s2">don&#39;t have to fall blindly into a pit</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.410" end="01:06:42.539" style="s2">quite as often and so the humility</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.959" end="01:06:46.380" style="s2">element is well do you want to be right</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.539" end="01:06:47.880" style="s2">or do you want to be learning and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.380" end="01:06:50.369" style="s2">deeper than that it&#39;s do you want to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.880" end="01:06:52.529" style="s2">the the tyrannical king who&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.369" end="01:06:54.660" style="s2">got everything figured out or do you</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.529" end="01:06:56.910" style="s2">want to be the continually transforming</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.660" end="01:06:59.459" style="s2">hero or fool for that matter who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.910" end="01:07:02.549" style="s2">getting better all the time and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.459" end="01:07:05.339" style="s2">actually a choice you know it&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.549" end="01:07:08.400" style="s2">choice and it&#39;s better to be the self</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.339" end="01:07:10.140" style="s2">transforming fool who&#39;s humble enough to</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.400" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">make friends with what he or she doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.140" end="01:07:14.969" style="s2">know and to listen when people talk and</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:17.190" style="s2">listening is a transformative exercise</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.969" end="01:07:18.479" style="s2">like if if you listen to the people in</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.190" end="01:07:20.670" style="s2">your life for example if you actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.479" end="01:07:22.109" style="s2">listen to them they&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.670" end="01:07:24.180" style="s2">wrong with them and how to fix it and</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.109" end="01:07:25.739" style="s2">what they want they can&#39;t even help it</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.180" end="01:07:27.749" style="s2">if you start listening because people</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.739" end="01:07:28.950" style="s2">are so shocked if you actually listen to</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.749" end="01:07:30.390" style="s2">them that they</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.950" end="01:07:32.040" style="s2">tell you all sorts of things that they</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.390" end="01:07:34.170" style="s2">might not have even intended to things</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.040" end="01:07:35.700" style="s2">they don&#39;t even know and then you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.170" end="01:07:38.099" style="s2">you can work with that</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.700" end="01:07:39.780" style="s2">and so and the other thing that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.099" end="01:07:41.579" style="s2">interesting you know now and then you</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.780" end="01:07:42.869" style="s2">have a meaningful conversation right you</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.579" end="01:07:44.280" style="s2">don&#39;t have a good conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.869" end="01:07:46.530" style="s2">someone you walk when you think geez you</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.280" end="01:07:48.300" style="s2">know what we really connected and I know</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.530" end="01:07:49.859" style="s2">more than I did when I came away from</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.300" end="01:07:51.510" style="s2">that conversation and during the</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.859" end="01:07:54.599" style="s2">conversation you&#39;re really engrossed in</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.510" end="01:07:56.849" style="s2">it and that that that feeling of being</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.599" end="01:07:58.380" style="s2">engrossed is a feeling of meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.849" end="01:08:00.240" style="s2">the feeling of meaning is engendered</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.380" end="01:08:02.190" style="s2">because you&#39;re having a transformative</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.240" end="01:08:03.750" style="s2">conversation your brain produces that</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.190" end="01:08:05.640" style="s2">feeling of meaning for it says oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.750" end="01:08:08.070" style="s2">this is exactly where you should be</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.640" end="01:08:10.020" style="s2">right here now it&#39;s it&#39;s the right place</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.070" end="01:08:12.420" style="s2">and time for you and that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.020" end="01:08:14.220" style="s2">place to occupy and so a good</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.420" end="01:08:16.380" style="s2">conversation where people are listening</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.220" end="01:08:18.120" style="s2">has exactly that nature and the reason</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.380" end="01:08:19.920" style="s2">it has that nature is because it is in</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.120" end="01:08:22.440" style="s2">fact transformative it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.920" end="01:08:24.660" style="s2">truisms of clinical psychology like if</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.440" end="01:08:26.219" style="s2">you&#39;re a clinical psychologist a huge</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.660" end="01:08:28.890" style="s2">part of what you do is just listen to</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.219" end="01:08:31.109" style="s2">people it&#39;s like you know old they come</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.890" end="01:08:34.049" style="s2">in they&#39;re unhappy and they&#39;d rather not</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.109" end="01:08:35.700" style="s2">be something like that you say well why</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.049" end="01:08:37.739" style="s2">do you think you might be unhappy and</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.700" end="01:08:39.719" style="s2">they don&#39;t know they have some ideas</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.739" end="01:08:41.370" style="s2">they may have to ramble around for like</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.719" end="01:08:43.170" style="s2">a year before they figure out why</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.370" end="01:08:45.420" style="s2">they&#39;re unhappy they get rid of a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.170" end="01:08:47.190" style="s2">of reasons why they thought they were</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.420" end="01:08:48.390" style="s2">unhappy that are untrue and then you</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.190" end="01:08:51.150" style="s2">kind of get to the heart of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.390" end="01:08:53.009" style="s2">then you might ask them all if you could</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.150" end="01:08:55.290" style="s2">have what you wanted so that your life</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.009" end="01:08:57.420" style="s2">would be okay what would that look like</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.290" end="01:08:58.650" style="s2">then they have to ramble around a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.420" end="01:09:01.410" style="s2">about that because they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.650" end="01:09:03.210" style="s2">know but the listening will straighten</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.410" end="01:09:05.850" style="s2">them out because people think by talking</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.210" end="01:09:07.620" style="s2">and in order to think you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.850" end="01:09:09.660" style="s2">someone to listen because it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.620" end="01:09:11.549" style="s2">to think hardly anyone can think and</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.660" end="01:09:13.170" style="s2">even the people who can think can only</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.549" end="01:09:15.839" style="s2">think about a limited number of things</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.170" end="01:09:17.460" style="s2">but almost everybody can talk and you</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.839" end="01:09:19.380" style="s2">can listen to yourself talk and if</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.460" end="01:09:21.900" style="s2">someone listens to you then well then</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.380" end="01:09:23.430" style="s2">you also have a foil for your thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.900" end="01:09:24.719" style="s2">right because you can watch the person</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.430" end="01:09:26.430" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking and see if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.719" end="01:09:28.350" style="s2">boring or see if you&#39;re amusing or if</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.430" end="01:09:31.500" style="s2">you&#39;re engrossing all of those things</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.350" end="01:09:31.920" style="s2">and so listening that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.500" end="01:09:34.350" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.920" end="01:09:36.120" style="s2">hi outline of Carl Rogers dictum he was</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.350" end="01:09:38.880" style="s2">a famous clinical psychologist this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.120" end="01:09:40.620" style="s2">another great little tip Roger said</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.880" end="01:09:42.900" style="s2">here&#39;s a trick to tell if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.620" end="01:09:45.089" style="s2">listening so let&#39;s say someone lays</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.900" end="01:09:46.890" style="s2">out there perspective for you and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.089" end="01:09:49.589" style="s2">what you do is say look here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.890" end="01:09:51.799" style="s2">think you said I think you said this and</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.589" end="01:09:54.210" style="s2">this and this and this and then this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.799" end="01:09:56.370" style="s2">that right have I got what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.210" end="01:09:59.190" style="s2">right and maybe the person says it&#39;s God</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.370" end="01:10:00.179" style="s2">you don&#39;t be listening at all and you</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.190" end="01:10:02.340" style="s2">know then they have to straighten you</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.179" end="01:10:02.640" style="s2">out or maybe they say yeah yeah you got</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.340" end="01:10:05.580" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.640" end="01:10:07.409" style="s2">and then the nice thing about that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.580" end="01:10:08.880" style="s2">that you summarize their argument for</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.409" end="01:10:12.090" style="s2">them which can be very helpful and for</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.880" end="01:10:14.070" style="s2">you but also you don&#39;t get to make the</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.090" end="01:10:15.449" style="s2">person into a straw man so like if</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.070" end="01:10:17.880" style="s2">you&#39;re arguing with your wife let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.449" end="01:10:21.449" style="s2">or your husband big party is gonna want</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.880" end="01:10:23.460" style="s2">to win not stupid because if you win you</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.449" end="01:10:25.980" style="s2">get to be top Lobster but they get to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.460" end="01:10:28.020" style="s2">bottom Lobster and if you want to live</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.980" end="01:10:30.210" style="s2">with bottom lobster then like more power</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.020" end="01:10:31.860" style="s2">to you but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it right</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.210" end="01:10:33.659" style="s2">because you don&#39;t want that you want to</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.860" end="01:10:35.940" style="s2">you want to defeat your wife in an</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.659" end="01:10:38.640" style="s2">argument oh well great like if she was</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.940" end="01:10:40.800" style="s2">gonna disappear tomorrow no problem but</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.640" end="01:10:43.320" style="s2">like you&#39;re gonna like live with</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.800" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">defeated miserable her for the next week</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.320" end="01:10:47.580" style="s2">that&#39;s no good so you listen and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.840" end="01:10:49.170" style="s2">think okay well here&#39;s here&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.580" end="01:10:50.909" style="s2">what I think you said and maybe even</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.170" end="01:10:53.460" style="s2">make it a little stronger and more</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.909" end="01:10:55.110" style="s2">elaborated than was the case with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.460" end="01:10:57.060" style="s2">original utterance so that you get the</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.110" end="01:10:59.000" style="s2">damn argument right and cuz you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.060" end="01:11:02.670" style="s2">want to win you want to fix the problem</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.000" end="01:11:04.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the winning and so the summary</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.670" end="01:11:06.840" style="s2">with listening is so useful for that</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.440" end="01:11:08.130" style="s2">because the person can say well yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.840" end="01:11:09.239" style="s2">that&#39;s what I meant</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.130" end="01:11:10.830" style="s2">it&#39;s like then well then you have to</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.239" end="01:11:12.840" style="s2">grapple without and Roger said well</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.830" end="01:11:14.699" style="s2">people we usually won&#39;t because you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.840" end="01:11:17.010" style="s2">if you live with someone and they tell</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.699" end="01:11:18.810" style="s2">you the truth about the situation it</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.010" end="01:11:21.000" style="s2">usually means that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.810" end="01:11:22.440" style="s2">really stupid that you&#39;re doing you want</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.000" end="01:11:23.790" style="s2">them to but there&#39;s something stupid</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.440" end="01:11:26.070" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing that you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.790" end="01:11:28.170" style="s2">doing that you actually have to stop and</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.070" end="01:11:30.750" style="s2">you know that&#39;s difficult and unlikely</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.170" end="01:11:32.610" style="s2">but well if you don&#39;t stop then you get</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.750" end="01:11:34.409" style="s2">to have the same damn problem every day</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.610" end="01:11:36.480" style="s2">or every week for the rest of your life</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.409" end="01:11:38.370" style="s2">so it&#39;s probably better to undergo the</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.480" end="01:11:40.890" style="s2">misery of stopping it than the misery of</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.370" end="01:11:46.409" style="s2">continuing it but that&#39;s the injunction</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.890" end="01:11:48.380" style="s2">to listen rule 11 is don&#39;t bother</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.409" end="01:11:52.830" style="s2">children when they&#39;re skateboarding and</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.380" end="01:11:55.679" style="s2">that&#39;s a meditation on the difference</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.830" end="01:11:56.650" style="s2">between weakness and goodness you see</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.679" end="01:11:59.050" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.650" end="01:12:01.690" style="s2">happened in our society and especially</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.050" end="01:12:03.610" style="s2">with regards to our attitude towards men</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.690" end="01:12:05.980" style="s2">but also our attitude towards the</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.610" end="01:12:08.409" style="s2">masculinity and women so it&#39;s just as</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.980" end="01:12:10.510" style="s2">toxic for women is that we seem to have</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.409" end="01:12:12.420" style="s2">concluded that strong men are dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.510" end="01:12:14.530" style="s2">and that&#39;s partly because we think</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.420" end="01:12:16.270" style="s2">Western culture is a tyrannical</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.530" end="01:12:18.250" style="s2">patriarchy and the only reason you get</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.270" end="01:12:20.739" style="s2">to the top is because you misuse power</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.250" end="01:12:22.870" style="s2">and so all the men who are at the top of</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.739" end="01:12:24.940" style="s2">the Harkey are all misusing their power</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.870" end="01:12:27.699" style="s2">and they&#39;re all tyrannical and all the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.940" end="01:12:29.800" style="s2">guys who have the aim and ambition to</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.699" end="01:12:31.600" style="s2">achieve that or just tyrants in training</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.800" end="01:12:33.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of the basic attitude</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.600" end="01:12:36.219" style="s2">that we have towards our own culture and</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.640" end="01:12:39.690" style="s2">towards young men now and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.219" end="01:12:42.130" style="s2">there&#39;s everything about that is</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.690" end="01:12:45.010" style="s2">pathological and inexcusable and</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.130" end="01:12:46.110" style="s2">shameful I mean first the claim that</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.010" end="01:12:55.980" style="s2">Western culture</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.110" end="01:12:58.389" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.980" end="01:13:03.360" style="s2">the idea that Western culture is</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.389" end="01:13:03.360" style="s2">primarily a patriarchal tyranny is like</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.690" end="01:13:08.469" style="s2">well first of all it&#39;s it&#39;s historically</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.099" end="01:13:11.199" style="s2">ignorant beyond belief because what are</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.469" end="01:13:12.820" style="s2">you compared to what exactly how many</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.199" end="01:13:16.239" style="s2">civilized countries are there in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.820" end="01:13:19.659" style="s2">world you know three dozen the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.239" end="01:13:21.519" style="s2">them are run by brutal thugs right and</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.659" end="01:13:24.489" style="s2">it isn&#39;t just thugs at the top man</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.519" end="01:13:25.929" style="s2">because that isn&#39;t how it works in in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.489" end="01:13:27.400" style="s2">country that&#39;s corrupt the corruption is</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.929" end="01:13:30.550" style="s2">spread through the entire country</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.400" end="01:13:33.070" style="s2">so and we&#39;re not like that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.550" end="01:13:35.079" style="s2">that I mean Western culture is</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.070" end="01:13:37.510" style="s2">fundamentally honest and I can give an</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.079" end="01:13:38.199" style="s2">example of that because people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.510" end="01:13:41.920" style="s2">like that idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.199" end="01:13:43.179" style="s2">eBay proved that cuz here here it did it</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.920" end="01:13:45.849" style="s2">did it was a very interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.179" end="01:13:47.409" style="s2">because when a eBay first popped up like</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.849" end="01:13:50.139" style="s2">the cynic would say eBay is not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.409" end="01:13:51.820" style="s2">work because I don&#39;t know you you live</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.139" end="01:13:54.010" style="s2">on the other side of the country you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.820" end="01:13:56.380" style="s2">gonna send me junk and I&#39;m gonna send</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.010" end="01:13:59.590" style="s2">you a check that bounces and that&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.380" end="01:14:02.139" style="s2">the end of eBay right right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.590" end="01:14:03.909" style="s2">a cynic would say and then what happened</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.139" end="01:14:05.739" style="s2">was that brokers popped up and they say</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.909" end="01:14:08.019" style="s2">well look we&#39;ll guarantee the exchange</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.739" end="01:14:09.340" style="s2">rights for a fee 10% we&#39;ll make sure</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.019" end="01:14:11.139" style="s2">that you don&#39;t send junk and we&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.340" end="01:14:13.900" style="s2">sure your check doesn&#39;t bounce and what</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.139" end="01:14:16.030" style="s2">happened was the brokers couldn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.900" end="01:14:19.090" style="s2">enough business and the reason for that</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.030" end="01:14:21.670" style="s2">was all the transactions were honest all</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.090" end="01:14:22.989" style="s2">of them you know it&#39;s like 19 if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.670" end="01:14:25.119" style="s2">were on eBay and you have a reputation</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.989" end="01:14:27.309" style="s2">of less than 99 percent there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.119" end="01:14:29.559" style="s2">something wrong with you you know okay</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.309" end="01:14:31.989" style="s2">98 percent but really it&#39;s that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.559" end="01:14:34.960" style="s2">that tight and so the default position</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.989" end="01:14:37.210" style="s2">was you&#39;re offering this I&#39;ll buy it</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.960" end="01:14:39.579" style="s2">we&#39;ll make the exchange fairly and what</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.210" end="01:14:41.710" style="s2">happened was a bunch of capital that was</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.579" end="01:14:43.239" style="s2">frozen technically speaking junk that</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.710" end="01:14:45.219" style="s2">people had that other people could meet</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.239" end="01:14:47.289" style="s2">got freed up and he Bey freed up a</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.219" end="01:14:49.539" style="s2">tremendous amount of money for people</p>

<p begin="01:15:13.400" end="01:15:18.170" style="s2">masculine and I read it partly as a</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.280" end="01:15:20.150" style="s2">continuation of what Nietzsche announced</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.170" end="01:15:22.640" style="s2">back in the late 1800s as the death of</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.150" end="01:15:25.040" style="s2">God right because in Western culture God</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.640" end="01:15:27.080" style="s2">was a masculine figure and the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.040" end="01:15:28.670" style="s2">the divine masculine had been decimated</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.080" end="01:15:30.140" style="s2">which was basically Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.670" end="01:15:32.870" style="s2">pronouncement has filtered all the way</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.140" end="01:15:36.110" style="s2">down to masculinity itself and I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.870" end="01:15:38.570" style="s2">that&#39;s an absolutely appalling outcome</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.110" end="01:15:40.430" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s something that could only</p>

<p begin="01:15:48.470" end="01:15:52.070" style="s2">in particular but young women as well</p>

<p begin="01:16:08.350" end="01:16:12.610" style="s2">it&#39;s no joke</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.850" end="01:16:16.940" style="s2">we need all the light we can possibly</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.610" end="01:16:18.890" style="s2">bring to bear on the situation and when</p>

<p begin="01:16:18.890" end="01:16:24.020" style="s2">for all sorts of reasons and I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.840" end="01:16:25.520" style="s2">there are very deep reasons and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.020" end="01:16:27.620" style="s2">partly why I would say rules to life</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.520" end="01:16:29.210" style="s2">also has it&#39;s a funny book because it</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.620" end="01:16:31.610" style="s2">has a very religious core but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.210" end="01:16:35.090" style="s2">very heavily grounded in evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.610" end="01:16:37.790" style="s2">biology so but that&#39;s what chapter 11 is</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.090" end="01:16:40.280" style="s2">about and it&#39;s about people who are the</p>

<p begin="01:16:40.280" end="01:16:43.730" style="s2">the people who restrict children&#39;s play</p>

<p begin="01:16:45.500" end="01:16:50.060" style="s2">movement now to not let children have</p>

<p begin="01:16:54.140" end="01:16:57.350" style="s2">many things wrong with that idea that</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.640" end="01:16:59.600" style="s2">would take an entire another lecture</p>

<p begin="01:17:28.040" end="01:17:32.900" style="s2">and when she was between the ages of 14</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.829" end="01:17:34.489" style="s2">and 16 at first destroyed her hip which</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.900" end="01:17:36.920" style="s2">had to be replaced and then it destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.489" end="01:17:40.159" style="s2">the ankle on her other leg which had to</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.920" end="01:17:42.020" style="s2">be replaced and she walked around for</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.159" end="01:17:44.270" style="s2">two years on broken legs and she was</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.020" end="01:17:47.030" style="s2">taking massive doses of opiates and</p>

<p begin="01:17:47.030" end="01:17:50.150" style="s2">had this advanced autoimmune disease</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.619" end="01:17:51.980" style="s2">which produced all sorts of other</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.150" end="01:17:53.690" style="s2">symptoms that were just as bad as the</p>

<p begin="01:17:53.690" end="01:17:58.400" style="s2">to describe and so it&#39;s just bloody</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.090" end="01:18:00.440" style="s2">brutal you know and as a test of your</p>

<p begin="01:18:09.079" end="01:18:13.909" style="s2">on well what to do in a situation like</p>

<p begin="01:18:19.159" end="01:18:23.329" style="s2">in crisis and so it&#39;s a disc it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:18:23.329" end="01:18:26.780" style="s2">sorts of things like in one of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.500" end="01:18:29.750" style="s2">things you do when you&#39;re overwhelmed by</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.780" end="01:18:31.400" style="s2">crisis is you shorten your timeframe you</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.750" end="01:18:33.230" style="s2">know it&#39;s like you can&#39;t think about</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.400" end="01:18:34.790" style="s2">next month maybe you can&#39;t even bloody</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.230" end="01:18:37.489" style="s2">well think about next week or maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.790" end="01:18:39.800" style="s2">even tomorrow you know because now is</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.489" end="01:18:41.420" style="s2">just so overwhelming that that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.800" end="01:18:43.969" style="s2">there is it&#39;s like and that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.420" end="01:18:45.949" style="s2">do you cut your timeframe back until you</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.969" end="01:18:47.599" style="s2">can cope with it and if it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.949" end="01:18:49.219" style="s2">next week that you see how to get</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.599" end="01:18:50.840" style="s2">through then it&#39;s the next day and if</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.219" end="01:18:53.570" style="s2">it&#39;s not the next day then it&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.840" end="01:18:56.480" style="s2">hour and if it&#39;s not the next hour then</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.570" end="01:19:00.349" style="s2">it&#39;s the next minute and you know people</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.480" end="01:19:04.969" style="s2">are very very very very tough and it</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.349" end="01:19:06.469" style="s2">turns out that if you face things it</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.969" end="01:19:08.059" style="s2">turns out that if you face things that</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.469" end="01:19:09.559" style="s2">you can put up with a lot more than you</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.059" end="01:19:12.530" style="s2">think you can put up with and you can do</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.559" end="01:19:15.590" style="s2">it without becoming corrupted and she</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.530" end="01:19:18.169" style="s2">did recover quite quite fully and much</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.590" end="01:19:19.459" style="s2">as a consequence of her own machination</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.169" end="01:19:20.749" style="s2">because she figured out what was wrong</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.459" end="01:19:22.760" style="s2">with her and then took the necessary</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.749" end="01:19:24.709" style="s2">steps to fix it which is nothing short</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.760" end="01:19:28.760" style="s2">of a bloody miracle as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.709" end="01:19:31.459" style="s2">concerned and anyway as part of the the</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.760" end="01:19:33.439" style="s2">the cat bit is I actually start by</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.459" end="01:19:35.419" style="s2">talking about our dog who actually died</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.439" end="01:19:38.899" style="s2">about a year ago but he&#39;s still alive in</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.419" end="01:19:41.209" style="s2">the book I you know I let people know</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.899" end="01:19:42.800" style="s2">cuz dog lovers love dogs and if you love</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.209" end="01:19:45.320" style="s2">cats then they think you don&#39;t like dogs</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.800" end="01:19:46.579" style="s2">and they don&#39;t like you so I also</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.320" end="01:19:48.079" style="s2">pointed out at the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.579" end="01:19:50.840" style="s2">chapter that you know if you want to pet</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.079" end="01:19:52.010" style="s2">a dog on the street that&#39;s okay too so</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.840" end="01:19:55.369" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to get up in arms about</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.010" end="01:19:57.050" style="s2">it but but the idea is that you know you</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.369" end="01:19:59.389" style="s2">have to be alert when you&#39;re suffering</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.050" end="01:19:59.659" style="s2">you have to be alert to the beauty in</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.389" end="01:20:02.570" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.659" end="01:20:03.769" style="s2">the unexpected beauty in life and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.570" end="01:20:05.209" style="s2">kind of what I was trying to get across</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.769" end="01:20:06.800" style="s2">with the idea of the cat there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.209" end="01:20:08.479" style="s2">cat that lives across the street from us</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.800" end="01:20:10.219" style="s2">called ginger and ginger is a Siamese</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.479" end="01:20:12.229" style="s2">cat and cats really aren&#39;t domesticated</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.219" end="01:20:13.849" style="s2">they technically speaking they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.229" end="01:20:16.550" style="s2">wild animals but they kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.849" end="01:20:18.530" style="s2">people god only knows why but they do</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.550" end="01:20:20.510" style="s2">you know and so ginger will come</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.530" end="01:20:22.729" style="s2">wandering over and our dog looks at her</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.510" end="01:20:24.769" style="s2">but they&#39;re friends and she rolls over</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.729" end="01:20:26.959" style="s2">on his back and Siegel used to you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.769" end="01:20:28.789" style="s2">knows are a bit and and then she kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.959" end="01:20:30.499" style="s2">mosey over and let you pet her if she</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.789" end="01:20:32.959" style="s2">was feeling like it&#39;s out day and you</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.499" end="01:20:35.380" style="s2">know you have to look for those little</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.959" end="01:20:38.119" style="s2">bit of that little bit of sparkling</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.380" end="01:20:39.800" style="s2">crystal in the darkness when things are</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.119" end="01:20:41.300" style="s2">bad you have to look and see where</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.800" end="01:20:43.130" style="s2">things are still beautiful and where</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.300" end="01:20:45.590" style="s2">there&#39;s still something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.130" end="01:20:48.019" style="s2">sustaining and you know you narrow your</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.590" end="01:20:50.179" style="s2">timeframe and you&#39;d be grateful for what</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.019" end="01:20:53.389" style="s2">you have and that can get you through</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.179" end="01:20:55.639" style="s2">some very dark times and maybe even</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.389" end="01:20:57.889" style="s2">successfully if you&#39;re lucky but even if</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.639" end="01:21:01.610" style="s2">unsuccessfully then maybe it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.889" end="01:21:03.679" style="s2">tragic and not absolute hell and you can</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.610" end="01:21:06.559" style="s2">do that you know in the worst situation</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.679" end="01:21:09.110" style="s2">you can make it only tragic and not held</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.559" end="01:21:10.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s a big gap between tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.110" end="01:21:13.280" style="s2">and hell you know there&#39;s nothing worse</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.760" end="01:21:16.159" style="s2">at a deathbed than to see the people</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.280" end="01:21:19.099" style="s2">there fighting the death is bad enough</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.159" end="01:21:20.329" style="s2">but you can take that as terrible as it</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.099" end="01:21:23.269" style="s2">is and make it into something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.329" end="01:21:24.590" style="s2">absolutely unbearable and maybe I think</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.269" end="01:21:26.689" style="s2">and this is sort of what I closed the</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.590" end="01:21:29.090" style="s2">book with is this idea is that if we</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.689" end="01:21:31.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t all attempt to make terrible</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.090" end="01:21:32.900" style="s2">things even worse than they are</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.160" end="01:21:34.640" style="s2">then maybe we could tolerate the</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.900" end="01:21:36.800" style="s2">terrible things that we have to put up</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.640" end="01:21:38.390" style="s2">with in order to exist and maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.800" end="01:21:39.920" style="s2">could make the world into a better place</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.390" end="01:21:41.570" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s what we should be</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.920" end="01:21:43.150" style="s2">doing and what we could be doing because</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.570" end="01:21:47.390" style="s2">we don&#39;t have anything better to do and</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.150" end="01:21:51.790" style="s2">that&#39;s what the book is about and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.390" end="01:21:51.790" style="s2">the end of 12 rules for life</p>

<p begin="01:22:34.110" end="01:22:39.660" style="s2">I would have sort of cut the talk and</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.500" end="01:22:41.190" style="s2">done something say we can have questions</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.660" end="01:22:43.680" style="s2">but I really didn&#39;t think it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.190" end="01:22:46.740" style="s2">appropriate this evening&#39;s talk was</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.680" end="01:22:48.660" style="s2">absolute luminous and inspiring but sir</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.740" end="01:22:51.750" style="s2">I&#39;m going to do one question one</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.660" end="01:22:54.120" style="s2">question only and and I&#39;m going to leave</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.750" end="01:22:56.160" style="s2">Jordan to actually decide what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.120" end="01:22:58.530" style="s2">question he&#39;s going to ask so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.160" end="01:23:00.480" style="s2">to take three from the audience I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:23:05.130" end="01:23:10.860" style="s2">live stream it&#39;s how do you challenge</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.660" end="01:23:12.810" style="s2">the identity politics of today the</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.860" end="01:23:15.870" style="s2">second is a more personal one is word</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.810" end="01:23:18.360" style="s2">you fall short yourself in these twelve</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.870" end="01:23:20.820" style="s2">rules and is it a constant adjustment</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.360" end="01:23:23.670" style="s2">and now let me take three questions from</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.820" end="01:23:25.920" style="s2">the audience and I&#39;ll leave Jordan to</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.670" end="01:23:33.200" style="s2">then decide which is the last question</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.920" end="01:23:35.610" style="s2">that he wants to ask so first hand there</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.200" end="01:23:39.540" style="s2">first of all it&#39;s an honor to be at your</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.610" end="01:23:41.820" style="s2">lecture and the question is I wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.540" end="01:23:43.710" style="s2">ask like for example some people like</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.820" end="01:23:47.990" style="s2">for example stefan molyneux who</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.710" end="01:23:51.650" style="s2">interviewed you puts I think tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.990" end="01:23:54.260" style="s2">attention to admitting Falls of parents</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.650" end="01:23:56.910" style="s2">and admitting the harm that was done</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.260" end="01:23:59.580" style="s2">when getting better and working through</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.910" end="01:24:01.650" style="s2">adversive childhood experience and I</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.580" end="01:24:10.500" style="s2">wanted to ask you about about that what</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.650" end="01:24:13.850" style="s2">you think about that my question is</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.500" end="01:24:15.780" style="s2">about chapter 9 about being humble and</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.850" end="01:24:18.510" style="s2">listening to what your enemies are</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.780" end="01:24:21.590" style="s2">saying and criticizing him and I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.510" end="01:24:24.840" style="s2">kind of first and who kind of speak</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.590" end="01:24:28.440" style="s2">speak my thoughts so I I speak them to</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.840" end="01:24:33.810" style="s2">my friends and see how they bounce at</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.440" end="01:24:37.260" style="s2">them as so I noticed that there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.810" end="01:24:39.770" style="s2">a group of my friends who always</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.260" end="01:24:42.790" style="s2">criticize what I&#39;m saying and not even</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.770" end="01:24:46.270" style="s2">try to understand what I&#39;m Karl</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.790" end="01:24:48.640" style="s2">I&#39;m coming from and I&#39;ve always wondered</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.270" end="01:24:52.000" style="s2">how to deal with that I mean I want to</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.640" end="01:24:53.590" style="s2">listen to what they are saying but they</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.000" end="01:24:55.540" style="s2">are not understanding what I&#39;m they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.590" end="01:24:57.390" style="s2">not trying to listen to what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.540" end="01:25:01.060" style="s2">so what would you do in that situation</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.390" end="01:25:03.850" style="s2">very briefly okay there&#39;s a line in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.060" end="01:25:07.720" style="s2">New Testament that&#39;s relevant to that do</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.850" end="01:25:09.280" style="s2">not cast pearls before swine and what</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.720" end="01:25:12.160" style="s2">that means is that if people are not</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.280" end="01:25:14.860" style="s2">listening to you stop talking to them</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.160" end="01:25:16.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s really that is the best piece</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.860" end="01:25:19.000" style="s2">of advice that I can give you and what</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.390" end="01:25:20.530" style="s2">happens is is that if you stop talking</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.000" end="01:25:23.710" style="s2">to people who aren&#39;t listening to you</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.530" end="01:25:26.200" style="s2">and start watching them instead they</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.710" end="01:25:28.330" style="s2">will tell you what they&#39;re up to but so</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.200" end="01:25:29.470" style="s2">if you have things to say you say them</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.330" end="01:25:31.870" style="s2">but you find people that will listen</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.470" end="01:25:34.000" style="s2">talk to them the ones who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.870" end="01:25:36.130" style="s2">listening pull back because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.000" end="01:25:37.630" style="s2">you&#39;re devaluing what you have to say by</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.130" end="01:25:40.120" style="s2">offering it to an audience that does</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.630" end="01:25:43.000" style="s2">nothing but reject it and that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.120" end="01:25:44.320" style="s2">guideline to life in general so pull</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.000" end="01:25:48.070" style="s2">back yep</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.320" end="01:25:53.470" style="s2">and our last question is gentleman over</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.070" end="01:25:55.090" style="s2">there with thee in blue thank you</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.470" end="01:25:56.530" style="s2">it brought smile to my face when you</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.090" end="01:25:59.260" style="s2">mentioned the work of John Taylor Gatto</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.530" end="01:26:01.150" style="s2">and I just wanted to know what you think</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.260" end="01:26:03.670" style="s2">the relationship is between the classic</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.150" end="01:26:05.850" style="s2">Trivium and the Holy Trinity and if</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.670" end="01:26:08.890" style="s2">there is how has that changed over time</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.850" end="01:26:12.270" style="s2">I&#39;m going to leave you do one question</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.890" end="01:26:14.469" style="s2">only okay okay and then</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.270" end="01:26:17.800" style="s2">and then and then you&#39;re gonna be back</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.469" end="01:26:20.050" style="s2">on stage dedicating yes yes okay okay I</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.800" end="01:26:22.270" style="s2">think I&#39;m going to answer where do you</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.050" end="01:26:26.949" style="s2">fall short in these twelve rules is it a</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.270" end="01:26:30.100" style="s2">cause constant adjustment you know like</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.949" end="01:26:34.960" style="s2">I wrote these rules why did I write</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.100" end="01:26:36.310" style="s2">these rules well you know and especially</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.960" end="01:26:37.840" style="s2">when I said well you should try to</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.310" end="01:26:39.699" style="s2">improve yourself instead of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.840" end="01:26:40.870" style="s2">set the world straight or instead of</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.699" end="01:26:42.160" style="s2">worrying about what other people are</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.870" end="01:26:43.330" style="s2">doing wrong you might say well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.160" end="01:26:44.830" style="s2">hell of a thing for someone to say you</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.330" end="01:26:47.260" style="s2">just wrote a book called 12 rules for</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.830" end="01:26:51.699" style="s2">life it&#39;s like you know but the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.260" end="01:26:53.230" style="s2">is that I wasn&#39;t just writing that I was</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.699" end="01:26:55.840" style="s2">writing that for me as much as for</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.230" end="01:26:57.610" style="s2">anyone else and I mean that&#39;s I really</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.840" end="01:26:59.890" style="s2">mean that sincerely you know I had an</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.610" end="01:27:02.949" style="s2">opportunity to spend somewhere around</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.890" end="01:27:04.900" style="s2">five years meditating on how you should</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.949" end="01:27:07.090" style="s2">conduct yourself so that your life is</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.900" end="01:27:08.980" style="s2">what it could be and like I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.090" end="01:27:10.780" style="s2">group of people that I&#39;m advising you</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.980" end="01:27:12.400" style="s2">know you know what I mean it&#39;s like all</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.780" end="01:27:14.110" style="s2">of these things are very difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.400" end="01:27:15.810" style="s2">stand up straight to remember that and</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.110" end="01:27:18.250" style="s2">to treat yourself like you&#39;re someone</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.810" end="01:27:20.440" style="s2">worthwhile and to make friends with</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.250" end="01:27:22.300" style="s2">people who are good for you and and and</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.440" end="01:27:24.250" style="s2">to tell the truth or at least not to lie</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.300" end="01:27:26.140" style="s2">I mean these are all ideals right and</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.250" end="01:27:28.300" style="s2">especially taken as a whole they</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.140" end="01:27:30.850" style="s2">constitute a kind of ideal and you never</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.300" end="01:27:33.489" style="s2">approve you never never attain the ideal</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.850" end="01:27:35.469" style="s2">the I and not only that it recedes as</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.489" end="01:27:36.670" style="s2">you approach it right because you</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.469" end="01:27:38.050" style="s2">straighten yourself out you think well</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.670" end="01:27:39.580" style="s2">I&#39;ve got it now and you think now wait a</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.050" end="01:27:41.230" style="s2">minute there&#39;s more to go there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.580" end="01:27:43.540" style="s2">more to go and then you get that much</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.230" end="01:27:45.010" style="s2">farther along the line you think oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.540" end="01:27:47.460" style="s2">I thought this was the end of the road</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.010" end="01:27:50.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like no there&#39;s plenty of</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.460" end="01:27:52.929" style="s2">imperfections left to iron out and so it</p>

<p begin="01:28:12.160" end="01:28:17.199" style="s2">can get but the real goodness is in the</p>

<p begin="01:28:24.739" end="01:28:29.450" style="s2">and this is a psychological observation</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.480" end="01:28:31.820" style="s2">the the central figure of Western</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.450" end="01:28:33.320" style="s2">culture is Christ and we can look at</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.820" end="01:28:35.989" style="s2">that psychologically because Christ is</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.320" end="01:28:38.360" style="s2">the dying and resurrecting hero and what</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.989" end="01:28:43.520" style="s2">does that mean psychologically well it</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.360" end="01:28:48.380" style="s2">means that you learn things painfully</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.520" end="01:28:51.460" style="s2">and when you learn something painfully a</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.380" end="01:28:53.989" style="s2">part of you has to die that&#39;s the pain</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.460" end="01:28:56.000" style="s2">you know when a dream is shattered for</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.989" end="01:28:57.920" style="s2">example a huge part of you that</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.000" end="01:28:59.989" style="s2">constituted that dream maybe even the</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.920" end="01:29:07.700" style="s2">biological substrate of that gene has to</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.989" end="01:29:09.560" style="s2">be stripped away and burned and so life</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.700" end="01:29:13.460" style="s2">is a constant process of death and</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.560" end="01:29:16.310" style="s2">rebirth and to participate in that fully</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.460" end="01:29:20.210" style="s2">is to allow yourself to be redeemed by</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.310" end="01:29:23.080" style="s2">it and so the good is that process of</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.210" end="01:29:25.130" style="s2">death and rebirth voluntarily undertaken</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.080" end="01:29:26.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re not as good as you</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.130" end="01:29:28.940" style="s2">could be so you let that part of you die</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.750" end="01:29:32.480" style="s2">and if someone comes along and says you</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.940" end="01:29:34.160" style="s2">know there&#39;s some dead wood here man it</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.480" end="01:29:36.020" style="s2">needs to be burned off you think well</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.160" end="01:29:38.120" style="s2">that stuff&#39;s still a bit alive when that</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.020" end="01:29:41.270" style="s2">burns it&#39;s gonna hurt it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.120" end="01:29:43.070" style="s2">well no kidding but maybe the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.270" end="01:29:45.830" style="s2">emerges in its place is something better</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.070" end="01:29:47.989" style="s2">and I think this is the secret of human</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.830" end="01:29:50.420" style="s2">beings this is what we&#39;re like unlike</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.989" end="01:29:52.640" style="s2">any other creature is that we can let</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.420" end="01:29:55.880" style="s2">our old selves die and let our new</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.640" end="01:30:01.400" style="s2">selves be born and that&#39;s what we should</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.880" end="01:30:05.239" style="s2">do and so where do I fall short in these</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.400" end="01:30:07.489" style="s2">twelve rules well endlessly because well</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.239" end="01:30:10.430" style="s2">here&#39;s a way of thinking about it until</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.489" end="01:30:15.380" style="s2">the entire world is redeemed we all fall</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.430" end="01:30:17.770" style="s2">short and that&#39;s probably a good place</p>
