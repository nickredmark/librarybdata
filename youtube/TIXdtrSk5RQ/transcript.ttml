<p begin="00:02:17.219" end="00:02:23.489" style="s2">days on my channel so as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.569" end="00:02:25.230" style="s2">today is adharma day and so today we</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.489" end="00:02:26.549" style="s2">want to learn a new lesson and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.230" end="00:02:29.849" style="s2">going to do a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.549" end="00:02:32.220" style="s2">exercise to really try and bring this</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.849" end="00:02:35.250" style="s2">lesson home mmm so let me start with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.220" end="00:02:38.040" style="s2">metaphor that you found is you find in</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.250" end="00:02:40.400" style="s2">several traditions especially meditative</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.040" end="00:02:43.230" style="s2">traditions this is looking at the pond</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.400" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">so the idea is you come upon a pond and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.230" end="00:02:48.269" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at it initially there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:49.650" style="s2">wind disturbing the surface of the pond</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.269" end="00:02:51.780" style="s2">this is like the way your mind is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.650" end="00:02:54.329" style="s2">rustling monkey mind and what you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.780" end="00:02:57.060" style="s2">to do first is learn how to sit and wait</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.329" end="00:03:02.010" style="s2">for the the wind to subside a bit and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.060" end="00:03:06.450" style="s2">for the pond to go right more and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.010" end="00:03:09.689" style="s2">smooth because when that happens when</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.450" end="00:03:12.599" style="s2">that happens then you get insight of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.689" end="00:03:14.909" style="s2">pasta you can see into the depths of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.599" end="00:03:18.030" style="s2">pond so there&#39;s two stages the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.909" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">stage is the calming and then the second</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.030" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">is insight there&#39;s books often</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:23.069" style="s2">frequently have those two paired of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:27.329" style="s2">petal I have a meditation manual called</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.069" end="00:03:30.060" style="s2">calm and insight right so up to now more</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.329" end="00:03:32.489" style="s2">explicitly more foreground we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.060" end="00:03:34.769" style="s2">concentrating on the first stage calming</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.489" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">the pond now of course it hasn&#39;t it has</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.769" end="00:03:39.629" style="s2">a lot of calm but we&#39;ve been just</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:42.209" style="s2">getting staying present and letting the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.629" end="00:03:44.250" style="s2">mind settle a bit but in the background</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.209" end="00:03:46.260" style="s2">I&#39;ve also been training you with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.250" end="00:03:49.109" style="s2">of stuff for that second more important</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.260" end="00:03:51.479" style="s2">stage which is the stage of looking into</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.109" end="00:03:54.389" style="s2">the pond getting insight which isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.479" end="00:03:56.250" style="s2">same thing as having sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.389" end="00:03:58.500" style="s2">theoretical idea so let me try and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.250" end="00:04:00.569" style="s2">explain what this means more</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.500" end="00:04:02.489" style="s2">specifically and concretely we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.569" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">to talk about the to this lesson</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.489" end="00:04:08.659" style="s2">and next lesson are sort of part 1 and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:11.639" style="s2">part 2 these are the five factors of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.659" end="00:04:14.280" style="s2">inquiring mindfulness the five factors</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.639" end="00:04:15.509" style="s2">of enquiring - I&#39;ll first list them and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.280" end="00:04:17.220" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk about what&#39;s meant by</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.509" end="00:04:19.320" style="s2">inquiring and then we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.220" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">about the first factor primarily today</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.320" end="00:04:23.039" style="s2">because all of the other factors are</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:26.669" style="s2">actually in service of the first five</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.039" end="00:04:29.879" style="s2">what is that first factor its vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.669" end="00:04:33.629" style="s2">the second one is sensitivity the third</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.879" end="00:04:36.620" style="s2">is Hewitt II the fourth is noticing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.629" end="00:04:40.349" style="s2">the fifth is reminding vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.620" end="00:04:45.020" style="s2">sensitivity acuity noticing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.349" end="00:04:47.370" style="s2">reminding what what is meant by inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.020" end="00:04:50.039" style="s2">so this is what&#39;s really important here</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.370" end="00:04:52.740" style="s2">inquiry there&#39;s two ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.039" end="00:04:55.139" style="s2">engage in inquiry one is largely</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.740" end="00:04:58.110" style="s2">curiosity inquiry and the other is</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.139" end="00:04:59.909" style="s2">wonder inquiry what happens in curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.110" end="00:05:01.439" style="s2">inquiry is we have a question and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.909" end="00:05:04.169" style="s2">trying to sort of solve that we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.439" end="00:05:05.550" style="s2">missing information which looks like we</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.169" end="00:05:07.949" style="s2">have a whole we&#39;re trying to fill it in</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.550" end="00:05:09.900" style="s2">a gap as quickly and as effectively as</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.949" end="00:05:12.270" style="s2">we can and that&#39;s very very important</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.900" end="00:05:14.039" style="s2">I have no way dismissing this or</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.270" end="00:05:16.319" style="s2">denigrating in Indian fashion but</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.039" end="00:05:18.210" style="s2">there&#39;s another kind of inquiry which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.319" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">really not questioning it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.210" end="00:05:22.439" style="s2">questing the two are related same route</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:25.249" style="s2">but it&#39;s slightly different going on a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.439" end="00:05:28.620" style="s2">quest because here the point is not to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.249" end="00:05:30.629" style="s2">fill in a knowing gap it&#39;s the extent</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.620" end="00:05:35.189" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s instead to expose</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.629" end="00:05:38.729" style="s2">yourself to exploration to open up to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.189" end="00:05:41.129" style="s2">call into question by going beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.729" end="00:05:44.039" style="s2">familiar right everything that you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.129" end="00:05:46.949" style="s2">regard is familiar it is to learn in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.039" end="00:05:50.669" style="s2">deep fashion to give up the pretense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.949" end="00:05:51.839" style="s2">expertise in our self-knowledge let me</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.669" end="00:05:53.189" style="s2">say that again because I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.839" end="00:05:55.589" style="s2">something that bears a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.189" end="00:05:58.259" style="s2">repeating it&#39;s it&#39;s fundamentally a kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.589" end="00:06:01.620" style="s2">of humility it&#39;s learning to give up the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.259" end="00:06:05.189" style="s2">pretended expertise we have in our self</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.620" end="00:06:08.759" style="s2">knowledge which paradoxically is one</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.189" end="00:06:12.180" style="s2">that we all fall prey to especially if</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.759" end="00:06:16.229" style="s2">we&#39;re engaging in spiritual practices so</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.180" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">this brings me to the the core of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.229" end="00:06:20.099" style="s2">five factors of acquiring mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:22.469" style="s2">were not truck right which is vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.099" end="00:06:24.270" style="s2">vigilance is about getting us into this</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.469" end="00:06:28.379" style="s2">place where we&#39;re not trying to come up</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.270" end="00:06:30.810" style="s2">with a theory or a justification or an</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.379" end="00:06:33.029" style="s2">explanation we&#39;re not doing any of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.810" end="00:06:36.949" style="s2">inferential theorizing justifying</p>

<p begin="00:06:36.949" end="00:06:40.680" style="s2">observation so think of the word</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.269" end="00:06:42.659" style="s2">vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.680" end="00:06:44.159" style="s2">something you might have noticed when</p>

<p begin="00:06:44.159" end="00:06:47.849" style="s2">translation is something that gets</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.750" end="00:06:49.139" style="s2">skipped over because they&#39;ll be a word</p>

<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:59.310" style="s2">something more than mindful mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.789" end="00:07:00.840" style="s2">think of it includes mindfulness but</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.310" end="00:07:04.229" style="s2">it&#39;s something more think of a person</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.840" end="00:07:06.569" style="s2">like a guardsman on a watch tower there</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.229" end="00:07:08.460" style="s2">and they&#39;re exemplifying watchfulness</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.569" end="00:07:10.110" style="s2">they&#39;re not just sort of staying present</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.460" end="00:07:13.050" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re looking</p>

<p begin="00:07:43.259" end="00:07:47.250" style="s2">on it but this is now making it much</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:50.219" style="s2">more focal or finally think of keeping a</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.370" end="00:08:13.650" style="s2">space so well we&#39;re trying to do with</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.650" end="00:08:14.789" style="s2">vigilance which is the core factor of</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.599" end="00:08:37.760" style="s2">our self-knowledge right and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.690" end="00:08:40.140" style="s2">energetic part is there&#39;s a movement and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.760" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">exploration and a penetrating</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.140" end="00:08:46.740" style="s2">observation so some interesting stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:50.360" style="s2">from the eye angle is it looks</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.740" end="00:08:54.019" style="s2">like it&#39;s actually this exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.360" end="00:08:56.670" style="s2">wondering you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.019" end="00:09:00.110" style="s2">observational inquiry that is conducive</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.670" end="00:09:02.999" style="s2">to many of the beneficial effects of</p>

<p begin="00:09:02.999" end="00:09:09.899" style="s2">very very critical very critical he sees</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.619" end="00:09:11.910" style="s2">you know it&#39;s important to pay attention</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.910" end="00:09:17.879" style="s2">was very critical of people who pursue</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:20.689" style="s2">these practices and they&#39;re seeking a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.879" end="00:09:22.259" style="s2">kind of contentedness and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.689" end="00:09:25.860" style="s2">self-satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.259" end="00:09:28.589" style="s2">he called them indolent and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.860" end="00:09:30.899" style="s2">compared them to cabbages that just sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.589" end="00:09:32.549" style="s2">of sit there so that&#39;s pretty harsh and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.899" end="00:09:33.989" style="s2">I&#39;m of course not the Buddha I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.549" end="00:09:36.540" style="s2">have the authority to criticize anybody</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.989" end="00:09:39.749" style="s2">to that degree but it&#39;s nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.540" end="00:09:43.290" style="s2">something to take note of we need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.749" end="00:09:46.529" style="s2">make this focal for ourselves we need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.290" end="00:09:49.829" style="s2">bring inquiring mindfulness in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.529" end="00:09:51.959" style="s2">right into our mindfulness practice okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.829" end="00:09:54.089" style="s2">so how do we do that well there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.959" end="00:09:56.160" style="s2">to be two sets of practices I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.089" end="00:09:58.709" style="s2">teach you today I&#39;m going to teach you</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:10:00.420" style="s2">meditative questioning which I that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.709" end="00:10:02.639" style="s2">how it&#39;s called in the tradition I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.420" end="00:10:05.179" style="s2">we naming it would make it more accurate</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.639" end="00:10:07.470" style="s2">if we called it meditative queston</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.179" end="00:10:11.490" style="s2">because it brings up that vigilance and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.470" end="00:10:13.259" style="s2">that exploratory observation I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.490" end="00:10:15.569" style="s2">to teach you that today and it&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.259" end="00:10:18.179" style="s2">to set up for something which is next</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.569" end="00:10:19.889" style="s2">week which is meditating on your</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.179" end="00:10:21.660" style="s2">distractions which is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.889" end="00:10:24.389" style="s2">powerful ways to deal with distractions</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.660" end="00:10:26.369" style="s2">in meditation and also how to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.389" end="00:10:28.199" style="s2">hindrances hindrances are things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.369" end="00:10:30.269" style="s2">prevent from engaging in the practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.199" end="00:10:32.189" style="s2">but today what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.269" end="00:10:34.439" style="s2">going to teach you a particular practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.189" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">and I would recommend doing this</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.439" end="00:10:40.470" style="s2">practice once a week so I practice you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:42.089" style="s2">do regularly like meta and past none</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.470" end="00:10:43.799" style="s2">which you should be alternating this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.089" end="00:10:45.720" style="s2">the practice you do once a week because</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.799" end="00:10:48.269" style="s2">what it does is it really gives you</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.720" end="00:10:53.970" style="s2">access it activates right and really</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.269" end="00:10:55.679" style="s2">brings into awareness it accentuates the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.970" end="00:10:59.029" style="s2">factor of vigilance and that&#39;s the core</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.679" end="00:11:02.129" style="s2">the five factors vigilance sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.029" end="00:11:03.899" style="s2">human noticing and reminding so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.129" end="00:11:04.919" style="s2">work on vigilance today and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.899" end="00:11:06.270" style="s2">going to do is we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.919" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">meditative question</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.270" end="00:11:12.330" style="s2">or as I&#39;d like to say meditated quested</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.880" end="00:11:14.340" style="s2">how does this work okay so you all as</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.330" end="00:11:17.190" style="s2">always and you&#39;ll see you see now how</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.340" end="00:11:20.610" style="s2">the core for sets you up to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.190" end="00:11:22.500" style="s2">basic foundation for mindfulness but</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.610" end="00:11:25.140" style="s2">they&#39;ve already they&#39;ve already got you</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.500" end="00:11:27.060" style="s2">in the training of vigilance in an</p>

<p begin="00:11:33.900" end="00:11:41.210" style="s2">and we do some basic for Passman we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.890" end="00:11:43.410" style="s2">do that and so the we will sit together</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.210" end="00:11:47.670" style="s2">and they&#39;ll be silent for quite a while</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.410" end="00:11:51.510" style="s2">and then at some point I&#39;ll say right go</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.670" end="00:11:54.180" style="s2">into meditative questing how does this</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.510" end="00:11:56.970" style="s2">work well why don&#39;t you do is pick a</p>
