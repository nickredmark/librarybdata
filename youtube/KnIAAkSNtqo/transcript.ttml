<p begin="00:01:05.040" end="00:01:09.420" style="s2">obvious when considering a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.350" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">this sort what level of analysis is</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.420" end="00:01:13.619" style="s2">appropriate if you&#39;re reading any given</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.259" end="00:01:24.420" style="s2">likely to be interpreted and when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.570" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">first encountered bill C 16 and its</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:28.619" style="s2">surrounding policies it seemed to me</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">that the appropriate level of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.619" end="00:01:32.189" style="s2">was to look at the context of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:35.090" style="s2">interpretation surrounding the bill</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.189" end="00:01:37.170" style="s2">which is what I did when I went and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.090" end="00:01:39.689" style="s2">scoured the Ontario Human Rights</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.170" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">Commission webpages and examined its</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.689" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">policies I did that because at that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">point the Department of Justice had</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:48.780" style="s2">clearly indicated on their website in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:51.530" style="s2">link that was later taken down that bill</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.780" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">C 16 would be interpreted in within the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.530" end="00:01:56.009" style="s2">president&#39;s policy precedents already</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">established by the Ontario Human Rights</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.009" end="00:02:00.540" style="s2">Commission so when I looked on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">website I thought well there&#39;s broader</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.540" end="00:02:04.860" style="s2">issues at stake here and I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">outline some of those broader issues in</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.860" end="00:02:10.200" style="s2">the initial you may or may not know I</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">made some videos criticizing bill C 16</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.200" end="00:02:15.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s a number of its of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">the policies that surrounding it and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.480" end="00:02:21.450" style="s2">think the most egregious elements of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:25.160" style="s2">policies are that it requires compelled</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.450" end="00:02:27.960" style="s2">speech the the Ontario Human Rights</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.160" end="00:02:30.390" style="s2">Commission explicitly states that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.960" end="00:02:32.970" style="s2">refusing to refer to a person by their</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.390" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">self-identified name and proper personal</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.970" end="00:02:40.110" style="s2">pronoun which is the pronouns that I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:41.960" style="s2">objecting to can be can be interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.110" end="00:02:43.950" style="s2">as harassment and so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.960" end="00:02:47.520" style="s2">explicitly defined in the relevant</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.950" end="00:02:49.470" style="s2">policies so I think that&#39;s appalling</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.520" end="00:02:51.030" style="s2">first of all because there hasn&#39;t been a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.470" end="00:02:54.060" style="s2">piece of legislation that requires</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.030" end="00:02:56.240" style="s2">Canadians to other a particular form of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.060" end="00:02:58.470" style="s2">address that has particular ideological</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.240" end="00:03:01.800" style="s2">implications before and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.470" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a line that we shouldn&#39;t cross then</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.800" end="00:03:07.020" style="s2">I think that the definition of identity</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:12.540" style="s2">that&#39;s enshrined in the surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.020" end="00:03:16.260" style="s2">policies is ill-defined and poorly</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.540" end="00:03:19.470" style="s2">thought through and also incorrect it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.260" end="00:03:21.060" style="s2">incorrect in that identity is not and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.470" end="00:03:22.950" style="s2">will never be something that people</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.060" end="00:03:24.300" style="s2">define subjectively because your</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.950" end="00:03:27.480" style="s2">identity is something that you actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.300" end="00:03:29.970" style="s2">have to act out in the world as a set of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.480" end="00:03:31.739" style="s2">procedural tools which most people learn</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.970" end="00:03:34.260" style="s2">and I&#39;m being technical about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.739" end="00:03:36.360" style="s2">between the ages of 2 &amp; 4 it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.260" end="00:03:38.489" style="s2">fundamental human reality it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.360" end="00:03:40.470" style="s2">recognized by the relevance a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.489" end="00:03:42.930" style="s2">developmental psychological authorities</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.470" end="00:03:44.340" style="s2">and so the idea that identity is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.930" end="00:03:47.070" style="s2">something that you define purely</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.340" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">subjectively is an idea without status</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.070" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned I also think</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">it&#39;s unbelievably dangerous for us to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:57.720" style="s2">move towards representing a social</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:04:00.030" style="s2">constructionist view of identity in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.720" end="00:04:02.070" style="s2">legal system the social constructionist</p>

<p begin="00:04:02.070" end="00:04:06.290" style="s2">nothing but a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.450" end="00:04:09.180" style="s2">socialization which is which and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.290" end="00:04:11.400" style="s2">there&#39;s an inordinate amount of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.180" end="00:04:14.940" style="s2">scientific evidence suggesting that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.400" end="00:04:16.350" style="s2">happens to not be the case and so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.940" end="00:04:19.709" style="s2">reason that this is being instantiated</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.350" end="00:04:21.479" style="s2">into law is because the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.709" end="00:04:22.919" style="s2">promoting that sort of perspective or at</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.479" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">least in part because the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.919" end="00:04:26.130" style="s2">promoting that sort of perspective know</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">perfectly well that they lost the battle</p>

<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:31.500" style="s2">grounds it&#39;s impressive in the policies</p>

<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:51.180" style="s2">something that should be increasingly</p>

<p begin="00:05:18.569" end="00:05:24.780" style="s2">to be the case I think that the</p>

<p begin="00:21:58.770" end="00:22:03.300" style="s2">entire Human Rights Commission says some</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.800" end="00:22:05.820" style="s2">people may not know how to determine</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.300" end="00:22:07.410" style="s2">what pronoun to use others may feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.820" end="00:22:09.540" style="s2">uncomfortable using gender-neutral</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.410" end="00:22:10.600" style="s2">pronouns generally when in doubt ask a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.540" end="00:22:12.789" style="s2">person how they wish to</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.600" end="00:22:14.890" style="s2">address used a if you don&#39;t know which</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.789" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">gone on to you this preferred simply</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.890" end="00:22:18.850" style="s2">referring to their person by their</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:22.150" style="s2">chosen name is always a respectful</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.850" end="00:22:24.039" style="s2">approach so you can use the pronoun you</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.150" end="00:22:27.520" style="s2">can choose you can use their chosen name</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.039" end="00:22:31.240" style="s2">so if someone chooses to change his name</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:33.130" style="s2">from Paul to Peter surely you would use</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.240" end="00:22:35.830" style="s2">Peter because it&#39;s a matter of simple</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.130" end="00:22:38.380" style="s2">politeness and and respect if the same</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.900" end="00:22:50.710" style="s2">difficulty well I guess the issue and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.760" end="00:22:52.030" style="s2">that speak about the legal issue there</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.710" end="00:22:53.860" style="s2">is that you&#39;re now introducing the full</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.030" end="00:22:56.440" style="s2">force of law behind the requirement to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.860" end="00:22:58.360" style="s2">use and I&#39;m dealing obviously with with</p>

<p begin="00:23:05.350" end="00:23:08.620" style="s2">we&#39;re running into trouble here I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.000" end="00:23:11.650" style="s2">the issue becomes that if you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.620" end="00:23:13.780" style="s2">address somebody by the the pronoun that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.650" end="00:23:16.330" style="s2">they self-identify by as I&#39;ve read out</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.780" end="00:23:20.350" style="s2">to you the fact that the full force of</p>

<p begin="00:23:33.909" end="00:23:38.919" style="s2">a respectful default so for nouns are</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:52.780" style="s2">there is a piece of legislation that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.620" end="00:23:56.140" style="s2">compels you to use my proper name in</p>

<p begin="00:25:32.830" end="00:25:38.919" style="s2">something that I was not at all familiar</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:40.750" style="s2">with prior to this bill being introduced</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.919" end="00:25:42.669" style="s2">and in particular about the</p>

<p begin="00:25:49.929" end="00:25:53.590" style="s2">think the people who initiated this</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.549" end="00:25:55.860" style="s2">legislation ever expected that there</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.590" end="00:25:58.419" style="s2">would be an absolute explosion of</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.860" end="00:26:01.029" style="s2">identities first of all and also of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.419" end="00:26:02.980" style="s2">so-called personal pronouns as there has</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.029" end="00:26:05.260" style="s2">been I think Facebook now recognizes</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.980" end="00:26:07.419" style="s2">something like 71 separate gender</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.260" end="00:26:09.340" style="s2">identity categories each of which in</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.419" end="00:26:11.590" style="s2">principle is associated with its own set</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.340" end="00:26:13.720" style="s2">of pronouns and so it&#39;s become what</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.590" end="00:26:15.159" style="s2">linguistically unmet it&#39;s become a</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.720" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">parody essentially it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.159" end="00:26:19.690" style="s2">linguistically unmanageable and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:21.519" style="s2">also the case that words can&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:26:25.090" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">sure how words enter the common parlance</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.799" end="00:26:33.070" style="s2">but it&#39;s certainly not that way and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:35.290" style="s2">the the legislation devolves into a kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.070" end="00:26:37.090" style="s2">of of absurdity as far as</p>

<p begin="00:26:48.040" end="00:26:53.230" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say anything like that if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">knew anything about common human nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.230" end="00:26:57.520" style="s2">let&#39;s say in the manner in which people</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:58.900" style="s2">communicate with one another so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.520" end="00:27:00.220" style="s2">types of pronouns you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.900" end="00:27:01.570" style="s2">just so everyone is clear because I</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.220" end="00:27:04.450" style="s2">don&#39;t think these are common common</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.570" end="00:27:06.490" style="s2">parlance the is there and what other</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.450" end="00:27:08.770" style="s2">sorts of gender-neutral pronouns are we</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.490" end="00:27:10.570" style="s2">discussing here well I have a very bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.770" end="00:27:12.160" style="s2">memory for that sort of thing but if</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.570" end="00:27:14.020" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in it you can find</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.160" end="00:27:16.510" style="s2">lists of them very rapidly on the web</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.020" end="00:27:19.180" style="s2">and they&#39;d been produced by I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.510" end="00:27:22.690" style="s2">they&#39;ve been produced by people whose</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.180" end="00:27:26.380" style="s2">essential desire is to gain linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.690" end="00:27:27.970" style="s2">control that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s &#39;simply is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.380" end="00:27:30.730" style="s2">that I can put it as a gain linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.970" end="00:27:34.240" style="s2">control but they&#39;re not used popularly</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.730" end="00:27:35.920" style="s2">and and that seems to me to be a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.240" end="00:27:37.900" style="s2">real problem as a consequence that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.920" end="00:27:40.150" style="s2">make failure to make their use something</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.900" end="00:27:43.060" style="s2">that that could carry a criminal penalty</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.150" end="00:27:44.530" style="s2">so I just don&#39;t understand that and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.060" end="00:27:47.530" style="s2">I don&#39;t understand how the government</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.530" end="00:27:49.330" style="s2">can justify imposing a criminal penalty</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.530" end="00:27:52.210" style="s2">on the use of words that no one either</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.330" end="00:27:54.940" style="s2">knows or uses it just seems preposterous</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.210" end="00:27:56.680" style="s2">to me but there it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.940" end="00:27:58.690" style="s2">could you please also tell us a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.680" end="00:28:00.400" style="s2">bit more about the your personal</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.690" end="00:28:02.140" style="s2">experience in pushing back against this</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.400" end="00:28:04.540" style="s2">and I mean many are familiar with your</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.140" end="00:28:07.030" style="s2">story but not everyone so I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.540" end="00:28:08.890" style="s2">to do well I made a video actually made</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.030" end="00:28:12.040" style="s2">three videos but we&#39;ll just talk about</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.890" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">one of them I made one criticizing Bill</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.040" end="00:28:15.130" style="s2">c16 for the reasons that I already</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:17.110" style="s2">described because I went read the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.130" end="00:28:20.830" style="s2">policies and they made my hair stand on</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.110" end="00:28:23.080" style="s2">end to the surrounding policies and so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.830" end="00:28:25.870" style="s2">made a video stating essentially that</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.080" end="00:28:28.360" style="s2">and detailed out my reasons and um you</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.870" end="00:28:30.580" style="s2">know I&#39;ve been following the Battle of</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.360" end="00:28:32.620" style="s2">let&#39;s say ideologies on campus for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.580" end="00:28:34.600" style="s2">very long period of time and I suppose I</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.620" end="00:28:36.910" style="s2">have some expertise in that and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.600" end="00:28:39.370" style="s2">a there&#39;s an ideological war that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.910" end="00:28:42.400" style="s2">ripping at campuses apart and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.370" end="00:28:44.260" style="s2">essentially between a ideological</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.400" end="00:28:46.030" style="s2">variant that&#39;s rooted in what&#39;s come to</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.260" end="00:28:47.740" style="s2">be known as post-modernism with kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.030" end="00:28:52.179" style="s2">the neo-marxist</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.740" end="00:28:54.520" style="s2">and and modern modernism I would say</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.179" end="00:28:56.170" style="s2">that&#39;s accounting for all the turmoil on</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.520" end="00:28:58.420" style="s2">campuses and I see this as an extension</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.170" end="00:29:00.580" style="s2">of this campus turmoil into the broader</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.420" end="00:29:02.590" style="s2">world and and I Reba leave that is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.580" end="00:29:05.559" style="s2">proper level of analysis I truly believe</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.590" end="00:29:08.770" style="s2">that and so I said that I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.559" end="00:29:10.840" style="s2">this is the Vanguard issue in the kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.770" end="00:29:12.820" style="s2">of ideological war and that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.840" end="00:29:15.490" style="s2">going to participate on the side of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.820" end="00:29:17.860" style="s2">people whose whose ideological stance I</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.490" end="00:29:19.720" style="s2">find reprehensible unforgivable and</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.860" end="00:29:22.150" style="s2">reprehensible especially the Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.720" end="00:29:23.770" style="s2">element of it and so I announced that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.150" end="00:29:25.540" style="s2">was going to use these words because I</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.770" end="00:29:26.980" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that they&#39;re instantiated</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.540" end="00:29:30.250" style="s2">to protect anyone&#39;s rights I believe</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.980" end="00:29:31.830" style="s2">their that the ideologues who are</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.250" end="00:29:34.210" style="s2">pushing this movement are using</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.830" end="00:29:36.010" style="s2">unsuspecting and sometimes complicit</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.210" end="00:29:37.950" style="s2">members of the so-called transgender</p>

<p begin="00:29:37.950" end="00:29:42.910" style="s2">Vanguard forward and I firmly believe</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.390" end="00:29:44.700" style="s2">that so I&#39;m not participating in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.910" end="00:29:47.170" style="s2">and the fact that it&#39;s potentially</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.700" end="00:29:49.270" style="s2">illegal for me not to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.170" end="00:29:51.670" style="s2">that is something that I regard as I</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.270" end="00:29:53.650" style="s2">think that&#39;s absolutely dreadful it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.670" end="00:29:55.630" style="s2">makes it puts a shudder in my heart as a</p>

<p begin="00:30:07.600" end="00:30:11.800" style="s2">going to be very difficult for the</p>

<p begin="00:36:38.060" end="00:36:47.420" style="s2">do consider one broader than the other I</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.740" end="00:36:50.210" style="s2">think they are overly broad definitions</p>

<p begin="00:36:52.369" end="00:36:57.380" style="s2">that the courts don&#39;t like over broad</p>

<p begin="00:38:35.780" end="00:38:39.260" style="s2">was the what would you say it was the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.490" end="00:38:41.600" style="s2">smoking pistol right because the issue</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.260" end="00:38:43.100" style="s2">is what&#39;s the right level of analysis he</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.600" end="00:38:45.200" style="s2">just supposed to look at the legislation</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.100" end="00:38:47.060" style="s2">well since the Justice Department said</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.060" end="00:38:50.750" style="s2">surrounding policies well that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.950" end="00:38:52.220" style="s2">did and that&#39;s what I based my case on</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.750" end="00:38:54.410" style="s2">and then all of a sudden the link to</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.220" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">those the link tying those two things</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.410" end="00:38:59.210" style="s2">together just vanished and people had to</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:39:01.220" style="s2">go into the internet archives to to to</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.210" end="00:39:02.480" style="s2">fish it back out so that it could remain</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.220" end="00:39:06.520" style="s2">part of the public record</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.480" end="00:39:06.520" style="s2">I think that&#39;s absolutely scandalous</p>

<p begin="00:39:18.530" end="00:39:25.760" style="s2">that you talked about this bill as being</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.470" end="00:39:28.040" style="s2">an expression of vanguard of ideology</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.760" end="00:39:29.600" style="s2">and am i right in thinking and well I</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.040" end="00:39:32.150" style="s2">was thinking more about the policies</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.600" end="00:39:35.660" style="s2">that surrounded it but but yes yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.150" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to square what you as a party</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.479" end="00:40:32.769" style="s2">feel it will be listened to so how do we</p>

<p begin="00:40:43.239" end="00:40:46.539" style="s2">biased sample and that&#39;s a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.249" end="00:40:49.150" style="s2">with the public consultation process</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.539" end="00:40:51.460" style="s2">that underlies this bill and and you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.150" end="00:40:53.769" style="s2">not appreciate that if you&#39;d like but</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.460" end="00:40:56.289" style="s2">it&#39;s standard practice in any in any</p>

<p begin="00:41:07.239" end="00:41:11.259" style="s2">point what exactly are all those people</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.460" end="00:41:12.880" style="s2">who are thinking the same way as me say</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.259" end="00:41:15.009" style="s2">you said that there&#39;s a bunch of them</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.880" end="00:41:16.420" style="s2">and a bunch of groups but you never said</p>

<p begin="00:41:16.420" end="00:41:21.640" style="s2">precisely well I think our chair who</p>

<p begin="00:41:21.640" end="00:41:27.339" style="s2">you&#39;re fun to read out what they&#39;re all</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.050" end="00:44:55.770" style="s2">sir so I&#39;m still trying to orient myself</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.850" end="00:44:59.010" style="s2">a little bit in this bill I&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.770" end="00:45:01.290" style="s2">bit lost in the arguments in this for</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.010" end="00:45:03.900" style="s2">and against but some arguments really</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.290" end="00:45:08.100" style="s2">struck me because some people said that</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.900" end="00:45:12.500" style="s2">without this bill there might be</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.100" end="00:45:12.500" style="s2">suicides people would become depressed</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.330" end="00:45:23.820" style="s2">transgender people of course and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.930" end="00:45:26.700" style="s2">seems to me that this is almost an</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.820" end="00:45:28.140" style="s2">extreme position that without this bill</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.700" end="00:45:29.880" style="s2">there would be an explosion of suicides</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.140" end="00:45:32.040" style="s2">and depression so I&#39;d like to ask two a</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.880" end="00:45:34.560" style="s2">question as a professor now you work in</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.040" end="00:45:41.510" style="s2">the the social sciences you study human</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.560" end="00:45:41.510" style="s2">behavior are there studies or statistics</p>

<p begin="00:45:45.930" end="00:45:52.500" style="s2">would have on those people is this bill</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.550" end="00:45:56.369" style="s2">would this bill save as many lives and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.500" end="00:45:58.710" style="s2">help as many people as it says well in</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.369" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">principle we would have that information</p>

<p begin="00:46:02.940" end="00:46:07.560" style="s2">were assessed properly but as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.220" end="00:46:09.330" style="s2">know there&#39;s been no no studies</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.560" end="00:46:11.010" style="s2">indicating that the introduction of this</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.330" end="00:46:13.530" style="s2">legislation specifically has done</p>

<p begin="00:46:19.470" end="00:46:24.360" style="s2">say often of marginalized groups but</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.810" end="00:46:26.250" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit of an overstatement so no I</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.360" end="00:46:28.320" style="s2">don&#39;t that that was part of my original</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.250" end="00:46:31.560" style="s2">claim is that there&#39;s no evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.320" end="00:46:32.820" style="s2">this sort of legal redress let&#39;s say is</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.560" end="00:46:35.250" style="s2">going to produce any positive</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.820" end="00:46:38.130" style="s2">consequences that are intended and I do</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.250" end="00:46:40.320" style="s2">believe that by making the issue let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.130" end="00:46:41.820" style="s2">say painfully visible that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.320" end="00:46:45.120" style="s2">thinking about it this actually had the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.820" end="00:46:46.950" style="s2">opposite effect and it&#39;s announced it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.120" end="00:46:49.470" style="s2">very very common and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.950" end="00:46:51.930" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s well known in the relevant</p>

<p begin="00:46:51.930" end="00:46:55.890" style="s2">intend something to happen when you make</p>

<p begin="00:47:00.150" end="00:47:04.280" style="s2">lovely if things were that simple and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.070" end="00:47:07.290" style="s2">mean the best social scientists always</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.280" end="00:47:10.200" style="s2">insist that you build an outcome</p>

<p begin="00:47:10.200" end="00:47:15.300" style="s2">what would you call social intervention</p>

<p begin="00:47:20.100" end="00:47:24.840" style="s2">it&#39;s based at least in part on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.680" end="00:47:26.370" style="s2">notion that the transgender community is</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.840" end="00:47:28.560" style="s2">a community and that there are voices</p>

<p begin="00:47:28.560" end="00:47:34.140" style="s2">that this is what they all want and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.360" end="00:47:36.090" style="s2">will work as intended that to me looking</p>

<p begin="00:47:41.550" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">also don&#39;t buy the intent so senator</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.330" end="00:47:54.750" style="s2">Duke we see what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">Thank You mr. chair first of all I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.750" end="00:47:59.820" style="s2">like to ask the question mr. Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:06.710" style="s2">and perhaps I would also have a question</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.820" end="00:48:10.260" style="s2">for mr. Brown my question is as follows</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.710" end="00:48:17.090" style="s2">dr. Peterson I&#39;m trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.260" end="00:48:17.090" style="s2">your position do you see a difference</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.270" end="00:48:23.160" style="s2">between the opinions that you express</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.310" end="00:48:27.000" style="s2">that you are expressing today on this</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.160" end="00:48:29.600" style="s2">issue as part of this public</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.000" end="00:48:35.750" style="s2">consultation</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.600" end="00:48:39.540" style="s2">and the actions that you take as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.750" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">university professor where you are in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.540" end="00:48:48.750" style="s2">position of authority and power over</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:50.550" style="s2">your students well first of all I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.750" end="00:48:52.290" style="s2">necessarily consider myself in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.550" end="00:48:54.000" style="s2">position of authority and power I</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.290" end="00:48:56.490" style="s2">consider myself in a position of</p>

<p begin="00:48:56.490" end="00:49:01.050" style="s2">thing so I don&#39;t agree with the way that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.410" end="00:49:02.880" style="s2">the question is formulated and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.050" end="00:49:04.800" style="s2">understand what that has to do with my</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.880" end="00:49:06.630" style="s2">stance I mean if I believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.800" end="00:49:09.000" style="s2">legislation is going to do more harm</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.630" end="00:49:12.630" style="s2">than good and I also firmly believe</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.000" end="00:49:15.450" style="s2">which I do that it is more in the issue</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.630" end="00:49:17.310" style="s2">of an ideological move than something</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.450" end="00:49:19.260" style="s2">that&#39;s designed to address the concerns</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.310" end="00:49:21.480" style="s2">that it purports to address I would also</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.260" end="00:49:23.190" style="s2">like to point out briefly that you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.480" end="00:49:24.750" style="s2">what should happen when I made that</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.190" end="00:49:27.720" style="s2">video and this is relevant to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.750" end="00:49:28.980" style="s2">question was that like maybe people paid</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.720" end="00:49:30.630" style="s2">attention to ten minutes</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.980" end="00:49:32.070" style="s2">teach it to it for ten minutes and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.630" end="00:49:34.080" style="s2">it got a newspaper article and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.070" end="00:49:36.240" style="s2">disappeared but I put my finger on</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.080" end="00:49:38.190" style="s2">something that&#39;s what I thought and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:39.930" style="s2">fact that this issue hasn&#39;t gone away in</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.190" end="00:49:42.240" style="s2">nine months quite the contrary it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:42.240" end="00:49:46.350" style="s2">sorts of parts of the world means that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.160" end="00:49:48.600" style="s2">means to me that I have some evidence</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.350" end="00:49:50.730" style="s2">that my choice of level of analysis was</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.600" end="00:49:53.220" style="s2">correct and that there&#39;s far more going</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.730" end="00:49:55.500" style="s2">on here so to speak than the mere</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.220" end="00:49:58.290" style="s2">surface issue that we&#39;re purporting to</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.500" end="00:50:00.180" style="s2">discuss and so I take exception to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.290" end="00:50:02.220" style="s2">notion that I am somehow abandoning my</p>

<p begin="00:50:06.120" end="00:50:10.260" style="s2">that my obligation of my students</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.650" end="00:50:12.690" style="s2">constantly is to tell them what I think</p>

<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:42.920" style="s2">I mean my question for you is do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.710" end="00:50:45.890" style="s2">make a difference between your opinion</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.920" end="00:50:48.830" style="s2">what you say and the fact that the</p>

<p begin="00:58:28.050" end="00:58:34.050" style="s2">can&#39;t it be changed with context and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.680" end="00:58:36.060" style="s2">this is part of the problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.050" end="00:58:37.770" style="s2">policies is they&#39;re so incoherent that</p>

<p begin="00:59:07.950" end="00:59:13.140" style="s2">and you can waive those claims goodbye</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.810" end="00:59:14.850" style="s2">because they&#39;re completely they are at</p>
