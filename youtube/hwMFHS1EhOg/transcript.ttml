<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:40.479" style="s2">little bit of background and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.840" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">introduction</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.479" end="00:01:46.880" style="s2">i&#39;m a vadriana practitioner i took</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">ordination in a traditional lineage</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.880" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">and i left that context a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.759" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">but my name within that context that i</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.840" end="00:01:59.600" style="s2">still use sometimes is rinsing palmo so</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:02:00.880" style="s2">you might have come across that name or</p>

<p begin="00:02:00.880" end="00:02:07.360" style="s2">kind of context on my blog vadriana now</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.750" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">so uh a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:14.319" style="s2">vadriana just for anybody who&#39;s new here</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.319" end="00:02:19.520" style="s2">and who&#39;s not familiar with the term as</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">we&#39;re presenting it here</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">it&#39;s um it&#39;s a life-affirming practical</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">spiritual training in presence of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">awareness basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">um there are many hundreds of practices</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">each have got their own</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">specific function and purpose</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">but the general the overarching</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:42.959" style="s2">intention</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">and the direction of adriana is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.959" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">congruent</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:51.040" style="s2">worldly activity um</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">i think worldly is a good word to use</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.040" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">because that covers many domains</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">it includes society it includes</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">environment other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">nature emotions there&#39;s a very broad</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">overarching term</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">and in buddhist terminology you would</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">maybe say something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">vajrayana trains dexterous</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.519" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">skillful activity in the world of form</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">um and that includes everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">everything everywhere that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">buddhist way of phrasing</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">sometimes people ask about the end goal</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">of adriana</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">and personally i prefer to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:38.159" style="s2">the effect or the result or results</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">because vadriana has many hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.159" end="00:03:42.560" style="s2">practices it has</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">probably thousands of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.560" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">those are not all the same and where</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">they lead</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:50.159" style="s2">the direction that they&#39;re oriented</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:51.599" style="s2">towards that&#39;s a continually renewed</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.159" end="00:03:53.230" style="s2">state of presence</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.599" end="00:03:55.040" style="s2">in activity</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.230" end="00:03:58.080" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.040" end="00:03:59.439" style="s2">and in that state of presence you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.080" end="00:04:01.720" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.439" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">compassion and spaciousness arise</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.720" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">so there&#39;s a kind of very natural</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">orientation</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">not towards transcending the world or</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:14.720" style="s2">leaving the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:15.920" style="s2">the orientation is towards natural</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">congruence</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.920" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">and active present awareness</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">so spontaneity means</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">in this context it means sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">rising of its own accord you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:30.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.600" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">do anything in that state you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">to do something to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:35.919" style="s2">compassion or competence occur it just</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">arises</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.919" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">naturally from the practice and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:43.120" style="s2">so if you experience the result of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">adriano practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.120" end="00:04:47.080" style="s2">at any time compassion and spaciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">are both there</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.080" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">instantaneously some of my little</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">introduction about how this fits into</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">the context of what we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">this speaks a bit toward what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">going to be talking about today</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">uh that a lot of these practices still</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:50.880" style="s2">you know it varying uh degrees one foot</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">in kind of the more renunciative</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.880" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">form of buddhism um and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">uh and kind of transcendental uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">uh and and yeah i i guess i&#39;m just uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">we&#39;ve described ourselves as degenerates</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:07.759" style="s2">because uh you know i know i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">any any uh uh urge to to remove myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.759" end="00:07:10.240" style="s2">from the world and want to be in the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">messy muck</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.039" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">uh a year later we had decided to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">this audacious thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:27.919" style="s2">of uh trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:28.720" style="s2">take guadriana principles and and apply</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.919" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">them in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.720" end="00:07:32.160" style="s2">contemporary setting so um yeah i guess</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">on view and what that that means in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.319" end="00:07:48.479" style="s2">buddhist context</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">um and then we&#39;ll uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.479" end="00:07:52.960" style="s2">the two of us might discuss a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">uh about you know kind of whatever comes</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.960" end="00:07:54.800" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:07:56.879" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll open it up to a broader</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.800" end="00:08:01.120" style="s2">conversation and just hear your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.879" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">and questions and and see what arises</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">thanks um so presentation in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">that i&#39;m just going to ramble on for</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">a while and i&#39;ve got a few little notes</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:14.240" style="s2">here to remind me about</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:14.240" style="s2">things that i thought i might say um</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:19.840" style="s2">so uh where to start</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.400" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">view is uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to say about it really</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.319" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">because it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:32.640" style="s2">um it&#39;s not a very clearly defined</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">concept or practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.640" end="00:08:36.320" style="s2">but it is both a concept and a practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.320" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very broad way of approaching</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">practice or understanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">different lineages different paths</p>

<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:57.279" style="s2">so view</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">is inseparable from</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.279" end="00:09:04.160" style="s2">jana that is the term for path</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">um there are different paths one of the</p>

<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">distinguished is by describing their</p>

<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">and get into this kind of geekery of</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">and go down the rabbit hole of defining</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">the 16 paths and the 34 paths and all of</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:33.600" style="s2">various many difference of slightly</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:36.800" style="s2">tweaked different</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.600" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">types of path in different systems so</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.800" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">different systems have different paths</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:42.480" style="s2">and view</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">is entirely connected up with this whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.480" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">of there being different paths and</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">it can get quite complicated and you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:52.399" style="s2">get into a lot of detail about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">particular view</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.399" end="00:09:59.040" style="s2">and what that is so um</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">i&#39;m going to keep it quite broad today</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.040" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">but i think understanding the history of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:05.600" style="s2">the term is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">interesting and useful um</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.600" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">originally it came about as a way</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">um this is really in the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">formative period</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">of buddhism and abhidharma it came about</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">as a way to describe</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:22.079" style="s2">people who weren&#39;t on the path</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:23.519" style="s2">so it was like kind of them and us thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.079" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">as with our view and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.519" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">the heathens have their wrong view and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:31.120" style="s2">you know this very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">two-way binary classification and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">um so that that was connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.279" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">idea of soul</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">and having a soul and within buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">historically there has not been</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">the idea of a soul so the tirtika the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">the them</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">they were the people who believed that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.519" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">there was a soul</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:58.720" style="s2">and the buddhists no self</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">no soul no inherent permanent sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">um thing inside us that continues to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:06.640" style="s2">that was the early very early kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">formation so</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.640" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">then view the the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">uh the way that it was conceived came to</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">change within mahayana</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:22.079" style="s2">and there was a lot of discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">different paths because</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.079" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">people were coming to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:30.320" style="s2">one could be a practicing buddhist and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">practice in one way or another way</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">and uh have</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">somewhat different ways of going about</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:39.120" style="s2">it and so there was a lot of attempt at</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.320" end="00:11:41.920" style="s2">synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.120" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">or attempt at trying to make things work</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.920" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">and figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">these different concepts of how life is</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:50.959" style="s2">or what the world is like how that could</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.959" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">um reconciled so that people didn&#39;t kill</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">basically so</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:04.399" style="s2">in the mahayana it came to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">connected to the idea of path and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.399" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">accepting different paths and different</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:09.320" style="s2">paths within buddhism people having</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:13.040" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.320" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">divergences and different orientation</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.040" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">so like i said it&#39;s not an entirely</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:23.440" style="s2">concept or practice</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2">so what i&#39;m going to do is i will</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.440" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">try to um i&#39;ll bring some</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">different ideas and some different ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:34.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">looking at or or of coming to understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:38.639" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.959" end="00:12:42.959" style="s2">um and then i&#39;ll look at</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.639" end="00:12:44.399" style="s2">those in terms of how we view ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.959" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">according to different yarners or</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.399" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">different methods or</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.240" end="00:12:50.160" style="s2">just by default how we view ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.959" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">and our emotions</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.160" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">and our own personal internal</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">experience and how we view others so</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.800" end="00:13:01.200" style="s2">that is very much connected to</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:03.839" style="s2">the kind of methodology that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.200" end="00:13:06.880" style="s2">training in and what we&#39;re attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.839" end="00:13:09.519" style="s2">as as practice</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.880" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">and then how we relate to nature and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.519" end="00:13:12.800" style="s2">environment and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">the world and all of those three things</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:17.760" style="s2">are ways that you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:21.440" style="s2">um unpack</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">what is happening with view um</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.440" end="00:13:26.639" style="s2">so a couple of sessions ago</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">on the store this was so this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.639" end="00:13:30.000" style="s2">actually our third</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:31.760" style="s2">one it&#39;s number two so our first one was</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.000" end="00:13:34.240" style="s2">number zero and</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.760" end="00:13:36.160" style="s2">in that one i talked quite a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.240" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">frames of reference</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">and i&#39;m not going to go over that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:43.360" style="s2">again in any great detail but that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:46.839" style="s2">very much connected</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.360" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">to view so if you haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.839" end="00:13:50.959" style="s2">that that discussion that we had it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:55.040" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.959" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">sutra to tantra and that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.040" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">primarily that whole thing is about</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">frames of reference so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">some quite useful material to bring to</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:05.680" style="s2">this idea as</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:08.079" style="s2">well so</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.680" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">frames of reference that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.079" end="00:14:12.079" style="s2">describing</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:12.079" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">another way and one which i like is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:20.399" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">immersion so when you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.399" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">a particular view it pervades everything</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">view is like the air that you breathe it</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.760" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">defines everything it&#39;s like how you see</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:31.440" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:33.279" style="s2">it&#39;s your understanding of the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.440" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">it&#39;s where where you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.279" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">somehow so it&#39;s connected to attitude</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">it&#39;s connected to</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">demeanor to stance all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">they&#39;re very slightly different they</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">have very strong connections and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">overlaps with view</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:49.920" style="s2">so how you see other people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:52.959" style="s2">that&#39;s very deeply connected to</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.920" end="00:14:55.920" style="s2">your framework of reference your view</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.959" end="00:14:55.920" style="s2">that may be hidden</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.639" end="00:15:01.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s a nebulous it&#39;s it&#39;s a nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">concept it&#39;s a bit difficult to describe</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.440" end="00:15:07.680" style="s2">um because it&#39;s so hidden</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:09.440" style="s2">um often</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">often i think view isn&#39;t particularly</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.440" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">coherent so you can flip</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">between different views without</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:15.839" style="s2">realizing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">according to what the pressures of</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.839" end="00:15:18.959" style="s2">circumstances are</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:21.120" style="s2">so there&#39;s this kind of modern bailey</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.959" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">pattern that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.120" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">and like where you retreat to one view</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">when the other one&#39;s threatened and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">you come back out to that view</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:34.079" style="s2">once the threat&#39;s gone and that just</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">happens so automatically that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.079" end="00:15:38.959" style="s2">you don&#39;t realize that that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:41.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like we usually have a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.959" end="00:15:43.040" style="s2">towards one particular very dominant</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.839" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.040" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">and then some alternatives kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:48.639" style="s2">stacked up that we can use</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.800" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">as that one fails and we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.639" end="00:15:53.839" style="s2">very easily slip into and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">go back to the dominant view but we</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.839" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">don&#39;t notice that we don&#39;t notice that</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:16:00.720" style="s2">we&#39;re employing views as coping</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">strategies in a way we&#39;ve just we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.720" end="00:16:04.639" style="s2">learned</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.759" end="00:16:06.639" style="s2">our frameworks of reference in order to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.639" end="00:16:10.240" style="s2">be able to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.639" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">life and to navigate our experience</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.240" end="00:16:17.199" style="s2">in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">helpful um useful way or it seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.199" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">it has seemed that way so when view</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.000" end="00:16:24.399" style="s2">becomes a practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">at that point you&#39;re bringing it</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.399" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">intentionally into conscious experience</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:31.279" style="s2">so the idea is that when you bring this</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">into consciousness and you regard it as</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.279" end="00:16:35.279" style="s2">a practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">then that&#39;s like a kind of intentional</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.279" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">immersion</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">so from the meta systematic perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:44.560" style="s2">the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:46.880" style="s2">arises it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.560" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">the the idea arises that it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.880" end="00:16:49.680" style="s2">to consciously move between different</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:52.000" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.680" end="00:16:54.079" style="s2">and to immerse yourself in one or</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.000" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">another or different methods</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.079" end="00:17:00.959" style="s2">in order to fully understand what</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:02.399" style="s2">that system is and how to come to terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.959" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">with it so there&#39;s this thing about</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.399" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">coming to terms with the system and for</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">that to occur there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.799" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">sense of complete immersion of really</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">like really getting to know how all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:15.360" style="s2">bits work or how</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">how it functions and going over and over</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">that and experiencing it</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">as it works again and again so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">you&#39;re very familiar with that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:27.120" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of embodying</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:27.120" style="s2">view in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.160" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">um in the in the buddhist context</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.919" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">system path method these are all words</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:38.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">pretty much relate to similar or the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.400" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">same kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.840" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.440" end="00:17:53.440" style="s2">your underlying view at any</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.640" end="00:17:54.400" style="s2">point is reflected in how you see</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.440" end="00:17:56.799" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.400" end="00:17:57.840" style="s2">and how you how you relate with your</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.799" end="00:18:00.960" style="s2">emotions</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.840" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">and your your sensed experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.960" end="00:18:04.799" style="s2">and it&#39;s connected to how you regard</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.799" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">and your attitude your whole attitude</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.360" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">towards the environment</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">to towards society towards nature</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:18.080" style="s2">so what i&#39;m going to do specifically</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">here is look</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.080" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">at the difference between citric view</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:22.320" style="s2">and tantric view which we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">some before but this is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">theme that</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:33.919" style="s2">that comes through this whole series</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:33.919" style="s2">and is recurring again and again um</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.000" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">but i&#39;m i&#39;m doing this specifically to</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:41.440" style="s2">sort of just go into detail about how</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:45.120" style="s2">views can be different</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.440" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s also a way of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.120" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">um it&#39;s giving away</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:54.160" style="s2">to when you&#39;re looking at books reading</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">books or when you&#39;re hearing other</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:57.919" style="s2">people speak or giving presentations or</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:19:00.880" style="s2">whatever that you can begin</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.919" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">to start distinguishing you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:04.160" style="s2">particularly in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">buddhist or a spiritual context start</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.160" end="00:19:08.160" style="s2">distinguishing between</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.240" end="00:19:09.280" style="s2">what are what are the views that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:11.600" style="s2">informing</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">or what is the dominant view that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.600" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">informing this particular person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.160" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">presentation you this is um</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:21.039" style="s2">this is something you could go into a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:22.840" style="s2">lot more detail like not just sutra not</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.039" end="00:19:24.790" style="s2">just tantra these are just very very</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.840" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">broad categories</p>

<p begin="00:19:32.480" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">you can also look at view in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.200" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">monism eternalism legalism dualism</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">and these are all very common views that</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">we tend to slip</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:48.400" style="s2">in between and which we use</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">invisibly we they kind of go unnoticed</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.400" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">so part of the work that he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">there is bringing</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:55.760" style="s2">those views into consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:19:58.160" style="s2">so that they can be much better</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:19:59.200" style="s2">understood as informing the way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.160" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.200" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">work the way that people address</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:06.799" style="s2">problems the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">relate and the way that we write books</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.799" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:16.159" style="s2">so i just wanted to make the point that</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:19.280" style="s2">the views that i am going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">look at in more detail here are just two</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.280" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">many many many even within buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:27.360" style="s2">and i like i like to look at these two</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.360" end="00:20:30.799" style="s2">they&#39;re very broad and so they they</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:33.039" style="s2">describe this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.799" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">really quite broad way of relating and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.039" end="00:20:39.600" style="s2">they&#39;re not difficult to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">once you&#39;re really aware of these um</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.600" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">different kind of orthogonal ways of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">relating to things then you can begin to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.679" end="00:20:49.760" style="s2">spot them a lot lot easier i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:52.000" style="s2">and i would like to go into zog chen</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.760" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">view a little as well but we may or may</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.000" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">not have</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:57.440" style="s2">time for that and maybe jared will um</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:21:00.840" style="s2">have something that he can say</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.440" end="00:21:04.000" style="s2">about that later as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.840" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">so um thinking about view</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.000" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">in relation to self so personal stuff</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:14.159" style="s2">our internal world our way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:16.000" style="s2">um all of our sense fields and our</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.159" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">cognition and everything that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">personal and</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">in in the cetric view</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">the kind of encapsulation of the view is</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.840" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">that uncontrolled emotions</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">are preventing you from freedom</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">from liberation from enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:35.200" style="s2">emotions particularly turbulent emotions</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.200" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">anger they</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:42.400" style="s2">they become obstacles you view those as</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.400" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">to your liberation so cetric view is</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">reflected in the way that you think</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">about your emotional life</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">your time yourself it&#39;s a project</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:55.919" style="s2">it&#39;s a project that you&#39;re working on so</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:21:58.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">analogy that i thought of in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.480" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">context was</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like a sculpture you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">um working to make this beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">perfect sculpture and you&#39;re chipping</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">away at the bits</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">that you don&#39;t want you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:13.919" style="s2">intricately involved in perfecting this</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.120" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.919" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">pure work of art and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:20.799" style="s2">the bits that you chop off or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">in the bits that you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:24.960" style="s2">honing away those are just completely</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:26.799" style="s2">irrelevant you&#39;re what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.960" end="00:22:29.280" style="s2">focused on and the way that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.799" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">working is just creating this</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.280" end="00:22:36.559" style="s2">beautiful eventually perfect</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">pure um</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.559" end="00:22:43.600" style="s2">object if you like or in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:46.000" style="s2">of practice it&#39;s subject um</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.600" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">so there&#39;s this idea of perfection of</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.000" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">ultimate purity</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">you&#39;re training your self towards and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:54.400" style="s2">that is no self that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">um you know there&#39;s this flip that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.400" end="00:22:59.440" style="s2">occurs because eventually</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">you hone everything away</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.440" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s this sort of sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">ideal of perfection</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">but eventually what that becomes is</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">cessation or</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">complete cessation of sensation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">so the perfect sculpture is when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">no material</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:18.559" style="s2">left it&#39;s just emptiness maybe a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">a crass analogy but</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.559" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">i wanted to get this project idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">established in relation to sutra</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">so not that tantra doesn&#39;t have projects</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:32.640" style="s2">there are many</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:35.360" style="s2">many sort of activities and projects the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">view which informs those is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.360" end="00:23:39.760" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">so cetric view establishes this goal</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">of purity of self of nonduality of self</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:48.159" style="s2">of experience of no self um</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">or emptiness of self that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.159" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.320" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">from ordinary experience now</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:58.720" style="s2">with tantra rather than uncontrolled</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">emotions preventing</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.720" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">liberation so the the emotions must be</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">pacified or tamed or calmed</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">tantra regards emotions as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">messed up</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">like they&#39;ve been convoluted and</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:15.120" style="s2">constrained and scrunched and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">squidged so they&#39;ve somehow been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.120" end="00:24:18.640" style="s2">shoved into this sort of tight</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">restricted highly limited</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">form is sometimes referred to as</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:27.520" style="s2">neuroses or distorted or unenlightened</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:30.840" style="s2">quality and personally i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">like those terms it&#39;s like the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.840" end="00:24:34.480" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:35.600" style="s2">the the view is that the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.480" end="00:24:38.400" style="s2">experience has been</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.600" end="00:24:39.760" style="s2">violently constricted by an enforced</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.400" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">habitual</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.760" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">compulsive mode or response</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:47.679" style="s2">and that&#39;s so instantaneous it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">see ourselves doing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.679" end="00:24:52.799" style="s2">but that is the thing within tantric</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">view that is seen to be the cause of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.799" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">limitation</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">so the tantric view towards self and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">emotions</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.679" end="00:25:01.360" style="s2">is that we&#39;ve done this this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">something that we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.360" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">and the review that the view sorry</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:11.600" style="s2">is reflected in wanting to engage</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">with those emotions in order to change</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.600" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">who and how we are so there&#39;s still this</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:17.520" style="s2">idea of liberation</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.520" end="00:25:19.360" style="s2">and particularly in outer tantra there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.520" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">a lot about purifying and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">perfecting and you know there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">this that idea is still there</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s much more mundane and messy</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:31.840" style="s2">tantra is</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">way more messy than sutra</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.840" end="00:25:35.760" style="s2">and the view is that liberation or</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:38.159" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.760" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">transformation is the principle which</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.159" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">the view informs</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:46.240" style="s2">so transformation is through involvement</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">with the ordinary everyday emotional</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.240" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">experience because there is this view of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">what we have done and how emotions are</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:54.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.919" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">changes the way that we&#39;re going to work</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">so in order for transformation to occur</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:01.679" style="s2">there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:02.880" style="s2">involvement it just doesn&#39;t happen at a</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.679" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">distance</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.880" end="00:26:08.000" style="s2">there isn&#39;t there&#39;s not an observer that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">you&#39;re creating that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.000" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">relating to an object you&#39;re getting in</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">involved you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.279" end="00:26:20.400" style="s2">allowing the space for transformation to</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:20.400" style="s2">occur</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.480" end="00:26:28.080" style="s2">because um with with sutra view</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">most meditation methods are informed by</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.080" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">sutra they emphasize calming</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">and pacifying emotions tantra is often</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">mistaken</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">um from that perspective tantra</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">mistaken to be about expression</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">because the opposite of renouncing and</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:46.400" style="s2">calming is thought to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">owning and expressing so it&#39;s seen to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.400" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:50.559" style="s2">and the difference that&#39;s perceived from</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">that perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.559" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">oh it&#39;s about getting into your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">and expressing and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">and you know having them and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:05.360" style="s2">so we&#39;re not talking about opposites</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">here so tantra isn&#39;t opposite to sutra</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.360" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of orthogonal to sutra it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">meta</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">like historically it was meta to suture</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:15.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of stepping outside</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.600" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">a sutra view there&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.440" end="00:27:20.880" style="s2">paradigm there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.960" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">not a continuation of sutra</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.880" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">it&#39;s different in principle that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">really important point to understand</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">about the difference in tantric</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:33.279" style="s2">view it&#39;s different in principle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">not a continuation it&#39;s not an expansion</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.279" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">so with regards to emotions that means</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:40.720" style="s2">engaging and becoming familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">somatic experience of emotion</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.720" end="00:27:43.919" style="s2">in order to have more choice available</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:46.960" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.919" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">than basic compulsive expression or</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.960" end="00:27:52.000" style="s2">repression or distraction</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:55.039" style="s2">or ignoring so you&#39;re not calming</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.000" end="00:27:58.559" style="s2">you&#39;re engaging in order</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.039" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">for that relationship to change</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.559" end="00:28:03.679" style="s2">so the way that we restrict and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.679" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">constrain our emotional experiences very</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.679" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">the tantric view towards emotions that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:11.919" style="s2">there are contortions that there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">distortions of their natural state</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.919" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">means that the practice occurs</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">in the presence of the emotion</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:23.600" style="s2">so that is a big difference so with</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">sutra the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.600" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">your your work or your practice is</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:31.279" style="s2">the presence of the emotion you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">finding the space</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.279" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">without the arising emotion and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:38.559" style="s2">where your practice is with tantra</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">your practice is with the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.559" end="00:28:42.159" style="s2">the arising emotion</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">so you&#39;re finding space with that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.159" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">not rejecting it or ignoring it</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">not calming</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.000" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">so when you get really skillful at that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:57.440" style="s2">you can channel the emotion effectively</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:58.480" style="s2">so for example with anger you feel the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.440" end="00:29:00.399" style="s2">anger</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.480" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">you understand the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.399" end="00:29:04.080" style="s2">arriving motion you kind of understand</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:06.559" style="s2">it experientially i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.080" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">and you find the liberated quality of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.559" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">the emotion which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:13.200" style="s2">clarity maybe or you know some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:16.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.200" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very clearing experience and there</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.080" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">is a choice</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">there and then maybe there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:24.559" style="s2">expression maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">a direct passionate statement which</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.559" end="00:29:28.799" style="s2">is it&#39;s just also going to be obviously</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:31.440" style="s2">kind because you have the spaciousness</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.799" end="00:29:32.720" style="s2">there so expression of emotion in</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.440" end="00:29:35.360" style="s2">buddhist hunter is never</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.720" end="00:29:37.120" style="s2">righteous it&#39;s not mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.360" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">expression of emotion is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">mean or vindictive or terrified or</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">peevish</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s just always based in</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:46.399" style="s2">spaciousness and spaciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:48.640" style="s2">kindness</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.399" end="00:29:49.840" style="s2">so with tantra and this is different to</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.640" end="00:29:52.399" style="s2">zogchen as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.840" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">so there&#39;s often a time gap there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.399" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">time gap between the arising</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:58.159" style="s2">of the emotion and the internal response</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:00.720" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.159" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">you&#39;re there is some work there there is</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.720" end="00:30:03.919" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:04.960" style="s2">you&#39;re allowing the spaciousness to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:07.440" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:08.399" style="s2">um maybe that&#39;s expression eventually</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.440" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">maybe it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.399" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">there&#39;s always this choice</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.159" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">so that was um</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.559" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a question that i think might be</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">worth worth addressing</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:31.279" style="s2">now uh siddharth did you did you want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:31.279" style="s2">mute yourself and ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:37.840" style="s2">or i can ask it for you</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:46.480" style="s2">your mic is coming from so uh when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.679" end="00:30:49.919" style="s2">say that tantra is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.480" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">uh not a continuation of sutra</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.919" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">is that what hold on i lost it</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:30:59.279" style="s2">is that with reference to the view</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:02.000" style="s2">associated with each path</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.279" end="00:31:03.919" style="s2">or with the paths themselves i know</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.000" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s said that the result of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.919" end="00:31:09.519" style="s2">sutra is the base of tatra</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:10.880" style="s2">right so it&#39;s both continuation not a</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.519" end="00:31:13.919" style="s2">continuation and i</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.880" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">am emphasizing the difference</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.919" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">at this moment but so it is continuation</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">in that sense but it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:22.799" style="s2">uh what i wanted to emphasize with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:24.480" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.799" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">in the sense that it is a different</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:30.320" style="s2">paradigm it&#39;s a different way of working</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:33.360" style="s2">so when we&#39;re talking about view view</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.320" end="00:31:36.799" style="s2">is what makes the difference</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.360" end="00:31:41.039" style="s2">so view is the sort of hub</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.799" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">of the discontinuation the discontinuity</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.039" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">so often and again the reason i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">emphasizing the difference is because</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">often the difference is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:54.320" style="s2">um covered over in some sense in order</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">for things to seem</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.320" end="00:31:58.559" style="s2">harmonious and continuous and and often</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:01.519" style="s2">tantra is viewed</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.559" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">from the perspective of sutra so what</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.519" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">i&#39;m doing here is viewing sutra from the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">perspective of tantra</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.440" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">and viewing tantra from its own</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">perspective in its own right</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">so from this view there is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">discontinuity</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:19.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s a really good question because</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">that&#39;s you know that is the usual</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.200" end="00:32:23.120" style="s2">presentation is yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">end point of sutra is the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.120" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">point of tantra and that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">important so thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">thanks for raising that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:37.760" style="s2">so i kind of waffled on a bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:41.360" style="s2">different views in relation to self</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">and to you know personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.360" end="00:32:45.919" style="s2">emotion and personal experience and what</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.840" end="00:32:48.559" style="s2">have you so</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.919" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">taking this into the realm of others the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.559" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">way that you view others</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.159" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">sutra views others as trapped and</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:33:00.159" style="s2">suffering in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:02.320" style="s2">we are with our emotions and experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.159" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">so the way that sutra views our self is</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.320" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">also reflected in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">sutra views other people and other</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:09.919" style="s2">people and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">you know people that we&#39;re relating with</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.919" end="00:33:13.519" style="s2">whether we know them or not</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:15.039" style="s2">so people are trapped people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.519" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">suffering suffering is</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.039" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">horrible it sucks and we can get out of</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">it that is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">the sutra view</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">because in this view you have some</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.519" end="00:33:27.519" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">of how things work as a practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.519" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">then there&#39;s a clearly defined way you</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.480" end="00:33:32.640" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">this defined way that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.640" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">end suffering and liberate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">might take a very very long time but</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">you&#39;re on that project so in some</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:47.519" style="s2">sense you regard yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">different to others in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.519" end="00:33:51.679" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:52.720" style="s2">liberated self is different to and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.679" end="00:33:56.279" style="s2">separate from</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.720" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">your emotional obstacles your own</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.279" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">impurities</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:07.360" style="s2">so in that way the purity of your own</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.840" end="00:34:08.879" style="s2">self is is separate from and different</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.360" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">to others as well so</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.879" end="00:34:15.839" style="s2">your pure self is pitying of others</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">who um are in this same horrible</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.839" end="00:34:21.440" style="s2">slush pile of nasty suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:22.639" style="s2">you have compassion for others because</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.440" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">your view</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.639" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">is that they are suffering you view them</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:29.440" style="s2">as trapped like parts of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:30.560" style="s2">that you&#39;re seeing as obstacles and as</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.440" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">trapped</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.560" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">and so this is how meta practice comes</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:38.000" style="s2">about it&#39;s about curing for</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:39.119" style="s2">purifying purifying your own impurities</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.000" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">and your own negative</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.119" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">karma through magically purifying others</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">of theirs</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.720" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">as well you&#39;re bringing good will and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:50.159" style="s2">purity and light and benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:50.879" style="s2">intention into your interactions with</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.159" end="00:34:52.800" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.879" end="00:34:54.320" style="s2">in order to assist in the project of</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.800" end="00:34:57.680" style="s2">getting rid of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">and bad feelings it&#39;s a meta matter is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.680" end="00:35:03.599" style="s2">very much tied up with sutrick view</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">of others there&#39;s this purification</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.599" end="00:35:08.800" style="s2">um principle and this this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:11.040" style="s2">bringing wholesomeness</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">and the view of others is informed by</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.040" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">the idea that suffering is the natural</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:16.240" style="s2">condition</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:18.320" style="s2">and that it&#39;s possible to escape from it</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.240" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">you&#39;re renouncing suffering</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.320" end="00:35:22.079" style="s2">so that your your view is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:25.680" style="s2">moving beyond suffering</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.079" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a way out others can escape from</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.680" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">it as well and your purpose</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:32.720" style="s2">is to bring relief to others by</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:33.680" style="s2">distancing even from the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.720" end="00:35:36.800" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.680" end="00:35:37.680" style="s2">that&#39;s very much emphasized in centric</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.800" end="00:35:40.560" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.680" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">and that can be a very very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.560" end="00:35:43.760" style="s2">wholesome practice if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:46.560" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re going through a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.760" end="00:35:46.560" style="s2">time or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:53.359" style="s2">in tantra because tantric view towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">how the world is and ourself and our</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.359" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">emotions is very different it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:36:00.640" style="s2">different in relation to others so in</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">tantra you&#39;re not rejecting your own</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.640" end="00:36:05.839" style="s2">impurities and inadequacies</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:07.599" style="s2">as such you&#39;re continuing to experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.839" end="00:36:09.119" style="s2">and feel the messiness</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.599" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">of your emotional world there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.119" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">clearly defined thing between this is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">good emotion this is a bad emotion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:18.000" style="s2">just all</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:20.000" style="s2">a jumble of different</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.000" end="00:36:21.200" style="s2">you know a lot of incoherence there and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.000" end="00:36:23.520" style="s2">your view</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">of others experiences that their view is</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.520" end="00:36:29.280" style="s2">equally messy and unpredictable as</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:31.040" style="s2">your own so with tantric practice</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.280" end="00:36:32.320" style="s2">you&#39;re engaging with all the qualities</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.040" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">of your own being</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.320" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">so the view towards others is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:38.079" style="s2">you&#39;re engaging with all their</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">qualities too you&#39;re not assisting or</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.079" end="00:36:41.440" style="s2">purifying</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:42.880" style="s2">other people with your own purity you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.440" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">dancing with them</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.880" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">you&#39;re recognizing and engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">their individual quirks and</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:51.400" style="s2">personalities because</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:52.640" style="s2">how you relate to yourself is</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.400" end="00:36:56.320" style="s2">non-renunciative</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.640" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">so also that view manifests</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.320" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">in relationship with others</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">so with yourself you&#39;re opening up space</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.520" end="00:37:05.440" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">choicefulness with regards to your</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.440" end="00:37:08.720" style="s2">emotions and your experience and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">the same towards others you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.720" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">for the space</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:13.040" style="s2">making it available for them you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:15.359" style="s2">engaging with who</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.040" end="00:37:17.440" style="s2">and how they happen to be in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.359" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">and accepting their emotions and their</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.440" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">constraints</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">as just being a part of the play</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">of how we</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">human how we are you know how we relate</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">in the world so the tantric view towards</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.359" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">others is that rather</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:36.560" style="s2">than rejecting anyone you&#39;re seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:40.000" style="s2">understand because</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.560" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">transformation can&#39;t occur without first</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">understanding so again there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:46.800" style="s2">this sense of a kind of time lag in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:48.079" style="s2">work that you&#39;re doing in your practice</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.800" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">it takes time</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.079" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">from the initial recognition and</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:54.079" style="s2">engagement to get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:56.640" style="s2">where transformation can occur because</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.079" end="00:37:59.839" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re having to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.640" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">find the space like we were</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.839" end="00:38:02.800" style="s2">getting back to the question that</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">somebody asked there you find a space</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.800" end="00:38:05.119" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:06.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the starting point that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.119" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">base for tantric practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.960" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">you find the space in the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.560" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">so is that i&#39;m going to go on to talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.720" end="00:38:22.320" style="s2">about relationship with the world and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">environment and nature and stuff but</p>

<p begin="00:39:02.800" end="00:39:07.599" style="s2">uh sutra tantric</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.839" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">practices is better for them based on</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.599" end="00:39:13.440" style="s2">their personality or</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">stage of stage of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.440" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s interesting um you know i</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:20.320" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">well from the tantric perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.320" end="00:39:27.040" style="s2">personality is really important</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">and um your personality in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.040" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">is your practice it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:33.280" style="s2">connected to your</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:34.880" style="s2">your practice in sutra that is not so</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.280" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.880" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">the case in sutra there&#39;s a general a</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">general answer that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.520" end="00:39:43.580" style="s2">applicative to everybody so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:44.960" style="s2">aiming towards a</p>

<p begin="00:39:44.960" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">sameness rather than difference so</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">i think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">i think it would be appropriate for</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.920" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">somebody to practice according to</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">which of those views they feel is most</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">resonant</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.119" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">i think the the sutric view can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">that can be very helpful if you are</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:19.200" style="s2">you know if you are in a position where</p>

<p begin="00:40:29.359" end="00:40:34.400" style="s2">you know it can actually be really</p>

<p begin="00:40:34.400" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">and it can be very very helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:45.280" style="s2">work within a very clear set</p>

<p begin="00:41:10.240" end="00:41:14.640" style="s2">learning how to systematize then i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">sutra practice is just</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.640" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">fabulous for that it really really can</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:21.400" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">people just become more</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.400" end="00:41:27.359" style="s2">systematized as beings</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.280" end="00:41:29.839" style="s2">and you know some of the some of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.359" end="00:41:29.839" style="s2">sutra</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.920" end="00:41:34.960" style="s2">organizations and approaches are very</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:38.240" style="s2">very good at doing that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.960" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">you know like going because goenka&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.240" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">is very good at that tmi i think is</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">probably really great at helping people</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">systematize um</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.520" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">uh we have another one from mauro uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">maybe i&#39;ll just say it just so we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:41:58.160" style="s2">move forward um</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:41:59.599" style="s2">what are the practical differences</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.160" end="00:42:00.880" style="s2">between a tantrica and a sutra</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.599" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.880" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">uh with relation to others if you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:06.480" style="s2">give</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:07.839" style="s2">some specific example uh that&#39;d be great</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.480" end="00:42:10.079" style="s2">that&#39;d be great yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.839" end="00:42:11.760" style="s2">well in the extreme a sushi practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.079" end="00:42:14.319" style="s2">is in a monastery</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.760" end="00:42:16.560" style="s2">sitting in their little meditation box</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.319" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">so they can stay awake all night</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.560" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">or stay aware all night whatever or you</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.280" end="00:42:24.079" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:25.599" style="s2">that the sort of archetypal extremes of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.079" end="00:42:28.880" style="s2">you know the the tantrica</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.599" end="00:42:32.480" style="s2">is the chad who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:34.640" style="s2">like you know bring it on bring it on</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.480" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">you know i&#39;m a hero i can do all of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.640" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:39.359" style="s2">uh i have infinite compassion i have</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:42.400" style="s2">infinite generosity</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:44.319" style="s2">and you know the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.400" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">suit this is the view from tantra</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.319" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">obviously the archetypal sutra</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">practitioner is somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">you know really very careful</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:59.520" style="s2">very considered very</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:02.960" style="s2">cautious in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.520" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">the potential danger and</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.960" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">implosion and explosion of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of taming there</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:12.880" style="s2">um and yeah you might go to a monastery</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:14.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.880" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">really spend quite a lot of time in</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.640" end="00:43:19.520" style="s2">contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.240" end="00:43:21.119" style="s2">practice you know really slowing things</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.520" end="00:43:23.119" style="s2">down a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:24.400" style="s2">paying a lot of attention to every</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.119" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:29.040" style="s2">so the the sutra and when that gets</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">translated into sort of ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.040" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">everyday life the citric view</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:38.160" style="s2">is to really like pay</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">deliberate attention to what is going on</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.160" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">like constantly renew this</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:48.079" style="s2">um what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:51.680" style="s2">this you know there&#39;s a slight sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.079" end="00:43:53.839" style="s2">um objectification there</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:54.880" style="s2">in terms of observing and bringing</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.839" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">observation or</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.880" end="00:44:02.280" style="s2">noticing or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">uh yeah yeah i&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.280" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">caricaturing the tantrica and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:12.720" style="s2">practitioner so a couple other quick</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:16.079" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.720" end="00:44:17.839" style="s2">uh purple uh you say if uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.079" end="00:44:19.200" style="s2">if sutra has general answers that apply</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.839" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">to everyone does that mean that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.200" end="00:44:22.560" style="s2">tantra has specific answers that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:24.079" style="s2">different for everyone yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">i think yeah that would that we could</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.079" end="00:44:29.920" style="s2">just give a yep</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.560" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">uh and then another one from robert uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.920" end="00:44:33.680" style="s2">stonehill what is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:35.359" style="s2">motivation for action and tantra</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.680" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">assuming that purification is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.359" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">ultimate motivation for sutra</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.040" end="00:44:53.440" style="s2">the the motivation is</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.319" end="00:44:59.599" style="s2">in buddhist terms it is i&#39;m trying not</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.400" end="00:45:01.680" style="s2">to use buddhist terms here but in</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.599" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">buddhist terms the the motivate</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.680" end="00:45:07.040" style="s2">motivation comes from the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:10.560" style="s2">unification of compassion and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.040" end="00:45:13.599" style="s2">so the motivation is already</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.560" end="00:45:13.599" style="s2">based in</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.839" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">spaciousness and spaciousness naturally</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.000" end="00:45:20.079" style="s2">gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:20.800" style="s2">compassion and so the motivation for</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.079" end="00:45:24.800" style="s2">tantra</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.800" end="00:45:27.040" style="s2">is often regarded as compassion</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.800" end="00:45:27.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.440" end="00:45:32.640" style="s2">i think i&#39;d like to look at it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">of active</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.640" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">engagement so the motivation is much</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">more about</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:42.720" style="s2">being creative it&#39;s about creative um</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">the motivation is to create good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.720" end="00:45:48.400" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">create good useful um</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">appropriate congruent</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:57.440" style="s2">um interrelations</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:45:59.040" style="s2">um you know appropriate congruent</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.440" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:02.400" style="s2">organizations and institutions and</p>

<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:31.440" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re speaking of the caricatures</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.240" end="00:46:35.599" style="s2">of sutra and tantra</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.440" end="00:46:38.000" style="s2">uh and you know pretty much uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.599" end="00:46:40.160" style="s2">any any lineages or or teachings or</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.000" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">systems that you&#39;re gonna run into today</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.160" end="00:46:47.200" style="s2">um they are very blended uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:49.119" style="s2">uh in a very extreme sense uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.200" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re a hardcore sutrick</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:53.839" style="s2">practitioner that might mean that</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:55.760" style="s2">uh you know emotions of all sort are</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.839" end="00:46:56.960" style="s2">just forbidden uh you know charlie i</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.760" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">think you told me about</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.960" end="00:47:02.319" style="s2">running into some uh theravadan uh monks</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:04.000" style="s2">in tibet and you know they they just</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.319" end="00:47:04.560" style="s2">they&#39;re fit the stone cold face like</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:07.280" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.560" end="00:47:08.800" style="s2">they are completely removed from any of</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.280" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">the the human element</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.800" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">um but mahayana which is is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.240" end="00:47:17.920" style="s2">more a more common uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.359" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">it includes some of this emotion but</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.920" end="00:47:20.960" style="s2">it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:21.839" style="s2">specifically uh you know the heartful</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.960" end="00:47:24.240" style="s2">emotion</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.839" end="00:47:25.119" style="s2">uh the meta uh you know and so it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.240" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.119" end="00:47:28.800" style="s2">starting to include uh emotion but not</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.839" end="00:47:31.440" style="s2">but with limits</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.800" end="00:47:33.119" style="s2">um and so yeah this this is seeing</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.440" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">things on the spectrum i think is really</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.119" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">um and yeah it just it does really get</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:39.680" style="s2">messy in a lot of ways that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">good way of looking at it and then the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.680" end="00:47:43.680" style="s2">so then the the next little step on from</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">that mahayana</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.680" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">is the outer tantra and that and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:54.800" style="s2">starts to just um have more</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:56.559" style="s2">of the relationship with oh emotions</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.800" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">that previously were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.559" end="00:48:01.119" style="s2">seen as a bit negative or whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:01.839" style="s2">there&#39;s still the purifying aspect there</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:03.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.839" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s a really great way of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:08.800" style="s2">putting it jared thank you</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:12.400" style="s2">yeah good view so</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.800" end="00:48:14.240" style="s2">thinking about how view</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.400" end="00:48:16.400" style="s2">affects our relationship with nature and</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.240" end="00:48:19.680" style="s2">the environment and the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.400" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">at large so traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.680" end="00:48:23.359" style="s2">very traditionally like jared was just</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:26.400" style="s2">saying in the sutrix view</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.359" end="00:48:26.960" style="s2">your um the view towards the world is</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.400" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.960" end="00:48:30.720" style="s2">are aiming to leave it and if at all</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:31.200" style="s2">possible you do that while you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.720" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.200" end="00:48:36.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not kidding i&#39;m not you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">the citric view is to leave this</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.000" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">world so sutra has this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:41.680" style="s2">minimalist</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:42.720" style="s2">quality to it you&#39;re uncluttering your</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.680" end="00:48:45.040" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.720" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">to make it a conducive habitat for you</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.040" end="00:48:49.680" style="s2">to nurture</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:50.079" style="s2">your your virtuous side your pure sides</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.079" end="00:48:54.079" style="s2">like for example you don&#39;t want babies</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:57.920" style="s2">around they&#39;re going to mess things up</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.079" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">and make it extremely difficult</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.920" end="00:49:03.200" style="s2">because they&#39;ll be getting in the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.200" end="00:49:06.880" style="s2">anything that gets in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.200" end="00:49:08.559" style="s2">attaining pure</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.880" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">pure life and enlightenment with this</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.559" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">kind of capital e</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.720" end="00:49:14.559" style="s2">is non-conducive to the path so</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:16.240" style="s2">sometimes you get these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.559" end="00:49:18.160" style="s2">compromises where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.240" end="00:49:20.079" style="s2">well yeah okay you know you can still</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.160" end="00:49:21.359" style="s2">practice and have babies and stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.079" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">it will be harder and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.359" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">will take a lot longer and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:31.359" style="s2">so it is actually very hard to practice</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">sutra sincerely with babies and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.359" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">stuff around and there&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.960" end="00:49:38.640" style="s2">it&#39;s you know citric view traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">was anti-natalist</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.640" end="00:49:42.079" style="s2">you took vows of celibacy you went off</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">to a monastery</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.079" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">your environment was honed to reflect</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:50.000" style="s2">the the purity of emptiness so for</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.000" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">practicing that path sex and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:50:01.280" style="s2">families and being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:03.839" style="s2">was just like a big no-no um</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.280" end="00:50:05.839" style="s2">so a very interesting thing happens with</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.839" end="00:50:09.599" style="s2">the view towards</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.839" end="00:50:13.119" style="s2">nature in sutra there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.599" end="00:50:15.359" style="s2">distinct split that occurs</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.119" end="00:50:15.359" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.319" end="00:50:19.839" style="s2">this is a maybe a bit more of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.079" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">traditional view but</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.839" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">you would regard all of nature as</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:25.359" style="s2">disgusting this this is really explicit</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:27.520" style="s2">in the sutras</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.359" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">it&#39;s gross it&#39;s worldly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.520" end="00:50:31.440" style="s2">non-conducive to practice</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.200" end="00:50:32.240" style="s2">animals are dumb and less lucky than you</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.440" end="00:50:34.559" style="s2">are in your</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.240" end="00:50:36.079" style="s2">fortunate precious human rebirth there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">this kind of sense that</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.079" end="00:50:39.119" style="s2">the body is gross there are practices</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:41.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.119" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">cultivate the view of the body is really</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:44.559" style="s2">disgusting and horrible and you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:47.839" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.559" end="00:50:49.280" style="s2">same view towards nature it&#39;s full of</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.839" end="00:50:52.720" style="s2">horrible creepy</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.280" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">creepy crawlies and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.720" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">they reflect how you yourself are</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:50:59.280" style="s2">captured into</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:51:00.880" style="s2">habitual compulsive cycles of of pattern</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:03.520" style="s2">and response that you want to get away</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.880" end="00:51:06.800" style="s2">from you want to escape</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">but on the other hand i think and</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.800" end="00:51:11.200" style="s2">looking at sutra in its modern</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:13.359" style="s2">contemporary context</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.200" end="00:51:15.520" style="s2">i think a very different kind of split</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.359" end="00:51:18.079" style="s2">has happened it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:19.200" style="s2">as it has become modernized you get this</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.079" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">opposite view of nature it&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">romanticism it&#39;s sort of incorporating</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">idealism and romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:32.000" style="s2">into buddhist approaches and you get</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">this kind of saccharine</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:40.559" style="s2">pure very kitsch attitude that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:42.559" style="s2">separating you from the reality</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.559" end="00:51:43.599" style="s2">and the messiness of nature you get this</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.559" end="00:51:45.920" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s stripping nature of</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.920" end="00:51:50.240" style="s2">anything dangerous and dirty</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:52.079" style="s2">sees only the beauty only and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.240" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">kind of distance there</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.079" end="00:51:56.400" style="s2">so you&#39;re romanticizing and observing</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:58.400" style="s2">from a distance</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.400" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">and then you can kind of reset that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.400" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">can regard nature as very pure</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:04.559" style="s2">as well so there&#39;s this split into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">world is</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">either kind of gross and horrible or</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.400" end="00:52:14.079" style="s2">there&#39;s this sort of thing that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.319" end="00:52:16.880" style="s2">brought from the western tradition into</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.079" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">regarding the world as sort of very pure</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.880" end="00:52:24.319" style="s2">and beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:25.839" style="s2">um not having that kind of nastiness</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.319" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">and that reflects the citric view</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.839" end="00:52:28.800" style="s2">towards the self it&#39;s like you strip the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:30.160" style="s2">self of all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.800" end="00:52:32.800" style="s2">dangerous stuff of anything</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.160" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">uncontrollable and unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.800" end="00:52:39.520" style="s2">um i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:41.760" style="s2">with sutrick view when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.520" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">really take centric view on</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.760" end="00:52:45.200" style="s2">um sincerely there&#39;s also this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:47.920" style="s2">danger</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.200" end="00:52:49.920" style="s2">that you might start role playing into</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.920" end="00:52:52.640" style="s2">this sort of pure self</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.920" end="00:52:53.680" style="s2">and sometimes i think when sutrick</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:57.680" style="s2">viewers</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:52:57.680" style="s2">is scorned or</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.000" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">when it&#39;s looked at as as being sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:03.440" style="s2">oh no</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.280" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">or whatever that what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.440" end="00:53:08.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.280" end="00:53:11.440" style="s2">people we&#39;re seeing we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.400" end="00:53:13.359" style="s2">a sort of false presentation</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.440" end="00:53:14.800" style="s2">of sutrick view there&#39;s like this sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.359" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">of virtuous holy good</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.800" end="00:53:20.000" style="s2">self that&#39;s prescribed and very</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:22.240" style="s2">confirming and confining</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.000" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">um a matter i think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.240" end="00:53:26.720" style="s2">ways that the sutra</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">view can backfire it can become in</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.720" end="00:53:31.119" style="s2">it can sort of prescribe this very fixed</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:34.400" style="s2">personality that people</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.119" end="00:53:38.240" style="s2">try to model themselves into or</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.400" end="00:53:40.160" style="s2">you know that we might try to um</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.240" end="00:53:42.240" style="s2">mold ourselves into being this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.160" end="00:53:44.960" style="s2">fixed personality</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.240" end="00:53:46.240" style="s2">and so tantra backfires in a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.960" end="00:53:48.720" style="s2">different kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.240" end="00:53:49.280" style="s2">what what tends to happen with tantric</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.720" end="00:53:52.960" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.280" end="00:53:55.359" style="s2">is that the expression of</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.960" end="00:53:56.720" style="s2">emotion is mistaken as the practice</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.359" end="00:53:59.440" style="s2">because you&#39;re doing all this work to</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.720" end="00:54:01.680" style="s2">embrace and engage with your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:03.920" style="s2">and especially if that&#39;s invaluable and</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.680" end="00:54:05.359" style="s2">revelatory and it can be revelatory if</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.920" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">you&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.359" end="00:54:09.200" style="s2">having practiced a lot of sutra that can</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:12.480" style="s2">be a really</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.200" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">valuable and and um useful experience</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.480" end="00:54:15.200" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.599" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">what can happen is you get into this</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">cycle of immediate compulsive expression</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:22.319" style="s2">which is kind of very ironic of course</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:26.079" style="s2">because that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.319" end="00:54:28.640" style="s2">sutra trains you to avoid so it can</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.079" end="00:54:30.079" style="s2">seem like when you&#39;re stepping into</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.640" end="00:54:32.319" style="s2">tantra and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.079" end="00:54:34.160" style="s2">transitioning your view into tantric</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.319" end="00:54:36.559" style="s2">view that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.160" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">you have this sort of liberated</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:40.079" style="s2">expression of emotion and your sudden</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:42.000" style="s2">you know you&#39;re in touch with all your</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.079" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">emotions and it&#39;s fabulous and</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.000" end="00:54:47.119" style="s2">you&#39;re just kind of vomiting them all</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:49.280" style="s2">over everybody um</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not uncommon when when somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.280" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.960" end="00:54:55.920" style="s2">beginning to make that move</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.160" end="00:54:57.920" style="s2">from sutra practice into tantric</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.920" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">practice and the inter-tantric view</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.920" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">that can happen very naturally at a</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:03.520" style="s2">certain point</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">like if you&#39;ve been living an ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.520" end="00:55:08.240" style="s2">life engaging with the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">but not you know trying to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.240" end="00:55:13.359" style="s2">restrict your emotions or</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">behave in a very sort of dissociated</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.359" end="00:55:18.319" style="s2">detached</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:20.720" style="s2">way and then you open up to tantric view</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.319" end="00:55:23.440" style="s2">you can get this kind of backlash that</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.720" end="00:55:25.280" style="s2">is not uncommon</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.440" end="00:55:27.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve not been used to embracing your</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.280" end="00:55:29.599" style="s2">emotion and sensation so you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.680" end="00:55:32.640" style="s2">trying to pacify it and calm it and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.599" end="00:55:34.400" style="s2">you get to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.640" end="00:55:36.799" style="s2">something about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.400" end="00:55:39.119" style="s2">renunciative frameworks and view</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.799" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">being maybe not what you want and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.119" end="00:55:44.319" style="s2">in that situation kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:46.960" style="s2">total compulsive expression can it can</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.319" end="00:55:48.640" style="s2">feel very liberating it can feel like</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.960" end="00:55:50.640" style="s2">that is the practice</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.640" end="00:55:52.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve kind of gone off track to where</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:53.440" style="s2">were they so yeah the tantric view</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.480" end="00:55:56.480" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.440" end="00:55:57.839" style="s2">nature and the environment so</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">the tantric relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.839" end="00:56:00.480" style="s2">environment with the natural world is</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.480" end="00:56:04.559" style="s2">it&#39;s all about creativity um</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:05.920" style="s2">metaphorically or</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.559" end="00:56:07.920" style="s2">maybe even literally you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.920" end="00:56:08.559" style="s2">you&#39;re a gardener you&#39;re nurturing</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.920" end="00:56:10.640" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.559" end="00:56:12.400" style="s2">assessing you&#39;re tweaking you&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:16.240" style="s2">space for things to grow</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.400" end="00:56:18.720" style="s2">you&#39;re cultivating something in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.240" end="00:56:20.400" style="s2">inner direction so you&#39;re changing</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.720" end="00:56:23.200" style="s2">circumstances with</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.400" end="00:56:25.359" style="s2">with tantric relationship with the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.200" end="00:56:26.319" style="s2">you&#39;re changing circumstances to give</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.359" end="00:56:30.160" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.319" end="00:56:31.680" style="s2">around you the best chance to grow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.160" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">like you&#39;re watering it</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.680" end="00:56:36.160" style="s2">making sure that there&#39;s some light</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:37.920" style="s2">there there&#39;s a lot of involvement</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.160" end="00:56:40.720" style="s2">but you&#39;re not focused on the outcome</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.920" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2">you&#39;re engaged in the process</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.720" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">so you may have an overall kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:46.160" style="s2">intention or purpose you may have</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:47.680" style="s2">a sense of where you&#39;re heading but you</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.160" end="00:56:49.200" style="s2">don&#39;t always know</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.680" end="00:56:50.880" style="s2">how you&#39;re going to get there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.200" end="00:56:52.880" style="s2">this kind of looseness</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.880" end="00:56:54.480" style="s2">again it&#39;s about playfulness it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:56.880" style="s2">a willingness toward</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.480" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">trial and error towards tweaking things</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.880" end="00:57:00.799" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">you&#39;ll often hear people referring to</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.799" end="00:57:07.680" style="s2">tantric practice as being like dancing</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:09.520" style="s2">and the result is being fluidity</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.680" end="00:57:11.680" style="s2">this is pertinent in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.520" end="00:57:15.200" style="s2">the the environment because</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.680" end="00:57:17.520" style="s2">it&#39;s engaged creative play the view</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.200" end="00:57:18.400" style="s2">towards the environment as having this</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.520" end="00:57:21.920" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.400" end="00:57:25.520" style="s2">unpredictable messy chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.920" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">gorgeous everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.520" end="00:57:32.000" style="s2">quality is it that</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.799" end="00:57:32.720" style="s2">view if you review if if you view the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.000" end="00:57:36.000" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.720" end="00:57:39.760" style="s2">in that way then that gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.000" end="00:57:41.680" style="s2">a relationship that involves engaged</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.760" end="00:57:43.680" style="s2">creative play</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.680" end="00:57:45.920" style="s2">that that all comes out of your</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.680" end="00:57:47.119" style="s2">meditation practice that&#39;s the direction</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.920" end="00:57:50.319" style="s2">that your meditation</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.119" end="00:57:53.839" style="s2">leads so she named practice that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.319" end="00:57:55.280" style="s2">referring to here or opening practice is</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.839" end="00:57:57.760" style="s2">always the base</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.280" end="00:57:58.400" style="s2">for something else in tantric practice</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.760" end="00:58:01.760" style="s2">it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.400" end="00:58:03.599" style="s2">the the end thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.760" end="00:58:05.520" style="s2">it&#39;s always the foundation it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.599" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">the ground for</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.520" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">the next way of relating or</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:12.799" style="s2">the next practice or it&#39;s always there</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:15.119" style="s2">as the ground</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.799" end="00:58:17.440" style="s2">of your practice and the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.119" end="00:58:20.160" style="s2">experience in meditation provides the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.440" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">security and the self-reliance so a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.160" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">of tantric practice is about developing</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:26.319" style="s2">self-reliance really it&#39;s the confidence</p>

<p begin="00:59:56.240" end="01:00:02.400" style="s2">emphasizing the difference</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.079" end="01:00:07.760" style="s2">in views here you can&#39;t romanticize</p>

<p begin="01:00:11.280" end="01:00:15.839" style="s2">some sort of distance there to be able</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.200" end="01:00:15.839" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.000" end="01:00:19.359" style="s2">tantric view is very realist in that</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:22.640" style="s2">sense a very</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.359" end="01:00:24.000" style="s2">pragmatic it&#39;s involved engagement with</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.640" end="01:00:25.119" style="s2">things as they are it&#39;s not kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.000" end="01:00:27.680" style="s2">climbing</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.119" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">some neatly prepared steps with railings</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.680" end="01:00:30.319" style="s2">to a scenic view with a signpost telling</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.839" end="01:00:31.920" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.319" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">where the scenic view is and then a big</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.920" end="01:00:36.559" style="s2">board at the top saying scenic view</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:38.720" style="s2">so that you know that&#39;s kind of very</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.559" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">reassuring you know that you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.720" end="01:00:42.079" style="s2">scenic view</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.359" end="01:00:42.960" style="s2">you know that that&#39;s what that is tantra</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.079" end="01:00:45.839" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.960" end="01:00:46.480" style="s2">tantra just doesn&#39;t do that it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.839" end="01:00:51.119" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.480" end="01:00:51.119" style="s2">view in that way it&#39;s not very scenic</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.760" end="01:00:55.040" style="s2">i would say charlie that the equanimity</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.480" end="01:00:56.960" style="s2">component</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.040" end="01:00:58.400" style="s2">the only way i see it fitting in here in</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.960" end="01:01:01.680" style="s2">the transition is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.400" end="01:01:03.760" style="s2">um spaciousness itself</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.680" end="01:01:05.040" style="s2">is equinamious in the sense that it</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.760" end="01:01:06.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have it doesn&#39;t have much of an</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.040" end="01:01:08.880" style="s2">agenda</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.000" end="01:01:09.680" style="s2">yeah right but that and and that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.880" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">creates</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.680" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">you know if we&#39;re using this dancing</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:16.319" style="s2">metaphor um</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.280" end="01:01:19.280" style="s2">you know you need space to dance in</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.319" end="01:01:19.839" style="s2">uh and and the more spaciousness is in</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.280" end="01:01:21.760" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.839" end="01:01:24.480" style="s2">you know the bigger the dance floor uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.760" end="01:01:27.520" style="s2">the more possibility there is uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.480" end="01:01:31.280" style="s2">for movement and interaction um</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.520" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">yeah so yeah it but that does not mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.280" end="01:01:35.599" style="s2">that that we&#39;re dispassionately uh and</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:38.319" style="s2">and completely</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.599" end="01:01:38.960" style="s2">equanimous with uh the the actual</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.319" end="01:01:41.680" style="s2">dancing</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.960" end="01:01:42.319" style="s2">uh we&#39;re actually fully engaged with it</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.680" end="01:01:44.799" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.319" end="01:01:46.000" style="s2">i think um equanimity has become very</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.799" end="01:01:50.799" style="s2">much associated with</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.000" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">calmness don&#39;t you think</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.799" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">yeah for sure yeah i think yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.319" end="01:01:58.559" style="s2">like you&#39;re saying maybe the tantric</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.079" end="01:01:59.599" style="s2">view towards equanimity is more to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.559" end="01:02:04.559" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.599" end="01:02:04.559" style="s2">um equality of</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.200" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">stuff arising something like that it</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.319" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.119" end="01:02:16.000" style="s2">shifts the emphasis somehow i think</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:16.960" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know maybe i should just</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.000" end="01:02:18.839" style="s2">kind of stop</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.960" end="01:02:20.319" style="s2">waffling now and we can should we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.839" end="01:02:22.400" style="s2">our</p>

<p begin="01:04:22.880" end="01:04:25.599" style="s2">spaciousness</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.160" end="01:04:28.480" style="s2">uh whereas you know something like</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.599" end="01:04:30.240" style="s2">cessation uh that that is in the citric</p>

<p begin="01:04:49.520" end="01:04:54.160" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.400" end="01:04:57.200" style="s2">uh states in the citric path will</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.160" end="01:04:59.280" style="s2">lead you to a place which which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.200" end="01:05:01.039" style="s2">the end point as well is it&#39;s connected</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.280" end="01:05:02.160" style="s2">to the end point so it&#39;s very different</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.039" end="01:05:04.720" style="s2">in that sense that</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.160" end="01:05:07.200" style="s2">you you&#39;re not hearing you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.720" end="01:05:10.319" style="s2">experiencing sensation you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.200" end="01:05:14.000" style="s2">um you know all of your sensations are</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.319" end="01:05:17.760" style="s2">pacified so yeah sheena doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.000" end="01:05:21.839" style="s2">you don&#39;t um you know sensation might</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.760" end="01:05:23.359" style="s2">change a lot with shine practice because</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.839" end="01:05:26.160" style="s2">you are simply</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.359" end="01:05:27.039" style="s2">simply allowing it to occur naturally</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.160" end="01:05:31.200" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.039" end="01:05:34.640" style="s2">sort of that conceptual grip that often</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.200" end="01:05:37.599" style="s2">shrouds it but um</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.640" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">yeah so concept just naturally seems to</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.599" end="01:05:42.400" style="s2">die down</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.319" end="01:05:42.400" style="s2">like thoughts naturally</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.559" end="01:05:47.760" style="s2">dissolve because that&#39;s what they do</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.400" end="01:05:47.760" style="s2">when they have space around them</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.039" end="01:05:52.480" style="s2">i noticed uh nicole you said tantric</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.119" end="01:05:54.480" style="s2">practice sounds more</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.480" end="01:05:55.760" style="s2">unification oriented than suture</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.480" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.760" end="01:06:00.160" style="s2">yeah i think that that&#39;s a perfect way</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:02.880" style="s2">of describing it um yeah that i think</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.160" end="01:06:04.160" style="s2">uh you know yogi uh which which is kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.880" end="01:06:06.720" style="s2">of alluding to this yoking</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.160" end="01:06:07.920" style="s2">uh whereas yeah the the tantra is is</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.720" end="01:06:10.960" style="s2">yoking</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.920" end="01:06:12.799" style="s2">uh the result of of sutra</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.960" end="01:06:14.079" style="s2">with everything else uh so that they</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.799" end="01:06:17.200" style="s2">become kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.079" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">inseparable in some sense and in</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.200" end="01:06:22.000" style="s2">in traditional terminology you would say</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.839" end="01:06:23.359" style="s2">tantric practice is the unification of</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.000" end="01:06:25.520" style="s2">emptiness and form or</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.359" end="01:06:27.119" style="s2">the the non-duality of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.520" end="01:06:30.079" style="s2">compassion</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.119" end="01:06:32.720" style="s2">and unification is often you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.079" end="01:06:35.440" style="s2">inner tantras that&#39;s connected to</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.720" end="01:06:37.119" style="s2">um unification of male and female and</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.440" end="01:06:40.079" style="s2">there are a lot of sexual</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.119" end="01:06:41.839" style="s2">imagery there as well so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.079" end="01:06:44.480" style="s2">unification is sort of a very</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.839" end="01:06:44.480" style="s2">traditional</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.720" end="01:06:48.319" style="s2">description of tantrum goal</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.400" end="01:06:51.520" style="s2">yeah even with like the the statues uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.640" end="01:06:54.160" style="s2">you know so</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.520" end="01:06:54.720" style="s2">in the sutra route it&#39;s the the solo</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.160" end="01:06:57.760" style="s2">buddha</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.720" end="01:06:58.640" style="s2">in this is with his pleasant smile uh of</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.760" end="01:07:01.520" style="s2">just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.640" end="01:07:02.640" style="s2">being okay with everything in in his in</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.520" end="01:07:05.440" style="s2">in isolation</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.640" end="01:07:06.720" style="s2">uh and one of the uh the the tantric uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.440" end="01:07:10.160" style="s2">uh the common tantric</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.720" end="01:07:13.520" style="s2">statues is is the yabyan which is uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.160" end="01:07:16.000" style="s2">you know a male and female uh having sex</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.520" end="01:07:18.400" style="s2">in unification so yeah it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.000" end="01:07:18.400" style="s2">explicit</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.319" end="01:07:26.240" style="s2">uh but the male and female to charlie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.559" end="01:07:29.359" style="s2">point the male and female</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.240" end="01:07:31.680" style="s2">um is is a uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.359" end="01:07:33.839" style="s2">is symbolic in the sense of talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.680" end="01:07:36.880" style="s2">about this very fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.839" end="01:07:38.960" style="s2">uh experience of emptiness or you could</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.880" end="01:07:42.240" style="s2">call it nebulosity or openness</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.960" end="01:07:45.440" style="s2">uh and then form or pattern or order</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.240" end="01:07:47.119" style="s2">or material um so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.440" end="01:07:48.799" style="s2">they they are definitely to be taken</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.119" end="01:07:51.520" style="s2">symbolic even though a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.799" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">tantric practices use them in literal uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.520" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">in a more of a literal fashion</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.799" end="01:08:08.240" style="s2">let&#39;s see here jared i think there was a</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.640" end="01:08:09.760" style="s2">a question from uh sarah a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.240" end="01:08:11.839" style="s2">ago here around china</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.760" end="01:08:13.680" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know sarah did you want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.839" end="01:08:16.720" style="s2">ask that the question around flattening</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.680" end="01:08:16.720" style="s2">a preference landscape</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.199" end="01:08:23.520" style="s2">sure um so that one was kind of when</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.159" end="01:08:26.799" style="s2">people were asking about</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.520" end="01:08:27.199" style="s2">equanimity i remember on one call you</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.799" end="01:08:30.159" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.199" end="01:08:31.359" style="s2">something about like flattening a</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.159" end="01:08:33.520" style="s2">preference landscape</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.359" end="01:08:35.920" style="s2">or something when you&#39;re doing shine and</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.520" end="01:08:39.040" style="s2">and maybe that was about just</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.920" end="01:08:40.719" style="s2">where your awareness or attention goes</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.040" end="01:08:42.480" style="s2">or kind of like what arises</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.719" end="01:08:44.239" style="s2">but but it sounds like that would be</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.480" end="01:08:47.679" style="s2">different from</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.239" end="01:08:50.159" style="s2">somehow changing yourself so that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.679" end="01:08:51.359" style="s2">feel the same way about whatever comes</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.159" end="01:08:54.000" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.359" end="01:08:55.920" style="s2">right yeah so i remember that</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.000" end="01:09:00.480" style="s2">conversation that was about</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.920" end="01:09:03.679" style="s2">um the so that was addressing the idea</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.480" end="01:09:04.799" style="s2">in concentrative meditation that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.679" end="01:09:09.600" style="s2">a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.799" end="01:09:12.319" style="s2">central focus or and very often that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.600" end="01:09:13.920" style="s2">quite internal so there&#39;s this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.319" end="01:09:17.040" style="s2">center and periphery</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.920" end="01:09:22.159" style="s2">so it&#39;s unbalanced in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.040" end="01:09:22.159" style="s2">so with shino practice there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.799" end="01:09:30.159" style="s2">the idea that you are not giving</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.000" end="01:09:34.960" style="s2">particular um</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.159" end="01:09:38.000" style="s2">priority to any aspect</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.960" end="01:09:41.199" style="s2">of experience</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.000" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">so you don&#39;t prioritize your nose</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.199" end="01:09:45.359" style="s2">you don&#39;t prioritize your breath you</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:49.440" style="s2">don&#39;t prioritize</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.359" end="01:09:53.759" style="s2">yourself in this body but you don&#39;t not</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.440" end="01:09:57.360" style="s2">um maintain awareness of all of those</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.759" end="01:09:57.360" style="s2">things so there&#39;s a kind of um</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.679" end="01:10:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not flattening so much as like we</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.320" end="01:10:06.560" style="s2">were saying equalness maybe or</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.880" end="01:10:07.280" style="s2">you know as far as your sense fields</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.560" end="01:10:10.159" style="s2">extend</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.280" end="01:10:12.400" style="s2">then that is where your awareness is so</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.159" end="01:10:14.239" style="s2">the tendency as well when one starts</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.400" end="01:10:16.400" style="s2">practicing machining goes from</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.239" end="01:10:18.159" style="s2">practicing sort of very concentrative</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.400" end="01:10:21.360" style="s2">method into practicing</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.159" end="01:10:22.800" style="s2">a more opening style of meditation is</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.360" end="01:10:23.360" style="s2">that your mind starts kind of popping</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.800" end="01:10:24.960" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.360" end="01:10:27.760" style="s2">so it&#39;s that thing and then that thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.960" end="01:10:30.960" style="s2">and that and there&#39;s a sort of sense of</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.760" end="01:10:32.080" style="s2">um you&#39;re awareness being kind of very</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.960" end="01:10:34.400" style="s2">flitty</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.080" end="01:10:35.760" style="s2">and that gradually dies down because</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.400" end="01:10:39.199" style="s2">you&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.760" end="01:10:39.199" style="s2">you know things want to grab</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.760" end="01:10:44.880" style="s2">things kind of arise and that is in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.560" end="01:10:47.840" style="s2">sense sort of grabbing of awareness</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.880" end="01:10:48.320" style="s2">and then the practice releases that so</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.840" end="01:10:50.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.320" end="01:10:53.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no particular priority</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.960" end="01:10:56.239" style="s2">prioritization things can just arise</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.440" end="01:10:56.880" style="s2">and they arise in the space so the felt</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.239" end="01:10:59.840" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.880" end="01:10:59.840" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.040" end="01:11:08.960" style="s2">yeah i guess equanimous in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.199" end="01:11:11.280" style="s2">yeah the i think the the equanimous uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.960" end="01:11:14.000" style="s2">um to what charlie was saying before i</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.280" end="01:11:16.560" style="s2">think there&#39;s a connotation that gets</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.000" end="01:11:18.239" style="s2">put on top of it which is to be which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.560" end="01:11:19.360" style="s2">calmness right or like a certain</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.239" end="01:11:22.159" style="s2">demeanor</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.360" end="01:11:22.480" style="s2">um and so it&#39;s like it can be this weird</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.159" end="01:11:24.080" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.480" end="01:11:25.360" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of play acting equanimity</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.080" end="01:11:26.560" style="s2">which is like oh if i don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.360" end="01:11:29.520" style="s2">anything then i</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.560" end="01:11:31.199" style="s2">react to it all the same um and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.520" end="01:11:33.040" style="s2">kind of a bit of an agenda being</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.199" end="01:11:35.199" style="s2">brought up but yeah the strange thing is</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.040" end="01:11:37.199" style="s2">is if you if there really is</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.199" end="01:11:39.360" style="s2">um if there isn&#39;t a preferential</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.199" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">treatment or a prescribed way of</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.360" end="01:11:43.199" style="s2">interacting</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:48.480" style="s2">with what comes up in experience then</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.199" end="01:11:48.480" style="s2">the quality of what arises is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.719" end="01:11:53.120" style="s2">not defined by you i suppose in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.520" end="01:11:55.600" style="s2">sense that</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.120" end="01:11:56.320" style="s2">sometimes if i&#39;m sitting in a sheena and</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.600" end="01:11:59.440" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.320" end="01:12:02.080" style="s2">you know motorcycles flying by the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.440" end="01:12:03.760" style="s2">uh the thing and maybe my wife&#39;s on a</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.080" end="01:12:06.320" style="s2">conference call and</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.760" end="01:12:07.360" style="s2">she&#39;s frustrated and i can hear you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.320" end="01:12:10.960" style="s2">all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.360" end="01:12:13.760" style="s2">things are very energetic and kind of um</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.960" end="01:12:14.880" style="s2">lively and and almost a little chaotic</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.760" end="01:12:16.480" style="s2">but that is because</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.880" end="01:12:19.040" style="s2">that is the environment is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.480" end="01:12:21.120" style="s2">chaotic so if i were to prescribe</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.040" end="01:12:22.239" style="s2">my reaction to it by saying i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.120" end="01:12:24.560" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.239" end="01:12:25.760" style="s2">you know i have to relate to this in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.560" end="01:12:28.239" style="s2">certain way</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.760" end="01:12:28.960" style="s2">that&#39;s when we might go wrong and yet i</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.239" end="01:12:32.480" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.960" end="01:12:36.080" style="s2">real equanimity um can be found</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.480" end="01:12:38.239" style="s2">in spaciousness in open space because it</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.080" end="01:12:39.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any agenda but but yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.239" end="01:12:41.520" style="s2">think that our mistake is when we</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.760" end="01:12:43.040" style="s2">we get an idea of what that what</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.520" end="01:12:44.560" style="s2">equanimity is and we start to play</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.040" end="01:12:47.520" style="s2">active</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.560" end="01:12:47.520" style="s2">if that makes any sense</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.679" end="01:12:52.159" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.880" end="01:12:54.400" style="s2">prioritization of focus</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.159" end="01:12:55.760" style="s2">either so like that situation that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.400" end="01:12:57.520" style="s2">described just then</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.760" end="01:13:00.000" style="s2">it would be very easy if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.520" end="01:13:03.520" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to maintain focus</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.000" end="01:13:08.080" style="s2">on your breath and maintain this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.520" end="01:13:12.719" style="s2">you know very calm</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.080" end="01:13:14.880" style="s2">consistent relationship with the breath</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.719" end="01:13:16.640" style="s2">and then all this stuff&#39;s going on you</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.880" end="01:13:18.000" style="s2">know that&#39;s going to be distracting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.640" end="01:13:21.679" style="s2">going to be irritating</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.000" end="01:13:24.400" style="s2">whereas if the</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.679" end="01:13:26.800" style="s2">if the emphasis on focus is taken away</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.400" end="01:13:29.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.800" end="01:13:30.000" style="s2">idea that there has to be a particular</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.360" end="01:13:33.199" style="s2">focus</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.000" end="01:13:36.800" style="s2">then everything just arises</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.199" end="01:13:36.800" style="s2">without that kind of priority</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.080" end="01:13:48.400" style="s2">so i think there&#39;s some interesting back</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.920" end="01:13:51.360" style="s2">and forth in the the chat around</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.400" end="01:13:52.719" style="s2">uh tantra and psychotherapy nicole did</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.360" end="01:13:54.480" style="s2">you want to ask that question that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.719" end="01:13:57.760" style="s2">had from a few minutes back</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.480" end="01:13:59.440" style="s2">sure yeah um yeah so i was as i was</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.760" end="01:14:02.880" style="s2">listening i was just kind of jumping</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.440" end="01:14:05.199" style="s2">to um what i know about uh sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.880" end="01:14:08.400" style="s2">freud and psychotherapeutic</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.199" end="01:14:09.920" style="s2">practice uh based on all of the research</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.400" end="01:14:11.800" style="s2">that has been done in the past</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.920" end="01:14:13.360" style="s2">century or so by these like</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.800" end="01:14:15.679" style="s2">psychologists</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.360" end="01:14:18.159" style="s2">uh specifically in regards to repression</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.679" end="01:14:21.280" style="s2">and specifically in regards to like uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.159" end="01:14:23.920" style="s2">what not allowing our desires to</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.280" end="01:14:26.080" style="s2">be unleashed how that causes us to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.920" end="01:14:26.880" style="s2">unhealthy in certain respects and can</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.080" end="01:14:29.920" style="s2">cause</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.880" end="01:14:32.560" style="s2">um psychopathy i was wondering if</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.920" end="01:14:33.840" style="s2">you think perhaps that uh that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.560" end="01:14:37.120" style="s2">leaning more so</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.840" end="01:14:40.400" style="s2">in the direction of uh tantric uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.120" end="01:14:43.199" style="s2">view uh rather than sort of like oh</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.400" end="01:14:45.040" style="s2">i guess my question was and i remembered</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.199" end="01:14:46.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.040" end="01:14:48.800" style="s2">would you say that tantric practice</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.960" end="01:14:52.239" style="s2">based on this recent research</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.800" end="01:14:55.760" style="s2">is more in line with human nature um</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.239" end="01:14:58.000" style="s2">rather than cyclic practice</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.760" end="01:14:58.000" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.640" end="01:15:08.320" style="s2">um i would say too that it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.199" end="01:15:12.800" style="s2">important to</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.320" end="01:15:14.480" style="s2">realize that uh i think um</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.800" end="01:15:16.640" style="s2">like we were talking about spectrum wise</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.480" end="01:15:18.239" style="s2">uh a lot of the different since there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.640" end="01:15:21.600" style="s2">so many different types of therapy</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.239" end="01:15:23.440" style="s2">uh and and psychotherapy uh some of them</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.600" end="01:15:25.600" style="s2">you might find sutrick elements in some</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.440" end="01:15:26.320" style="s2">and you might find tantric elements and</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.600" end="01:15:29.679" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.320" end="01:15:32.560" style="s2">um and and yeah i think to your point</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.679" end="01:15:34.400" style="s2">a lot of the the shadow work type things</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.560" end="01:15:35.679" style="s2">uncovering what we have repressed or</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.400" end="01:15:38.159" style="s2">were ashamed of</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.679" end="01:15:38.800" style="s2">um does kind of go in a tantric route of</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.159" end="01:15:40.480" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.800" end="01:15:42.159" style="s2">wanting to work with it wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.480" end="01:15:44.960" style="s2">include it in our experience</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.159" end="01:15:46.719" style="s2">um and yet at the same time sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.960" end="01:15:49.840" style="s2">you could even if if the goal</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.719" end="01:15:53.280" style="s2">of of uncovering it is to get rid of it</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.840" end="01:15:55.280" style="s2">um then that might be you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.280" end="01:15:57.280" style="s2">some sort of amalgamation of the two you</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.280" end="01:15:58.800" style="s2">know or we want to purify it we want to</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.280" end="01:16:00.000" style="s2">get rid of it as opposed to transforming</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.800" end="01:16:02.719" style="s2">it into something else</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.000" end="01:16:03.120" style="s2">um so yeah it&#39;s hard to to clearly put</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.719" end="01:16:05.280" style="s2">it in</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.120" end="01:16:07.360" style="s2">in either camp but there&#39;s yeah you can</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.280" end="01:16:08.960" style="s2">you can use that the tantric citric</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.360" end="01:16:20.080" style="s2">lens to look at things and get a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.960" end="01:16:23.120" style="s2">a flavor of where they oriented</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.080" end="01:16:23.920" style="s2">so i like uh christian&#39;s uh question</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.120" end="01:16:26.239" style="s2">here in chat</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.920" end="01:16:28.000" style="s2">around uh goodness and congruence and</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.239" end="01:16:31.120" style="s2">and who defines that christian do you</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.000" end="01:16:33.679" style="s2">want to go ahead and ask that</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.120" end="01:16:34.239" style="s2">yeah i can ask that real quick i just</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.679" end="01:16:37.760" style="s2">need to</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.239" end="01:16:40.159" style="s2">scroll up to it</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.760" end="01:16:41.120" style="s2">um well the question was i can&#39;t find it</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.159" end="01:16:42.480" style="s2">it was about</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.120" end="01:16:45.280" style="s2">well you mentioned that goodness and</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.480" end="01:16:47.840" style="s2">congruence are kind of the motivating</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.280" end="01:16:48.960" style="s2">objectives of the creative play in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.840" end="01:16:51.120" style="s2">tantric view</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.960" end="01:16:53.520" style="s2">and where when that earlier question</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.120" end="01:16:56.320" style="s2">about motivation for action was asked</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.520" end="01:16:58.320" style="s2">and i was wondering how goodness or</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.320" end="01:17:00.080" style="s2">congruence is defined if it&#39;s defined</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.320" end="01:17:01.199" style="s2">within the view or if that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.080" end="01:17:04.080" style="s2">that&#39;s left up to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.199" end="01:17:06.159" style="s2">tantric practitioner or or how those two</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.080" end="01:17:08.880" style="s2">ideas may be</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.159" end="01:17:10.000" style="s2">okay right i see so yeah this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.880" end="01:17:14.840" style="s2">congruence</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.000" end="01:17:16.480" style="s2">is um is coming</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.840" end="01:17:19.440" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.480" end="01:17:20.239" style="s2">the um it&#39;s from the end point of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.440" end="01:17:23.520" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.239" end="01:17:26.800" style="s2">series which is spontaneous congruent</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.520" end="01:17:30.239" style="s2">action and that is really the</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.800" end="01:17:34.080" style="s2">um that is the result</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.239" end="01:17:34.640" style="s2">of tantric practice in some ways in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.080" end="01:17:38.560" style="s2">base</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.640" end="01:17:40.880" style="s2">of zogchen practice so</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.560" end="01:17:40.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.199" end="01:17:47.840" style="s2">it&#39;s congruence so</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.320" end="01:17:49.440" style="s2">this is a question that i think a lot</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.840" end="01:17:51.120" style="s2">about and that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.440" end="01:17:52.719" style="s2">i&#39;ve kind of gone backwards and forwards</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.120" end="01:17:56.000" style="s2">a lot over</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.719" end="01:17:56.840" style="s2">um over the years i don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.000" end="01:17:59.760" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.840" end="01:18:02.560" style="s2">is an automatic</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.760" end="01:18:04.480" style="s2">like if you experience the result of</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.560" end="01:18:07.360" style="s2">tantric practice if you experience</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.480" end="01:18:09.440" style="s2">uh rigpa um if you experience like</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.360" end="01:18:12.560" style="s2">presence of awareness</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.440" end="01:18:16.320" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.560" end="01:18:19.120" style="s2">are going to behave perfectly or</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.320" end="01:18:20.159" style="s2">always act in the best way or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.120" end="01:18:23.840" style="s2">so the practice</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.159" end="01:18:26.239" style="s2">after being</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.840" end="01:18:28.159" style="s2">after having the experience of presence</p>

<p begin="01:18:34.960" end="01:18:42.239" style="s2">never fixed so the practice after that</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.960" end="01:18:46.719" style="s2">is learning and training how to relate</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.239" end="01:18:50.159" style="s2">that in the world as you go about</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.719" end="01:18:53.360" style="s2">ordinary activity how to maintain that</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.159" end="01:18:56.400" style="s2">state and how to translate that</p>

<p begin="01:18:56.400" end="01:19:00.239" style="s2">response and that isn&#39;t automatic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.120" end="01:19:03.199" style="s2">not prescribed</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.239" end="01:19:04.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not prescribed as this is the way</p>

<p begin="01:19:04.560" end="01:19:08.560" style="s2">and the very nature of the world makes</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.120" end="01:19:12.000" style="s2">that impossible</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.560" end="01:19:14.400" style="s2">so there&#39;s always a random</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.000" end="01:19:15.360" style="s2">element there&#39;s always something</p>

<p begin="01:19:20.560" end="01:19:24.400" style="s2">you know your motivation might be there</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.400" end="01:19:27.600" style="s2">and your awareness might be there</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.400" end="01:19:30.640" style="s2">but things can just kind of still</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.600" end="01:19:34.080" style="s2">pan out wrong so that&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.640" end="01:19:36.000" style="s2">built into the the whole of the</p>

<p begin="01:19:49.120" end="01:19:54.800" style="s2">consistently constantly available</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.640" end="01:19:56.640" style="s2">as activity you know there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.800" end="01:19:59.360" style="s2">going to be this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.640" end="01:20:00.880" style="s2">play and fluidity and you know there can</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.360" end="01:20:02.800" style="s2">always be</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.880" end="01:20:04.480" style="s2">different kinds of skill or a better</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.800" end="01:20:07.840" style="s2">sort of skill so</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.480" end="01:20:10.960" style="s2">as i suppose a little bit like um</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.840" end="01:20:11.360" style="s2">continuing positive feedback loops you</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.960" end="01:20:13.920" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.360" end="01:20:14.960" style="s2">that could be an infinite loop it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.920" end="01:20:18.400" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.960" end="01:20:21.840" style="s2">is going to end at some point</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.400" end="01:20:26.080" style="s2">in yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.840" end="01:20:27.679" style="s2">perfect experience yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.080" end="01:20:29.360" style="s2">to keep coming back to the dancing</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.679" end="01:20:32.560" style="s2">metaphor um</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.360" end="01:20:35.120" style="s2">you know i think</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.560" end="01:20:35.760" style="s2">we all know what it looks like uh when</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.120" end="01:20:38.000" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.760" end="01:20:38.880" style="s2">is when the the the dance is too</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.000" end="01:20:40.800" style="s2">prescribed</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.880" end="01:20:42.800" style="s2">uh it&#39;s too constrained it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.800" end="01:20:46.639" style="s2">creative it can&#39;t ever change or evolve</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.800" end="01:20:50.320" style="s2">uh to the circumstances um</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.639" end="01:20:51.840" style="s2">and so when we include spontaneity in</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.320" end="01:20:53.920" style="s2">there or creativity</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.840" end="01:20:54.880" style="s2">uh through uh finding that that</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.920" end="01:20:57.760" style="s2">spaciousness</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.880" end="01:20:59.199" style="s2">uh and possibility um and kind of get</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.760" end="01:21:01.199" style="s2">out of our own ways</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.199" end="01:21:02.800" style="s2">then we kind of get into something maybe</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.199" end="01:21:03.600" style="s2">like looks like a little bit like a flow</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.800" end="01:21:06.639" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.600" end="01:21:08.560" style="s2">um and so you know to be in to have</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.639" end="01:21:09.440" style="s2">presence of awareness to be at the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.560" end="01:21:11.840" style="s2">end of</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.440" end="01:21:14.320" style="s2">this meditation series uh might mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.840" end="01:21:16.800" style="s2">that it&#39;s very easy for you to flow</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.320" end="01:21:18.800" style="s2">and to dance very fluidly and and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.800" end="01:21:20.880" style="s2">without kind of hesitation and a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.800" end="01:21:24.080" style="s2">confidence and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.880" end="01:21:26.320" style="s2">and yet every time you&#39;re dancing uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.080" end="01:21:28.080" style="s2">you&#39;re practicing and figuring out how</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.320" end="01:21:31.120" style="s2">to continually develop</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.080" end="01:21:33.679" style="s2">the skills of dancing um</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.120" end="01:21:34.560" style="s2">and and then there&#39;s no yeah there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.679" end="01:21:37.920" style="s2">end to that</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.560" end="01:21:38.719" style="s2">uh to how good we get at working with</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.920" end="01:21:42.080" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.719" end="01:21:45.440" style="s2">methods and and openness to creative</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.080" end="01:21:45.920" style="s2">uh spontaneous action right yeah so like</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.440" end="01:21:47.679" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.920" end="01:21:49.120" style="s2">analogy that you&#39;re reminding me of is</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.679" end="01:21:52.080" style="s2">like skiing</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.120" end="01:21:53.920" style="s2">and you know you watch somebody skiing</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.080" end="01:21:56.320" style="s2">over new terrain or down</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.920" end="01:21:57.679" style="s2">you know uh down different sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.320" end="01:21:59.760" style="s2">mountain sides of whatever there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.679" end="01:22:01.520" style="s2">always something different there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.760" end="01:22:04.239" style="s2">always kind of responding</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.520" end="01:22:04.880" style="s2">in a way and it&#39;s kind of just beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.239" end="01:22:06.719" style="s2">to watch</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.880" end="01:22:09.280" style="s2">because there&#39;s this kind of congruence</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.719" end="01:22:10.639" style="s2">between the activity in the environment</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.280" end="01:22:12.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s a sort of dancing</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.639" end="01:22:17.040" style="s2">relationship with the environment and i</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.880" end="01:22:19.679" style="s2">really like that kind of analogy for</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.040" end="01:22:20.320" style="s2">it&#39;s you know you couldn&#39;t say that that</p>

<p begin="01:25:10.960" end="01:25:14.480" style="s2">finding a system</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.000" end="01:25:15.840" style="s2">that really seems to resonate and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.480" end="01:25:19.760" style="s2">going more</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.840" end="01:25:21.920" style="s2">into that one and exploring it as well</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.760" end="01:25:22.960" style="s2">um and there&#39;s also the other thing that</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.920" end="01:25:25.520" style="s2">came to mind is</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.960" end="01:25:28.080" style="s2">some david&#39;s pages on buddhism for</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.520" end="01:25:29.760" style="s2">vampires the shadow</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.080" end="01:25:31.920" style="s2">shadow work which isn&#39;t the same it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.760" end="01:25:34.480" style="s2">not the same as</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.920" end="01:25:35.679" style="s2">tantric practice but there are very</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.480" end="01:25:37.679" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.679" end="01:25:40.080" style="s2">similarities like and i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.679" end="01:25:44.320" style="s2">eating the shadow and</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.080" end="01:25:44.320" style="s2">all of that series</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.480" end="01:25:53.440" style="s2">as there&#39;s been some interesting back</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.760" end="01:25:54.080" style="s2">and forth in the chat here for the last</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.440" end="01:25:56.480" style="s2">few minutes</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.080" end="01:25:58.320" style="s2">about uh a question from michael tapps</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.480" end="01:26:00.159" style="s2">recent stoa sarah did you want to go</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.320" end="01:26:00.719" style="s2">ahead and start that question off and</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.159" end="01:26:02.159" style="s2">see if</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.719" end="01:26:04.400" style="s2">we can get charlie and jared&#39;s thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.159" end="01:26:04.400" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.480" end="01:26:08.880" style="s2">yeah so this was on october 6th i</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.440" end="01:26:11.920" style="s2">listened to</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.880" end="01:26:13.600" style="s2">michael taft on the stoa and</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.920" end="01:26:15.600" style="s2">um i don&#39;t remember whether he was</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.600" end="01:26:17.520" style="s2">someone i think asked a question about</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.600" end="01:26:19.520" style="s2">either shinzo young or the manasseh</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.520" end="01:26:24.159" style="s2">academy maple and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.520" end="01:26:27.360" style="s2">they&#39;re tied in together um and</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.159" end="01:26:29.360" style="s2">michael taft said they&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.360" end="01:26:32.080" style="s2">stuff dualistically</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.360" end="01:26:33.760" style="s2">and then pushing people into the nondual</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.080" end="01:26:35.760" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.760" end="01:26:37.679" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering if you all have</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.760" end="01:26:41.360" style="s2">thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.679" end="01:26:43.679" style="s2">because it&#39;s been unclear to me what</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.360" end="01:26:45.920" style="s2">view they&#39;re using and how that relates</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.679" end="01:26:48.320" style="s2">to the methods they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.920" end="01:26:49.360" style="s2">because when they talk about purpose it</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.320" end="01:26:52.560" style="s2">seems very</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.360" end="01:26:54.719" style="s2">sutrick it seems very like um</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.560" end="01:26:56.159" style="s2">the world is bad we gotta we gotta fix</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.719" end="01:26:58.320" style="s2">it we gotta fix ourselves we gotta chip</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.159" end="01:27:01.440" style="s2">away all the bad stuff</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.320" end="01:27:02.960" style="s2">and but then they use</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.440" end="01:27:04.480" style="s2">tantric style emotional work like</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.960" end="01:27:07.120" style="s2">biomotive encircling</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.480" end="01:27:07.120" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.400" end="01:27:18.560" style="s2">i am not you know i know</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.159" end="01:27:19.600" style="s2">a little about monastic academy i know a</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.560" end="01:27:22.719" style="s2">little about</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.600" end="01:27:25.920" style="s2">um shinzon&#39;s approach</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.719" end="01:27:29.280" style="s2">uh i&#39;m not i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.920" end="01:27:29.760" style="s2">i&#39;m in a good position to comment</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.280" end="01:27:32.880" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.760" end="01:27:37.520" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know enough about</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.880" end="01:27:37.520" style="s2">how they&#39;re going about things um</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.600" end="01:27:40.239" style="s2">circling</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.920" end="01:27:46.400" style="s2">my understanding of circling is that</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.760" end="01:27:49.679" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of pretty similar</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.400" end="01:27:52.000" style="s2">to a lot of the um</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.679" end="01:27:53.280" style="s2">the kind of gestalt work that i was</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.000" end="01:27:56.400" style="s2">involved with</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.280" end="01:27:58.000" style="s2">um you know the the the description of</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.400" end="01:28:00.239" style="s2">what circling is like and</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.000" end="01:28:01.679" style="s2">what the gestalt group work and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.239" end="01:28:04.960" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.679" end="01:28:06.800" style="s2">um who&#39;s called focusing or that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.960" end="01:28:10.320" style="s2">background so i think</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.800" end="01:28:13.840" style="s2">i&#39;m reasonably familiar with those</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.320" end="01:28:17.520" style="s2">kinds of group um</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.840" end="01:28:20.719" style="s2">emotional work and dynamics um</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.520" end="01:28:23.040" style="s2">yeah and i would say there is there</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.719" end="01:28:26.800" style="s2">really is certainly a tantric flavor</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.040" end="01:28:30.000" style="s2">to that methodology</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.800" end="01:28:34.320" style="s2">um so where it ends up</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.000" end="01:28:37.360" style="s2">uh you know if you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.320" end="01:28:40.000" style="s2">understanding emotional resonance</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.360" end="01:28:40.840" style="s2">personally and in relation to others and</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.000" end="01:28:44.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.840" end="01:28:45.840" style="s2">exploring emotional connection and</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.000" end="01:28:47.360" style="s2">like how people are relating to each</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.840" end="01:28:49.040" style="s2">other in</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.360" end="01:28:51.679" style="s2">in the here and now in a circle so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.040" end="01:28:51.679" style="s2">just going to cough</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.400" end="01:28:58.400" style="s2">so if you if you&#39;re doing that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.800" end="01:29:02.000" style="s2">exploration</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.400" end="01:29:05.360" style="s2">then traditionally speaking that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.000" end="01:29:08.080" style="s2">cetric practice so that&#39;s not cetric</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.360" end="01:29:09.360" style="s2">methodology that&#39;s not suitable practice</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.080" end="01:29:12.719" style="s2">but if your</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.360" end="01:29:17.199" style="s2">end point would then be</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.719" end="01:29:19.920" style="s2">to say okay well</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.199" end="01:29:21.120" style="s2">now that i understand that emotion i can</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.920" end="01:29:23.679" style="s2">kind of leave it</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.120" end="01:29:26.000" style="s2">behind whatever then that might be</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.679" end="01:29:28.719" style="s2">heading towards a sutrac</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.000" end="01:29:29.280" style="s2">um goal but i don&#39;t know enough about</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.719" end="01:29:31.520" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.280" end="01:29:33.520" style="s2">they are doing to say whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.520" end="01:29:36.800" style="s2">kind of bringing sutrick view</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.520" end="01:29:38.400" style="s2">in at a later point or you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.800" end="01:29:42.639" style="s2">whether it&#39;s just kind of mishmash of</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.400" end="01:29:42.639" style="s2">views or or what i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.360" end="01:29:47.920" style="s2">do you have any thoughts about that</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.040" end="01:29:51.120" style="s2">jared have you you maybe have more</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.920" end="01:29:54.320" style="s2">uh more knowledge of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.120" end="01:29:58.159" style="s2">of that of those systems that i do</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.320" end="01:30:01.199" style="s2">i mean i i think uh my broad view</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.159" end="01:30:04.560" style="s2">um of of a lot of the work is that</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.199" end="01:30:04.880" style="s2">much of what we&#39;re seeing um that that</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.560" end="01:30:07.760" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.880" end="01:30:08.880" style="s2">with people like shinzen and everyone is</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.760" end="01:30:11.920" style="s2">leading to</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.880" end="01:30:15.040" style="s2">unique synthesis of</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.920" end="01:30:17.199" style="s2">uh you know sutra tantra</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.040" end="01:30:18.639" style="s2">uh maybe even a little bit of zogjan and</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.199" end="01:30:21.440" style="s2">mahamudra</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.639" end="01:30:21.760" style="s2">and then also uh incorporating a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.440" end="01:30:25.120" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.760" end="01:30:26.480" style="s2">of therapy psychotherapy um you know so</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.120" end="01:30:28.239" style="s2">because that seems to be the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.480" end="01:30:31.280" style="s2">background uh</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.239" end="01:30:32.480" style="s2">frame that all that us westerners come</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.280" end="01:30:35.360" style="s2">to things from</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.480" end="01:30:37.199" style="s2">um i don&#39;t you know because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.360" end="01:30:41.360" style="s2">synthesis i think it can be really</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.199" end="01:30:44.480" style="s2">tough to try and unpack uh just</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.360" end="01:30:48.800" style="s2">you know what exactly it is um and</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.480" end="01:30:51.280" style="s2">and then when you also factor in that</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.800" end="01:30:52.000" style="s2">sometimes even if it&#39;s not explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.280" end="01:30:55.280" style="s2">stated</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.000" end="01:30:58.400" style="s2">in a system there can be</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.280" end="01:31:00.960" style="s2">a tantric or citric influence</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.400" end="01:31:02.719" style="s2">simply by the words that we use and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.960" end="01:31:03.760" style="s2">common connotations that everybody has</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.719" end="01:31:06.800" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.760" end="01:31:09.360" style="s2">um so so it&#39;s yeah i i</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.800" end="01:31:10.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i couldn&#39;t say that i have</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.360" end="01:31:12.239" style="s2">the that i</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.320" end="01:31:14.400" style="s2">have any kind of clear sense of the the</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.239" end="01:31:14.960" style="s2">orientation um but it definitely seems</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.400" end="01:31:18.239" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.960" end="01:31:22.159" style="s2">a lot of modern synthesis um</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.239" end="01:31:25.040" style="s2">the reason i uh</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.159" end="01:31:25.840" style="s2">the reason i went to got to uh vadriana</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.040" end="01:31:28.880" style="s2">in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.840" end="01:31:32.159" style="s2">uh was part of a</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.880" end="01:31:35.679" style="s2">looking for a foundational way</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.159" end="01:31:36.800" style="s2">or a a very uh non-abstracted view that</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.679" end="01:31:40.080" style="s2">i could</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.800" end="01:31:41.199" style="s2">employ to see what all of these systems</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.080" end="01:31:42.960" style="s2">are and what they&#39;re doing and how</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.199" end="01:31:46.960" style="s2">they&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.960" end="01:31:49.360" style="s2">and uh and and that becomes more</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.960" end="01:31:50.880" style="s2">available especially in very specific</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.360" end="01:31:53.760" style="s2">contexts talking to somebody</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.880" end="01:31:55.840" style="s2">how is this affecting you uh what what</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.760" end="01:31:57.440" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s working what&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.840" end="01:31:59.199" style="s2">um and this kind of goes to the</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.440" end="01:32:02.239" style="s2">specificity of tantra</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.199" end="01:32:02.880" style="s2">um and uh and yeah really this comes</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.239" end="01:32:05.760" style="s2">down to</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.880" end="01:32:06.560" style="s2">the fact that vajrayana uses these base</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.760" end="01:32:08.159" style="s2">lenses</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.560" end="01:32:10.560" style="s2">uh even though there&#39;s many of the other</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.159" end="01:32:13.840" style="s2">ones with just emptiness and form</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.560" end="01:32:15.600" style="s2">um and that for me is what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.840" end="01:32:18.000" style="s2">wanting to to really embody those in a</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.600" end="01:32:18.800" style="s2">deep way uh as kind of this meta view</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.000" end="01:32:21.280" style="s2">even though</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.800" end="01:32:23.199" style="s2">even though uh from a vadriana view it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.280" end="01:32:25.440" style="s2">still saying that</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.199" end="01:32:27.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not any more it&#39;s not more true in</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.440" end="01:32:28.960" style="s2">some sense all of these are simply</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.600" end="01:32:29.679" style="s2">different lenses that we can look at</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.960" end="01:32:31.840" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.679" end="01:32:33.360" style="s2">um but but yeah that the emptiness and</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.840" end="01:32:35.679" style="s2">form lens for me is like kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.360" end="01:32:38.159" style="s2">most foundational that i&#39;ve found and</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.679" end="01:32:38.719" style="s2">it really does allow me to kind of move</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.159" end="01:32:42.639" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.719" end="01:32:43.280" style="s2">different uh perspectives and to try to</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.639" end="01:32:45.920" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.280" end="01:32:47.120" style="s2">what&#39;s working and how it&#39;s working um</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.920" end="01:32:49.360" style="s2">and then yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.120" end="01:32:50.560" style="s2">you could i could go in circles if we</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.360" end="01:32:51.920" style="s2">were to like talk about something</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.560" end="01:32:52.639" style="s2">specifically like oh yeah this is a</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.920" end="01:32:54.480" style="s2">tantric</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.639" end="01:32:56.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a method here uh but now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.480" end="01:32:59.760" style="s2">coming to a sutrich results or</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.480" end="01:33:02.159" style="s2">uh or complying a citric view um</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.760" end="01:33:03.679" style="s2">or or you know now aft after to</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.159" end="01:33:06.480" style="s2">charlie&#39;s point after we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.679" end="01:33:06.960" style="s2">uh stoked up these emotions in a tantric</p>

<p begin="01:33:09.280" end="01:33:12.719" style="s2">of them and yeah it&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="01:33:15.760" end="01:33:18.480" style="s2">really hard to to say that there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.600" end="01:33:21.520" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.480" end="01:33:24.159" style="s2">super consistent uh thing it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:35:17.679" end="01:35:21.040" style="s2">really really good to understand what</p>

<p begin="01:35:21.040" end="01:35:24.400" style="s2">to to be able to notice that and say</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.119" end="01:35:26.639" style="s2">okay right</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.400" end="01:35:28.080" style="s2">this is a description from the</p>

<p begin="01:35:28.080" end="01:35:32.000" style="s2">or with cetric view because it&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.320" end="01:35:35.400" style="s2">that kind of language</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.000" end="01:35:39.280" style="s2">that can be just very helpful in</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.400" end="01:35:41.199" style="s2">untangling what is being presented</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.280" end="01:35:44.000" style="s2">in different synthesis and different</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.199" end="01:35:46.239" style="s2">systems and what have you</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.000" end="01:35:47.760" style="s2">and we don&#39;t really have a good language</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.239" end="01:35:49.679" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.760" end="01:35:51.679" style="s2">tantra and zogjania you know those would</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.679" end="01:35:54.960" style="s2">be very very</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.679" end="01:35:56.320" style="s2">uh uniquely different i think in their</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.960" end="01:35:59.360" style="s2">terminology and</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.320" end="01:36:02.080" style="s2">you know i&#39;m i often think about how</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.360" end="01:36:02.800" style="s2">we&#39;re describing things and you know in</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.080" end="01:36:06.080" style="s2">that whole</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.800" end="01:36:10.000" style="s2">series that i did on um</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.080" end="01:36:12.560" style="s2">um sheena and chalmetta and</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.000" end="01:36:13.600" style="s2">the tmi series on my blog the difference</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.560" end="01:36:15.840" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.600" end="01:36:17.920" style="s2">all of that i was really really careful</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.840" end="01:36:20.560" style="s2">not to use the word</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.920" end="01:36:21.360" style="s2">attention and not to talk about things</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.560" end="01:36:22.880" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.360" end="01:36:24.800" style="s2">attention and focus you know i may have</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.880" end="01:36:28.320" style="s2">done at some point i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.800" end="01:36:31.440" style="s2">but i was very intentionally</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.320" end="01:36:35.520" style="s2">using the language of shinee</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.440" end="01:36:39.199" style="s2">to describe shinee practice rather than</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.520" end="01:36:41.600" style="s2">using the language of tmi or</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.199" end="01:36:42.320" style="s2">the language of sutra practice to</p>

<p begin="01:36:42.320" end="01:36:46.239" style="s2">shinee and that&#39;s you know those kind of</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.360" end="01:36:49.840" style="s2">differences</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.239" end="01:36:51.679" style="s2">are they&#39;re not easy to pick up on</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.840" end="01:36:53.760" style="s2">either because the language of sutra is</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.679" end="01:36:55.840" style="s2">so pervasive it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.760" end="01:36:57.119" style="s2">everywhere it&#39;s just we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.840" end="01:37:00.719" style="s2">spiritually</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.119" end="01:37:03.760" style="s2">immersed in that language now</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.719" end="01:37:06.320" style="s2">um and i think other possibilities are</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.760" end="01:37:06.320" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.000" end="01:37:11.600" style="s2">the more we kind of stretch it like the</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.679" end="01:37:14.320" style="s2">dynamics of sutra which is just</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.600" end="01:37:14.880" style="s2">basically kind of value judgments about</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.320" end="01:37:17.920" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.880" end="01:37:18.560" style="s2">good and bad in our experience um we can</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.920" end="01:37:20.320" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.560" end="01:37:21.600" style="s2">move past the buddhist context and just</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.320" end="01:37:24.400" style="s2">say like you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.600" end="01:37:26.239" style="s2">you know judeo christian or christian uh</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.400" end="01:37:26.960" style="s2">influences you know of heaven and hell</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.239" end="01:37:29.199" style="s2">and sin and</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.960" end="01:37:30.000" style="s2">and everything like that like you also</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.199" end="01:37:33.679" style="s2">have some of those</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.000" end="01:37:36.320" style="s2">similar dynamics yeah right yeah puritan</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.679" end="01:37:36.800" style="s2">puritan influences tie in really well</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.320" end="01:37:40.159" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.800" end="01:37:41.840" style="s2">with sutrix view yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.159" end="01:37:43.600" style="s2">so i know we&#39;re right at our time so i</p>
