<p begin="00:00:03.270" end="00:00:06.540" style="s2">campus is being heard I also apologized</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.009" end="00:00:08.330" style="s2">for the but what may be like low quality</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.540" end="00:00:12.150" style="s2">video and maybe even like some</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.330" end="00:00:14.040" style="s2">choppiness right I&#39;m sitting in my my</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.150" end="00:00:16.800" style="s2">parents ranch in rural Texas and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.040" end="00:00:19.980" style="s2">internet connections that&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.800" end="00:00:22.350" style="s2">urban so what they do I&#39;ll have to make</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.980" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">do a lot of that&#39;s happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.350" end="00:00:28.560" style="s2">and some videos so we all just have to</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:29.910" style="s2">make do given the circumstances so as I</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.560" end="00:00:32.899" style="s2">mentioned before we started recording I</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.910" end="00:00:36.660" style="s2">thought it&#39;d be good if we pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.899" end="00:00:38.100" style="s2">whether the thing we came to in our last</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.660" end="00:00:41.309" style="s2">discussion when so a lot of people seem</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.100" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">to be appreciating and in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.309" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">I&#39;m reading in the comments was this I</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:49.800" style="s2">this this idea of faith and the faith</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:53.640" style="s2">that takes you through a transformative</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.800" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">process and I propose to you I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.640" end="00:00:58.620" style="s2">mean it as a definition but although all</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:01.260" style="s2">sort of reorder it again the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.620" end="00:01:04.140" style="s2">faith not as a willful assertion of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.260" end="00:01:09.299" style="s2">proposition mmm-hmm but a cultivated</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.140" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2">sense of being in in a participatory</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.299" end="00:01:13.530" style="s2">knowing of a transformative process that</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:15.619" style="s2">continuity of contact rather than trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.530" end="00:01:19.549" style="s2">to bring some kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.619" end="00:01:21.750" style="s2">argumentative closure and conclusion and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.549" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">that seems to me to be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.750" end="00:01:26.130" style="s2">relevant both to the longer arc of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">transformation that we&#39;re facing right</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:30.990" style="s2">now and this shorter and more acute arc</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">that we&#39;re facing right now in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.990" end="00:01:34.290" style="s2">culture and what I&#39;d like to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:36.390" style="s2">with you is what you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.290" end="00:01:39.750" style="s2">and then tie that back to our ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.390" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">discussion of the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.750" end="00:01:44.939" style="s2">religion and and then that&#39;s all I want</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:46.680" style="s2">to say I&#39;m not I don&#39;t want to put too</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.939" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">many constraints but I want to give sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.680" end="00:01:52.100" style="s2">of a context and then let&#39;s see what</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:52.100" style="s2">emerges in our discussion</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.750" end="00:02:01.079" style="s2">yeah well all right so just to I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.149" end="00:02:02.280" style="s2">just to begin the beginning obviously my</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.079" end="00:02:03.450" style="s2">mind has immediately turned to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.280" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">narrative that you told about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.450" end="00:02:10.250" style="s2">transition in the West and in particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.020" end="00:02:13.560" style="s2">that that switch that began with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.250" end="00:02:16.670" style="s2">reading in your head yeah as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.560" end="00:02:18.569" style="s2">reading any group yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.670" end="00:02:20.700" style="s2">and that transition towards</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.569" end="00:02:22.200" style="s2">propositional writing towards logic yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.700" end="00:02:29.989" style="s2">and towards the notion that it well</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.200" end="00:02:33.750" style="s2">stated phrases is the thing yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.989" end="00:02:35.069" style="s2">something about how man it&#39;s just such a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.750" end="00:02:37.400" style="s2">beautiful notion of thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.069" end="00:02:43.380" style="s2">idea of faith as being groundedness</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.400" end="00:02:45.900" style="s2">being solidity as being oriented like</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.380" end="00:02:47.069" style="s2">integrity like I actually recently</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.900" end="00:02:50.040" style="s2">mentioned something about the need for</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.069" end="00:02:52.739" style="s2">integrity in it several people commented</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.040" end="00:02:54.030" style="s2">in a sense of like confusion about what</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.739" end="00:02:55.500" style="s2">integrity means and I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.030" end="00:02:58.739" style="s2">reasonable it&#39;s quite reasonable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.500" end="00:03:00.180" style="s2">it&#39;s not obvious what that means um and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.739" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">to me the pointing was something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.180" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">like you know you can think about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:07.950" style="s2">structural integrity of a wall that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:09.660" style="s2">laid on a solid foundation and then each</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.950" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">brick is securely right on top of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.660" end="00:03:13.650" style="s2">burqa above it so that it can hold its</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:14.489" style="s2">weight and it stays out like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.650" end="00:03:16.139" style="s2">well-built</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.489" end="00:03:18.569" style="s2">there&#39;s a integrity so that is well</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.139" end="00:03:24.780" style="s2">built and it can you can do things with</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.569" end="00:03:27.739" style="s2">this notion of a impractical the word</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.780" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">the word faith having a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.739" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">agentic yeah like turning in the word</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:37.350" style="s2">meaning like moving it from the semantic</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:39.720" style="s2">domain into the nernst of means to an</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.350" end="00:03:41.630" style="s2">end right into the faith has something</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.720" end="00:03:48.660" style="s2">about that which is has a as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.630" end="00:03:51.500" style="s2">well-founded reliable means to an end</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.660" end="00:03:51.500" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.590" end="00:03:55.349" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s so funny maybe think about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.579" end="00:04:00.780" style="s2">like if you kind of transposition in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.349" end="00:04:03.480" style="s2">that direction a like a basketball</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.780" end="00:04:04.980" style="s2">player a truly masterful basketball</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.480" end="00:04:06.930" style="s2">player you&#39;ve seen certain circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.980" end="00:04:09.540" style="s2">when they shoot the shot and they just</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.930" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">turn around and walk away because they</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.540" end="00:04:12.629" style="s2">know well before the ball is hit the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">hoop that it&#39;s going in yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.629" end="00:04:17.100" style="s2">faith yeah it&#39;s the faith of the master</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:18.449" style="s2">knowing that their tool will do with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.100" end="00:04:20.130" style="s2">tool is intended that their will will</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.449" end="00:04:25.050" style="s2">carry itself out in the world with</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.130" end="00:04:27.539" style="s2">artistry and a certain elegance because</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.050" end="00:04:29.490" style="s2">the competence is just there like they</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.539" end="00:04:30.510" style="s2">just know that that feels to me like</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.490" end="00:04:36.389" style="s2">that&#39;s getting in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.510" end="00:04:38.820" style="s2">how&#39;s that landing for you I like parts</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.389" end="00:04:42.389" style="s2">of it and I want to I want to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.820" end="00:04:45.300" style="s2">open up other parts of it because the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.389" end="00:04:46.860" style="s2">thing that concerns me and what you said</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.300" end="00:04:49.190" style="s2">let me say what concerns me in that let</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.860" end="00:04:53.789" style="s2">me say what I liked what landed for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.190" end="00:04:55.470" style="s2">what concerns me is part of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.789" end="00:05:00.530" style="s2">historical narrative was also the shift</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.470" end="00:05:06.020" style="s2">with Luther right and you get the shift</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.530" end="00:05:06.020" style="s2">towards sort of willful assertion that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.500" end="00:05:12.330" style="s2">and that God is also a purely willing</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.169" end="00:05:15.870" style="s2">agent willing in the sense not of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.330" end="00:05:17.449" style="s2">wanting but of actively enforcing his</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.870" end="00:05:21.599" style="s2">will on the world the imposition</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.449" end="00:05:23.190" style="s2">position notion mm-hmm yeah and so and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.599" end="00:05:26.039" style="s2">they and we know some of the dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.190" end="00:05:28.080" style="s2">offshoots of this which is the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.039" end="00:05:30.180" style="s2">faith is sort of you know almost a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:31.650" style="s2">magical will imposition of your will on</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.180" end="00:05:34.770" style="s2">the world you&#39;ll just sort of will the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.650" end="00:05:36.360" style="s2">world to be what you want it to be and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.770" end="00:05:37.740" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think you want to put your</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.360" end="00:05:39.599" style="s2">finger on that I don&#39;t think you want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.740" end="00:05:43.260" style="s2">say that because I know what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.599" end="00:05:44.490" style="s2">discussed before yeah so so there&#39;s a so</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.260" end="00:05:45.750" style="s2">let me be thrown in front of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.490" end="00:05:47.039" style="s2">metaphor that comes to my mind as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.750" end="00:05:49.110" style="s2">talking and they both have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.039" end="00:05:50.639" style="s2">water so one has to do with the notion</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.110" end="00:05:51.750" style="s2">of a kayak in the river the other one is</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.639" end="00:05:54.090" style="s2">a surfer on a surfboard</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.750" end="00:05:58.139" style="s2">yeah yeah and I think there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.090" end="00:06:00.810" style="s2">big distinction between a surfer who</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.139" end="00:06:03.539" style="s2">really has this sense that he is going</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.810" end="00:06:03.980" style="s2">to out paddled the ocean you know his</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.539" end="00:06:06.140" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.980" end="00:06:09.080" style="s2">is the thing right that it&#39;s a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.140" end="00:06:10.910" style="s2">almost like a brutal forcing of mastery</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.080" end="00:06:12.140" style="s2">on the natural environment the ocean is</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.910" end="00:06:14.180" style="s2">a great example because in most cases</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.140" end="00:06:15.650" style="s2">this just straight isn&#39;t gonna happen to</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.180" end="00:06:18.130" style="s2">be a good surfer it&#39;s first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.650" end="00:06:20.990" style="s2">you&#39;ve learned that lesson that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.130" end="00:06:22.760" style="s2">primarily your responsibility is</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.990" end="00:06:24.770" style="s2">sensitivity to be aware of the flows</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.760" end="00:06:26.660" style="s2">that you were in meshed in right right</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.770" end="00:06:28.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about your choices</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.660" end="00:06:31.400" style="s2">like a trim tab in the in the Bucky</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.760" end="00:06:32.690" style="s2">fuller sense there there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.400" end="00:06:34.970" style="s2">opening there&#39;s a pop there&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.690" end="00:06:37.910" style="s2">where your choice makes a difference</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.970" end="00:06:41.210" style="s2">mm-hmm that your your will has a place</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.910" end="00:06:42.980" style="s2">in the larger context and that and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.210" end="00:06:45.350" style="s2">then faith is this sense of like being</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.980" end="00:06:47.450" style="s2">held in surfing it literally it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.350" end="00:06:49.820" style="s2">being in the pocket right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.450" end="00:06:51.350" style="s2">literally be to know how to sense what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.820" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">happening around you and to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.350" end="00:06:54.710" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in a way that you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:55.820" style="s2">held in the pocket it&#39;s a very move away</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.710" end="00:06:57.830" style="s2">Sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.820" end="00:07:00.350" style="s2">right right that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.830" end="00:07:02.660" style="s2">about in that direction okay that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.350" end="00:07:04.070" style="s2">much in line with what I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.660" end="00:07:08.270" style="s2">when I was trying to propose this idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.070" end="00:07:10.790" style="s2">of this dynamic sense of continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.270" end="00:07:12.380" style="s2">contact with an unfolding process which</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.790" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">of course is exactly what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.380" end="00:07:16.700" style="s2">this area and then there&#39;s you brought</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:17.810" style="s2">in an extra dimension which you often do</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.700" end="00:07:20.030" style="s2">wonderfully with your with your</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.810" end="00:07:21.740" style="s2">visualizations I love the way you do</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.030" end="00:07:23.630" style="s2">that by the way you will be articulating</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.740" end="00:07:25.070" style="s2">something conceptually you&#39;ll bring it</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.630" end="00:07:27.980" style="s2">into a visual metaphor and then the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.070" end="00:07:29.810" style="s2">visual metaphor unfolds unpacking</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.980" end="00:07:31.880" style="s2">something in the phenomenology that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.810" end="00:07:33.590" style="s2">isn&#39;t immediately referenced in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.880" end="00:07:35.690" style="s2">concept because you brought up this idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.590" end="00:07:37.610" style="s2">of like the pocket and finding the sweet</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.690" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">spot right it&#39;s nice to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.610" end="00:07:44.150" style="s2">again by the way it&#39;s been too long yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:48.190" style="s2">I agree I like it a lot too and so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.150" end="00:07:52.340" style="s2">like that I&#39;d like iiiii cuz you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.190" end="00:07:54.800" style="s2">you know being a martial artist Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.340" end="00:07:56.420" style="s2">Chuan and stuff like that they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.800" end="00:07:59.270" style="s2">it&#39;s part of its of course getting into</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.420" end="00:08:01.580" style="s2">a flow state but part of its also</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.270" end="00:08:03.980" style="s2">getting into like you said getting into</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.580" end="00:08:06.740" style="s2">the pocket so I take it that like</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.980" end="00:08:08.780" style="s2">there&#39;s there there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.740" end="00:08:10.520" style="s2">normativity to faith if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.780" end="00:08:13.670" style="s2">like you can do it you can do it better</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.520" end="00:08:15.650" style="s2">or worse you can think of the surfer you</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.670" end="00:08:17.580" style="s2">know maintaining sort of a continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.650" end="00:08:20.100" style="s2">contact with the wave</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.580" end="00:08:22.590" style="s2">but they&#39;re sort of clumsy right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.100" end="00:08:24.060" style="s2">then you the one who gets if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.590" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">allow me a term I&#39;ve been working on you</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.060" end="00:08:27.960" style="s2">know gets an optimal grip on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">situation right and they find that</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.960" end="00:08:32.190" style="s2">reciprocity with the worlds right</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:35.190" style="s2">there&#39;s that deep sort about one minute</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.190" end="00:08:36.570" style="s2">and then they have a sense of right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.190" end="00:08:38.850" style="s2">it&#39;s not something you know even with</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.570" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">the power of a skill I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.850" end="00:08:42.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a knowing at a much deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:44.400" style="s2">you you know that you you you have this</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.600" end="00:08:48.230" style="s2">sense of a deep kind of conformity and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.400" end="00:08:51.030" style="s2">at one MIT with things yeah gives you</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.230" end="00:08:54.210" style="s2">the sense that you&#39;re in you&#39;re in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.030" end="00:08:57.480" style="s2">sweet spot with respect to how something</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.210" end="00:08:59.190" style="s2">is unfolding is that part of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.480" end="00:09:00.450" style="s2">putting your finger on yeah absolutely I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.190" end="00:09:01.860" style="s2">really like the fact that you highlight</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.450" end="00:09:03.840" style="s2">that notion of that one minute because</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.860" end="00:09:06.120" style="s2">it is diplom I first-person experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.840" end="00:09:07.530" style="s2">when I&#39;m in those circumstances I guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.120" end="00:09:10.590" style="s2">that sense that sense of sort of going</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.530" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">and dropping away and an extension and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.590" end="00:09:15.720" style="s2">sensitivity and you know and of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:17.160" style="s2">the classic example is that the moment</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.720" end="00:09:18.600" style="s2">that you are aware of it or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.160" end="00:09:21.210" style="s2">thinking about it you get in your head</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.600" end="00:09:23.580" style="s2">you&#39;re not in it anymore right</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.210" end="00:09:25.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s important right in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.580" end="00:09:27.750" style="s2">context of this notion of propositional</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.560" end="00:09:30.180" style="s2">well that&#39;s exactly right so there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.750" end="00:09:31.140" style="s2">things I want to talk about there one is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.180" end="00:09:33.810" style="s2">exactly that because I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.140" end="00:09:36.180" style="s2">interested as you know and dialectic and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.810" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">how it affords deal logos I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.180" end="00:09:41.700" style="s2">in about this this you know this</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:42.990" style="s2">interplay between dropping in I&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.700" end="00:09:45.300" style="s2">your metaphor it&#39;s it&#39;s a good one and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.990" end="00:09:47.760" style="s2">then maybe I&#39;ll use my metaphor stepping</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.300" end="00:09:49.950" style="s2">back and looking at and right and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.760" end="00:09:52.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of higher order place you</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.950" end="00:09:54.990" style="s2">can get there - yes that&#39;s got its own</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.680" end="00:09:57.000" style="s2">sweet spot right absolutely yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.990" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">absolutely completely in fact you&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.000" end="00:10:00.180" style="s2">again I just had the first-person</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:02.370" style="s2">experience so there&#39;s like a middle spot</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.180" end="00:10:03.930" style="s2">it&#39;s a bad place the top shot of both</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.370" end="00:10:05.280" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s this really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.930" end="00:10:06.690" style="s2">thing where you&#39;re like actually in both</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.280" end="00:10:09.000" style="s2">of those places and they really do</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.690" end="00:10:15.210" style="s2">support each other yes yes and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.000" end="00:10:17.160" style="s2">the kind of faith in dialectic that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.210" end="00:10:18.600" style="s2">see in the Platonic dialogues I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.160" end="00:10:19.650" style="s2">reading a really good book I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.600" end="00:10:23.280" style="s2">remember the name of the author&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.650" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">starts with an R real cocky I think I</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.280" end="00:10:26.610" style="s2">might be getting it wrong it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:29.940" style="s2">heidegger&#39;s Platonism guy sent it to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.610" end="00:10:30.450" style="s2">and he&#39;s unpacking this whole thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.940" end="00:10:33.840" style="s2">could play</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.450" end="00:10:36.510" style="s2">thought that ultimately there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.840" end="00:10:38.790" style="s2">kind of faith in dialectic and Plato</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.510" end="00:10:40.770" style="s2">because and confederal argues that when</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.790" end="00:10:43.740" style="s2">you&#39;re doing this process you altima</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.770" end="00:10:46.110" style="s2">can&#39;t put it into words which sounds odd</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.740" end="00:10:48.300" style="s2">for dialectic right but his whole point</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.110" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">is you you do this so something catches</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.300" end="00:10:53.640" style="s2">fire right that is ultimately non</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:54.870" style="s2">propositional but nevertheless that</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.640" end="00:10:57.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you can just do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.870" end="00:10:59.250" style="s2">you want there is a normativity there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.180" end="00:11:03.030" style="s2">there is this there is this guiding mass</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.250" end="00:11:04.050" style="s2">of it yeah yeah yeah yeah again Hague&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.030" end="00:11:05.280" style="s2">absolutely and it&#39;s beauty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.050" end="00:11:08.520" style="s2">beautiful it&#39;s like you could say me</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.280" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">even like a mm-hmm this new ship of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.520" end="00:11:12.840" style="s2">conformity that there&#39;s a shape there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:14.880" style="s2">a shape to it there is a shape that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.840" end="00:11:17.580" style="s2">all there is to it if you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.880" end="00:11:18.870" style="s2">don&#39;t grab a ball like this then you</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.580" end="00:11:20.100" style="s2">were not going to be successful in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.870" end="00:11:21.660" style="s2">holding the ball like if you hold it</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.100" end="00:11:24.780" style="s2">like this it&#39;s gonna slide up your hand</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.660" end="00:11:28.020" style="s2">was that yeah that&#39;s the optimum of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.780" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">gripping again the dynamic yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.020" end="00:11:34.500" style="s2">brings me to kind of the other other</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:37.610" style="s2">point I wanted to we don&#39;t have to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.500" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">to it immediately but I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.610" end="00:11:44.270" style="s2">situate that in terms of again the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:46.980" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion this idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.270" end="00:11:49.230" style="s2">because I want to add one more dance to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.980" end="00:11:50.790" style="s2">it absolutely very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.230" end="00:11:52.500" style="s2">yeah and I&#39;m seeing it unfold in real</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.790" end="00:11:54.330" style="s2">time actually okay great</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.500" end="00:11:56.510" style="s2">because the one more thing I would want</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.330" end="00:11:59.490" style="s2">to add to that which i think is implicit</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.510" end="00:12:01.830" style="s2">especially if the surfer right is</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.490" end="00:12:04.860" style="s2">getting an optimal grip on a continually</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.830" end="00:12:06.270" style="s2">shifting situation is the surfer is also</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.860" end="00:12:08.550" style="s2">going through some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.270" end="00:12:10.350" style="s2">transformative process now in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.550" end="00:12:12.540" style="s2">surfing situations it&#39;s transformation</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.350" end="00:12:14.730" style="s2">of there&#39;s their skillset and their</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.540" end="00:12:15.930" style="s2">sensitivity but what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.730" end="00:12:17.580" style="s2">I think when we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.930" end="00:12:19.080" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion is a much</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.580" end="00:12:23.730" style="s2">more profound and comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.080" end="00:12:26.610" style="s2">transformation and so what I mean is for</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.730" end="00:12:29.100" style="s2">discussion is taking this notion we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.610" end="00:12:31.710" style="s2">starting to craft of faith but then</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.100" end="00:12:33.030" style="s2">saying but what does that look like when</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.710" end="00:12:35.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a faith that&#39;s gonna take you</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.030" end="00:12:38.250" style="s2">through this much more comprehensive and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.640" end="00:12:39.900" style="s2">profound transformation does that does</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.250" end="00:12:41.190" style="s2">that make sense as a question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.900" end="00:12:43.500" style="s2">absolutely let me just try throw</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.190" end="00:12:44.550" style="s2">something out that occurs to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.500" end="00:12:46.529" style="s2">apologize that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.550" end="00:12:49.529" style="s2">a bit too topical but yeah I&#39;m gonna use</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.529" end="00:12:51.540" style="s2">the coronaviruses or the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.529" end="00:12:52.500" style="s2">unfolding meta-crisis as I&#39;m referring</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.540" end="00:12:55.140" style="s2">to it because you have to think about a</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.500" end="00:12:57.810" style="s2">lot of stuff besides just a virus yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.140" end="00:12:59.370" style="s2">in this context of faith in this context</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.810" end="00:13:00.750" style="s2">of religion yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.370" end="00:13:02.459" style="s2">and it&#39;s really quite fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.750" end="00:13:04.950" style="s2">actually it&#39;s almost like a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.459" end="00:13:06.390" style="s2">reflection of the Black Plague yes you</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.950" end="00:13:12.690" style="s2">and I talked about this like last time</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.390" end="00:13:14.790" style="s2">yeah yeah so here&#39;s here&#39;s what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.690" end="00:13:17.370" style="s2">to happen at least in some places in</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.790" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">some context is that some people will</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.370" end="00:13:20.910" style="s2">take faith in this sense that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.720" end="00:13:26.430" style="s2">talking about mmm it&#39;s just to say that</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.910" end="00:13:28.800" style="s2">they will find a way to come into a how</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.430" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">do you say it a dynamic conformity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:33.149" style="s2">yeah with what is really unfolding yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:35.820" style="s2">which we should say that they will make</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.149" end="00:13:37.649" style="s2">good choices they will they will make</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.820" end="00:13:39.209" style="s2">choices that are right in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.649" end="00:13:42.990" style="s2">to the reality that they find themselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.209" end="00:13:45.089" style="s2">in and to who they are or at the place</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.990" end="00:13:47.430" style="s2">that they are at in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.089" end="00:13:48.870" style="s2">themselves to their own bodies to to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.430" end="00:13:51.000" style="s2">people who they are with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.870" end="00:13:53.190" style="s2">relationships that they are near and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.000" end="00:13:54.420" style="s2">in fact in extending it and if you fight</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.190" end="00:13:55.890" style="s2">over this is happening in real time for</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.420" end="00:13:57.510" style="s2">example many many communities around the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.890" end="00:13:59.640" style="s2">world we&#39;re the beginning to realize</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.510" end="00:14:02.040" style="s2">that a lot of the help that they need</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.640" end="00:14:04.470" style="s2">we&#39;ll only in candling be found among</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.040" end="00:14:06.690" style="s2">the people who they are nearby right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.470" end="00:14:07.410" style="s2">to the degree to which you and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.690" end="00:14:08.790" style="s2">saying is that that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.410" end="00:14:10.680" style="s2">discovery of what is in fact actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.790" end="00:14:11.910" style="s2">real mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.680" end="00:14:15.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a reality it is simply the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.910" end="00:14:16.740" style="s2">reality that in a context like this to</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.000" end="00:14:19.950" style="s2">be able to rely on your neighbors is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.740" end="00:14:22.260" style="s2">very a good strategy it&#39;s a good place</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.950" end="00:14:24.860" style="s2">to be and to be able to be relied on by</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.260" end="00:14:27.720" style="s2">your neighbors is a good place to be yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.860" end="00:14:29.790" style="s2">trust and by the way of non-trivial yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.720" end="00:14:31.620" style="s2">all these things exactly good faith</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.790" end="00:14:32.670" style="s2">competence integrity trustworthiness all</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.620" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">these sort of things that are old-school</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.670" end="00:14:38.220" style="s2">virtues for good reasons as our friend</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:42.089" style="s2">Jordan Peterson sort of famously tried</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.220" end="00:14:43.980" style="s2">to hammer into the consciousness that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.089" end="00:14:46.290" style="s2">a coming to faith thread that building</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.980" end="00:14:47.550" style="s2">of an actual capacity to do so</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.290" end="00:14:49.320" style="s2">all right now it&#39;s not the hope that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.550" end="00:14:51.360" style="s2">exists but the learning the relearning</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.320" end="00:14:53.699" style="s2">and the many ways does the rediscovery</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:55.709" style="s2">of what it means to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.699" end="00:14:58.290" style="s2">integrity and what it means to be able</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.709" end="00:14:58.499" style="s2">to have trustworthiness and and how to</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.290" end="00:15:00.359" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.499" end="00:15:02.489" style="s2">so across a larger group of people had</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.359" end="00:15:03.989" style="s2">to be to be a neighbor to be neighborly</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.489" end="00:15:07.199" style="s2">and to be a good neighbor in the context</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.989" end="00:15:09.779" style="s2">of crisis is an embodiment of this face</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.199" end="00:15:13.969" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about right in in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.779" end="00:15:15.899" style="s2">larger fashion I&#39;m on a larger body and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.969" end="00:15:17.399" style="s2">the the beautiful thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.899" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">environment they&#39;re in right now is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.399" end="00:15:22.729" style="s2">it has this beautiful that the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.199" end="00:15:25.619" style="s2">constants between salience and relevance</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.729" end="00:15:28.129" style="s2">we are making we are forced to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.619" end="00:15:30.539" style="s2">choices yeah we find out very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.129" end="00:15:33.359" style="s2">whether the basis of choice was a good</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.539" end="00:15:34.739" style="s2">basis of choice right right it has</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.359" end="00:15:37.199" style="s2">meaning it lands right there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.739" end="00:15:38.159" style="s2">consequences yes so this is a very this</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.199" end="00:15:40.889" style="s2">is sort of an optimal learning</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.159" end="00:15:42.509" style="s2">environment for for building faith I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.889" end="00:15:43.859" style="s2">really enjoying this but I really like</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.509" end="00:15:48.569" style="s2">the idea of being able to recover this</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.859" end="00:15:51.389" style="s2">this notion so well so deeply from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.569" end="00:15:57.749" style="s2">false narrative that has presented it as</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.389" end="00:15:59.789" style="s2">being kind of maximally maladaptive so</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.749" end="00:16:02.369" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of things we could riff</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.789" end="00:16:03.419" style="s2">on that so let&#39;s put a pin in because</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.369" end="00:16:05.369" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned so we can try and get I</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.419" end="00:16:07.499" style="s2">wanna I want to get to this the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.369" end="00:16:09.599" style="s2">connection to integrity and I would want</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.499" end="00:16:12.809" style="s2">to talk about integrity in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.599" end="00:16:14.789" style="s2">process of integration mm-hmm-hmm what</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.809" end="00:16:17.039" style="s2">that looks like because integrity I</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.789" end="00:16:20.009" style="s2">think has degenerated in our common</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.039" end="00:16:22.439" style="s2">conception into a kind of steadfastness</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.009" end="00:16:24.799" style="s2">which i think is a component but nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.439" end="00:16:29.639" style="s2">is sufficient for what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.799" end="00:16:31.199" style="s2">put your finger on the other thing we</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.639" end="00:16:33.059" style="s2">might do is pick up on what you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.199" end="00:16:35.579" style="s2">said which i think is really important</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.059" end="00:16:38.629" style="s2">is which is the contrast class which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.579" end="00:16:41.699" style="s2">more traditional notions of faith ah</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.629" end="00:16:44.879" style="s2">right so I mean what immediately comes</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.699" end="00:16:47.429" style="s2">to mind are two notions that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.879" end="00:16:49.470" style="s2">already discussed but maybe I think we</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.429" end="00:16:52.019" style="s2">should maybe excavated a bit more that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.470" end="00:16:53.489" style="s2">we want to say no this isn&#39;t what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.019" end="00:16:55.319" style="s2">need right now what this isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.489" end="00:16:57.029" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about at least one is</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.319" end="00:16:59.099" style="s2">where as I said before willful</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.029" end="00:17:01.259" style="s2">imposition that you&#39;re going to force</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.099" end="00:17:02.999" style="s2">things which is the opposite of whoa way</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.259" end="00:17:05.220" style="s2">right I&#39;m going to want things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.999" end="00:17:07.500" style="s2">right instead of fall it&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.220" end="00:17:09.480" style="s2">the Chinese metaphors finding the grain</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.500" end="00:17:10.649" style="s2">of the wood and knowing how to follow</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.480" end="00:17:12.400" style="s2">the grain of the wood but nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.649" end="00:17:13.449" style="s2">you can still carve the wood</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.400" end="00:17:15.400" style="s2">but you follow the grain of the wood</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.449" end="00:17:17.980" style="s2">rather than forcing against the grain</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.400" end="00:17:20.920" style="s2">and and really risking tearing the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.980" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">thing apart and hurting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.920" end="00:17:26.559" style="s2">so and there&#39;s that and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:28.449" style="s2">these two are shadows of each other in</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.559" end="00:17:30.970" style="s2">the almost in the Union sense I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.449" end="00:17:33.190" style="s2">they&#39;re the they&#39;re both sides of Luther</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.970" end="00:17:36.250" style="s2">yeah not not to make him the villain</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.190" end="00:17:37.960" style="s2">here and then the other one is and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.250" end="00:17:40.270" style="s2">something that you put your finger on</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.960" end="00:17:42.520" style="s2">which is something I think we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.270" end="00:17:45.160" style="s2">which is a kind of magical Hope which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.520" end="00:17:47.830" style="s2">oh well we just have to have faith which</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.160" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">is the sense of you know something</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.830" end="00:17:53.620" style="s2">completely miraculous and external to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:58.960" style="s2">is going to you know save me and save</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.620" end="00:18:01.300" style="s2">the situation and that that to me seems</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.960" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">Oh also equally dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.300" end="00:18:06.429" style="s2">in dangerous times like these so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:08.740" style="s2">idea that we&#39;re gonna force the grain</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.429" end="00:18:09.910" style="s2">and you can you can see that right with</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.740" end="00:18:11.500" style="s2">you know there&#39;s been political</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.910" end="00:18:14.559" style="s2">responses where people just sort try to</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.500" end="00:18:16.450" style="s2">deny the reality or will it away by</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.559" end="00:18:18.070" style="s2">assertion no no it&#39;s real where</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.450" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">everything&#39;s fine the economy&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.070" end="00:18:21.640" style="s2">great get all that sort of stopped and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:23.170" style="s2">then there&#39;s the other well we just</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.640" end="00:18:25.960" style="s2">tough that faith where it means we just</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.170" end="00:18:29.230" style="s2">sort of have to hope and I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.960" end="00:18:31.000" style="s2">I&#39;m very critical of the notion and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.230" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">a classical notion he goes back to st.</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.000" end="00:18:36.550" style="s2">Paul I&#39;m very I&#39;m usually very</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.520" end="00:18:38.620" style="s2">respectful of st. Paul but his notion of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.550" end="00:18:40.390" style="s2">defining faith in terms of hope</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.620" end="00:18:44.740" style="s2">I think is problematic because I find</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.390" end="00:18:48.460" style="s2">hope a very problematic thing because</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.740" end="00:18:51.010" style="s2">it&#39;s different because it&#39;s we do the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.460" end="00:18:53.350" style="s2">same thing we can rescue hope yes i I</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.010" end="00:18:56.230" style="s2">hear what you&#39;re saying right so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.350" end="00:18:57.970" style="s2">I&#39;m quite happy to rescue hope I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.230" end="00:19:00.460" style="s2">gonna say that I wasn&#39;t rejecting hope I</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.970" end="00:19:02.710" style="s2">find hope ambiguous and equivocal in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.460" end="00:19:05.320" style="s2">way that&#39;s very dangerous right right</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.710" end="00:19:07.809" style="s2">and so that we could we could try and</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.320" end="00:19:10.090" style="s2">work that out and that that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.809" end="00:19:12.190" style="s2">critique of Paul&#39;s notion that faith is</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.090" end="00:19:14.110" style="s2">hope for things that we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.190" end="00:19:18.429" style="s2">evidence for or something like that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.110" end="00:19:21.310" style="s2">we haven&#39;t seen and what I what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.429" end="00:19:23.320" style="s2">trying to get at is you know what I see</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.310" end="00:19:25.270" style="s2">wrong with them it parallels the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.320" end="00:19:26.140" style="s2">criticism I made sorry I&#39;m going on but</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.270" end="00:19:28.240" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.140" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">there&#39;s an argument here it parallels</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.240" end="00:19:32.830" style="s2">the criticisms I made sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:35.230" style="s2">Locke and Rousseau where you know Locke</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.830" end="00:19:37.000" style="s2">is a purely passive epistemology and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.230" end="00:19:39.910" style="s2">that&#39;s the magical hope version of faith</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.000" end="00:19:42.340" style="s2">I just possibly wait for the miracle</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.910" end="00:19:44.350" style="s2">waiting for a miracle right and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.340" end="00:19:46.809" style="s2">there and then or you have Rousseau&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.350" end="00:19:49.840" style="s2">which is the willful imposition I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.809" end="00:19:52.030" style="s2">gonna make the miracle happen</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.840" end="00:19:55.450" style="s2">right I&#39;m gonna write I&#39;m gonna and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.030" end="00:19:57.670" style="s2">seems to me that for reasons analogous</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.450" end="00:20:01.210" style="s2">to why both of those epistemologies are</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.670" end="00:20:05.169" style="s2">seriously questionable I think both of</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.210" end="00:20:07.299" style="s2">those notions of faith as magical will</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.169" end="00:20:09.490" style="s2">and magical hope should equally be</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.299" end="00:20:11.650" style="s2">rejected so that was an argument</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.490" end="00:20:14.830" style="s2">I wanted something absolutely I think I</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.650" end="00:20:17.650" style="s2">said and I mean as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.830" end="00:20:18.910" style="s2">that seems obvious like yes yes yes and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.650" end="00:20:25.210" style="s2">I think your framing is just right like</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.910" end="00:20:27.010" style="s2">one has this energy imposition yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.210" end="00:20:29.260" style="s2">I think the way I categorize they both</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.010" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">are characteristics of the maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.260" end="00:20:33.370" style="s2">the relationship to reality yes I agree</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:35.320" style="s2">that&#39;s why I made the analogy to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.370" end="00:20:37.809" style="s2">epistemology because I think yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.320" end="00:20:39.429" style="s2">apologies are ultimately now adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.809" end="00:20:43.090" style="s2">ways of understanding the acquisition of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.429" end="00:20:47.610" style="s2">knowledge and and then the way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.090" end="00:20:50.980" style="s2">the the transmogrification of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.610" end="00:20:54.790" style="s2">simply to choose I&#39;m Calvin and Hobbes</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.980" end="00:20:55.960" style="s2">soon as the what is right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.790" end="00:20:58.419" style="s2">to reality and it&#39;s kind of a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.960" end="00:21:02.730" style="s2">simple question yeah what is what is it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.419" end="00:21:05.770" style="s2">what is it intimate subtle honorable</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.730" end="00:21:06.970" style="s2">humble like there&#39;s how does one come</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.770" end="00:21:08.530" style="s2">into right relationship with reality few</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.970" end="00:21:10.600" style="s2">think about like in the context of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.530" end="00:21:13.720" style="s2">notion of the meaning crisis mm-hmm you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.600" end="00:21:15.040" style="s2">can I want to put a fine point and it</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.720" end="00:21:17.710" style="s2">may be like what it&#39;s at the center of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.040" end="00:21:19.540" style="s2">the meaning crisis is the lack of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.710" end="00:21:21.370" style="s2">right relationship to reality I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.540" end="00:21:24.549" style="s2">that is extremely well said and very</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.370" end="00:21:28.210" style="s2">astute I like that in fact I would I</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.549" end="00:21:33.700" style="s2">would accept that as a summation of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.210" end="00:21:35.380" style="s2">central project of the whole series Wow</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.700" end="00:21:36.700" style="s2">all right that&#39;s good news then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.380" end="00:21:38.999" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re doing the thing we should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.700" end="00:21:42.850" style="s2">doing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.999" end="00:21:45.509" style="s2">Wow so that&#39;s interesting because I have</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.850" end="00:21:50.350" style="s2">heard in religious contexts faith</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.509" end="00:21:54.549" style="s2">sometimes described as being in a right</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.350" end="00:21:56.529" style="s2">relationship or knowing how knowing when</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.549" end="00:21:57.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a finesse element in here of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.529" end="00:22:00.340" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.850" end="00:22:02.230" style="s2">knowing how and when to be in a right</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.340" end="00:22:05.799" style="s2">relationship with God so I have heard</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.230" end="00:22:09.460" style="s2">that that&#39;s not Raman it in my religious</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.799" end="00:22:14.980" style="s2">past but I do remember that being posed</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.460" end="00:22:16.149" style="s2">as a a way of understanding yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.980" end="00:22:17.679" style="s2">I think this all comes down to the thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.149" end="00:22:19.299" style="s2">we talked about last time which is this</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.679" end="00:22:20.769" style="s2">sort of terrible trap that we get into</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.299" end="00:22:22.690" style="s2">where we try to force ourselves into</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.769" end="00:22:25.379" style="s2">being effective by training doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.690" end="00:22:28.960" style="s2">rather than training capacity yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.379" end="00:22:31.179" style="s2">say okay somebody wise once discovered</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.960" end="00:22:32.289" style="s2">that if you follow these three rules the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.179" end="00:22:33.669" style="s2">likelihood that you&#39;ll be in right</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.289" end="00:22:35.559" style="s2">relationship to God would be in right</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.669" end="00:22:38.470" style="s2">relationship to reality is very high</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.559" end="00:22:40.029" style="s2">yeah well it turns out that it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.470" end="00:22:41.169" style="s2">the easier to get somebody to read three</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.029" end="00:22:42.909" style="s2">rules and just kind of repeat it over</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.169" end="00:22:45.190" style="s2">and over again than it is to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.909" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">in them the native capacity to actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.190" end="00:22:49.960" style="s2">make effective choices in themselves yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:51.460" style="s2">and so we kind of lose track of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.960" end="00:22:54.279" style="s2">thing we start to try to go in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.460" end="00:22:56.529" style="s2">direction let&#39;s say yeah I mean some</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.279" end="00:22:58.090" style="s2">sense it&#39;s a developmental laziness this</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.529" end="00:23:01.119" style="s2">seems to be a consistent trap that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.090" end="00:23:03.039" style="s2">fall into yeah I noticed that when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.119" end="00:23:04.690" style="s2">reading Gonzales book dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.039" end="00:23:08.200" style="s2">dialectic and he talks about the two</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.690" end="00:23:10.029" style="s2">traps that Plato has Socrates constantly</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.200" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">this skill and Charybdis that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.029" end="00:23:14.379" style="s2">constantly trying to steer the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:18.580" style="s2">conversation between one is the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.379" end="00:23:21.580" style="s2">nosov common sense mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.580" end="00:23:23.799" style="s2">and then the other is what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.580" end="00:23:26.889" style="s2">the satisfaction with technical</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.799" end="00:23:28.749" style="s2">definition kind of empty theorizing a</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.889" end="00:23:32.169" style="s2">theorizing that has no existential</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.749" end="00:23:34.239" style="s2">challenge or import attached yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.169" end="00:23:35.889" style="s2">yeah beautiful and then you can see how</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.239" end="00:23:39.249" style="s2">thank you that&#39;s a good selling credit</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.889" end="00:23:40.509" style="s2">so you have a it&#39;s very similar to her</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.249" end="00:23:41.710" style="s2">it&#39;s not exactly the same but very</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.509" end="00:23:43.929" style="s2">similar just they add the bifurcation</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.710" end="00:23:47.529" style="s2">and did it it&#39;s like have a lazy</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.929" end="00:23:50.619" style="s2">disengaged and sometimes even like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.529" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">truculent or diffident relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.619" end="00:23:55.630" style="s2">reality which is the common sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.960" end="00:23:59.500" style="s2">No and then there&#39;s a that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.630" end="00:24:00.790" style="s2">distancing and a actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.500" end="00:24:03.490" style="s2">interesting yeah that doctrine said is</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.790" end="00:24:06.100" style="s2">very much the mastery domain we</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.490" end="00:24:07.870" style="s2">basically say you know fuck reality our</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.100" end="00:24:09.490" style="s2">rules are the rules and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.870" end="00:24:11.650" style="s2">impose the rigor of the rule we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.490" end="00:24:13.420" style="s2">discipline ourselves so vigorously and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.650" end="00:24:15.940" style="s2">our discipline is actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.420" end="00:24:18.780" style="s2">force reality to conform to us yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.940" end="00:24:21.880" style="s2">think and I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.780" end="00:24:24.550" style="s2">that&#39;s the attraction of ideology right</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.880" end="00:24:26.500" style="s2">is I can hammer everything I can I could</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.550" end="00:24:30.910" style="s2">hammer this doctrine on to the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.500" end="00:24:34.510" style="s2">right yeah so but the but and so what</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.910" end="00:24:35.620" style="s2">what I&#39;m okay so we we might have a four</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.510" end="00:24:36.850" style="s2">dimensional thing or what might have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.620" end="00:24:38.350" style="s2">two dimensional thing I don&#39;t know quite</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.850" end="00:24:40.390" style="s2">what we&#39;re mapping that the mapping is</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.350" end="00:24:42.640" style="s2">yeah because we have an active we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.390" end="00:24:44.500" style="s2">an activity passivity golden mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.640" end="00:24:46.300" style="s2">trying to get between and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.500" end="00:24:47.320" style="s2">also a golden mean I don&#39;t know know</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.300" end="00:24:48.250" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing with the vertical it</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.320" end="00:24:50.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean anything it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.250" end="00:24:54.520" style="s2">alternative dimension but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.080" end="00:24:57.310" style="s2">golden mean between two kinds of obvious</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.520" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">misses I&#39;d like to say there&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.310" end="00:25:01.930" style="s2">said there&#39;s the the imposition of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:03.730" style="s2">doctrine but but I think that common</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.930" end="00:25:06.130" style="s2">sense also carries with it a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:25:27.220" end="00:25:29.680" style="s2">like the dunning-kruger effect or</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.690" end="00:25:31.570" style="s2">something like that it is a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.680" end="00:25:36.040" style="s2">specific realization that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.570" end="00:25:38.110" style="s2">case yes so what and again I get the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.040" end="00:25:39.370" style="s2">feeling that the flavor for that of me</p>

<p begin="00:25:48.460" end="00:25:54.580" style="s2">you know and the obvious &#39;no sand of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.180" end="00:25:55.810" style="s2">common sense yeah it&#39;s really</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.789" end="00:28:06.149" style="s2">so that then I think is now I feels to</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.090" end="00:28:08.309" style="s2">me like we&#39;re steering back then to the</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.309" end="00:28:12.090" style="s2">about a golden mean and we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.720" end="00:28:16.139" style="s2">about a virtue and that seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.090" end="00:28:18.090" style="s2">be working in marketing us back to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.139" end="00:28:22.109" style="s2">need to discuss the integrity and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.090" end="00:28:23.220" style="s2">integration hmm yeah okay so may I may I</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.109" end="00:28:26.600" style="s2">do something we haven&#39;t done yet me</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.220" end="00:28:28.379" style="s2">actually read something please from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.600" end="00:28:30.690" style="s2">from my friend</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.379" end="00:28:32.369" style="s2">yes Akiko camera I quoted him recently</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.690" end="00:28:34.249" style="s2">and on exactly this question of</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.369" end="00:28:37.379" style="s2">integrity hmm</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.249" end="00:28:40.440" style="s2">so the as you might imagine from his</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.379" end="00:28:44.220" style="s2">name he&#39;s Japanese the Japanese word</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.440" end="00:28:47.629" style="s2">toku tete in Chinese which is usually</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.220" end="00:28:50.999" style="s2">translated as virtue also means power or</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.629" end="00:28:53.700" style="s2">integrity mm-hmm toku is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.999" end="00:28:56.070" style="s2">consciousness of the whole that makes</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.700" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">her life coherent consistent and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.070" end="00:29:02.999" style="s2">integral therefore toku is integrity</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:05.039" style="s2">antoku is also power because through</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.999" end="00:29:09.330" style="s2">toku your vision action and results</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.039" end="00:29:11.899" style="s2">become coherent and consistent and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.330" end="00:29:14.580" style="s2">he talks about the notion of integrity</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.899" end="00:29:15.330" style="s2">the integration the coming together I</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.580" end="00:29:17.399" style="s2">lost it</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.330" end="00:29:18.659" style="s2">too bad I&#39;m full unfortunately the quote</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.399" end="00:29:21.599" style="s2">that I quoted did not include the piece</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.659" end="00:29:25.440" style="s2">that I was looking for it&#39;s still a good</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.599" end="00:29:27.179" style="s2">quote to begin with them yeah so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.440" end="00:29:28.379" style="s2">go back to just first principles and</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.179" end="00:29:31.739" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.379" end="00:29:33.749" style="s2">integration yes and and then hole right</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.739" end="00:29:36.229" style="s2">a hole it&#39;s an integration oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.749" end="00:29:40.289" style="s2">there&#39;s some really good stuff there</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.229" end="00:29:43.019" style="s2">well part of it part of it is so what</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.289" end="00:29:46.590" style="s2">comes to my mind immediately is again</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.019" end="00:29:48.059" style="s2">because I&#39;m working on it so much but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.590" end="00:29:52.529" style="s2">guess also because I&#39;m committed to it</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.059" end="00:29:53.789" style="s2">existentially is plato&#39;s deep I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.529" end="00:29:58.440" style="s2">it&#39;s one of his profound insights about</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.789" end="00:30:02.460" style="s2">the deep belonging together of inter</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.440" end="00:30:03.899" style="s2">intra psychic integration and right</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.460" end="00:30:07.529" style="s2">ontological integration with the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.899" end="00:30:09.629" style="s2">that one man there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.529" end="00:30:12.440" style="s2">three dimensions of that one myth you</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.629" end="00:30:14.360" style="s2">have to be at one with yourself and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.440" end="00:30:15.770" style="s2">we have to get beyond a trivial meaning</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.360" end="00:30:18.680" style="s2">of that and so hopefully we can unpack</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.770" end="00:30:21.320" style="s2">that at the FBI one with reality and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.680" end="00:30:22.400" style="s2">then those two at one myths are all</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.320" end="00:30:24.950" style="s2">right one with each other they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.400" end="00:30:30.770" style="s2">mutually affording each other that awful</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.950" end="00:30:36.260" style="s2">way and I think for me the normativity</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.770" end="00:30:39.170" style="s2">then of faith is the normativity of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.260" end="00:30:42.260" style="s2">is affording me a progression towards an</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.170" end="00:30:46.370" style="s2">optimal grip that brings about inner</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.260" end="00:30:49.430" style="s2">peace and an optimal grip that gives me</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.370" end="00:30:51.920" style="s2">ontological depth perception and then in</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.430" end="00:30:55.070" style="s2">right and then an optimal grip that</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.920" end="00:30:56.840" style="s2">makes the two of them right reciprocally</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.070" end="00:30:58.820" style="s2">open so the world and me are</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.840" end="00:31:02.350" style="s2">reciprocally opening each other rather</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.820" end="00:31:07.130" style="s2">than reciprocally narrowing this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.350" end="00:31:09.530" style="s2">let&#39;s play guitar yeah so I have a I had</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.130" end="00:31:12.110" style="s2">a sense of some kind of sound that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.530" end="00:31:13.490" style="s2">would like to make okay but to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.110" end="00:31:15.050" style="s2">successfully achieve that there has to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.490" end="00:31:17.510" style="s2">be an integration in the interior there</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.050" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">has to be a smoothness of the flow from</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.510" end="00:31:23.060" style="s2">the rising sensibility that is actually</p>

<p begin="00:31:26.900" end="00:31:31.400" style="s2">is now my my interior is expressing</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.630" end="00:31:33.140" style="s2">itself as an exterior which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.400" end="00:31:35.360" style="s2">manifested directly as an actual</p>

<p begin="00:31:40.580" end="00:31:45.680" style="s2">right but now the objective space the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.520" end="00:31:48.290" style="s2">note is sounded the sound that I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.680" end="00:31:51.050" style="s2">sensing in myself is now sounded in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.290" end="00:31:55.160" style="s2">outside and I can hear it and it lands</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.050" end="00:31:57.560" style="s2">in me which then moves me from a note to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.160" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">the next note right and your reciprocal</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.390" end="00:32:47.140" style="s2">concrete example of what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.470" end="00:32:49.360" style="s2">about I hope it was not too too banal</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.140" end="00:32:53.830" style="s2">but I like like making no no not at all</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.360" end="00:32:56.020" style="s2">I think I think what&#39;s really again to</p>

<p begin="00:33:09.970" end="00:33:13.990" style="s2">think also part of what we meant by</p>

<p begin="00:33:21.220" end="00:33:26.650" style="s2">reasons why we love music so much is it</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.400" end="00:33:29.530" style="s2">represents to us sort of an ideal state</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.650" end="00:33:31.960" style="s2">in which our salience tracking and our</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.960" end="00:33:37.000" style="s2">smoothly in sync together I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.600" end="00:33:39.490" style="s2">part of if you&#39;ll allow me part of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.000" end="00:33:43.059" style="s2">beauty of music and Plato talks a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.490" end="00:33:46.510" style="s2">about especially in the symposium right</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.059" end="00:33:50.740" style="s2">you know that that there&#39;s that the this</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.510" end="00:33:53.410" style="s2">dialogical faith brings with it a sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.740" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">of beauty a sense of beauty which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.410" end="00:33:57.580" style="s2">the same thing as a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.640" end="00:33:59.530" style="s2">pleasantness right Rilke is very good</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.580" end="00:34:00.880" style="s2">for teaching us if beauty doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.530" end="00:34:03.669" style="s2">the same thing as pleasantness or</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.880" end="00:34:06.549" style="s2">entertaining beauty and put us on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.669" end="00:34:09.869" style="s2">border of awe or even horror as well</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.549" end="00:34:12.669" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s because you beauty and scary</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.869" end="00:34:15.100" style="s2">does a beautiful book of what it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.669" end="00:34:16.540" style="s2">beautiful gem of a book on on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.100" end="00:34:18.550" style="s2">experience of beauty and how it and this</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.540" end="00:34:22.619" style="s2">is her language it shouldn&#39;t be equated</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.550" end="00:34:26.679" style="s2">with truth and goodness but it trains us</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.619" end="00:34:29.109" style="s2">hmm and goodness and so beauty is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.679" end="00:34:31.899" style="s2">sense that you&#39;re getting this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.109" end="00:34:35.590" style="s2">flowing at one mint and you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.899" end="00:34:37.530" style="s2">you&#39;re coupling salience and right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.590" end="00:34:42.600" style="s2">truth tracking together</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.530" end="00:34:45.300" style="s2">you&#39;re getting you know a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.600" end="00:34:48.419" style="s2">of your deeper competence and beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.300" end="00:34:53.940" style="s2">a way of saying ah to all of that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.419" end="00:34:55.409" style="s2">beautiful yeah there&#39;s a sense as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.940" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">saying it out of like this just a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.409" end="00:35:00.660" style="s2">slow I think is Martha Graham just like</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:03.360" style="s2">a single perfectly smooth motion of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.660" end="00:35:07.460" style="s2">hand right right and in that sense like</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.360" end="00:35:10.950" style="s2">the would you call the competence or the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.460" end="00:35:14.390" style="s2">the the the interior exterior the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.950" end="00:35:20.580" style="s2">balancing length is exactly says it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.390" end="00:35:22.890" style="s2">implicitly no no integrally unavoidably</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.580" end="00:35:24.960" style="s2">a relationality between the interior and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.890" end="00:35:27.060" style="s2">the exterior and a way of actually using</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.960" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">that the factor that relationality to</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.060" end="00:35:34.370" style="s2">achieve a smoothness yes um subtlety and</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:36.750" style="s2">smoothness to it which doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.370" end="00:35:39.900" style="s2">smoothness doesn&#39;t mean a reductive</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.750" end="00:35:42.330" style="s2">homogeneity this I mean you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.900" end="00:35:44.940" style="s2">lot of fine grained movement and</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.330" end="00:35:48.180" style="s2">differentiation but the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.940" end="00:35:51.270" style="s2">integrity right is its heat right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.180" end="00:35:54.170" style="s2">I mean that that&#39;s why I often prefer</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.270" end="00:35:56.490" style="s2">the notion of complexification because</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.170" end="00:35:59.570" style="s2">when a system is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.490" end="00:36:01.080" style="s2">differentiating and then maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.570" end="00:36:02.610" style="s2">integration throughout that</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.080" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">differentiation I think that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.610" end="00:36:08.220" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about it getting the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:10.440" style="s2">ability to ride the wave of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.220" end="00:36:11.940" style="s2">to surf the wave of uncertainty to go</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.440" end="00:36:14.250" style="s2">back to one of your earlier metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.940" end="00:36:16.830" style="s2">and add to allude to a book by Andy</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.250" end="00:36:18.690" style="s2">Clark as well I guess well and I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.830" end="00:36:21.540" style="s2">also brought to mind the works of</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.690" end="00:36:25.230" style="s2">Christopher Alexander mmm the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.540" end="00:36:28.770" style="s2">architect who one of his great polymaths</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.230" end="00:36:30.270" style="s2">who his discipline was architecture but</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.770" end="00:36:31.770" style="s2">he ended up using architecture as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.270" end="00:36:35.310" style="s2">primary medium to then explore all</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.770" end="00:36:36.510" style="s2">things right and what&#39;s nice about is</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.310" end="00:36:38.130" style="s2">that you can actually very clearly get a</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.510" end="00:36:41.120" style="s2">sense of this sort of golden mean that</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.130" end="00:36:43.800" style="s2">the homogeneity is not beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.120" end="00:36:45.690" style="s2">what you can&#39;t sort of a mess is not</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.800" end="00:36:47.220" style="s2">beautiful yeah there&#39;s a particular</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.690" end="00:36:49.560" style="s2">location where you actually really need</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.220" end="00:36:51.030" style="s2">to have the right mixture of symmetries</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.560" end="00:36:53.480" style="s2">and bowel</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.030" end="00:36:56.250" style="s2">said actually asymmetries and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.480" end="00:36:58.950" style="s2">characteristics of what that a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.250" end="00:37:00.540" style="s2">physical environment you know houses and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.950" end="00:37:04.350" style="s2">buildings a nation at you know parks</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.540" end="00:37:06.450" style="s2">look like which is nice i mean it&#39;s its</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.350" end="00:37:07.980" style="s2">interest you can discover that that when</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.450" end="00:37:09.630" style="s2">you find someone who&#39;s thought deeply</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.980" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">about this and it spend time out in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.630" end="00:37:12.360" style="s2">particular discipline and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve done it multimodal they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.360" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">done it in a discipline that actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:18.330" style="s2">begin to become transparent matic that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:21.870" style="s2">they generally end up coming to more or</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.330" end="00:37:24.230" style="s2">less the same place this is um that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.870" end="00:37:24.230" style="s2">great observation</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.440" end="00:37:31.670" style="s2">so i mean to me now it almost becomes</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.880" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">how&#39;s it work it&#39;s simple but not easy i</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.160" end="00:37:40.080" style="s2">think it&#39;s a right way of putting it mhm</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:41.190" style="s2">we have more or less two questions i</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.080" end="00:37:42.180" style="s2">guess these are the two questions that</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.190" end="00:37:44.040" style="s2">people who is struggling with forever</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.180" end="00:37:45.990" style="s2">but but the challenge is to get good at</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.040" end="00:37:48.660" style="s2">it not to try to have to have done with</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.990" end="00:37:52.980" style="s2">it right you know one question is just</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.660" end="00:37:55.380" style="s2">to be aware of what are the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.980" end="00:37:57.750" style="s2">practices the heuristics not the rules</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.380" end="00:38:01.290" style="s2">but the rules of thumb loosely held</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.750" end="00:38:05.340" style="s2">guidances that allow us to develop in</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.290" end="00:38:07.100" style="s2">this way how do we did the there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.340" end="00:38:11.070" style="s2">couple of pi day oh and the greek i</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.100" end="00:38:12.570" style="s2">think um yeah and then the other one is</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.070" end="00:38:14.940" style="s2">two traps like what are the what are the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.570" end="00:38:18.170" style="s2">things that cause us to go astray how do</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.940" end="00:38:21.330" style="s2">how do we find ourselves off the path</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.170" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">and just becoming you aware of and wise</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.330" end="00:38:26.490" style="s2">and able to respond to that as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:27.990" style="s2">occurring that&#39;s the religion that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.490" end="00:38:30.330" style="s2">a religion i just the combination of</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.990" end="00:38:33.170" style="s2">those two things I think that&#39;s rectus</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.330" end="00:38:36.630" style="s2">built in life in yourself and in others</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.170" end="00:38:39.540" style="s2">that would pick up on the contrast</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.630" end="00:38:42.660" style="s2">between schleiermacher and Schley and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.540" end="00:38:44.910" style="s2">Schlegel&#39;s take on Plato you know Shlomo</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.660" end="00:38:46.620" style="s2">was the person who did that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.910" end="00:38:48.570" style="s2">translations of the dialogue that sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.620" end="00:38:51.090" style="s2">of started the modern school scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.570" end="00:38:56.720" style="s2">around Plato and it sort of fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.090" end="00:38:58.860" style="s2">into two schools one school or you could</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.720" end="00:39:00.750" style="s2">again I wish I could remember the author</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.860" end="00:39:02.550" style="s2">of this book same but the dogmatist</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.750" end="00:39:03.930" style="s2">there say here&#39;s Plato&#39;s arguments and</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.630" end="00:39:26.670" style="s2">sort of thing and how they all fit</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.670" end="00:39:33.060" style="s2">out and each side has its strengths and</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.520" end="00:42:28.330" style="s2">trying to point out how the the form of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.950" end="00:42:32.270" style="s2">the dialogue Slagel thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.330" end="00:42:34.820" style="s2">indispensable because it is the place in</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.270" end="00:42:37.220" style="s2">which you will get that smooth flowing</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.820" end="00:42:39.650" style="s2">integration between ah my right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.220" end="00:42:41.270" style="s2">Police&#39;s yeah and so it we came up from</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.650" end="00:42:43.400" style="s2">is you&#39;re saying that was this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.270" end="00:42:45.830" style="s2">the opening the holding open of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.400" end="00:42:47.810" style="s2">space yes the guy logos the the ability</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.830" end="00:42:49.820" style="s2">to actually recognize that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.810" end="00:42:51.589" style="s2">actually something there there&#39;s a space</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.820" end="00:42:53.960" style="s2">of the dialogue that your action in</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.589" end="00:42:56.780" style="s2">relationship and so when you&#39;re reading</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.960" end="00:43:00.680" style="s2">Plato&#39;s dialogues Department if you if</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.780" end="00:43:02.900" style="s2">you collapse that into a text then</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.680" end="00:43:05.240" style="s2">you&#39;re not in dialogue with the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.900" end="00:43:06.589" style="s2">that&#39;s right if you can maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.240" end="00:43:08.540" style="s2">dialogue oh so you can now be in</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.589" end="00:43:10.490" style="s2">dialogue with the dialogue and that</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.540" end="00:43:13.099" style="s2">space opens up right and that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.490" end="00:43:14.960" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s in this case with us</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.099" end="00:43:17.810" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit more obvious because</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.960" end="00:43:19.099" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to imagine that there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.810" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">changes going on in you and there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.099" end="00:43:22.220" style="s2">changes going on in me it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:24.290" style="s2">harder to imagine there are changes</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.220" end="00:43:26.580" style="s2">going on in Plato&#39;s dialogue when I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.290" end="00:43:28.680" style="s2">a relationship with it but right</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.580" end="00:43:29.910" style="s2">nonetheless it is the case that it has</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.680" end="00:43:31.230" style="s2">it has the depth to lurk there was</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.910" end="00:43:32.820" style="s2">superb opening I mean people had the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.230" end="00:43:34.470" style="s2">experience that truly rich pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.820" end="00:43:37.320" style="s2">work yeah that&#39;s it right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.470" end="00:43:38.730" style="s2">philosopher and the poet yes yes poetry</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.320" end="00:43:40.260" style="s2">has that characteristic that if I go</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.730" end="00:43:42.150" style="s2">through life if I change through life</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.260" end="00:43:44.400" style="s2">and I will integrate life into myself</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.150" end="00:43:46.470" style="s2">when I come back to a poem that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.400" end="00:43:47.970" style="s2">deeply meaningful it also has changed</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.470" end="00:43:52.440" style="s2">yes yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.970" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve talked about that as what I</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.440" end="00:43:58.800" style="s2">mean by an experience of sacredness that</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:44:02.730" style="s2">ongoing continuity of affordance of</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.800" end="00:44:04.980" style="s2">reciprocal opening so is is part of what</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.730" end="00:44:08.940" style="s2">we&#39;re putting our finger on that is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.980" end="00:44:14.850" style="s2">faith is a cultivated sensitivity to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.940" end="00:44:17.550" style="s2">this kind of richness right yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.850" end="00:44:19.200" style="s2">really yeah that&#39;s very nice so what</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.550" end="00:44:20.730" style="s2">happens is it to me is that I&#39;m holding</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.200" end="00:44:23.160" style="s2">the previous conversation about faith</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.730" end="00:44:25.680" style="s2">right here yes I have like a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.160" end="00:44:30.240" style="s2">very embodied sense of almost a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:33.060" style="s2">practical prosaic element to it like our</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.240" end="00:44:34.320" style="s2">surfer yeah right who in a moment&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.060" end="00:44:38.910" style="s2">gonna come and say hey no dude I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.320" end="00:44:39.510" style="s2">this other thing but then you say what</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.910" end="00:44:41.280" style="s2">you just said</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.510" end="00:44:45.270" style="s2">and so I suddenly see it from a</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.280" end="00:44:46.830" style="s2">different angle and yes very much so yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.270" end="00:44:50.850" style="s2">actually I&#39;m obviously in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.830" end="00:44:54.420" style="s2">obviously right it&#39;s like the the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.850" end="00:44:58.020" style="s2">tracing or following the track the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.420" end="00:45:02.460" style="s2">tasting the the sensing in the flow of</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.020" end="00:45:08.940" style="s2">experience the the we call this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.460" end="00:45:10.680" style="s2">like um the trajectory yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.940" end="00:45:13.080" style="s2">that is this that is the sacred that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.680" end="00:45:15.510" style="s2">the dispositional relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.080" end="00:45:17.370" style="s2">reality that places us on the path right</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.510" end="00:45:19.620" style="s2">that&#39;s the sacred the thing that moves</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.370" end="00:45:25.070" style="s2">us in that direction yes I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.620" end="00:45:27.360" style="s2">that so I&#39;m really interested then in</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.070" end="00:45:28.500" style="s2">back by the way this is what hits me</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.360" end="00:45:29.880" style="s2">with hope so I&#39;d like to try to take a</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.500" end="00:45:31.890" style="s2">shot at her oh let&#39;s take a shot at hope</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.880" end="00:45:32.910" style="s2">then let&#39;s take a shot sorry that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.890" end="00:45:33.150" style="s2">very aggressive I didn&#39;t mean it that</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.910" end="00:45:34.680" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.150" end="00:45:37.840" style="s2">go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.680" end="00:45:40.450" style="s2">III have a very ambivalent attitude</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.840" end="00:45:44.280" style="s2">towards hope part of its my</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.450" end="00:45:47.710" style="s2">fundamentalist upbringing and part of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.280" end="00:45:48.730" style="s2">personal experience both myself and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.710" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">people that have been close to where</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.730" end="00:45:54.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen people trapped in life sucking</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:56.440" style="s2">potentially life destroying</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.190" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">relationships because of hope right yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.440" end="00:46:07.030" style="s2">yes so right so there&#39;s there&#39;s a word</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:08.650" style="s2">in in Buddhism G you&#39;ll know but I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.030" end="00:46:11.020" style="s2">quite recall it I think it starts with</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.650" end="00:46:13.390" style="s2">the sea and essentially a good</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.020" end="00:46:16.560" style="s2">disposition to have mmm like what&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.390" end="00:46:18.820" style="s2">with a nice solid disposition to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.560" end="00:46:24.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not compassion it&#39;s definite not</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.820" end="00:46:26.410" style="s2">complacency you know it&#39;s physically</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.640" end="00:46:28.300" style="s2">this is mmm say this is what hope really</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.410" end="00:46:30.970" style="s2">ought to be it&#39;s physically in a place</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.300" end="00:46:35.140" style="s2">of being very very much in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.970" end="00:46:38.980" style="s2">with what is real right but then</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.140" end="00:46:43.330" style="s2">choosing to orient towards it in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.980" end="00:46:46.300" style="s2">nonreactive stance does it also shift</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.330" end="00:46:48.790" style="s2">things so that choosing to orient in an</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.300" end="00:46:51.580" style="s2">honor like is hope</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.790" end="00:46:54.520" style="s2">I like this I&#39;m get I&#39;m getting a visual</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.580" end="00:46:57.520" style="s2">image like if you sort of got this right</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.520" end="00:46:59.980" style="s2">fluid optimal grip on a complex</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.520" end="00:47:02.500" style="s2">situation and it&#39;s predominantly this</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.980" end="00:47:04.330" style="s2">way but because you actually have you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.500" end="00:47:07.090" style="s2">really in touch you see a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.330" end="00:47:08.890" style="s2">here and that your stance towards it</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.090" end="00:47:11.680" style="s2">might actually afford that possibility</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.890" end="00:47:13.810" style="s2">coming forth is it yes like that yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.680" end="00:47:17.110" style="s2">exactly it and and this is key like</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.810" end="00:47:19.960" style="s2">again is it&#39;s very it&#39;s a adducing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.110" end="00:47:21.940" style="s2">a drawing out if you try to if you try</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.960" end="00:47:24.130" style="s2">to teleport to the end you&#39;re engaging</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.940" end="00:47:26.500" style="s2">in the magical thinking that has often</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.130" end="00:47:32.500" style="s2">has claimed hope yes yes yes very</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.500" end="00:47:35.590" style="s2">different right it&#39;s that notion of one</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.500" end="00:47:37.990" style="s2">no it&#39;s like flow in one day if I if I</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.590" end="00:47:40.750" style="s2">get back on my heels if I second-guess</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.990" end="00:47:43.720" style="s2">myself if I assume the worst</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.750" end="00:47:45.190" style="s2">then I will destabilize my capacity I</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.720" end="00:47:47.040" style="s2">would be out of balance I will no longer</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.190" end="00:47:47.820" style="s2">be able to be in conformity</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.040" end="00:47:50.190" style="s2">and for me with what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.820" end="00:47:52.380" style="s2">happening right right and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.190" end="00:47:54.090" style="s2">something like a again because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.380" end="00:47:58.320" style="s2">in back into the surfing metaphor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.090" end="00:48:00.240" style="s2">the you know if you imagine the surfer</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.320" end="00:48:01.790" style="s2">and the surfer is seeing the spot like</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.240" end="00:48:04.500" style="s2">they see the pocket in the wave breaking</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.790" end="00:48:06.120" style="s2">you might say they hoped themselves into</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.500" end="00:48:08.520" style="s2">the spot right right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.120" end="00:48:10.560" style="s2">combination of exactly two things one is</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.520" end="00:48:12.630" style="s2">holding a dispositional attitude of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.560" end="00:48:15.090" style="s2">fluid balanced relationship with what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.630" end="00:48:16.980" style="s2">in themselves not holding themselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.090" end="00:48:18.930" style="s2">back a big piece of this is not holding</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.980" end="00:48:20.760" style="s2">yourself back right not getting in your</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.930" end="00:48:23.820" style="s2">head not getting angry reactive and</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.760" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">tightening up and then seeking the best</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.820" end="00:48:28.830" style="s2">place to be in or inton yourself towards</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:30.060" style="s2">that best place right like that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.830" end="00:48:31.980" style="s2">those are the few peat components if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.060" end="00:48:34.830" style="s2">have those two components therein lies</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.980" end="00:48:36.750" style="s2">hope now reverse that say let&#39;s imagine</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.830" end="00:48:40.260" style="s2">that&#39;s what Paul was saying and see if</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.750" end="00:48:42.360" style="s2">that actually ends back on faith so he</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.260" end="00:48:46.410" style="s2">says it&#39;s the hope of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.360" end="00:48:48.440" style="s2">not yet seen and I guess it&#39;s it would</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.410" end="00:48:50.900" style="s2">it would MIT it would meet very nicely</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.440" end="00:48:54.570" style="s2">especially if you go into the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.900" end="00:48:56.370" style="s2">Corinthian him towards agape where it</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.570" end="00:48:59.100" style="s2">ends where he&#39;s proposing the most</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.370" end="00:49:03.510" style="s2">excellent way by the way the way of</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.100" end="00:49:06.120" style="s2">agape and then he proposes that in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.510" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">end we will know as we are known he</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.120" end="00:49:12.780" style="s2">proposes a sort of a I suppose it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:14.910" style="s2">culmination a culmination of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.780" end="00:49:17.490" style="s2">participatory knowing we will know as we</p>

<p begin="00:49:19.080" end="00:49:28.590" style="s2">reality and so faith the usual your</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.500" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">metaphor is the hope that sees that as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.590" end="00:49:35.790" style="s2">path as a way as a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:38.370" style="s2">realizable by a committed stance towards</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.790" end="00:49:44.040" style="s2">that possibility yeah that would work</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.370" end="00:49:45.450" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great and that is great and</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.040" end="00:49:47.070" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.450" end="00:49:49.050" style="s2">like okay so let&#39;s just check this out</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.070" end="00:49:53.550" style="s2">now I&#39;m bringing in that Viktor Frankl</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.050" end="00:49:54.660" style="s2">of course it&#39;s great established app</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.550" end="00:50:00.750" style="s2">let&#39;s bring him in bring him in office</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.660" end="00:50:03.720" style="s2">up the sidelines no matter where you are</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.750" end="00:50:05.520" style="s2">there is always hope which is to say no</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.720" end="00:50:07.140" style="s2">matter where you are there is always an</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.520" end="00:50:08.490" style="s2">appropriate dispositional stance in</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.140" end="00:50:11.460" style="s2">relationship to where you are they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.490" end="00:50:13.710" style="s2">oriented towards the best possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.460" end="00:50:16.500" style="s2">where you are yes yes that&#39;s all we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.710" end="00:50:18.630" style="s2">to say right which is a possibility in</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.500" end="00:50:21.330" style="s2">the sense of a potentiality not just</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.630" end="00:50:22.650" style="s2">another biological possibility yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.330" end="00:50:23.880" style="s2">what was interesting about Franco</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.650" end="00:50:26.490" style="s2">because if you remember when he was</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.880" end="00:50:29.490" style="s2">talking about his time in in the camp he</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.490" end="00:50:30.660" style="s2">was very careful to City this goes back</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.490" end="00:50:33.510" style="s2">to what we were talking about the sweet</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.660" end="00:50:34.710" style="s2">spot he was very careful to situate you</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.510" end="00:50:36.690" style="s2">know what he was talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.710" end="00:50:40.680" style="s2">logos by the way logotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.690" end="00:50:42.750" style="s2">idea logos is all connected right was</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.680" end="00:50:45.210" style="s2">right he how he differentiated between</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.750" end="00:50:47.760" style="s2">the two groups that he saw worked able</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.210" end="00:50:50.250" style="s2">to survive in the camps there were the</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.760" end="00:50:51.960" style="s2">people who just gave up of course and</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.250" end="00:50:54.030" style="s2">they but there was people who actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.960" end="00:50:56.190" style="s2">had the magical hope they would say no</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.030" end="00:50:59.640" style="s2">no and they did willful assertion we</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.190" end="00:51:01.530" style="s2">will be liberated on day X I know it I</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.640" end="00:51:04.110" style="s2">know it and then they asked would come</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.530" end="00:51:06.150" style="s2">and of course the liberation will not</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.110" end="00:51:09.390" style="s2">occur and then those people were very</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.150" end="00:51:13.080" style="s2">very quickly fall apart they would fall</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.390" end="00:51:15.480" style="s2">apart so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not an assertion</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.080" end="00:51:17.250" style="s2">right this hope it&#39;s something else it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.480" end="00:51:20.130" style="s2">I like your idea of turning it into a</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.250" end="00:51:22.680" style="s2">verb a verb of orientation and I see it</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.130" end="00:51:24.810" style="s2">almost like the kind of reducing of</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.680" end="00:51:27.240" style="s2">possibilities that then starts to afford</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.810" end="00:51:30.150" style="s2">a very nascent for perhaps constantly</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.240" end="00:51:32.940" style="s2">accelerating reciprocal opening yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.150" end="00:51:34.560" style="s2">think of it like like child the child</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.940" end="00:51:37.290" style="s2">learning how to do something yeah I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.560" end="00:51:39.750" style="s2">learn you had a stand or to walk it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.290" end="00:51:41.690" style="s2">that thing it&#39;s like the the the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.750" end="00:51:43.560" style="s2">of the sense the sense of what the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.690" end="00:51:47.250" style="s2">accomplishment if the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.560" end="00:51:48.960" style="s2">growth is and the the searching of all</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.250" end="00:51:50.400" style="s2">the different you know a child learning</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.960" end="00:51:52.200" style="s2">how to walk like lurching all over the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.400" end="00:51:54.060" style="s2">place but in that space of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.200" end="00:51:56.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a spot over here that is the I</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.060" end="00:51:58.620" style="s2">know that is called walking by the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.850" end="00:52:00.360" style="s2">now we have an integrity in there - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.620" end="00:52:02.700" style="s2">the integration of all the distinct</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.360" end="00:52:05.490" style="s2">aspects itself into an increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.700" end="00:52:08.310" style="s2">coherent whole the achieves a competency</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.490" end="00:52:10.740" style="s2">yeah and hope is the orientation in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.310" end="00:52:11.790" style="s2">direction right the correct by the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.740" end="00:52:13.740" style="s2">it&#39;s very important right it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.790" end="00:52:14.280" style="s2">delusional is a correct awareness of in</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.740" end="00:52:16.080" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.280" end="00:52:19.080" style="s2">the presence and the orientation the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.080" end="00:52:24.300" style="s2">directionality and the proximity towards</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.080" end="00:52:27.570" style="s2">at that location so that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.300" end="00:52:30.390" style="s2">usually call that hope I usually I use</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.570" end="00:52:32.610" style="s2">the term discernment discernment for</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.390" end="00:52:36.690" style="s2">that and a discernment that discloses</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.610" end="00:52:38.390" style="s2">and draws out possibilities and starts</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.690" end="00:52:41.190" style="s2">to actualize those possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.390" end="00:52:46.860" style="s2">precisely because of the way you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.190" end="00:52:51.990" style="s2">oriented towards them so is yeah so it</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.860" end="00:52:53.370" style="s2">seems to me that right um I I just want</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.990" end="00:52:55.320" style="s2">to I just want to emphasize something</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.370" end="00:52:56.970" style="s2">here because I know it&#39;s not happening</p>

<p begin="00:53:05.910" end="00:53:09.120" style="s2">agree that what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.960" end="00:53:11.340" style="s2">reaches deeper than procedural knowing</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.120" end="00:53:12.900" style="s2">it Reese&#39;s into perspectival and</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.340" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">participatory knowing because we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:40.569" style="s2">beginnings of it I think that the I</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.750" end="00:54:42.369" style="s2">think that what we&#39;re doing here I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.569" end="00:54:44.530" style="s2">this is growing in my argument and in my</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.369" end="00:54:48.970" style="s2">mind and I think also with Chris that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.530" end="00:54:51.910" style="s2">what you and I are enacting here is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.970" end="00:54:54.490" style="s2">central piece of how we get to that</p>

<p begin="00:55:09.520" end="00:55:16.000" style="s2">addressing right now I used to think</p>

<p begin="00:55:37.599" end="00:55:42.250" style="s2">the religion of the future would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.280" end="00:55:44.710" style="s2">doing people learning how to commune not</p>

<p begin="00:55:57.790" end="00:56:01.510" style="s2">never minded the conversation I had with</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.710" end="00:56:03.579" style="s2">my friend Brett Weinstein have you ever</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.510" end="00:56:09.630" style="s2">met Brett no I&#39;d like to at some point</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.579" end="00:56:11.950" style="s2">he sees a beautiful beautiful being and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.630" end="00:56:14.859" style="s2">yeah try this this is very nice</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.950" end="00:56:17.049" style="s2">and it came to me as he was talking</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.859" end="00:56:20.260" style="s2">about our conversations I&#39;m particular</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.049" end="00:56:21.549" style="s2">the conversation at the four of us so</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.260" end="00:56:25.930" style="s2">you remember Franklin Roosevelt&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.549" end="00:56:27.549" style="s2">fireside chats yeah of course and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.930" end="00:56:28.270" style="s2">familiar with the phrase the next Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.549" end="00:56:31.480" style="s2">is a saint huh</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.270" end="00:56:35.890" style="s2">I imagine yeah yes okay so Brett has</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.480" end="00:56:37.930" style="s2">proposed campfires campfires not</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.890" end="00:56:39.460" style="s2">fireside chats because campfires are the</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.930" end="00:56:41.860" style="s2">locus of human consciousness it&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.460" end="00:56:44.890" style="s2">we could become a conscious together yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.860" end="00:56:48.190" style="s2">so Brett&#39;s campfire looks like looks</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.890" end="00:56:51.040" style="s2">like our forward dialogue okay but in</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.190" end="00:56:52.300" style="s2">the context of of where we are like so</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.040" end="00:56:57.400" style="s2">imagine a circumstance where you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.300" end="00:57:00.940" style="s2">gathered together for people who engaged</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.400" end="00:57:02.920" style="s2">in a conversation a dialogue over over</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.940" end="00:57:04.570" style="s2">the over the meta-crisis right yep</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.920" end="00:57:07.240" style="s2">where where are we and how might we</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.570" end="00:57:09.900" style="s2">respond to it never a period of an hour</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.240" end="00:57:11.860" style="s2">so they they explore that in dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.900" end="00:57:16.690" style="s2">thoughtful ER carefully</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.860" end="00:57:17.320" style="s2">there&#39;s no equivocation there are as far</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.690" end="00:57:19.180" style="s2">as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.320" end="00:57:23.530" style="s2">don&#39;t bother and they&#39;d be running out</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.180" end="00:57:25.210" style="s2">of time I am we appended on this I</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.530" end="00:57:27.250" style="s2">apologize that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.210" end="00:57:28.600" style="s2">for very strong values and I will</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.250" end="00:57:30.420" style="s2">imagine that you will actually identify</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.600" end="00:57:33.390" style="s2">several more from this kind of a process</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.420" end="00:57:35.050" style="s2">so one piece is that is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.390" end="00:57:36.910" style="s2">transformation of the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.050" end="00:57:38.770" style="s2">themselves the actual out the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.910" end="00:57:41.490" style="s2">they had dialectical process for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.770" end="00:57:45.220" style="s2">people in the in the dialogue yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.490" end="00:57:47.320" style="s2">then there is the the content of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.220" end="00:57:49.000" style="s2">dialogue that which is actually produced</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.320" end="00:57:50.860" style="s2">there for other people who are listening</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.000" end="00:57:52.090" style="s2">much like as you and I talk there are</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.860" end="00:57:54.850" style="s2">things that we say that ours may be</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.090" end="00:57:56.350" style="s2">meaningful in and of themselves but then</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.850" end="00:57:58.120" style="s2">of course there is the the participation</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.350" end="00:58:00.310" style="s2">the engagement in the dialogue meaning</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.120" end="00:58:01.270" style="s2">the dialogue oohs of the participants</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.310" end="00:58:04.000" style="s2">were over the people who are purchased</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.270" end="00:58:06.340" style="s2">or watching the video yeah you know just</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.000" end="00:58:07.360" style="s2">sensing and feeling in themselves and in</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.340" end="00:58:09.070" style="s2">their own bodies coming into</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.360" end="00:58:10.690" style="s2">relationship with dialogue becoming</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.070" end="00:58:13.660" style="s2">capable of dialogue in themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.690" end="00:58:15.430" style="s2">beginning to reconnect with that vital</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.660" end="00:58:17.100" style="s2">fabric that is a total history of human</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.430" end="00:58:19.930" style="s2">consciousness from the first campfires</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.100" end="00:58:21.340" style="s2">being part of that entire arc in full</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.930" end="00:58:24.550" style="s2">seriousness and responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.340" end="00:58:27.070" style="s2">empowerment then the fourth is them</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.550" end="00:58:28.240" style="s2">doing it themselves yes and people all</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.070" end="00:58:29.350" style="s2">over the country people all over the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.240" end="00:58:31.210" style="s2">world choosing to gather around</p>

<p begin="00:58:31.210" end="00:58:35.770" style="s2">relationship to a crisis a real a moment</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.190" end="00:58:37.510" style="s2">where this capacity to do this is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.770" end="00:58:40.330" style="s2">answer to the question yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.510" end="00:58:41.920" style="s2">beautiful yeah I&#39;m a deep agreement with</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.330" end="00:58:45.760" style="s2">this it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been actively</p>
