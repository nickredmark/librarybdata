<p begin="00:04:49.480" end="00:04:55.350" style="s2">understand that&#39;s the nature of horizons</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.870" end="00:04:55.350" style="s2">all right enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.110" end="00:05:05.790" style="s2">it&#39;s its own ecosystem right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.970" end="00:05:08.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a the thing that I the thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.790" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">I&#39;ve been appreciating about these about</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.370" end="00:05:12.120" style="s2">these conversations and what I&#39;m what</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:13.500" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing is that they&#39;re spurring on</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.120" end="00:05:16.050" style="s2">other conversations that are being</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.500" end="00:05:19.410" style="s2">viewed right and there&#39;s there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.050" end="00:05:21.180" style="s2">in which you can see this you know each</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.410" end="00:05:23.340" style="s2">different conversations are being</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.180" end="00:05:27.390" style="s2">pregnant by other ones so you really get</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.340" end="00:05:31.380" style="s2">this sense of a something something</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.390" end="00:05:33.000" style="s2">living or something being created and by</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.380" end="00:05:35.670" style="s2">a lot of different people like for</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.000" end="00:05:38.640" style="s2">example there&#39;s you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.670" end="00:05:41.670" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s Paul van der clay who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.640" end="00:05:44.940" style="s2">a minister right who&#39;s basically kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.670" end="00:05:49.200" style="s2">taking on like really exploring all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.940" end="00:05:51.060" style="s2">these kind of secular ideas right while</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.200" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">from the perspective of being a minister</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.060" end="00:05:56.520" style="s2">and really grappling with them right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:59.130" style="s2">having conversations and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.520" end="00:06:00.990" style="s2">interesting because you know if we look</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.130" end="00:06:03.840" style="s2">at like my understanding of Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.990" end="00:06:06.750" style="s2">notion about like technology is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.840" end="00:06:09.930" style="s2">kind of techno and framing right you</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.750" end="00:06:12.120" style="s2">know Quranic figure out like get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.930" end="00:06:14.990" style="s2">all the background and only like look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.120" end="00:06:17.240" style="s2">the ground and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.990" end="00:06:19.550" style="s2">this happens to be and I think what you</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.240" end="00:06:22.190" style="s2">guys are doing back in the day on on</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.550" end="00:06:25.460" style="s2">YouTube and what we&#39;re doing here is I</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.190" end="00:06:27.140" style="s2">wonder if this is one of the places and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.460" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m curious to hear what you think</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.140" end="00:06:34.790" style="s2">about this um where technology is</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:38.420" style="s2">actually affording write something</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.790" end="00:06:40.520" style="s2">untechnical to come in right so like I</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.420" end="00:06:43.370" style="s2">don&#39;t know anything less technological</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.520" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">than a meandering right conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.370" end="00:06:50.150" style="s2">that goes on for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:51.920" style="s2">right and it&#39;s interesting because well</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.150" end="00:06:53.600" style="s2">one thing is that they&#39;re finding that</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.920" end="00:06:55.580" style="s2">people actually have an attention span</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.600" end="00:06:59.570" style="s2">that they that they didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.580" end="00:07:01.730" style="s2">they had when it was just the network&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.570" end="00:07:03.860" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like the network&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.730" end="00:07:06.080" style="s2">thought we were all kind of stupid okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.860" end="00:07:08.030" style="s2">like you just got these these little</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.080" end="00:07:09.830" style="s2">sound bites of things you know because</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.030" end="00:07:12.170" style="s2">they were different constraint as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.830" end="00:07:15.080" style="s2">but you know you have people like Joe</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.170" end="00:07:19.460" style="s2">Rogan and you know that are doing these</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.080" end="00:07:21.890" style="s2">three-hour long meandering pretty deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.460" end="00:07:23.420" style="s2">you know it&#39;ll actually vast kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.890" end="00:07:27.710" style="s2">conversations and people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.420" end="00:07:32.590" style="s2">tuning in sure well I think what I said</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.710" end="00:07:36.100" style="s2">what all this okay I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.590" end="00:07:39.130" style="s2">yeah so with podcast sort of stuff where</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.100" end="00:07:41.320" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s available for people and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.130" end="00:07:43.600" style="s2">people have longer commute commutes and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.320" end="00:07:46.780" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it as a multitasking and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.600" end="00:07:47.800" style="s2">they may not only could they be doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.780" end="00:07:49.710" style="s2">different things while it&#39;s on in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.800" end="00:07:51.700" style="s2">background and there&#39;s that going on I</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.710" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">think you&#39;re right I mean there is some</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.700" end="00:07:56.139" style="s2">sense of which all of this though is</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:07:57.970" style="s2">elevating the overall expectations for</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.139" end="00:07:59.770" style="s2">kind of engagement but I think as far as</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.970" end="00:08:02.110" style="s2">the height of your stuff you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.770" end="00:08:04.450" style="s2">guess my own sensibility would be that</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.110" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">no I it there really is something very</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.450" end="00:08:08.770" style="s2">insidious about the way that things are</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:11.260" style="s2">being framed and the way I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.770" end="00:08:13.780" style="s2">that the technologies in frame by way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.260" end="00:08:16.930" style="s2">an eight historicism that if you take</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.780" end="00:08:19.500" style="s2">something like let&#39;s take psychology</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.930" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">just as an example you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.500" end="00:08:26.290" style="s2">traditionally anyway you know psychology</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:28.540" style="s2">was something like an experimental and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.290" end="00:08:32.110" style="s2">it&#39;s a body of knowledge but it was it</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.540" end="00:08:34.120" style="s2">was built upon being familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.110" end="00:08:35.469" style="s2">certain thinkers and certain traditions</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.120" end="00:08:37.000" style="s2">and you might say well you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.469" end="00:08:38.620" style="s2">psychoanalytic tradition we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.000" end="00:08:41.020" style="s2">begin with Freud and we&#39;re gonna try to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.620" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">look at how young reacted to Freud and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.020" end="00:08:44.740" style="s2">then we try to understand Lacan wears</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:47.140" style="s2">now I think people say we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.740" end="00:08:49.089" style="s2">time for all that you point to something</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.140" end="00:08:50.770" style="s2">in the brain and unless you can point to</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.089" end="00:08:52.540" style="s2">something in the brain this is all a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.770" end="00:08:54.760" style="s2">bunch of malarkey so I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.540" end="00:08:57.430" style="s2">kind of rampant a historicism that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.760" end="00:08:59.320" style="s2">technologies are introducing partly</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.430" end="00:09:01.150" style="s2">because it&#39;s information overload but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.320" end="00:09:02.890" style="s2">mean I think look at people like Richard</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.150" end="00:09:04.900" style="s2">lambs work and people who&#39;ve done work</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.890" end="00:09:07.510" style="s2">on economics of attention there was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.900" end="00:09:11.650" style="s2">time when what was short or what was</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.510" end="00:09:13.540" style="s2">what was sparse or you know in need was</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.650" end="00:09:15.730" style="s2">information and we had more than enough</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.540" end="00:09:17.290" style="s2">attention and we didn&#39;t know how to you</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.730" end="00:09:17.709" style="s2">know to get the information that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.290" end="00:09:20.260" style="s2">needed</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.709" end="00:09:21.760" style="s2">where&#39;s now there&#39;s an absolute overflow</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.260" end="00:09:25.270" style="s2">of information more than one could ever</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.760" end="00:09:27.880" style="s2">consume and was scarce is attention so</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.270" end="00:09:30.100" style="s2">the information is now in abundance the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.880" end="00:09:33.580" style="s2">attention is scarce and because of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.100" end="00:09:35.820" style="s2">you know those those two things coming</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.580" end="00:09:37.900" style="s2">together have you know they really</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.820" end="00:09:39.970" style="s2">unleashed a kind of rampant a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.900" end="00:09:41.740" style="s2">historicism and there&#39;s other factors as</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.970" end="00:09:43.630" style="s2">well as it has to do with diaspora and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.740" end="00:09:45.740" style="s2">the culture has to do with you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.630" end="00:09:47.330" style="s2">changing ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.740" end="00:09:49.010" style="s2">people are no longer in extended</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.330" end="00:09:50.900" style="s2">families which is parents raising their</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.010" end="00:09:52.280" style="s2">kids rather than grandparents mean I</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.900" end="00:09:53.890" style="s2">think that slows down some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.280" end="00:09:56.330" style="s2">cultural change as well</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.890" end="00:09:58.910" style="s2">but yeah I think I think there it really</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.330" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">is an important issue that you know stem</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.910" end="00:10:02.900" style="s2">is coming back with a vengeance</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:05.990" style="s2">and I think philosophers are</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.900" end="00:10:08.210" style="s2">increasingly gonna be and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.990" end="00:10:09.350" style="s2">you need to invoke Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.210" end="00:10:11.480" style="s2">such a great example where you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.350" end="00:10:13.910" style="s2">people aren&#39;t really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.480" end="00:10:16.790" style="s2">philosophical ideas as much as they are</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.910" end="00:10:18.620" style="s2">in empirical based psychology I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.790" end="00:10:21.230" style="s2">that&#39;s what he Jordan Peterson brings a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.620" end="00:10:23.210" style="s2">lot of empirical based psychology to</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.230" end="00:10:25.460" style="s2">bear on his claims everything from you</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.210" end="00:10:27.770" style="s2">know evolutionary biology but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.460" end="00:10:31.310" style="s2">psychology it&#39;s grounded in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.770" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">empirical studies and so I think classic</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.310" end="00:10:37.300" style="s2">philosophical ideas are giving way to</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:39.680" style="s2">technocratic thought empirically driven</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.300" end="00:10:40.520" style="s2">kind of scientific thought and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:42.260" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.520" end="00:10:44.240" style="s2">I mean maybe really you know important</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.260" end="00:10:47.030" style="s2">for people to be a lot more attuned to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.240" end="00:10:48.440" style="s2">scientific worldview but that&#39;s how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.030" end="00:10:50.510" style="s2">I mean I think for heidegger&#39;s taste</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.440" end="00:10:52.460" style="s2">this would have been a killing of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.510" end="00:10:54.470" style="s2">philosophy and poetry yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.460" end="00:10:58.550" style="s2">philosophy and poetry and the offing</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.470" end="00:11:00.530" style="s2">right now oh yeah totally Oh totally</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.550" end="00:11:03.980" style="s2">well that&#39;s that that&#39;s the one I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.530" end="00:11:06.410" style="s2">one of the things that I&#39;m you know when</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.980" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">I to ever to whatever degree I&#39;m part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.410" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">this right</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.510" end="00:11:13.590" style="s2">the the thing I&#39;m trying to see that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.150" end="00:11:19.740" style="s2">think I&#39;m Avoca</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.590" end="00:11:22.590" style="s2">or attempting to evoke is that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.740" end="00:11:25.590" style="s2">sense of how you call it like that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.590" end="00:11:27.720" style="s2">sense of the way because right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.590" end="00:11:30.060" style="s2">doing a series where I&#39;m with with</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.720" end="00:11:32.040" style="s2">another like a another philosopher um</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.060" end="00:11:33.630" style="s2">we&#39;re going through and reading the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.040" end="00:11:35.970" style="s2">Platonic dialogues straight through</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.630" end="00:11:37.650" style="s2">right and like and then commenting on</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.970" end="00:11:40.050" style="s2">them and you know riffing on them and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.650" end="00:11:43.230" style="s2">bringing different people in and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.050" end="00:11:48.060" style="s2">that sense of where I feel there</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.230" end="00:11:49.950" style="s2">personally indebted um to and I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.060" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">you talk about this as well of like what</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.950" end="00:11:55.830" style="s2">it is to really grapple with a text</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:57.870" style="s2">right and with an author in in that in</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.830" end="00:11:59.910" style="s2">this strange sense where I noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.870" end="00:12:03.150" style="s2">for me cuz I don&#39;t have it I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.910" end="00:12:05.550" style="s2">an academic background um I went to art</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.150" end="00:12:09.390" style="s2">school you know shortly after high</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.550" end="00:12:12.270" style="s2">school and but I got something spoke to</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.390" end="00:12:14.040" style="s2">me and with Heidegger and I used to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.270" end="00:12:15.480" style="s2">know as a poor student so but I used to</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.040" end="00:12:17.400" style="s2">live across the street from Barnes and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.480" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">Noble so no one read the Heidegger book</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.400" end="00:12:22.380" style="s2">so I&#39;d go you know I basically had my</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:23.910" style="s2">own collection and I go there and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.380" end="00:12:26.070" style="s2">would just like get amped up on coffee</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.910" end="00:12:29.580" style="s2">and start reading Heidegger and I&#39;d no</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.070" end="00:12:31.140" style="s2">idea what that sign was for like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.580" end="00:12:35.010" style="s2">know the first three chapters or</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.140" end="00:12:37.680" style="s2">something but there was this this this</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.010" end="00:12:41.070" style="s2">sense this sense that something grabs</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.680" end="00:12:45.450" style="s2">your interest like from some horizon</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.070" end="00:12:47.400" style="s2">opens up and what&#39;s mysterious to me is</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.450" end="00:12:49.860" style="s2">how do I know to be interested by</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.400" end="00:12:53.490" style="s2">something which I find out years later</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.860" end="00:12:55.950" style="s2">right as this whole world that opened up</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.490" end="00:12:58.890" style="s2">but something captures me but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.950" end="00:13:00.660" style="s2">it&#39;s not something I know like I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.890" end="00:13:02.250" style="s2">explain and I think this is some of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.660" end="00:13:04.770" style="s2">danger that you&#39;re talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.250" end="00:13:06.810" style="s2">like the hyper scientism right that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.770" end="00:13:09.450" style="s2">comes up where it&#39;s all the actual right</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.810" end="00:13:11.280" style="s2">we don&#39;t even notice that they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.450" end="00:13:15.930" style="s2">they&#39;re imposing a metaphysics on that</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.280" end="00:13:18.570" style="s2">right right in in a lot of ways but but</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.930" end="00:13:21.000" style="s2">then reap from just grappling by myself</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.570" end="00:13:22.410" style="s2">like trying to figure out what what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.000" end="00:13:26.400" style="s2">actually reading</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.410" end="00:13:27.900" style="s2">was fascinating to me was at the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.400" end="00:13:29.670" style="s2">time I started reading Heidegger is when</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.900" end="00:13:31.770" style="s2">I started this practice called circling</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.670" end="00:13:33.930" style="s2">with a group of my friends in San</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.770" end="00:13:35.940" style="s2">Francisco and I would like read I dagur</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.930" end="00:13:37.770" style="s2">and then I go in circle on the beach</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.940" end="00:13:40.530" style="s2">right we just get around and we just get</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.770" end="00:13:42.300" style="s2">like we just go into what was in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.530" end="00:13:44.640" style="s2">present moment right and we end up in</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.300" end="00:13:46.110" style="s2">all kinds of places which ended up</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.640" end="00:13:47.790" style="s2">becoming something like a practice</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.110" end="00:13:51.540" style="s2">that&#39;s actually like spread throughout</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.790" end="00:13:54.270" style="s2">the world which is fascinating too to</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.540" end="00:13:56.640" style="s2">find myself inside of that but but it</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.270" end="00:13:57.870" style="s2">wasn&#39;t until about three years later and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.640" end="00:13:59.550" style="s2">I didn&#39;t know what the connection was</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.870" end="00:14:01.860" style="s2">between what I was reading and what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.550" end="00:14:03.810" style="s2">was doing and then three years later all</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.860" end="00:14:06.090" style="s2">of a sudden I just kind of opened my</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.810" end="00:14:12.200" style="s2">eyes and I looked around and I started</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.090" end="00:14:14.370" style="s2">to catch the the UM like the grammatical</p>

<p begin="00:14:14.370" end="00:14:18.600" style="s2">right and there were things like</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.720" end="00:14:21.240" style="s2">backgrounds and foregrounds and worlds</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.600" end="00:14:25.460" style="s2">and getting someone&#39;s world and horizons</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.240" end="00:14:32.190" style="s2">and opened up and and I was like oh whoa</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.460" end="00:14:35.100" style="s2">that it gave me a sense of that I had no</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.190" end="00:14:37.320" style="s2">idea that that was bleeding over that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.100" end="00:14:39.450" style="s2">that there was something about reading a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.320" end="00:14:42.150" style="s2">text right and I would imagine this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.450" end="00:14:44.370" style="s2">the way with any any kind of like text</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.150" end="00:14:46.440" style="s2">that&#39;s just beyond your ability to make</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.370" end="00:14:49.290" style="s2">sense of it but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.440" end="00:14:51.780" style="s2">speaking to you and so you read it like</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.290" end="00:14:54.210" style="s2">I would try to grasp Heidegger and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.780" end="00:14:57.390" style="s2">would like have to step so far outside</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.210" end="00:14:59.250" style="s2">of my my frame of reference to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.390" end="00:15:01.260" style="s2">look back to try to attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.250" end="00:15:03.180" style="s2">understand that and I do that over and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.260" end="00:15:05.640" style="s2">over and over again and what I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.180" end="00:15:08.550" style="s2">realize that was happening was it it</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.640" end="00:15:11.730" style="s2">transformed how I saw how I listened</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.550" end="00:15:14.370" style="s2">right on some level that I didn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.730" end="00:15:17.550" style="s2">that&#39;s that that sense of having a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.370" end="00:15:21.060" style="s2">breeding practice or we&#39;re Appling with</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.550" end="00:15:23.820" style="s2">things that are just um outside of our</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.060" end="00:15:26.430" style="s2">own this is a good example to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.820" end="00:15:28.410" style="s2">partly why I like you know I have the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.430" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">luxury so I mean I realized that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.410" end="00:15:32.050" style="s2">not everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:33.970" style="s2">you know I have University Professors so</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.050" end="00:15:35.860" style="s2">I get to work with young people I get to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.970" end="00:15:37.960" style="s2">be in the classroom has probably been</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.860" end="00:15:40.090" style="s2">why I&#39;ve been less inclined to spend</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.960" end="00:15:42.130" style="s2">time on YouTube currently because I do</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.090" end="00:15:43.510" style="s2">have other things to do with my time and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.130" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">I and I prefer the face-to-face with</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.510" end="00:15:46.960" style="s2">students and I really do prefer the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:48.730" style="s2">texts for some of those reasons you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.960" end="00:15:52.510" style="s2">saying you know they won&#39;t so young</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.730" end="00:15:55.210" style="s2">people you know think anybody right when</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.510" end="00:15:58.420" style="s2">you&#39;re when you&#39;re really young you just</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.210" end="00:16:00.460" style="s2">run around and you play you chase things</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.420" end="00:16:02.410" style="s2">and you&#39;re in the woods who&#39;s got stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.460" end="00:16:04.330" style="s2">and you have no idea what&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.410" end="00:16:05.890" style="s2">when puberty sets and all suddenly you</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.330" end="00:16:07.990" style="s2">start finding different things</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.890" end="00:16:09.340" style="s2">interesting and you start changing your</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.990" end="00:16:12.400" style="s2">orientations and there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.340" end="00:16:14.290" style="s2">newfound capacities in your body all</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.400" end="00:16:16.300" style="s2">this kind of stuff and I think something</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.290" end="00:16:19.090" style="s2">similar happens to a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.300" end="00:16:21.820" style="s2">around the age of 20 where or in their</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.090" end="00:16:24.040" style="s2">mid-20s they they don&#39;t see it coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.820" end="00:16:25.450" style="s2">but suddenly they go you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.040" end="00:16:27.760" style="s2">think I might be an intellectual and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.450" end="00:16:29.740" style="s2">they face through a certain engagement</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.760" end="00:16:31.990" style="s2">with particular authors particular texts</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.740" end="00:16:35.740" style="s2">sort of opening the history and they say</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.990" end="00:16:39.160" style="s2">wow you know I actually enjoy thinking I</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.740" end="00:16:41.050" style="s2">enjoy these kind of exercise of my mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.160" end="00:16:43.120" style="s2">of trying to figure out what an author</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.050" end="00:16:46.060" style="s2">means and the kind of distance that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.120" end="00:16:47.170" style="s2">gives me to come back to myself and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.060" end="00:16:49.270" style="s2">yeah I mean I think there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.170" end="00:16:51.550" style="s2">something so about that and I guess I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.270" end="00:16:54.400" style="s2">just wanna real quickly sort of riff on</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.550" end="00:16:56.260" style="s2">that which is you know when people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.400" end="00:16:57.250" style="s2">listening to us if anyone would actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.260" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">be listening to us right now</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.250" end="00:17:03.280" style="s2">you know they in listening they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:06.130" style="s2">of allowing us to think their thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.280" end="00:17:07.750" style="s2">for them that is to really listen is to</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.130" end="00:17:09.990" style="s2">open to the other and let their words</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.750" end="00:17:12.339" style="s2">kind of do the thinking now they can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.990" end="00:17:15.189" style="s2">objecting or agreeing or disagreeing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.339" end="00:17:17.500" style="s2">doing other sort of I guess dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.189" end="00:17:19.180" style="s2">relations of their own thought to it but</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.500" end="00:17:21.850" style="s2">it&#39;s very different than reading when I</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.180" end="00:17:24.670" style="s2">sit down to read the only way for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.850" end="00:17:27.189" style="s2">author to gain a voice is for me to give</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.670" end="00:17:30.340" style="s2">the author the voice that is I have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.189" end="00:17:32.440" style="s2">engage in speech production in order for</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.340" end="00:17:34.680" style="s2">that author to be heard at all so</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.440" end="00:17:37.160" style="s2">there&#39;s an exercise and a growth in</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.680" end="00:17:39.530" style="s2">articulate see like one</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.160" end="00:17:41.950" style="s2">to grow articulate in one&#39;s own speech</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.530" end="00:17:44.380" style="s2">production in order to accurately</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.950" end="00:17:47.630" style="s2">pronounce and to give voice to</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.380" end="00:17:50.600" style="s2">particular text so I think there is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.630" end="00:17:52.790" style="s2">very real disadvantage as people just</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.600" end="00:17:55.370" style="s2">listen to podcasts and as they plug in</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.790" end="00:17:57.710" style="s2">they may be gaining information but they</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.370" end="00:18:00.050" style="s2">may not be exercising the kind of speech</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.710" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">production skills that come along just</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.050" end="00:18:05.210" style="s2">inherently with becoming a reader</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:07.550" style="s2">interesting I&#39;ve never quite made that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.210" end="00:18:10.370" style="s2">connection or that in that next step</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.550" end="00:18:12.410" style="s2">because I&#39;ve I have noticed and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.370" end="00:18:16.510" style="s2">think listening I think listening is</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.410" end="00:18:22.700" style="s2">perhaps the the last the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.510" end="00:18:25.150" style="s2">determinant phenomena right of being</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.700" end="00:18:28.670" style="s2">human that gets very little air time</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.150" end="00:18:32.090" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s so interesting is like</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.670" end="00:18:33.860" style="s2">why are we able to listen to some people</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.090" end="00:18:36.710" style="s2">at certain points and hear what they</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.860" end="00:18:39.020" style="s2">have to say and other points we could</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.710" end="00:18:40.970" style="s2">try as much and to hear what they say</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.020" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">but we just weren&#39;t able to hear it it</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.970" end="00:18:45.950" style="s2">is a fascinating listening you know is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.760" end="00:18:48.350" style="s2">skill it&#39;s a competency but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.950" end="00:18:50.900" style="s2">there&#39;s something like there&#39;s blockers</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.350" end="00:18:52.700" style="s2">or developmental you know things where</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.900" end="00:18:55.430" style="s2">you get the Charlie Brown effect where</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.700" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">the teachers talking you hear why it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.430" end="00:18:59.600" style="s2">you&#39;re listening it just it&#39;s not there</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:00.860" style="s2">you know so there is something about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.600" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">I think you can see it in political</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.860" end="00:19:07.400" style="s2">discourse you know as people are</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:10.820" style="s2">listening they hear selectively and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.400" end="00:19:13.310" style="s2">takes great great effort and real</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.820" end="00:19:17.330" style="s2">concerted attention to try to not just</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.310" end="00:19:18.740" style="s2">filter it into a tunnel and or a silo</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.330" end="00:19:21.020" style="s2">that&#39;s self confirming for their</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.740" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">ideologies in their yeah the vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.020" end="00:19:28.310" style="s2">ego needs to defend itself yeah that in</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:30.110" style="s2">that I think that would you I mean would</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.310" end="00:19:32.180" style="s2">you say that that sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.110" end="00:19:34.130" style="s2">vulnerable ego we need to defend</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.180" end="00:19:36.200" style="s2">themselves is</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.130" end="00:19:37.450" style="s2">is probably one of the ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.200" end="00:19:40.790" style="s2">don&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.450" end="00:19:42.920" style="s2">exactly right cuz you&#39;re right because</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.790" end="00:19:45.500" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed that sense to you of where</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.920" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">and I want to go I want to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.500" end="00:19:51.410" style="s2">this thing he said about the about</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:55.910" style="s2">reading a text right as is like having</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.410" end="00:19:59.660" style="s2">to produce speech in some way is yours</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.910" end="00:20:01.700" style="s2">but it&#39;s not yours so it&#39;s really I get</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.660" end="00:20:03.800" style="s2">this kind of kinesthetic sense about it</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.700" end="00:20:05.570" style="s2">as you&#39;re talking about it really Oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.800" end="00:20:08.060" style="s2">Ponty I mean really Ponte I basically</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.570" end="00:20:10.370" style="s2">become the other as I read them because</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.060" end="00:20:13.910" style="s2">you know I&#39;m sort of wearing the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.370" end="00:20:16.730" style="s2">and I&#39;m I&#39;m walking around in their</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.910" end="00:20:20.770" style="s2">symbolic universe and then it&#39;s becoming</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.730" end="00:20:25.880" style="s2">as I become myself through the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.770" end="00:20:27.470" style="s2">yeah huh it&#39;s so interesting because I</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.880" end="00:20:31.400" style="s2">would imagine there&#39;s that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.470" end="00:20:33.140" style="s2">becoming another is is is you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.400" end="00:20:35.540" style="s2">definitely it seems to be different when</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.140" end="00:20:37.820" style="s2">I when I myself and I put myself in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.540" end="00:20:40.280" style="s2">position and I walk around that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.820" end="00:20:42.580" style="s2">really being you it&#39;s like when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.280" end="00:20:42.580" style="s2">when I</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.070" end="00:20:49.680" style="s2">ib q pi your position so thoroughly that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.620" end="00:20:52.590" style="s2">i begin to have the the background that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.680" end="00:20:54.030" style="s2">you have that allows me to see it</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.590" end="00:20:57.540" style="s2">differently as you would see it</p>

<p begin="00:20:57.540" end="00:21:06.600" style="s2">absence is starts to get at levels of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.330" end="00:21:08.250" style="s2">like identity and but that i think i</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.600" end="00:21:10.110" style="s2">think and i think what i&#39;m what&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.250" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">horizon is we&#39;re talking is just that</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.110" end="00:21:16.230" style="s2">sense of a certain indebtedness i have</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:17.880" style="s2">to that practice of yeah I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.230" end="00:21:19.950" style="s2">figure-ground is a great way to come at</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.880" end="00:21:21.990" style="s2">it yeah when you&#39;re first starting the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.950" end="00:21:24.060" style="s2">author is a figure in your the ground</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.990" end="00:21:25.650" style="s2">and that&#39;s the difficulty of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.060" end="00:21:27.540" style="s2">assimilation is that you&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.650" end="00:21:30.840" style="s2">your own ground but that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.540" end="00:21:32.730" style="s2">assimilate basically you&#39;re not turning</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.840" end="00:21:34.590" style="s2">it into something that you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.730" end="00:21:38.550" style="s2">turning yourself into something that can</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.590" end="00:21:41.100" style="s2">match it this is what we call the law</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.550" end="00:21:44.370" style="s2">requisite variety you know that a system</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.100" end="00:21:46.290" style="s2">can only handle the complexity of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.370" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">system that it would adapt to by being</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.290" end="00:21:51.840" style="s2">is complicated or is internally</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">complexified so I am encountering a text</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.840" end="00:21:56.130" style="s2">I learned to internally complexify</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:58.260" style="s2">myself to be able to meet it by the time</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.130" end="00:22:01.530" style="s2">I&#39;m able to do that it&#39;s become ground</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.260" end="00:22:03.630" style="s2">for me and now I look with the author as</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.530" end="00:22:06.720" style="s2">a lens rather than me looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.630" end="00:22:12.950" style="s2">text man that&#39;s pretty that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.720" end="00:22:12.950" style="s2">quite neat that&#39;s quite deep and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:17.030" style="s2">it just I think I&#39;m getting the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.170" end="00:22:20.210" style="s2">I think what Rebecca would call</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.030" end="00:22:24.890" style="s2">participatory knowing right of that of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.210" end="00:22:27.680" style="s2">that sense and way you know in the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.890" end="00:22:29.420" style="s2">to get at this that I&#39;ve heard expert or</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.680" end="00:22:33.830" style="s2">knowing the way that he talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.420" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">it&#39;s is it David Bentley Hart the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.830" end="00:22:40.910" style="s2">the the modern he&#39;s like a continental</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:44.030" style="s2">theologian and he&#39;s really taking on</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.910" end="00:22:47.090" style="s2">like the the New Atheists he&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.030" end="00:22:49.430" style="s2">funny and in in air getting pompous in</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.090" end="00:22:51.830" style="s2">this kind of cool way but he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.430" end="00:22:54.890" style="s2">you know he so he writes these books and</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.830" end="00:22:56.770" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of arguing with with like you</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.890" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">know the New Atheists and he in he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.770" end="00:23:04.070" style="s2">he&#39;s responding to the claim that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:07.070" style="s2">something about like that arguing about</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.070" end="00:23:09.800" style="s2">whether or not Dawkins can test for</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.070" end="00:23:11.750" style="s2">whether or not there&#39;s a God right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.800" end="00:23:14.980" style="s2">he&#39;s like well okay so here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.750" end="00:23:17.960" style="s2">Dawkins would have to do is he&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.980" end="00:23:19.640" style="s2">he&#39;d have to just probably spend you</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.960" end="00:23:22.130" style="s2">know well you have to go through all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.640" end="00:23:24.740" style="s2">rituals right for months and he&#39;d pray</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.130" end="00:23:26.780" style="s2">and the ceremonies and the rites of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.740" end="00:23:29.780" style="s2">everything that comes with the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.780" end="00:23:33.800" style="s2">rules and fully participate in it for a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.780" end="00:23:37.010" style="s2">couple of years and then we can start to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.800" end="00:23:38.930" style="s2">get at that question there&#39;s that sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.010" end="00:23:41.750" style="s2">where part like in a certain way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.930" end="00:23:43.760" style="s2">you can&#39;t kind of in that I think what</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.750" end="00:23:47.420" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about is that it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.760" end="00:23:51.710" style="s2">it&#39;s that full figure-ground immersion</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.420" end="00:23:53.870" style="s2">right an enactment of both what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.710" end="00:23:55.700" style="s2">foreground but what goes background in</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.870" end="00:23:57.410" style="s2">order for you to an act with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.700" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">foreground that actually brings</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.410" end="00:24:02.720" style="s2">something like presence right the sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:05.480" style="s2">of being something like living and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.720" end="00:24:07.040" style="s2">present I&#39;m just getting that sense as</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.480" end="00:24:09.410" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about like as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.040" end="00:24:12.500" style="s2">talking about reading in some way it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.410" end="00:24:15.020" style="s2">it&#39;s a deeper level of like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.500" end="00:24:17.480" style="s2">just abstract about being informed but</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.020" end="00:24:22.280" style="s2">you&#39;re actually like walking in to</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.480" end="00:24:25.510" style="s2">another&#39;s world and finding yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.280" end="00:24:25.510" style="s2">with a background</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.610" end="00:24:29.929" style="s2">that then you can converse with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.110" end="00:24:31.910" style="s2">author right I remember when I had my</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.929" end="00:24:32.540" style="s2">colleague here Robert Mayberry when he</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.910" end="00:24:35.510" style="s2">was still alive</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.540" end="00:24:37.429" style="s2">and I was in his office and we we would</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.510" end="00:24:39.890" style="s2">regularly meet and talk about books and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.429" end="00:24:41.330" style="s2">get readings together and one day I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.890" end="00:24:43.790" style="s2">in his office I looked at him I said</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.330" end="00:24:45.290" style="s2">Robert what exactly would your mind have</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.790" end="00:24:48.860" style="s2">been like it you&#39;re not learn to read</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.290" end="00:24:50.840" style="s2">and he just laughed out loud and we both</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.860" end="00:24:53.830" style="s2">just sat there and went it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.840" end="00:24:56.510" style="s2">any sense I mean the the borders between</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.830" end="00:24:59.150" style="s2">brains maybe something that&#39;s visible</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.510" end="00:25:01.220" style="s2">but the borders between minds is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.150" end="00:25:03.679" style="s2">minds are much more of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.220" end="00:25:06.679" style="s2">socio-historical dynamic and they have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.679" end="00:25:09.650" style="s2">lot to do with literacy and that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.679" end="00:25:12.590" style="s2">know we&#39;ve become the particular kinds</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.650" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">of minds that we have through all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.590" end="00:25:19.040" style="s2">of technological mediations clocks</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">calendars but the literate word I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.040" end="00:25:24.860" style="s2">that the written word the printed word</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:27.260" style="s2">has shaped our consciousness and opened</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.860" end="00:25:29.510" style="s2">us to history in ways that would we</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.260" end="00:25:31.520" style="s2">would be in like a mythical time rather</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.510" end="00:25:33.260" style="s2">than a historical time and they look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:35.750" style="s2">like something like Foster&#39;s work no</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.260" end="00:25:38.270" style="s2">villain Flusser using a lot of really</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.750" end="00:25:40.190" style="s2">interesting stuff on sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.270" end="00:25:42.200" style="s2">mythical and then the rise of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.190" end="00:25:43.700" style="s2">historic and how right now historical</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.200" end="00:25:46.220" style="s2">consciousness is slowly going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.700" end="00:25:48.590" style="s2">displaced by a new kind of myth and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.220" end="00:25:50.450" style="s2">the image culture you know I mean image</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.590" end="00:25:52.549" style="s2">culture I mean this is you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.450" end="00:25:54.020" style="s2">also I you know Lance Strait has some</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.549" end="00:25:55.880" style="s2">really good stuff on this where you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.020" end="00:25:59.090" style="s2">I think if there&#39;s a concern it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.880" end="00:26:01.549" style="s2">the articulate word the thoughtful word</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.090" end="00:26:04.160" style="s2">is sort of being attacked on two sides</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.549" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">on one side it&#39;s the image and on other</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.160" end="00:26:08.780" style="s2">side it&#39;s the number and so hyper</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:10.549" style="s2">quantitative rationality with everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.780" end="00:26:12.710" style="s2">being reducible to something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.549" end="00:26:14.720" style="s2">quantified and reason about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.710" end="00:26:16.280" style="s2">a mathematical model or it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.720" end="00:26:18.740" style="s2">that you just apprehend through an image</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.280" end="00:26:21.500" style="s2">but the spoken word the articulate word</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.740" end="00:26:25.850" style="s2">is neither of those and you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.500" end="00:26:28.309" style="s2">a depth to the spoken word that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.850" end="00:26:30.740" style="s2">it&#39;s not to deny that we can make</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.309" end="00:26:32.450" style="s2">representations by taking the spoken</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.740" end="00:26:34.070" style="s2">word and calling it the letters on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.450" end="00:26:34.400" style="s2">page and it&#39;s not to deny that we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.070" end="00:26:36.200" style="s2">run</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.400" end="00:26:39.620" style="s2">kinds of numbers about you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.200" end="00:26:40.940" style="s2">statistical normalities and linguistics</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.620" end="00:26:43.460" style="s2">and other kinds of things but it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.940" end="00:26:45.350" style="s2">say isn&#39;t there something that&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.460" end="00:26:48.350" style="s2">let me try to reduce it down to image</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.350" end="00:26:50.990" style="s2">and number I think there is yeah oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.350" end="00:26:52.730" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.990" end="00:26:54.260" style="s2">to it&#39;s trying to read the text through</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.730" end="00:26:56.930" style="s2">like measuring the shape of the letter</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.260" end="00:26:59.660" style="s2">or something right yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.930" end="00:27:02.120" style="s2">exactly you know and it&#39;s I I think you</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.660" end="00:27:03.680" style="s2">know what one can embrace and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.120" end="00:27:07.100" style="s2">the importance of I spend you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.680" end="00:27:08.870" style="s2">importance of you know I think some</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.100" end="00:27:11.210" style="s2">people they need more statistical</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.870" end="00:27:13.330" style="s2">literacy people need basic competencies</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.210" end="00:27:15.740" style="s2">in math they need basic competencies in</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.330" end="00:27:19.070" style="s2">statistical and scientific methodologies</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.740" end="00:27:21.890" style="s2">but that said I am you know I I lament</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.070" end="00:27:23.780" style="s2">the loss of the humanities and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.890" end="00:27:27.080" style="s2">there we could talk about the way that</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.780" end="00:27:28.760" style="s2">this is opening humanity is to larger</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.080" end="00:27:30.680" style="s2">platforms it&#39;s bringing outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.760" end="00:27:33.320" style="s2">Academy and I think that&#39;s true I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.680" end="00:27:35.060" style="s2">you know be very easily to oversimplify</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.320" end="00:27:36.560" style="s2">all of this I think it is very</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.060" end="00:27:38.330" style="s2">complicated and a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.560" end="00:27:40.610" style="s2">levels so it&#39;s probably more of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.330" end="00:27:42.950" style="s2">everything in some way probably more</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.610" end="00:27:44.870" style="s2">poetry more history books more</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.950" end="00:27:46.430" style="s2">philosophy books than ever before have</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.870" end="00:27:48.350" style="s2">been written like right now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.430" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">coming off the shelf so I mean some of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.350" end="00:27:52.010" style="s2">this all you guys on how going to cast</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:55.120" style="s2">the narrative but I think the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.010" end="00:27:58.730" style="s2">slow steady deep appreciation for</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.120" end="00:28:01.730" style="s2">historical thought steeping in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.730" end="00:28:03.590" style="s2">tradition I see that as on the decline</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.730" end="00:28:06.440" style="s2">people just don&#39;t have time for that and</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.590" end="00:28:09.620" style="s2">we live in a world where it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.440" end="00:28:12.530" style="s2">electric media have now they interlocked</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.620" end="00:28:14.510" style="s2">us in such a way that the rate in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.530" end="00:28:16.970" style="s2">pace of life is radically different than</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.510" end="00:28:18.680" style="s2">it was just like 20 25 years ago when I</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.970" end="00:28:20.420" style="s2">was in graduate school it just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.680" end="00:28:21.770" style="s2">seem like like right now you know we</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.420" end="00:28:24.470" style="s2">were talking you know that this</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.770" end="00:28:26.420" style="s2">coronavirus were all on lockdown and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.470" end="00:28:28.520" style="s2">universities I mean it&#39;s almost as if</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.420" end="00:28:30.680" style="s2">they&#39;re expecting us not really but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.520" end="00:28:33.260" style="s2">almost as if they&#39;re expecting us within</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.680" end="00:28:35.930" style="s2">two days to go from all you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.260" end="00:28:38.090" style="s2">face-to-face instruction seamlessly to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.930" end="00:28:40.460" style="s2">an online mode of delivery you want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.090" end="00:28:42.770" style="s2">go a crisis and a pandemic is happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.460" end="00:28:45.950" style="s2">why don&#39;t we take a week off and just</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.770" end="00:28:46.880" style="s2">think about other things like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.950" end="00:28:50.179" style="s2">never gonna be another snow</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.880" end="00:28:53.090" style="s2">you know it used to be when I went to</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.179" end="00:28:54.440" style="s2">school on the day one the professor</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.090" end="00:28:56.389" style="s2">would show up and they would hand out</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.440" end="00:28:57.980" style="s2">the syllabus and you would learn about</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.389" end="00:29:00.740" style="s2">the class and you would go get the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.980" end="00:29:02.539" style="s2">readings after the class now they opened</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.740" end="00:29:04.549" style="s2">the blackboard site before the class</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.539" end="00:29:07.789" style="s2">even begins there&#39;s homework assigned</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.549" end="00:29:10.130" style="s2">for that first day everything is moving</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.789" end="00:29:12.500" style="s2">at an interlocking ringing pace looking</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.130" end="00:29:14.509" style="s2">in the coronavirus how possibly when</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.500" end="00:29:17.889" style="s2">this is spread across the globe before</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.509" end="00:29:22.039" style="s2">mass air travel yeah what thinking years</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.889" end="00:29:26.690" style="s2">yeah Oh totally I mean it&#39;s the airplane</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.039" end="00:29:28.519" style="s2">and the logic of rapid you know biblical</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.690" end="00:29:30.590" style="s2">you know have a business meeting in New</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.519" end="00:29:32.389" style="s2">York and let&#39;s make it back to the end</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.590" end="00:29:34.039" style="s2">of the day you know you&#39;re gonna jet out</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.389" end="00:29:38.330" style="s2">there in the morning and jet back at</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.039" end="00:29:41.419" style="s2">night people you know I think that many</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.330" end="00:29:43.070" style="s2">people they&#39;re stressed they&#39;re anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.419" end="00:29:44.929" style="s2">ridden they don&#39;t know how to live at</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.070" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">this inhuman pace they&#39;re over schedule</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.929" end="00:29:50.600" style="s2">yeah that information overload again</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:52.940" style="s2">that leads itself to a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.600" end="00:29:56.419" style="s2">historicism and it leads itself to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.940" end="00:29:58.309" style="s2">technocratic orientation of learning and</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.419" end="00:30:00.320" style="s2">knowledge itself it&#39;s sort of like what</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.309" end="00:30:01.909" style="s2">do I do with the knowledge like knowing</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.320" end="00:30:03.919" style="s2">and be knowledgeable</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.909" end="00:30:06.429" style="s2">that sounds antiquated we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:09.110" style="s2">recite some poems by her acquaint</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.429" end="00:30:12.440" style="s2">whereas I think now we say well what do</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.110" end="00:30:15.220" style="s2">you do with that yeah yeah in fact let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.440" end="00:30:17.240" style="s2">see I would say it seems increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.220" end="00:30:19.759" style="s2">basically what I&#39;m hearing you say is</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.240" end="00:30:22.340" style="s2">like our sense of temporality is like</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.759" end="00:30:23.360" style="s2">just in the last 25 years is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.340" end="00:30:27.200" style="s2">looking at a very different</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.360" end="00:30:31.370" style="s2">temporalities yes and part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.200" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">funny like I I mean I&#39;m starting to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.370" end="00:30:36.139" style="s2">thoughts for the first time of like oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:38.210" style="s2">this is what my parents used to say when</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.139" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">they talked about like there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.210" end="00:30:41.870" style="s2">that you can appreciate what you have is</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.159" end="00:30:45.230" style="s2">is you&#39;re young great I remember going</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.870" end="00:30:47.389" style="s2">like I wonder if I can or not right like</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.230" end="00:30:50.360" style="s2">it I I&#39;m starting to have some of those</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.389" end="00:30:53.000" style="s2">thoughts of like oh this is what they</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.360" end="00:30:55.909" style="s2">meant there right there would be no way</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.000" end="00:30:59.500" style="s2">to be older when you&#39;re younger like</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.909" end="00:31:01.570" style="s2">older is a very full embodied thing but</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.500" end="00:31:04.360" style="s2">but the sense of what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.570" end="00:31:08.110" style="s2">about just in like 25 years right within</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.360" end="00:31:12.010" style="s2">our generation a radical change in what</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.110" end="00:31:14.710" style="s2">shows up as significant and real in such</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.010" end="00:31:18.190" style="s2">a drastic way which it ain&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.710" end="00:31:19.570" style="s2">used to take hundreds of years right for</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.190" end="00:31:22.059" style="s2">it to happen</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.570" end="00:31:23.740" style="s2">I mean some way really began with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.059" end="00:31:26.409" style="s2">Telegraph The Telegraph</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.740" end="00:31:28.179" style="s2">made possible a separation of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.409" end="00:31:31.980" style="s2">information and transportation it</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.179" end="00:31:34.450" style="s2">created the time zones and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.980" end="00:31:36.610" style="s2">accelerated the ability to exchange</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.450" end="00:31:37.960" style="s2">information created the futures market</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.610" end="00:31:41.620" style="s2">in the stock market I mean there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.960" end="00:31:45.039" style="s2">a whole bunch of ways that since at</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.620" end="00:31:47.530" style="s2">least the 1850s we&#39;ve been living at a</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.039" end="00:31:49.690" style="s2">greater distance from people who lived</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.530" end="00:31:52.179" style="s2">historically and now as you say lent the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.690" end="00:31:54.190" style="s2">last 25 with the digital age as more and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.179" end="00:31:56.830" style="s2">more people are living online they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.190" end="00:32:01.210" style="s2">have time for commutes they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.830" end="00:32:03.280" style="s2">time for things that involve slow</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.210" end="00:32:04.330" style="s2">steeping instead there&#39;s just demand for</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.280" end="00:32:05.950" style="s2">instantaneous and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.330" end="00:32:07.330" style="s2">probably the appeal of podcast I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.950" end="00:32:08.490" style="s2">the podcast is wonderful you can do</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.330" end="00:32:12.190" style="s2">other things while you&#39;re listening</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.490" end="00:32:14.919" style="s2">mm-hmm right right now I&#39;m wondering I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.190" end="00:32:16.990" style="s2">wondering right because this is what</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.919" end="00:32:21.580" style="s2">I&#39;ve been a lot of what I&#39;ve been just</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.990" end="00:32:24.070" style="s2">diving into is is just is I mean I just</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.580" end="00:32:24.640" style="s2">think Heidegger was so prophetic in this</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.070" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">regard</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.640" end="00:32:28.750" style="s2">right about the whole thing about a the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:29.740" style="s2">age of technology and the concealing of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.750" end="00:32:31.659" style="s2">concealment</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.740" end="00:32:34.890" style="s2">right the withdrawal of withdrawing in</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.659" end="00:32:37.750" style="s2">that sense of my understanding is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.890" end="00:32:39.520" style="s2">like the deep humanities and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.750" end="00:32:41.650" style="s2">sitting with something and grappling</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.520" end="00:32:43.510" style="s2">with it and incubating it and being with</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.650" end="00:32:46.740" style="s2">things that you don&#39;t know that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.510" end="00:32:49.510" style="s2">immediately useful or intelligible is</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.740" end="00:32:51.610" style="s2">all about like it&#39;s all about in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.510" end="00:32:54.820" style="s2">certain sense being aware that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.610" end="00:32:59.860" style="s2">something&#39;s concealed right and but yet</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.820" end="00:33:02.140" style="s2">that being that glowing as almost</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.860" end="00:33:05.260" style="s2">virtuous to move towards and that eats</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.140" end="00:33:07.929" style="s2">in order to know that I must become</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.260" end="00:33:10.809" style="s2">someone who could write in drawing on</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.929" end="00:33:12.790" style="s2">that sense of development and character</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.809" end="00:33:15.370" style="s2">that comes through time and call</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.790" end="00:33:17.830" style="s2">elevation in challenge and grappling</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.370" end="00:33:19.570" style="s2">with things and dead ends and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.830" end="00:33:21.880" style="s2">to me that like when you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.570" end="00:33:24.580" style="s2">you to use this phrase like living</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.880" end="00:33:26.770" style="s2">online I&#39;m I really got that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.580" end="00:33:29.350" style="s2">like you&#39;re not just talking about being</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.770" end="00:33:31.510" style="s2">on the computer on the internet there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.350" end="00:33:34.810" style="s2">a way in which this structure of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.510" end="00:33:36.700" style="s2">internet fashions the way that we drive</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.810" end="00:33:40.470" style="s2">down the road and what we choose to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.700" end="00:33:42.910" style="s2">and how we even think our schedule and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.470" end="00:33:45.700" style="s2">right there&#39;s a kind of like the online</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.910" end="00:33:48.940" style="s2">is now kind of on some sense is</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.700" end="00:33:50.410" style="s2">synonymous with the world yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.940" end="00:33:51.880" style="s2">mean I think would you take things like</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.410" end="00:33:54.340" style="s2">relationships you know what what are</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.880" end="00:33:56.410" style="s2">they what&#39;s the impact of people swiping</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.340" end="00:34:00.400" style="s2">right or swipe me and left in their</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.410" end="00:34:02.470" style="s2">determining other picking a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.400" end="00:34:06.610" style="s2">partner you know I think the difference</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.470" end="00:34:09.910" style="s2">between asking how good am I gonna be in</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.590" end="00:34:41.950" style="s2">think some people you&#39;re under</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.179" end="00:34:44.350" style="s2">estimating how it&#39;s about their own</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.950" end="00:34:46.870" style="s2">growth and instead we want to track them</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.350" end="00:34:49.810" style="s2">on a secret or better we think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.870" end="00:34:54.130" style="s2">done we&#39;re fine everyone else you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.810" end="00:34:57.250" style="s2">all we need is more information or some</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.130" end="00:35:02.080" style="s2">some accessible trick or some against or</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.250" end="00:35:03.850" style="s2">secret right right and I said so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.080" end="00:35:05.830" style="s2">it&#39;s when it&#39;s slow that that want that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.850" end="00:35:08.320" style="s2">part down it is kind of like zero in on</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.830" end="00:35:10.210" style="s2">a bit because this is because part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.320" end="00:35:11.560" style="s2">the thing that like Heidegger to go back</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.210" end="00:35:14.770" style="s2">to category what he talked about is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.560" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">the strange things about being in such</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.770" end="00:35:19.480" style="s2">like as you would say a truly dark time</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:22.150" style="s2">is not one in which people are talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.480" end="00:35:25.510" style="s2">about how dark it is right a truly dark</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.150" end="00:35:27.270" style="s2">time is its conceals it&#39;s it&#39;s dark it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.510" end="00:35:30.900" style="s2">dark that it&#39;s dark</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.270" end="00:35:33.330" style="s2">it&#39;s darkened park right so it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.900" end="00:35:36.270" style="s2">the ways that I noticed myself in in</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.330" end="00:35:38.160" style="s2">trying to figure out I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.270" end="00:35:41.100" style="s2">it&#39;s figure out but like trying to feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.160" end="00:35:43.710" style="s2">into what is the best way to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.100" end="00:35:46.590" style="s2">this time that to me isn&#39;t totally</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.710" end="00:35:48.180" style="s2">obvious but I think the hint I&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.590" end="00:35:51.210" style="s2">from Heidegger is when he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.180" end="00:35:54.810" style="s2">like in the saving in in the danger as</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.210" end="00:35:59.790" style="s2">the saving power right and in in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.810" end="00:36:04.710" style="s2">part that that part of responding has to</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.790" end="00:36:06.930" style="s2">do with staying awake I think to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.710" end="00:36:09.750" style="s2">withdrawal of sense or as he would say</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.930" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">it like the withdrawal of being right</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.750" end="00:36:18.330" style="s2">the being discloses itself now in its</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:21.770" style="s2">not being there and and that that kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.330" end="00:36:25.020" style="s2">of continually noticing the utter</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.770" end="00:36:26.940" style="s2">uncanny --mess of this time like so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.020" end="00:36:29.160" style="s2">so for example like if you really kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.940" end="00:36:33.090" style="s2">of look it&#39;s it&#39;s what&#39;s so strange is</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.160" end="00:36:35.460" style="s2">how strew how how not strange things</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.090" end="00:36:38.070" style="s2">occur to people but when you step back</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.460" end="00:36:40.110" style="s2">you&#39;re like for the for example the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.070" end="00:36:43.110" style="s2">dating thing that you just you just</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.110" end="00:36:45.030" style="s2">brought up in my lifetime right and this</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.110" end="00:36:46.920" style="s2">is a huge deal it&#39;s kind of like how</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.030" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">people couple we&#39;ve been doing that for</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.920" end="00:36:50.220" style="s2">like ever</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">right it&#39;s been like probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.220" end="00:36:55.350" style="s2">central thing that human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:57.600" style="s2">done and in a matter of about I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.350" end="00:37:00.300" style="s2">say I noticed this change happen</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.600" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">probably within two to three years when</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.300" end="00:37:04.620" style="s2">I was born and I think we&#39;re the last</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:07.230" style="s2">generation like they have a memory</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.620" end="00:37:10.050" style="s2">before the internet right oh yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.230" end="00:37:11.040" style="s2">my fifties I remember when TV you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.050" end="00:37:14.490" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.040" end="00:37:19.710" style="s2">totally it&#39;s like um I just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.490" end="00:37:22.380" style="s2">lived my life and there was a a a non</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.710" end="00:37:24.300" style="s2">conceptual sense that what would happen</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.380" end="00:37:26.130" style="s2">is that you go out and you live your</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.300" end="00:37:28.680" style="s2">life and somewhere in living your life</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.130" end="00:37:30.270" style="s2">you meet somebody and most likely you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.680" end="00:37:33.870" style="s2">get married and then you&#39;ll have kids</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.270" end="00:37:36.690" style="s2">but it&#39;s all part of the enacting and</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.870" end="00:37:40.260" style="s2">living of your life and that I think was</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.690" end="00:37:44.130" style="s2">probably that that version in some</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.260" end="00:37:46.620" style="s2">form for I don&#39;t know thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.130" end="00:37:52.460" style="s2">or something like that right to various</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.620" end="00:37:56.210" style="s2">degrees to within two years you now</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.460" end="00:37:58.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole separate category called</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.210" end="00:38:03.390" style="s2">like finding your partner going to an</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.980" end="00:38:05.460" style="s2">app yeah this selectivity proc process</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.390" end="00:38:08.250" style="s2">where it&#39;s it&#39;s actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.460" end="00:38:10.980" style="s2">situated in this its own category and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.250" end="00:38:13.310" style="s2">all the stuff about compatibility where</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.980" end="00:38:17.790" style="s2">you show up into a relationship already</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.310" end="00:38:20.100" style="s2">inside of that context of evaluating in</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.790" end="00:38:22.470" style="s2">that that that&#39;s within a few years that</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.100" end="00:38:26.100" style="s2">became the way that you date people</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.470" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">don&#39;t actually have a sense of who you</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.100" end="00:38:31.620" style="s2">partner with is just an out springing of</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:33.810" style="s2">your life it&#39;s now this thing that you</p>

<p begin="00:39:46.920" end="00:39:50.880" style="s2">little truth that people don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.960" end="00:39:53.790" style="s2">admit that not everything can be bought</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.880" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">you know I think capitalism wants to</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.380" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">look at other countries you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.640" end="00:40:35.880" style="s2">historically I mean women were basically</p>

<p begin="00:40:42.210" end="00:40:46.110" style="s2">interesting sort of model and because I</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.520" end="00:40:48.780" style="s2">think in arranged marriages sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.110" end="00:40:50.460" style="s2">sometimes people go well you know I hope</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.780" end="00:40:52.860" style="s2">they picked a good partner for me but</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.460" end="00:40:54.690" style="s2">they learn how to make things work and</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.860" end="00:40:56.790" style="s2">they see the obligation is how to be a</p>

<p begin="00:46:18.830" end="00:46:22.910" style="s2">about this in framing stuff so this was</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.960" end="00:46:25.490" style="s2">about three or four weeks ago I was in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.910" end="00:46:27.230" style="s2">philosophy colloquium on a Sunday it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.490" end="00:46:29.030" style="s2">a psychologist a philosopher and I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.230" end="00:46:30.050" style="s2">from the comm theory area and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.030" end="00:46:32.720" style="s2">talking about artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.050" end="00:46:34.580" style="s2">and the question of you know is it</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.720" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">desirable and how possible it is in</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.580" end="00:46:40.820" style="s2">tosca stuff and in the flyer it had the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:44.270" style="s2">expression you know faster smarter</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.820" end="00:46:46.370" style="s2">sexier younger and maybe immortal you</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.270" end="00:46:49.250" style="s2">know so you know questions about AI and</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.370" end="00:46:50.690" style="s2">what will it cost um and we had quite a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.250" end="00:46:53.540" style="s2">lovely discussion but I think what came</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.690" end="00:46:56.660" style="s2">out of it is we sort of asked what about</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.540" end="00:46:59.660" style="s2">wisdom in the information age like if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.660" end="00:47:01.670" style="s2">would have thrown wiser into that would</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.660" end="00:47:03.860" style="s2">it have worked or what do they just pop</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.670" end="00:47:07.010" style="s2">right out of the frame yeah you know it</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.860" end="00:47:10.430" style="s2">seems as if if we&#39;re gonna say quicker</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.010" end="00:47:13.430" style="s2">and faster and more efficient and does</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.430" end="00:47:15.830" style="s2">this fit with wiser you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.430" end="00:47:17.420" style="s2">people have a tendency to think that as</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.830" end="00:47:21.080" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna get old they&#39;re gonna grow</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.420" end="00:47:23.480" style="s2">wise and I think some people grow wise</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.080" end="00:47:25.580" style="s2">with age but not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.480" end="00:47:28.370" style="s2">I think if some people never have</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.580" end="00:47:30.870" style="s2">humility they will never grow wise a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.370" end="00:47:33.300" style="s2">humility is one of the preconditions for</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.870" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">and that what happens as many people</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.300" end="00:47:38.610" style="s2">they get humbled along the way to age</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:41.700" style="s2">and there&#39;s the opportunities for wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.610" end="00:47:44.280" style="s2">occur there but I think there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.700" end="00:47:47.810" style="s2">of non humility or a kind of error</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.280" end="00:47:51.390" style="s2">against that&#39;s deep in the AI</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.810" end="00:47:53.160" style="s2">orientation that potentially limits</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.390" end="00:47:54.840" style="s2">people&#39;s ability to open the wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.160" end="00:47:56.580" style="s2">the number one for me is death</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.840" end="00:47:58.290" style="s2">acceptance you know I mean I&#39;ve done so</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.580" end="00:47:59.820" style="s2">much stuff on death acceptance I was on</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.290" end="00:48:01.080" style="s2">sabbatical last winter and I just</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.820" end="00:48:02.370" style="s2">finished my most recent book and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.080" end="00:48:05.280" style="s2">really excited it&#39;s gonna be coming out</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.370" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">next year oh yeah yeah it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.280" end="00:48:08.610" style="s2">nothing exists and it&#39;s undeath</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:10.500" style="s2">acceptance but it&#39;s a source of absence</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.610" end="00:48:13.170" style="s2">anon being a little bit Heidegger in</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.500" end="00:48:15.120" style="s2">there but jean-paul Sartre a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.170" end="00:48:18.590" style="s2">Douglas Hardy had listeners stuff I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.120" end="00:48:21.390" style="s2">I really like arty stuff yeah Shirin</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.590" end="00:48:22.650" style="s2">Lynn Margulis enduring saying and doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.390" end="00:48:26.730" style="s2">a lot of stuff on them but I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.650" end="00:48:30.690" style="s2">think you know to me accepting death is</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.730" end="00:48:33.480" style="s2">so is so important you know I saw a Joe</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.690" end="00:48:35.400" style="s2">Rogan and he was talking with I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.480" end="00:48:37.830" style="s2">Brian Greene again there&#39;s the physicist</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.400" end="00:48:41.310" style="s2">it was a great great podcast but at one</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.830" end="00:48:43.800" style="s2">point he asks Brian Greene asked Rogen</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.310" end="00:48:45.960" style="s2">he says you know if they could do like</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.800" end="00:48:47.850" style="s2">Kurzweil would like and do the neural</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.960" end="00:48:51.930" style="s2">net download into an artificial machine</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.850" end="00:48:54.510" style="s2">would you do it and Rogan says well hmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.930" end="00:48:55.620" style="s2">no he says well if you would ask me ten</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.510" end="00:48:57.990" style="s2">years ago I probably would have said yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.620" end="00:49:00.270" style="s2">but now you know I&#39;ve done too many like</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.990" end="00:49:01.590" style="s2">serious psychedelics particularly DMT</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.270" end="00:49:03.720" style="s2">and he goes I want to know what happens</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.590" end="00:49:08.310" style="s2">when the lights go out you know and Part</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.720" end="00:49:09.660" style="s2">B wanted to go very weird how you got</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.310" end="00:49:11.820" style="s2">from the question of would you do the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.660" end="00:49:13.260" style="s2">neural net download to somehow you want</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.820" end="00:49:14.550" style="s2">to know what happens when the light&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.260" end="00:49:17.430" style="s2">gone you know part of me wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.550" end="00:49:20.750" style="s2">where&#39;s the death acceptance because I</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.430" end="00:49:23.460" style="s2">think what happens you know and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.750" end="00:49:24.990" style="s2">there are people who undergo a serious</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.460" end="00:49:27.630" style="s2">psychedelic experience and then they</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.990" end="00:49:29.430" style="s2">experience ego death and then after</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.630" end="00:49:32.040" style="s2">they&#39;ve experienced a reality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.430" end="00:49:33.660" style="s2">beyond their ego it&#39;s easy to slide into</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.040" end="00:49:34.890" style="s2">there must be life after death no that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.660" end="00:49:37.770" style="s2">was you alive em on a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.890" end="00:49:39.900" style="s2">experience I think many people who have</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.770" end="00:49:42.270" style="s2">serious legged Elek experiences if</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.900" end="00:49:44.400" style="s2">people it lends them the ability to grow</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.270" end="00:49:46.170" style="s2">comfortable with death</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:48.359" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s like rogue in its unless</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.170" end="00:49:50.700" style="s2">saying he misidentified his own</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.359" end="00:49:53.400" style="s2">experience but it&#39;s almost like instead</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.700" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">of saying I think the psychedelics have</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.400" end="00:49:58.710" style="s2">so tamed my fear of death that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:50:01.710" style="s2">willing to just see what happens I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.710" end="00:50:03.180" style="s2">scared of it anymore but instead it was</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.710" end="00:50:04.589" style="s2">almost like he was a imagine you were</p>

<p begin="00:50:35.309" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">they&#39;ve covered over that and now</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.109" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">they&#39;re worried about the continuance of</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:42.650" style="s2">this little tiny sack of skin they take</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:46.470" style="s2">of themselves to believe how tragic yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.650" end="00:50:48.900" style="s2">it&#39;s just impoverished so so what was it</p>

<p begin="00:50:58.140" end="00:51:01.819" style="s2">decade but I wrote it over the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.700" end="00:51:06.029" style="s2">sabbatical so I started writing last</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.819" end="00:51:07.980" style="s2">January and I wrote most of it over the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.029" end="00:51:09.239" style="s2">semester then through the summer and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.980" end="00:51:11.730" style="s2">had the chance to you know I&#39;ll do some</p>

<p begin="00:51:30.869" end="00:51:35.519" style="s2">think you know I did do a good number of</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.720" end="00:51:37.589" style="s2">videos on nothing that were you know all</p>

<p begin="00:51:47.009" end="00:51:53.789" style="s2">was fun for me to then take the time to</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.400" end="00:51:56.700" style="s2">really carefully lay out my arguments on</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.789" end="00:51:58.070" style="s2">paper instead of this on the copier on</p>

<p begin="00:54:23.559" end="00:54:27.460" style="s2">inherited a Western tradition which</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.630" end="00:54:29.259" style="s2">tried to make it seem and it partly was</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.460" end="00:54:32.529" style="s2">a religious tradition about sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.259" end="00:54:35.410" style="s2">being excluding non-being</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.529" end="00:54:37.539" style="s2">but the world that we have is a temporal</p>

<p begin="00:55:18.489" end="00:55:23.200" style="s2">like views it from that perspective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.200" end="00:55:28.079" style="s2">just it turns everything on its head in</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.200" end="00:55:33.249" style="s2">this very foreign but rich kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.079" end="00:55:35.200" style="s2">the so quick for you right so so what</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.249" end="00:55:38.529" style="s2">you think what you&#39;re saying right is</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.200" end="00:55:41.319" style="s2">you&#39;re basically saying like no look it</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.529" end="00:55:42.759" style="s2">to say that like you can&#39;t escape the</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.319" end="00:55:45.249" style="s2">nothing problem right is basically</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.759" end="00:55:49.420" style="s2">saying that you can&#39;t escape your being</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.249" end="00:55:51.219" style="s2">and that is really tied to the</p>

<p begin="00:56:01.839" end="00:56:07.359" style="s2">to deal with time and thought and time</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.749" end="00:56:07.900" style="s2">and thought are not a thing they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.359" end="00:56:12.369" style="s2">a thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.900" end="00:56:13.450" style="s2">mine is a kind of relation of past</p>

<p begin="00:56:13.450" end="00:56:18.640" style="s2">but thought is that peculiar kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.390" end="00:56:23.200" style="s2">time which inherently deals with</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.640" end="00:56:24.100" style="s2">non-being yeah okay the hot is that kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.200" end="00:56:26.920" style="s2">of time</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.100" end="00:56:29.110" style="s2">that inherently deals with not being a</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.920" end="00:56:32.080" style="s2">thought that dealt only in actualities</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.110" end="00:56:35.470" style="s2">will be thought at all and in the same</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.080" end="00:56:38.050" style="s2">way that thought in time largely resists</p>

<p begin="00:56:38.050" end="00:56:40.660" style="s2">of reductive science and it&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.730" end="00:56:42.370" style="s2">that you guys have a much more</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.660" end="00:56:44.050" style="s2">complicated science in order to deal</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.370" end="00:56:45.460" style="s2">with problems of time and thought you</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.050" end="00:56:47.590" style="s2">know I think Terence deacons book</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.460" end="00:56:50.440" style="s2">incomplete nature is a great exemplar of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.590" end="00:56:52.750" style="s2">some of this but I think at that point</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.440" end="00:56:54.730" style="s2">if people are going to admit that time</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.750" end="00:56:56.230" style="s2">is very nebulous and thought is very</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.730" end="00:56:57.820" style="s2">nebulous well then of course you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.230" end="00:56:59.710" style="s2">gonna get the problem that nothing is</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.820" end="00:57:02.410" style="s2">going to be is equally nebulous as far</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.710" end="00:57:04.510" style="s2">as time if I say to you I&#39;m real people</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.410" end="00:57:06.220" style="s2">go sure if I go is thought real they go</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.510" end="00:57:07.720" style="s2">sure if I say there&#39;s nothing real to go</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.220" end="00:57:09.610" style="s2">what have you gone crazy you want to go</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.720" end="00:57:15.400" style="s2">look there&#39;s no way to have time without</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.610" end="00:57:16.840" style="s2">man being yeah yeah yeah you know here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.400" end="00:57:19.960" style="s2">one again one of the examples in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.840" end="00:57:22.810" style="s2">book right so I&#39;m there and I look and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.960" end="00:57:25.270" style="s2">see a wine glass on the table and I see</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.810" end="00:57:27.640" style="s2">a dog come over and the dog&#39;s tail is</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.270" end="00:57:31.600" style="s2">wagging back and forth around the glass</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.640" end="00:57:34.210" style="s2">now I can think about the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.600" end="00:57:37.990" style="s2">that glass being spilled so I move it</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.210" end="00:57:40.450" style="s2">away on another shelf the non spilling</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.990" end="00:57:44.620" style="s2">never occurs empirically so thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.450" end="00:57:46.660" style="s2">ability to make the world orderly as it</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.620" end="00:57:48.460" style="s2">is it covers over itself that is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.660" end="00:57:50.560" style="s2">world is the orderly place that it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.460" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">because people avoid going where they</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.560" end="00:57:53.440" style="s2">know they&#39;re not welcome this is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.000" end="00:57:54.490" style="s2">problem with the pandemic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.440" end="00:57:55.180" style="s2">happening right now there are many</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.490" end="00:57:58.420" style="s2">people going</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.180" end="00:58:00.190" style="s2">if we act right now people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.420" end="00:58:01.960" style="s2">think we overreacted because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.190" end="00:58:03.820" style="s2">gonna prevent the spread from happening</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.960" end="00:58:05.020" style="s2">and then once it&#39;s prevented those who</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.820" end="00:58:07.420" style="s2">thought they were overreacting about</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.020" end="00:58:08.500" style="s2">look you overreacted it didn&#39;t spread we</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.420" end="00:58:10.630" style="s2">know they&#39;re overreacting</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.500" end="00:58:18.010" style="s2">wasn&#39;t an overreaction that&#39;s what made</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.630" end="00:58:21.790" style="s2">it not happen exactly yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.010" end="00:58:24.490" style="s2">interesting I also I think bomb talks</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.790" end="00:58:26.680" style="s2">about this right where he really does a</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.490" end="00:58:29.110" style="s2">really good job of just dislodging</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.680" end="00:58:31.570" style="s2">thought from kind of internal</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.110" end="00:58:33.720" style="s2">representations and to imaging that</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.570" end="00:58:37.150" style="s2">looky we don&#39;t we make this weird</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.720" end="00:58:37.690" style="s2">division between objects and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.150" end="00:58:41.980" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.690" end="00:58:44.650" style="s2">like you know that pillow right that</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.980" end="00:58:47.020" style="s2">pillow is accommodating a whole future</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.650" end="00:58:50.350" style="s2">of concerns that aren&#39;t here that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.020" end="00:58:53.170" style="s2">that isn&#39;t an object out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.350" end="00:58:55.480" style="s2">over there that is thinking like</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.170" end="00:58:57.850" style="s2">everything of moved if David Bohm I</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.480" end="00:58:59.410" style="s2">would that&#39;s he&#39;s great on all of this</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.850" end="00:59:01.990" style="s2">and I&#39;m thought as a process</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.410" end="00:59:04.780" style="s2">I&#39;m thought being more like the weather</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.990" end="00:59:07.360" style="s2">and something below direct conscious</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.780" end="00:59:09.100" style="s2">control at least more than we think so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.360" end="00:59:10.840" style="s2">mean we can try to consciously control</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.100" end="00:59:12.880" style="s2">our thought and we kind of consciously</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.840" end="00:59:14.350" style="s2">control our breathing but as soon as we</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.880" end="00:59:15.820" style="s2">forget to do it it just picks up on its</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.350" end="00:59:18.460" style="s2">own autonomous chord whether we want it</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.820" end="00:59:20.410" style="s2">to or not you know you can have thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.460" end="00:59:22.720" style="s2">that you know we wouldn&#39;t ever want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.410" end="00:59:24.490" style="s2">claim responsibility for because they</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.720" end="00:59:26.590" style="s2">just spontaneously crop up there and</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.490" end="00:59:28.330" style="s2">again you see the Eagle function which</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.590" end="00:59:30.540" style="s2">sort of identifying and dis identifying</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.330" end="00:59:34.800" style="s2">with the thoughts that crop up right</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.540" end="00:59:39.240" style="s2">into it so kind of back to death right</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.800" end="00:59:39.240" style="s2">right so when you mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.320" end="00:59:43.970" style="s2">making peace with death right is part</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.230" end="00:59:46.340" style="s2">like I basically hear that is like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.970" end="00:59:48.650" style="s2">most important thing yes that&#39;s wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.340" end="00:59:51.440" style="s2">yeah wisdom begins with death acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.650" end="00:59:54.260" style="s2">right it&#39;s a real humility about who you</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.440" end="00:59:56.660" style="s2">are right so when I accept death I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.260" end="00:59:58.850" style="s2">I don&#39;t think what you&#39;re I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.660" end="01:00:00.760" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is like I accept</p>

<p begin="01:00:47.990" end="01:00:52.760" style="s2">and we have to suffer from those things</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.240" end="01:00:53.240" style="s2">and to realize that we&#39;re all in this</p>

<p begin="01:00:53.240" end="01:00:56.780" style="s2">and his beautiful book by Alfonso Ling</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.520" end="01:00:57.890" style="s2">is called the community of those who</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.780" end="01:00:59.750" style="s2">have nothing in common</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.890" end="01:01:01.760" style="s2">look there&#39;s one community it&#39;s not age</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.750" end="01:01:03.710" style="s2">it&#39;s not nationality it&#39;s not even being</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.760" end="01:01:05.630" style="s2">human is that we&#39;re all dying and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.710" end="01:01:07.940" style="s2">dying together either you accept that</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.630" end="01:01:10.220" style="s2">we&#39;re all dying or you want to live in</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.940" end="01:01:12.080" style="s2">illusion people don&#39;t believe in chosen</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.220" end="01:01:16.040" style="s2">people but they want to believe in</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.080" end="01:01:18.920" style="s2">something like a salvation for them</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.040" end="01:01:22.490" style="s2">rather than seeing it as the struggle</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.920" end="01:01:25.130" style="s2">for justice in this world yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.490" end="01:01:27.770" style="s2">the people they don&#39;t really you know if</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.130" end="01:01:29.660" style="s2">there isn&#39;t gonna be real justice in</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.770" end="01:01:33.290" style="s2">this world there isn&#39;t gonna be justice</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.660" end="01:01:35.960" style="s2">yeah yeah to imagine that you know Skyy</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.290" end="01:01:37.820" style="s2">daddy is gonna make amends for all of it</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.960" end="01:01:39.260" style="s2">right and it&#39;s gonna assure that justice</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.820" end="01:01:41.540" style="s2">are protected so many people</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.260" end="01:01:43.460" style="s2">psychologically they know that this</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.540" end="01:01:45.470" style="s2">world is unjust there are so much</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.460" end="01:01:47.930" style="s2">hardship so much luck to the draw and it</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.470" end="01:01:49.610" style="s2">is horrifying how much some people are</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.930" end="01:01:51.890" style="s2">born not only biologically with</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.610" end="01:01:52.839" style="s2">advantages but socio historically wealth</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.890" end="01:01:55.539" style="s2">all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.839" end="01:01:57.549" style="s2">other people biologically born with a</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.539" end="01:01:59.289" style="s2">disadvantaged body a severely maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.549" end="01:02:01.599" style="s2">disabled body and also in social</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.289" end="01:02:03.640" style="s2">political and I think once we accept</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.599" end="01:02:05.200" style="s2">that and get real about it become adults</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.640" end="01:02:07.299" style="s2">about it we got to do the best we can</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.200" end="01:02:09.249" style="s2">about trying to alleviate all of these</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.299" end="01:02:12.609" style="s2">world problems and not wait for some</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.249" end="01:02:16.180" style="s2">other factor to come and do it by either</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.609" end="01:02:17.739" style="s2">a miracle or by afterlife whatever that</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.180" end="01:02:20.019" style="s2">is so sort of everything&#39;s gonna be fine</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.739" end="01:02:21.609" style="s2">because no matter how bad it was</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.019" end="01:02:23.559" style="s2">God&#39;s gonna make sure they have an</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.609" end="01:02:26.769" style="s2">easier time in heaven or something yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.559" end="01:02:31.619" style="s2">weird story like that yeah that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.769" end="01:02:34.869" style="s2">sense of so there&#39;s a sense of so if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.619" end="01:02:37.119" style="s2">cuz this is this is a I&#39;m son some love</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.869" end="01:02:38.979" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about is closer to us</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.119" end="01:02:40.539" style="s2">than ourselves right it&#39;s like on one</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.979" end="01:02:49.509" style="s2">level what you&#39;re talking about is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.539" end="01:02:53.019" style="s2">most the ontologically grounding</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.509" end="01:02:55.960" style="s2">groundless ground of like before even</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.019" end="01:02:58.569" style="s2">our inauthenticity is about death point</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.960" end="01:03:00.430" style="s2">to this nature of our own death right</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.569" end="01:03:02.650" style="s2">it&#39;s like you can&#39;t quite get out of it</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.430" end="01:03:06.609" style="s2">but in that sense it&#39;s so difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.650" end="01:03:10.539" style="s2">see right when you say death so if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.609" end="01:03:11.589" style="s2">in death acceptance right and I&#39;m living</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.539" end="01:03:13.420" style="s2">in death acceptance</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.589" end="01:03:16.479" style="s2">what is one of the ways that I would</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.420" end="01:03:19.960" style="s2">know I think when you look at another&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.479" end="01:03:21.969" style="s2">face and you see the others face as the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.960" end="01:03:24.759" style="s2">only possible God you could ever repay</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.969" end="01:03:27.130" style="s2">you&#39;re in the right domain I think if</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.759" end="01:03:29.829" style="s2">people say well you know life is a gift</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.130" end="01:03:30.789" style="s2">in repayable and I&#39;m gonna try to give</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.829" end="01:03:32.769" style="s2">it back to God</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.789" end="01:03:35.469" style="s2">I think there&#39;s any way to repay God the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.769" end="01:03:38.950" style="s2">only way that to repay it is to love</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.469" end="01:03:41.469" style="s2">your fellow human being you the earth to</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.950" end="01:03:43.420" style="s2">take care of you know it could be you</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.469" end="01:03:44.349" style="s2">know that our concern about animals I</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.420" end="01:03:47.769" style="s2">mean I think there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.349" end="01:03:49.719" style="s2">horizons but it&#39;s to realize the the</p>

<p begin="01:04:10.540" end="01:04:16.330" style="s2">this is what&#39;s really interesting this</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.610" end="01:04:18.490" style="s2">is kind of this this Anto trans</p>

<p begin="01:04:24.460" end="01:04:28.750" style="s2">say to the in the face of the other and</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.440" end="01:04:32.290" style="s2">like seeing the other as the one the</p>

<p begin="01:04:35.860" end="01:04:40.870" style="s2">but at the same time there is a cut</p>

<p begin="01:09:59.429" end="01:10:04.440" style="s2">such an odd thing you know I think how</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.670" end="01:10:06.570" style="s2">does the death relate to the time and</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.440" end="01:10:09.780" style="s2">thought you know I think one way to say</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.570" end="01:10:12.150" style="s2">it is we&#39;re walking straws as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.780" end="01:10:14.100" style="s2">straws who walk we have a hole on one</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.150" end="01:10:14.790" style="s2">end a hole on the other and life pours</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.100" end="01:10:17.760" style="s2">through us</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.790" end="01:10:20.190" style="s2">we&#39;re not objects we&#39;re straws or</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.760" end="01:10:22.619" style="s2">alimentary canal x&#39; and the river of</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.190" end="01:10:24.179" style="s2">life is flowing through us I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.619" end="01:10:26.460" style="s2">think you&#39;re shedding skin on the</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.179" end="01:10:29.070" style="s2">outside and all the way on the inside as</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.460" end="01:10:31.050" style="s2">well it&#39;s like a straw that sheds both</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.070" end="01:10:33.179" style="s2">its inner and outer layers as it moves</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.050" end="01:10:34.920" style="s2">well there&#39;s a hole cut you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.179" end="01:10:37.110" style="s2">funny I I&#39;m really getting this sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.920" end="01:10:41.699" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting as I&#39;m walking as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.110" end="01:10:43.320" style="s2">I&#39;m walking into on one will about what</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.699" end="01:10:45.270" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about is not you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.320" end="01:10:47.969" style="s2">talking about some new I yeah this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.270" end="01:10:50.820" style="s2">actually phenomenologically more sound</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.969" end="01:10:52.050" style="s2">than the absolute body by drew leader is</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.820" end="01:10:54.239" style="s2">one of the best books on this the a</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.050" end="01:10:56.489" style="s2">fashion body body</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.239" end="01:10:58.080" style="s2">well that that kind of I did I have</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.489" end="01:10:59.310" style="s2">noticed that when I meditate that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.080" end="01:11:02.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.310" end="01:11:08.220" style="s2">that especially sound man sound is</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.220" end="01:11:10.530" style="s2">something like the how when you like</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.220" end="01:11:12.180" style="s2">when you make room for sound like stop</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.530" end="01:11:16.230" style="s2">it that sound is a whole other thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.180" end="01:11:17.310" style="s2">this is one of the things I this is one</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.230" end="01:11:19.080" style="s2">of the things that that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.310" end="01:11:21.420" style="s2">interesting that we&#39;re in a digital</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.080" end="01:11:24.510" style="s2">culture I think a big part of it is</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.420" end="01:11:28.320" style="s2">because we&#39;ve become so visual oriented</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.510" end="01:11:30.150" style="s2">right that it&#39;s hard to imagine and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.320" end="01:11:33.240" style="s2">think you were the guy that got me into</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.150" end="01:11:36.840" style="s2">all Walter Ong man that&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.240" end="01:11:38.580" style="s2">like talk about like get long long is he</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.840" end="01:11:40.290" style="s2">similar a hugger for me in that way</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.580" end="01:11:44.850" style="s2">where you you&#39;re reading it and all of a</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.290" end="01:11:49.470" style="s2">sudden the cube turns where to grok to</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.850" end="01:11:52.470" style="s2">grok what a moment was like in oral but</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.470" end="01:11:54.510" style="s2">like pre pre literate culture and now</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.470" end="01:11:57.060" style="s2">many people would really benefit from</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.510" end="01:11:58.650" style="s2">looking at his chapter called writing</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.060" end="01:12:00.450" style="s2">restructures consciousness from the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.650" end="01:12:01.650" style="s2">orality and literacy book i mean he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.450" end="01:12:04.020" style="s2">got a lot of books and a lot a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.650" end="01:12:05.370" style="s2">stuff but that thing that chapter is</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.020" end="01:12:06.960" style="s2">quite a respite through the forehead</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.370" end="01:12:08.550" style="s2">women who&#39;s never really thought about</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.960" end="01:12:10.530" style="s2">what literacy is and I was affected</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.550" end="01:12:12.720" style="s2">consciousness this way brilliant it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.530" end="01:12:14.910" style="s2">amazing it&#39;s amazing it&#39;s kind of like I</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.720" end="01:12:17.100" style="s2">mean even just the sense of just just</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.910" end="01:12:19.520" style="s2">the sense that I can abstract out a</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.100" end="01:12:22.710" style="s2">sense of an autobiographical self</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.520" end="01:12:24.900" style="s2">independent like it I don&#39;t even know if</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.710" end="01:12:27.510" style="s2">that was possible until there was</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.900" end="01:12:30.070" style="s2">literacy you know hey well we definitely</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.510" end="01:12:32.070" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have had the</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.070" end="01:12:35.290" style="s2">we definitely wouldn&#39;t have had the</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.070" end="01:12:37.960" style="s2">capacity to tolerate the novelty right</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.290" end="01:12:39.940" style="s2">because so much was embedded into into</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.960" end="01:12:46.480" style="s2">these rhythms and stuff like that right</p>

<p begin="01:13:41.580" end="01:13:45.390" style="s2">this is actually kind of how I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.440" end="01:13:48.660" style="s2">during this time why there&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.390" end="01:13:52.740" style="s2">thing called circling that I do I</p>

<p begin="01:14:00.260" end="01:14:03.600" style="s2">there are so many different ways and</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.550" end="01:14:06.900" style="s2">this is one of things I wanted to ask</p>

<p begin="01:14:06.900" end="01:14:12.890" style="s2">I think before I think the moment was</p>

<p begin="01:14:12.890" end="01:14:17.190" style="s2">before the answering machine</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.180" end="01:14:18.570" style="s2">i as far as I can tell and I think the</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.190" end="01:14:20.670" style="s2">printing press and reading and</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.570" end="01:14:23.070" style="s2">newspapers and and all that is is a</p>

<p begin="01:14:23.070" end="01:14:27.600" style="s2">I wanted to have a neck like an invert</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.170" end="01:14:29.220" style="s2">like an informational exchange I always</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.600" end="01:14:31.500" style="s2">would at least it would have had to cold</p>

<p begin="01:14:31.500" end="01:14:39.990" style="s2">like and in that in in that that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.070" end="01:14:41.670" style="s2">facing each other and talking and</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.990" end="01:14:43.710" style="s2">confronting other innocent all the</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.670" end="01:14:46.020" style="s2">ambiguity and the risk that comes with</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.710" end="01:14:50.070" style="s2">that right it&#39;s inherently uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.020" end="01:14:53.640" style="s2">right but life was such a way that in</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.070" end="01:14:56.280" style="s2">order to do that I had to go through or</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.640" end="01:14:58.320" style="s2">that relational events with people he</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.280" end="01:15:00.960" style="s2">was just embedded in everything that we</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.320" end="01:15:02.960" style="s2">did and then the answering machine I</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.960" end="01:15:06.690" style="s2">think was the beginning of it and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.960" end="01:15:09.890" style="s2">email and texting and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.690" end="01:15:12.690" style="s2">you introduced this division right where</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.890" end="01:15:14.730" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.690" end="01:15:17.699" style="s2">having to call you up and go through the</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.730" end="01:15:20.460" style="s2">this this coordinated participatory</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.699" end="01:15:24.090" style="s2">thing which in some level is what what</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.460" end="01:15:28.739" style="s2">shaped myself understanding those</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.090" end="01:15:31.230" style="s2">interactions right are so crucial now</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.739" end="01:15:34.020" style="s2">there&#39;s all these divisions where people</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.230" end="01:15:38.219" style="s2">actually don&#39;t don&#39;t have to go through</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.020" end="01:15:40.500" style="s2">that coordinated activity and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.219" end="01:15:45.140" style="s2">just this instant exchange to where</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.500" end="01:15:48.270" style="s2">events our in this generation events are</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.140" end="01:15:52.260" style="s2">textual exchanges people like kids get</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.270" end="01:15:54.750" style="s2">together and they like they&#39;ll text each</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.260" end="01:15:57.420" style="s2">other or sometimes on the text and</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.750" end="01:16:00.810" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s real right and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.420" end="01:16:02.910" style="s2">interactions Audion interactions and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.810" end="01:16:06.830" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of self concealing</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.910" end="01:16:06.830" style="s2">sense about it and I&#39;m just curious what</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.250" end="01:16:16.140" style="s2">what is that what is what&#39;s what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.330" end="01:16:18.390" style="s2">what&#39;s it doing that for that the what</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.140" end="01:16:20.219" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s your sense of that like</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.390" end="01:16:26.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things going on there</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.219" end="01:16:27.960" style="s2">you know it&#39;s Alfred should has a</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.250" end="01:16:29.640" style="s2">concept called growing older together</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.960" end="01:16:32.070" style="s2">you know and he was one of the early</p>

<p begin="01:16:32.070" end="01:16:36.360" style="s2">he became instrumental to the social</p>

<p begin="01:16:36.360" end="01:16:40.800" style="s2">this notion of growing older together he</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.010" end="01:16:42.890" style="s2">would say that there&#39;s a privileged kind</p>

<p begin="01:17:14.730" end="01:17:19.739" style="s2">also even feeds into I think senses of</p>

<p begin="01:19:54.150" end="01:19:59.640" style="s2">filtering into this though is that they</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.370" end="01:20:02.930" style="s2">have by the time they&#39;re 15 or 16 they</p>

<p begin="01:20:11.840" end="01:20:16.080" style="s2">representations of relationships where</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.920" end="01:20:17.700" style="s2">they again goes from the person being</p>

<p begin="01:20:17.700" end="01:20:20.970" style="s2">complex relationships and it all goes</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.320" end="01:20:22.650" style="s2">down about a two-hour thing and they</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.970" end="01:20:24.240" style="s2">consume so many thousands of hours of</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.650" end="01:20:26.880" style="s2">that and now they have expectations</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.240" end="01:20:28.560" style="s2">about the relationships you know that</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.880" end="01:20:30.840" style="s2">they imagine that they&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.560" end="01:20:33.090" style="s2">unfold like the happily ever after</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.840" end="01:20:35.160" style="s2">stories or the the kind of complexity</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.090" end="01:20:37.110" style="s2">and then even like you leave they go on</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.160" end="01:20:39.360" style="s2">TV they&#39;re gonna watch like some sitcom</p>

<p begin="01:21:45.000" end="01:21:48.750" style="s2">could literally like that I think this</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.220" end="01:21:51.240" style="s2">is the first time in history where all</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.750" end="01:21:52.470" style="s2">you need is basically a computer and</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.240" end="01:21:55.320" style="s2">internet connection and maybe an</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.470" end="01:21:57.780" style="s2">apartment and you could you could like</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.320" end="01:22:01.200" style="s2">start a company you could become like</p>

<p begin="01:22:01.200" end="01:22:06.890" style="s2">videos you could be and never have to</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.890" end="01:22:11.430" style="s2">ever come in contact with another person</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.890" end="01:22:13.380" style="s2">right this uh there&#39;s just something</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.430" end="01:22:14.910" style="s2">about like I kind of when I kind of step</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.380" end="01:22:17.730" style="s2">back from that and I just kind of sense</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.910" end="01:22:20.490" style="s2">the whole of it like what is that sense</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.730" end="01:22:23.010" style="s2">I mean is it is it have to do with this</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.490" end="01:22:27.900" style="s2">kind of bubbles bubble that happened</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.010" end="01:22:29.040" style="s2">with with literacy training one way to</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.900" end="01:22:31.200" style="s2">come in it would be something like this</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.040" end="01:22:33.360" style="s2">that and I should probably go soon maybe</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.200" end="01:22:35.820" style="s2">will come because this is gonna be like</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.360" end="01:22:37.470" style="s2">an endless conversation but I think it</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.820" end="01:22:39.840" style="s2">would be just a Pandora&#39;s box here but I</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.470" end="01:22:42.750" style="s2">mean I think it&#39;s some way you know the</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.840" end="01:22:44.820" style="s2">human being is that organism that part</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.750" end="01:22:47.250" style="s2">of nature which specialized in math</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.820" end="01:22:50.550" style="s2">specialization that was our specialty</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.250" end="01:22:53.760" style="s2">that is we don&#39;t have any particular</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.550" end="01:22:58.740" style="s2">ecological niche that were embedded in</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.760" end="01:23:01.980" style="s2">we have wide dietary practices you ask</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.740" end="01:23:03.480" style="s2">what is the mating ritual of the human</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.980" end="01:23:05.640" style="s2">well it depends upon what culture you go</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.480" end="01:23:08.310" style="s2">to you can&#39;t just do again this is huge</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.640" end="01:23:09.960" style="s2">wide and openness and in some way you</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.310" end="01:23:13.740" style="s2">might say that you know it&#39;s almost as</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.960" end="01:23:15.990" style="s2">if nature experimented with opening up</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.740" end="01:23:18.720" style="s2">ranges of the experience of freedom and</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.990" end="01:23:21.300" style="s2">agency at a certain place in you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.720" end="01:23:24.330" style="s2">like and we&#39;re we&#39;re that and in some</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.300" end="01:23:26.280" style="s2">way you can see it that this organism is</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.330" end="01:23:28.320" style="s2">not going to stop thrashing around until</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.280" end="01:23:29.940" style="s2">it figures out a way to hide or you get</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.320" end="01:23:31.680" style="s2">out of the agency that&#39;s been sentenced</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.940" end="01:23:33.690" style="s2">to and it wants to create a social</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.680" end="01:23:35.340" style="s2">determinism to make up for the loss of</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.690" end="01:23:36.930" style="s2">the biological determinism and most</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.340" end="01:23:38.700" style="s2">other organism sort of like locked into</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.930" end="01:23:41.610" style="s2">so that they don&#39;t have to experience</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.700" end="01:23:44.160" style="s2">conscience and choice and the agony of</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.610" end="01:23:48.170" style="s2">you know decision making but there is</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.160" end="01:23:50.820" style="s2">that other extreme of those capacitated</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.170" end="01:23:51.989" style="s2">agencies through technologies they</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.820" end="01:23:53.999" style="s2">afford greater</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.989" end="01:23:56.369" style="s2">trol at the push of a button and so you</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.999" end="01:23:59.010" style="s2">can sort of see in some way this this</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.369" end="01:24:01.559" style="s2">thrashing about in the free space and</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.010" end="01:24:03.710" style="s2">nature is trying to maximize its power</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.559" end="01:24:05.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s reaching its range and</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.710" end="01:24:08.340" style="s2">insufficiency while simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.880" end="01:24:10.920" style="s2">trying to get out of it and you can sort</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.340" end="01:24:13.409" style="s2">of imagine a kind of determinism of an</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.920" end="01:24:20.280" style="s2">agency wedding together in the strangest</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.409" end="01:24:21.690" style="s2">of ways man totally totally</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.280" end="01:24:23.340" style="s2">I really like the way that you put that</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.690" end="01:24:24.780" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be I&#39;m gonna be thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.340" end="01:24:27.239" style="s2">that those are all the kind of thought</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.780" end="01:24:29.849" style="s2">these open horizons have just been kind</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.239" end="01:24:32.699" style="s2">of wiggling through as I walk around and</p>
