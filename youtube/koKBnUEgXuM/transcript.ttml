<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">podcast livestream I am here with dr.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.929" end="00:00:19.650" style="s2">Heather hi as always and we are ready to</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:21.810" style="s2">chat about some very interesting topics</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.650" end="00:00:25.529" style="s2">this week do we have any business that</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.810" end="00:00:27.390" style="s2">needs to be covered up front not that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.529" end="00:00:28.590" style="s2">remember right now yes I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.390" end="00:00:30.119" style="s2">recall any business either we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.590" end="00:00:33.390" style="s2">slightly thrown we are seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.119" end="00:00:36.899" style="s2">brand-new kind of error on our live</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.390" end="00:00:39.600" style="s2">stream where are apparently happening</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.899" end="00:00:41.670" style="s2">and we cannot see them for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.600" end="00:00:43.379" style="s2">no matter how we link up to the channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.670" end="00:00:44.550" style="s2">but for the moment it doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.379" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">interfering with our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.550" end="00:00:50.149" style="s2">broadcast so we&#39;re going to go as usual</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:56.280" style="s2">and hope that that clears up as normal</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.149" end="00:00:57.660" style="s2">alright so where shall we start why</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:01:00.510" style="s2">don&#39;t you start with what you had in</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.660" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">mind all right let us talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.510" end="00:01:05.760" style="s2">fact that for many weeks in fact since</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:07.590" style="s2">the beginning of this crisis the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.760" end="00:01:10.710" style="s2">question of herd immunity has been</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.590" end="00:01:13.010" style="s2">central to many people&#39;s thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.710" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">I&#39;m watching something unfold over</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.010" end="00:01:20.580" style="s2">social media where the consensus around</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:23.070" style="s2">the accessibility of herd immunity as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.580" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">solution to the kovat 19:00 crisis seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.070" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">to be evaporating and I think it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:29.369" style="s2">time that it did so just say that again</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.299" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">what is evaporating the consensus that</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.369" end="00:01:34.740" style="s2">herd immunity is actually the the road</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:36.689" style="s2">out of this crisis for us is evaporating</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.740" end="00:01:40.079" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s evaporating around</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.689" end="00:01:43.500" style="s2">several different concepts one the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.079" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">information that once sick with SARS</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.500" end="00:01:49.829" style="s2">Cove - one is immune going forward has</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:51.270" style="s2">not emerged it&#39;s still probable that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.829" end="00:01:54.710" style="s2">that is the case but we really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.270" end="00:01:58.469" style="s2">know that it is the case and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.710" end="00:02:00.570" style="s2">gambling on herd immunity is a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.469" end="00:02:04.439" style="s2">because it&#39;s quite possible that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.570" end="00:02:05.700" style="s2">who had this virus are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.439" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">vulnerable in the future and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.700" end="00:02:08.700" style="s2">herd immunity is not even a thing of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:09.959" style="s2">course without the ability to time</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.700" end="00:02:11.640" style="s2">travel this always would have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.959" end="00:02:14.310" style="s2">impossible to know at this point right</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.640" end="00:02:15.959" style="s2">that there&#39;s just no way to know whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.310" end="00:02:18.690" style="s2">those who have been exposed and have</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.959" end="00:02:22.590" style="s2">antibodies now will in a year six months</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.690" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">six years any of those things yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.590" end="00:02:27.690" style="s2">there&#39;s that and then I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.959" end="00:02:29.629" style="s2">conflation that in fact herd immunity is</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.690" end="00:02:33.269" style="s2">desirable if it is achieved through</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.629" end="00:02:35.550" style="s2">vaccine and in fact that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.269" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">what a vaccine does it creates a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.550" end="00:02:42.360" style="s2">herd immunity without illness so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:45.870" style="s2">people have been thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.360" end="00:02:47.940" style="s2">emerging naturally and in fact in places</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.870" end="00:02:50.340" style="s2">like Britain they have experimented with</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.940" end="00:02:52.349" style="s2">it at the level of policy but I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:53.790" style="s2">and they and I think effectively that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.349" end="00:02:56.370" style="s2">was what was being experimented with in</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.790" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">Sweden as well which as we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.370" end="00:03:03.170" style="s2">a couple of livestreams ago the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:07.140" style="s2">and Sweden versus their close neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.170" end="00:03:11.030" style="s2">were are quite a bit higher or something</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.140" end="00:03:13.590" style="s2">like six to nine times higher per capita</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.030" end="00:03:17.159" style="s2">I believe was the analysis that I had</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.590" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">done than in neighboring Norway I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.159" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">it was right so in any case it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:25.409" style="s2">interesting that the the collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:28.290" style="s2">wisdom around where we are and what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.409" end="00:03:31.650" style="s2">road out looks like is changing but at</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.290" end="00:03:35.340" style="s2">the same time we&#39;re watching a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.650" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">obvious fragmentation of our collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.340" end="00:03:39.060" style="s2">will to fight this together I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:41.849" style="s2">have two factions we have a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.060" end="00:03:45.000" style="s2">people pushing the idea that it is time</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.849" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">to open things back up because well I</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.000" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">think they would most specifically name</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:53.970" style="s2">the economic concerns but they appear</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:57.930" style="s2">those who are pushing the open it back</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.970" end="00:04:01.470" style="s2">up now narrative appear to have no</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.930" end="00:04:05.730" style="s2">awareness about how much danger we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.470" end="00:04:07.739" style="s2">in and how many unknowns remain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.730" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">really easy to want simple binary</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.739" end="00:04:12.599" style="s2">solutions right and this is we&#39;ve raised</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:16.530" style="s2">this before a number of times but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.599" end="00:04:18.750" style="s2">it&#39;s in some ways a strange it might</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.530" end="00:04:21.720" style="s2">appear to be a strange position for us</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.750" end="00:04:23.850" style="s2">to be in as people who have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.720" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">the binary or strongly by</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.850" end="00:04:30.270" style="s2">nature of the sex and gender</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:32.100" style="s2">respectively but in general in complex</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.270" end="00:04:35.160" style="s2">systems you don&#39;t have clear binaries</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.100" end="00:04:39.210" style="s2">with clear boundaries between the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.160" end="00:04:42.660" style="s2">categories and certainly you know many</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.210" end="00:04:45.690" style="s2">weeks ago and with growing loudness now</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.660" end="00:04:46.350" style="s2">there are calls to just open it up</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.690" end="00:04:48.180" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.350" end="00:04:49.620" style="s2">and just tell us what the predictions</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.180" end="00:04:51.030" style="s2">are just tell us what&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.620" end="00:04:53.250" style="s2">well we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.030" end="00:05:00.360" style="s2">happen this is exactly the point this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.250" end="00:05:01.500" style="s2">this is a a cat a new cat to the show</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.360" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">actually I think this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.500" end="00:05:08.850" style="s2">others this virus has no history with</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:12.630" style="s2">humans before six or eight months ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.850" end="00:05:13.890" style="s2">and so we do not know how it is going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.630" end="00:05:15.000" style="s2">continue to change and in fact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.890" end="00:05:19.800" style="s2">one of the things we&#39;ll be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.000" end="00:05:21.630" style="s2">here today yeah so we have to I think we</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.800" end="00:05:24.630" style="s2">have to separate between two things I</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.630" end="00:05:26.640" style="s2">think we have to separate between the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.630" end="00:05:36.060" style="s2">binary maybe it&#39;s three things the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.640" end="00:05:39.780" style="s2">binary the bimodal and the complex that</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.060" end="00:05:41.340" style="s2">nets to some sort of a binary choice so</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.780" end="00:05:44.730" style="s2">the problem is we do have a binary</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.340" end="00:05:47.010" style="s2">choice in some sense between two kinds</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.730" end="00:05:49.310" style="s2">of policy there&#39;s one kind of policy</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.010" end="00:05:52.170" style="s2">that airs in the direction of caution of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.310" end="00:05:54.060" style="s2">medical caution epidemiological caution</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.170" end="00:05:57.330" style="s2">on the basis of what we do not yet know</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.060" end="00:06:00.150" style="s2">and the hazards that might lurk and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.330" end="00:06:05.610" style="s2">there is another policy approach which</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.150" end="00:06:08.310" style="s2">basically says well there is a cost to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.610" end="00:06:10.680" style="s2">remaining on lockdown in socially</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.310" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">distanced and there is a cost to opening</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.680" end="00:06:15.810" style="s2">back up and we think we know that it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">certainly better for everyone if we just</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.810" end="00:06:19.590" style="s2">open it back up and there&#39;s a naive</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:19.830" style="s2">version of that which is this isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.590" end="00:06:22.050" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.830" end="00:06:24.060" style="s2">and there is a sophisticated version</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.050" end="00:06:25.080" style="s2">which sounds more like you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.060" end="00:06:26.790" style="s2">people are going to die from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.080" end="00:06:30.600" style="s2">depression that&#39;s coming to and we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.790" end="00:06:35.100" style="s2">to compare these two but the real</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.600" end="00:06:36.630" style="s2">question I think is how I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.100" end="00:06:38.610" style="s2">our discussion is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.630" end="00:06:41.460" style="s2">good our collective discussion is any</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.610" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">good yet there&#39;s there are points here</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.460" end="00:06:46.320" style="s2">which I know we need to be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">that we are not talking about I have yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.320" end="00:06:52.230" style="s2">to hear them anywhere and I know that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:53.790" style="s2">rich discussion that is a non polarized</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.230" end="00:06:55.860" style="s2">discussion a discussion in which we all</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.790" end="00:06:58.790" style="s2">arrived with the intent to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.860" end="00:07:02.670" style="s2">what is best for us and us could mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.790" end="00:07:06.470" style="s2">Americans better if it means citizens of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.670" end="00:07:08.790" style="s2">the world but we could be having an</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.470" end="00:07:11.430" style="s2">important dialogue but the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.790" end="00:07:12.750" style="s2">this tendency for things to become</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.270" end="00:07:18.630" style="s2">the proper discussion about well what do</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.160" end="00:07:21.750" style="s2">we actually know about where we are and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.630" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">what does it imply so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.750" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">questions that I keep waiting to hear</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:32.970" style="s2">emerge I hope it catches on from here I</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:35.040" style="s2">guess is if you open things back up you</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.970" end="00:07:36.090" style="s2">will create more infection unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.040" end="00:07:38.970" style="s2">one of these people who believes that</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.090" end="00:07:41.670" style="s2">this is not a real thing those people</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.970" end="00:07:43.830" style="s2">are crazy as far as I can tell but but</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.670" end="00:07:47.090" style="s2">just to be clear the this isn&#39;t even a</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.090" end="00:07:52.500" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s real but I don&#39;t know where it</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.520" end="00:07:54.030" style="s2">came from or I think it came from this</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.500" end="00:07:58.050" style="s2">or you know there are a number of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.030" end="00:08:01.410" style="s2">hypotheses over in the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.050" end="00:08:03.270" style="s2">narrative looks like a cover story or is</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.410" end="00:08:05.100" style="s2">at least covering the fact that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.270" end="00:08:07.020" style="s2">really know and there&#39;s a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.100" end="00:08:08.070" style="s2">possible hypothesis space and there</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.020" end="00:08:11.570" style="s2">which we&#39;ve talked about a number of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.070" end="00:08:14.190" style="s2">times here but at the far end of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.570" end="00:08:16.110" style="s2">possibility space is this isn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.190" end="00:08:19.500" style="s2">real have you even met anyone who has</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.110" end="00:08:21.330" style="s2">come down with 19 right and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.500" end="00:08:24.930" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way I think we always</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.330" end="00:08:28.260" style="s2">have to leave a category for what I</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.930" end="00:08:30.120" style="s2">would call the UH thunk that is some way</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.260" end="00:08:32.099" style="s2">that things could be unfolding as we see</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.120" end="00:08:34.440" style="s2">them through some mechanism we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.099" end="00:08:36.810" style="s2">yet entertained but but that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.440" end="00:08:38.640" style="s2">very high probability we have a corona</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.810" end="00:08:41.580" style="s2">virus circulating it seems to be causing</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.640" end="00:08:44.460" style="s2">a disease we call Cove it 19 it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.580" end="00:08:45.889" style="s2">have emerged from wuhan through whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.460" end="00:08:47.420" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.889" end="00:08:49.329" style="s2">and it&#39;s causing a pandemic that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.420" end="00:08:54.109" style="s2">involves an awful lot of people having</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.329" end="00:08:57.079" style="s2">blood clots strokes heart attacks lungs</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.109" end="00:09:00.350" style="s2">filling with goo all sorts of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.079" end="00:09:04.549" style="s2">pathologies we&#39;ve discussed but alright</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.350" end="00:09:09.459" style="s2">let&#39;s get back to the question there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.549" end="00:09:13.669" style="s2">a virus that appears to be new to this</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.459" end="00:09:17.299" style="s2">human population that means it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.669" end="00:09:20.209" style="s2">inherently experimenting with mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.299" end="00:09:21.709" style="s2">to transmit itself from one person to</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.209" end="00:09:24.709" style="s2">the next</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.709" end="00:09:26.629" style="s2">it is experimenting as we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.709" end="00:09:29.089" style="s2">about on this podcast before what all</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.629" end="00:09:31.730" style="s2">evolved creatures are trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.089" end="00:09:34.249" style="s2">lodge themselves as far into the future</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.730" end="00:09:36.259" style="s2">as they can basically we&#39;re all trying</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.249" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">not to go extinct and so the farther you</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.259" end="00:09:39.919" style="s2">can launch yourself in the future the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:41.029" style="s2">better off you are so can I say like I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.919" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">like the language that we&#39;ve used before</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.029" end="00:09:45.379" style="s2">a little bit better that it is exploring</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:48.350" style="s2">space it is exploring possibility space</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.379" end="00:09:49.910" style="s2">as opposed to it is experimenting just</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.350" end="00:09:50.989" style="s2">because experiment you know for those</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.910" end="00:09:52.249" style="s2">people who are listening and not</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.989" end="00:09:54.739" style="s2">watching and can&#39;t see your square</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.249" end="00:09:57.439" style="s2">Coates square quick scare quotes around</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.739" end="00:09:59.329" style="s2">experimenting this is not we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.439" end="00:10:01.999" style="s2">talking about human experimentation on</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.329" end="00:10:03.350" style="s2">the coronavirus which very may very well</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.999" end="00:10:06.439" style="s2">may have happened we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.350" end="00:10:09.259" style="s2">the virus itself basically exploring</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.439" end="00:10:11.449" style="s2">space into which it can successfully</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.259" end="00:10:13.069" style="s2">move and thrive yeah when I say</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.449" end="00:10:15.470" style="s2">experiment I mean it in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.069" end="00:10:17.629" style="s2">that we would say natural experiment you</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.470" end="00:10:20.749" style="s2">know who I is a natural experiment in</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.629" end="00:10:23.239" style="s2">invasive species right nobody set it up</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.749" end="00:10:26.230" style="s2">that way it just it allows us to test</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.239" end="00:10:31.189" style="s2">hypotheses by looking at the pattern so</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.230" end="00:10:35.720" style="s2">the whatever our language choice is</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.189" end="00:10:41.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about how effective</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.720" end="00:10:44.329" style="s2">this virus is going to be in moving into</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.660" end="00:10:51.169" style="s2">the future we humanity are presumably</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.329" end="00:10:53.089" style="s2">all United it with the intent to give it</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.169" end="00:10:54.759" style="s2">as little room to get into the future as</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.089" end="00:10:56.779" style="s2">possible we would like to end its</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.759" end="00:10:59.800" style="s2">interaction with humans as quickly as</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.779" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">possible one of the factor</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.800" end="00:11:10.040" style="s2">that dictates how successful we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:12.950" style="s2">likely to be is how much area how much</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.040" end="00:11:16.790" style="s2">area in design space it has to explore</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.950" end="00:11:18.740" style="s2">new combinations of things and to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.790" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">extent that we are divided over the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.740" end="00:11:23.390" style="s2">question about whether it&#39;s time to open</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.720" end="00:11:27.670" style="s2">back up the group that is pushing a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.390" end="00:11:31.000" style="s2">quick return to normalcy is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.670" end="00:11:33.830" style="s2">gambling on all of our behalf on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.000" end="00:11:36.410" style="s2">extra space that the virus will now have</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.830" end="00:11:37.460" style="s2">to discover ways of persisting in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.410" end="00:11:39.940" style="s2">human population</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.460" end="00:11:44.270" style="s2">so we talked in an early livestream</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.940" end="00:11:50.060" style="s2">about one very bad possibility here is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.270" end="00:11:53.420" style="s2">that this virus becomes a fellow</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.060" end="00:11:57.260" style="s2">traveler with humans indefinitely like</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.420" end="00:12:00.170" style="s2">another flu now if it became less</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.260" end="00:12:03.110" style="s2">dangerous and then it currently is then</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.170" end="00:12:06.530" style="s2">it currently is and became persistent</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.110" end="00:12:08.420" style="s2">that would be a devastating blow it</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.530" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">would not be a fatal blow to humanity</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.420" end="00:12:15.110" style="s2">but it would be a huge setback and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:17.060" style="s2">would have to put the losses that would</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.110" end="00:12:19.730" style="s2">come from having a second flu-like</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.060" end="00:12:22.430" style="s2">phenomenon circulating in humans</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.730" end="00:12:24.800" style="s2">you would have to stack them against the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.430" end="00:12:26.890" style="s2">cost of remaining in lockdown now and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.800" end="00:12:30.350" style="s2">the problem is those costs are</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.890" end="00:12:33.080" style="s2">effectively indefinitely large because</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.350" end="00:12:35.300" style="s2">the future is indefinitely long and if</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.080" end="00:12:38.030" style="s2">it becomes a permanent feature then</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.300" end="00:12:40.400" style="s2">those costs will simply mount every year</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.030" end="00:12:43.520" style="s2">yes they will become normalized right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.400" end="00:12:45.950" style="s2">we have to think in terms of what is our</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.520" end="00:12:48.940" style="s2">best chance of taking this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.950" end="00:12:51.590" style="s2">has now spread far and wide and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.940" end="00:12:54.170" style="s2">preventing it from spreading further</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.590" end="00:12:56.360" style="s2">keeping it in as few bodies as possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.170" end="00:12:59.990" style="s2">so it has as little room to discover new</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.360" end="00:13:05.870" style="s2">ways of infecting us as we can manage is</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.990" end="00:13:08.150" style="s2">in the long term surely right so in any</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.870" end="00:13:09.800" style="s2">case have you heard anybody else say</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.150" end="00:13:11.690" style="s2">that that we&#39;re trying to reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.800" end="00:13:12.339" style="s2">amount of evolutionary space it has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.690" end="00:13:14.889" style="s2">discover</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.339" end="00:13:16.540" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think so but you know we</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.889" end="00:13:18.819" style="s2">we spend a lot of time talking so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.540" end="00:13:23.019" style="s2">certainly I&#39;ve heard that my own house</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.819" end="00:13:26.649" style="s2">yes but how do we lodge this in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.019" end="00:13:28.209" style="s2">public discussion so that people when</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.649" end="00:13:29.230" style="s2">somebody suggests hey it&#39;s time to open</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.209" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">it back up</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.230" end="00:13:32.949" style="s2">you know crashing an economy is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:34.029" style="s2">that you have a right to do yes there</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.949" end="00:13:35.680" style="s2">are gonna be desk but they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.029" end="00:13:37.809" style="s2">desk these arguments that we constantly</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.680" end="00:13:40.509" style="s2">hear in favor of opening it back up</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.809" end="00:13:43.029" style="s2">ignore the harm we are doing to</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.509" end="00:13:45.370" style="s2">ourselves in the distant future if we</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.029" end="00:13:47.350" style="s2">give it too much room now wellness I</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.370" end="00:13:50.139" style="s2">mean this is always the case with with</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.350" end="00:13:53.499" style="s2">with policy that it values the short</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.139" end="00:13:55.899" style="s2">term over the long term and it is always</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.499" end="00:13:58.689" style="s2">true that those things that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.899" end="00:14:01.509" style="s2">evolutionary successful are successful</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.689" end="00:14:03.189" style="s2">because they have managed to yes survive</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.509" end="00:14:05.680" style="s2">the short term but to launch themselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.189" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">into the future you know in the past</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.680" end="00:14:10.120" style="s2">they launch themselves into the future</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:12.819" style="s2">and there are very very many strategies</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.120" end="00:14:14.949" style="s2">and lineages that fail to do that which</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.819" end="00:14:16.929" style="s2">we now have you know either fossil or</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.949" end="00:14:20.529" style="s2">much more likely no evidence at all they</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.929" end="00:14:23.759" style="s2">ever existed so I think I think it&#39;ll be</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.240" end="00:21:21.830" style="s2">any moment right</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.350" end="00:21:24.230" style="s2">but cert seems to be unprecedented and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.830" end="00:21:26.690" style="s2">certainly breaks at least some rules of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.230" end="00:21:28.940" style="s2">their own internal language and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.690" end="00:21:33.890" style="s2">expectations that people who get grants</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.940" end="00:21:35.630" style="s2">pis and their their associates certainly</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.890" end="00:21:37.640" style="s2">never expect to have their money pulled</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.630" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">mid grant stream you know all grants</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.640" end="00:21:42.980" style="s2">have some amount of tenure two of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:46.160" style="s2">so amount of time during which they</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.980" end="00:21:48.320" style="s2">progress and many grants are expected to</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.160" end="00:21:50.510" style="s2">be able to continue for further rounds</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.320" end="00:21:52.820" style="s2">if they apply for them and have made</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.510" end="00:21:54.080" style="s2">appropriate progress in the interim and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.820" end="00:21:55.010" style="s2">I don&#39;t know any of the details of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.080" end="00:21:58.670" style="s2">particular grant</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.010" end="00:22:00.950" style="s2">but how interesting really that within</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.670" end="00:22:04.240" style="s2">the US on the same day the intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.950" end="00:22:06.520" style="s2">community of this official position is</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.240" end="00:22:07.870" style="s2">this is fine you know this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.520" end="00:22:09.550" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing to see here folks</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.870" end="00:22:11.230" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing there&#39;s no man behind</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.550" end="00:22:11.500" style="s2">the curtain in fact don&#39;t even look at</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.230" end="00:22:14.650" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.500" end="00:22:17.320" style="s2">don&#39;t even ask if there is one that NIH</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.650" end="00:22:20.680" style="s2">pulls funding for a long-standing effort</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.320" end="00:22:22.090" style="s2">to study coronaviruses in bats that is a</p>

<p begin="00:22:22.090" end="00:22:28.870" style="s2">China yeah so you can see that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.350" end="00:22:30.430" style="s2">juxtaposition makes no sense from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.870" end="00:22:32.260" style="s2">outside exactly there&#39;s nothing about</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.430" end="00:22:33.910" style="s2">this that requires detailed scientific</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.260" end="00:22:35.350" style="s2">knowledge this the intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.910" end="00:22:37.960" style="s2">community is saying one thing with</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.350" end="00:22:39.460" style="s2">absolute clarity and we are behaving</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.960" end="00:22:42.490" style="s2">very differently at the level of what</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.460" end="00:22:48.520" style="s2">kind of work we are funding at the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.490" end="00:22:51.310" style="s2">time but even more disturbing I think is</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.520" end="00:22:54.430" style="s2">the fact that the virology community</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.310" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">that is the sanctioned tenured research</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.430" end="00:23:02.200" style="s2">one University virology community is</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:06.340" style="s2">monolithic in its embrace of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.200" end="00:23:10.840" style="s2">that this is an unmodified virus that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.340" end="00:23:13.450" style="s2">came from nature while people who are</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.840" end="00:23:17.080" style="s2">not part of that community but are</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.450" end="00:23:19.150" style="s2">expert enough to navigate much of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.080" end="00:23:21.250" style="s2">data that is available to us in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.150" end="00:23:23.290" style="s2">public are reaching very different</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.250" end="00:23:26.140" style="s2">conclusions now I want to be super</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.290" end="00:23:28.540" style="s2">careful here a as we&#39;ve said before we</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.140" end="00:23:30.910" style="s2">are not going to advance conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.540" end="00:23:33.100" style="s2">theories we will advance conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.910" end="00:23:35.560" style="s2">hypotheses because that is the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.100" end="00:23:37.960" style="s2">these things I thought in by advance</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.560" end="00:23:39.670" style="s2">also we probably don&#39;t want to get into</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.960" end="00:23:40.870" style="s2">the business of dissecting every single</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.670" end="00:23:45.030" style="s2">word that we choose to use but by</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.870" end="00:23:47.800" style="s2">advance you mean discuss and as evidence</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.030" end="00:23:49.660" style="s2">mounts for any above others we will</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.800" end="00:23:52.090" style="s2">speak about those that seem to be less</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.660" end="00:23:53.920" style="s2">supported less often and those that seem</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.090" end="00:23:56.440" style="s2">to be more supported more often while</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.920" end="00:24:00.100" style="s2">still maintaining that they are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.440" end="00:24:01.600" style="s2">hypotheses for which evidence could come</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.100" end="00:24:03.190" style="s2">forward that would falsify them and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.600" end="00:24:05.230" style="s2">dropped them off the list of plausible</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.190" end="00:24:08.920" style="s2">explanations and you know for those of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.230" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">you who are new to the game of theory</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.920" end="00:24:14.110" style="s2">you should understand theorists do not</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">generate theories you cannot you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.110" end="00:24:17.190" style="s2">generate hypotheses and at the point</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:20.300" style="s2">that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.190" end="00:24:22.350" style="s2">become supported so that they are the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.300" end="00:24:24.300" style="s2">assumption that they is that they are</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.350" end="00:24:28.350" style="s2">true like the earth goes around the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.300" end="00:24:31.290" style="s2">or that you know the information that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.350" end="00:24:34.350" style="s2">allows heredity in morphology comes</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.290" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">through DNA these things then become</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.350" end="00:24:37.740" style="s2">theories at the point that they are</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:40.260" style="s2">they&#39;re not immune to being falsified</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.740" end="00:24:43.560" style="s2">but they become the default assumption</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.260" end="00:24:44.910" style="s2">so we will offer hypotheses we will</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.560" end="00:24:46.350" style="s2">advance them in the sense of putting</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.910" end="00:24:48.650" style="s2">them on the table it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.350" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2">we backed them I have to say I am still</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.650" end="00:24:54.180" style="s2">rooting for the idea that somehow this</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:24:55.950" style="s2">is a natural virus that escaped without</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.180" end="00:24:58.650" style="s2">the scientific community&#39;s involvement</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.950" end="00:25:02.940" style="s2">as a scientist I want that to be the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.650" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">case but I have to say the evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.940" end="00:25:09.510" style="s2">that&#39;s what happened is amazingly weak</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:11.460" style="s2">the narrative is very strong but this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.510" end="00:25:12.930" style="s2">such a critical distinction and it you</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.460" end="00:25:15.240" style="s2">know it gets at the naturalistic fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.930" end="00:25:19.140" style="s2">the idea that what is is not what ought</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.240" end="00:25:20.850" style="s2">to be that good scientists good everyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.140" end="00:25:23.910" style="s2">who are trying to understand things in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.850" end="00:25:25.710" style="s2">scientific way may well come to believe</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.910" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">that something is true while</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.710" end="00:25:31.230" style="s2">simultaneously wishing fervently that it</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:32.820" style="s2">were not true these we often find</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.230" end="00:25:35.730" style="s2">ourselves in this position it is indeed</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.820" end="00:25:38.340" style="s2">exactly why we argue actually an</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.730" end="00:25:41.010" style="s2">evolutionary perspective on humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.340" end="00:25:43.110" style="s2">on the entire world is exactly the thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.010" end="00:25:44.910" style="s2">that you need in order to change those</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.110" end="00:25:48.030" style="s2">things that evolution has handed us</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.910" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">which are not beautiful or wonderful for</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.030" end="00:25:56.430" style="s2">us so what are we to make of the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:58.380" style="s2">those who are in the best position to</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.430" end="00:26:00.600" style="s2">advance our interests and the best</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.380" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">position to understand what is taking</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.600" end="00:26:09.030" style="s2">place appear to be monolithically</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:11.490" style="s2">subscribed to a narrative that does not</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.030" end="00:26:13.020" style="s2">stand up to scrutiny in other words it</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.490" end="00:26:14.640" style="s2">may be that many of those people believe</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.020" end="00:26:16.950" style="s2">this is a natural virus but their</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:19.230" style="s2">certainty that that&#39;s the only way this</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.950" end="00:26:23.160" style="s2">could have gotten into humans in wuhan</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.230" end="00:26:27.450" style="s2">is simply unjustified by anything I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.160" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">seen anywhere yeah well the NIH just</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.450" end="00:26:33.670" style="s2">pulled a grant</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:36.250" style="s2">doctor was at Kyle siddell who we talked</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.670" end="00:26:37.630" style="s2">about in an earlier livestream lost his</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.250" end="00:26:41.950" style="s2">position at the hospital where he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.630" end="00:26:43.810" style="s2">working for the crime of going on</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.950" end="00:26:46.090" style="s2">YouTube and talking about his suspicions</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.810" end="00:26:50.920" style="s2">that the treatment with ventilators was</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.090" end="00:26:52.630" style="s2">not the best treatment for patients the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.920" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">video by the current County doctors</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.630" end="00:26:56.200" style="s2">which I basically eviscerated a couple</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:58.150" style="s2">of live streams ago I don&#39;t think they</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.200" end="00:27:01.060" style="s2">were right I don&#39;t think that their</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.150" end="00:27:02.920" style="s2">analysis was good faith but they</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.060" end="00:27:06.220" style="s2">absolutely need to be able to have voice</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.920" end="00:27:09.750" style="s2">that was pulled down from YouTube there</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.220" end="00:27:11.950" style="s2">are there are a number of frankly crazy</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.750" end="00:27:15.220" style="s2">conspiracy theories going around that</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.950" end="00:27:19.920" style="s2">keep on getting pulled so there seems to</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.220" end="00:27:22.330" style="s2">be widespread effort by the sensors</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.920" end="00:27:25.600" style="s2">which are in the case of NIH federal</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.330" end="00:27:30.070" style="s2">sensors in the case of YouTube private</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.600" end="00:27:31.480" style="s2">corporation sensors to keep us keep us</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.070" end="00:27:34.330" style="s2">on the straight and narrow you know keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.480" end="00:27:37.480" style="s2">us on a particular narrative so who wins</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.330" end="00:27:39.640" style="s2">by us all talking about and coming to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.480" end="00:27:41.140" style="s2">think that we&#39;re sophisticated for not</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.640" end="00:27:46.350" style="s2">paying any attention to the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.140" end="00:27:49.180" style="s2">hypotheses who wins by by having the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.350" end="00:27:52.120" style="s2">space of possible explanations winnow to</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.180" end="00:27:53.590" style="s2">a single one which frankly for those of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.120" end="00:27:56.560" style="s2">us who are trying to understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.590" end="00:27:59.490" style="s2">going on that single explanation is</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.560" end="00:28:01.720" style="s2">looking less and less likely to be true</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.490" end="00:28:03.040" style="s2">and yeah I just turned the question</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.720" end="00:28:05.560" style="s2">around on you at some level but I also</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.040" end="00:28:08.080" style="s2">just I was trying to outline all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.560" end="00:28:12.220" style="s2">places we&#39;ve seen all the mechanisms by</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.080" end="00:28:14.020" style="s2">which we seem to be seeing dissenting</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.220" end="00:28:16.330" style="s2">voices silence so at one level sorry</p>

<p begin="00:29:14.140" end="00:29:22.280" style="s2">towards positive reviews so if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.750" end="00:29:23.990" style="s2">you know has 95 percent positive reviews</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.280" end="00:29:29.540" style="s2">on ebay you know something&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.990" end="00:29:31.940" style="s2">wrong because that&#39;s pretty low so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.540" end="00:29:35.420" style="s2">have similar networks inside of academia</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.940" end="00:29:39.170" style="s2">and it is not obvious from the outside</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.420" end="00:29:44.630" style="s2">but the degree to which a virologist who</p>

<p begin="00:30:27.290" end="00:30:34.310" style="s2">of deaths this is a major error right</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.460" end="00:30:37.880" style="s2">if the virality community is in some way</p>

<p begin="00:31:14.190" end="00:31:18.230" style="s2">to emphasize there is a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:31:18.230" end="00:31:25.920" style="s2">kovat 19 most of it is garbage</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.470" end="00:31:27.960" style="s2">some of it is partially garbage and</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.920" end="00:31:29.730" style="s2">these are the toughest ones to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.960" end="00:31:32.130" style="s2">or the partial garbage the partial</p>

<p begin="00:31:40.200" end="00:31:44.850" style="s2">priors and some regards and you think oh</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.360" end="00:31:47.010" style="s2">yeah right then they say something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.850" end="00:31:48.660" style="s2">you know it&#39;s wrong I think well how do</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.010" end="00:31:50.040" style="s2">I match these things up because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.660" end="00:31:52.710" style="s2">a whole lot that I can&#39;t assess on my</p>

<p begin="00:31:55.920" end="00:32:00.270" style="s2">this isn&#39;t so how is it that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.680" end="00:32:04.910" style="s2">separate the wheat from the chaff right</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.270" end="00:32:04.910" style="s2">and in general for me as somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.120" end="00:32:09.300" style="s2">finds I must go look at these if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.130" end="00:32:11.400" style="s2">being told that this couldn&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.300" end="00:32:13.320" style="s2">have emerged from the do you know how</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.400" end="00:32:20.490" style="s2">many labs there are in wuhan that study</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.320" end="00:32:22.440" style="s2">coronaviruses from bats one - oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.490" end="00:32:25.140" style="s2">know I find that kind of shocking one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.440" end="00:32:29.550" style="s2">them is actually a couple hundred meters</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.140" end="00:32:31.590" style="s2">from the fish market I mean it&#39;s how is</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.550" end="00:32:33.330" style="s2">that not a famous fact maybe I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.590" end="00:32:35.610" style="s2">lied to maybe that&#39;s not even true but I</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.330" end="00:32:39.120" style="s2">certainly read an analysis that provided</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.610" end="00:32:40.530" style="s2">a map that showed this right we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:42.330" style="s2">got a friendly neighborhood for allergy</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.530" end="00:32:44.760" style="s2">lab just down the street well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.330" end="00:32:46.920" style="s2">other thing and in fact one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.760" end="00:32:48.510" style="s2">better analyses that I&#39;ve seen started</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.920" end="00:32:53.460" style="s2">with the question of okay yes it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.510" end="00:32:55.950" style="s2">surprising that that there is a virology</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.460" end="00:32:57.630" style="s2">lab in Wuhan that studies coronaviruses</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.950" end="00:33:00.210" style="s2">from bats and that this epidemic started</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.630" end="00:33:02.100" style="s2">there but the first question was well</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.210" end="00:33:03.570" style="s2">maybe these things are all over the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.100" end="00:33:04.800" style="s2">place and so that&#39;s not that surprising</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.570" end="00:33:06.900" style="s2">right they&#39;re not all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.800" end="00:33:08.909" style="s2">okay there are two Biggie&#39;s right well</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.900" end="00:33:11.099" style="s2">in the US but I just asked</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.909" end="00:33:12.479" style="s2">that maybe these things are all over the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.099" end="00:33:14.609" style="s2">place and therefore that&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.479" end="00:33:16.590" style="s2">surprising this is so important this</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.609" end="00:33:19.139" style="s2">this is the step that is often missing</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.590" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">when people start promoting conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.139" end="00:33:25.080" style="s2">hypotheses as it were right the actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:27.599" style="s2">what is the expected value don&#39;t so you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.080" end="00:33:29.129" style="s2">don&#39;t assume that the fact of these two</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.599" end="00:33:31.649" style="s2">things being in close proximity to each</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.129" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">other is unlikely until you know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.649" end="00:33:36.059" style="s2">frequency of the one thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:38.849" style="s2">think shouldn&#39;t have shown up there and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.059" end="00:33:41.159" style="s2">if it were true that there were one in</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.849" end="00:33:44.190" style="s2">every city over I don&#39;t know two hundred</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.159" end="00:33:47.099" style="s2">thousand in China then it&#39;s relative</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.190" end="00:33:50.580" style="s2">proximity to a market that sells fresh</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.099" end="00:33:53.129" style="s2">food is completely unsurprising and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.580" end="00:33:54.749" style="s2">warrants no discussion at all and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.129" end="00:33:57.899" style="s2">know I&#39;d love to see the goodness of fit</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.749" end="00:34:03.450" style="s2">test the chi-square or whatever - to</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.899" end="00:34:05.039" style="s2">know whether or not the these two things</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.450" end="00:34:06.779" style="s2">the you know the fish market and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.039" end="00:34:09.240" style="s2">virology lab being in relative proximity</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.779" end="00:34:10.919" style="s2">to one another is unlikely compared to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.240" end="00:34:12.780" style="s2">other cities of comparable or larger</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.919" end="00:34:16.289" style="s2">size I think would be the right analysis</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.780" end="00:34:18.299" style="s2">for Wuhan but suffice it to say that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.289" end="00:34:20.549" style="s2">fact that the question was even asked</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.299" end="00:34:22.319" style="s2">and that the answer apparently without</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.549" end="00:34:23.700" style="s2">any numbers to it came back was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.319" end="00:34:26.039" style="s2">no actually these labs are quite</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.700" end="00:34:28.260" style="s2">uncommon tells us okay well at least</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.039" end="00:34:30.599" style="s2">they passed that first step of this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.260" end="00:34:32.700" style="s2">this seems to be unlikely yeah seems to</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.599" end="00:34:34.649" style="s2">be unlikely at an extraordinary level</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.700" end="00:34:36.899" style="s2">and I mean I must say if I can just</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.649" end="00:34:39.960" style="s2">remind people of the story we discovered</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.899" end="00:34:43.020" style="s2">that there was some pandemic about to</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.960" end="00:34:47.789" style="s2">unfold when we emerged from the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.020" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">in late January late January we were in</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.789" end="00:34:53.099" style="s2">Ecuador and there was one case thought</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.359" end="00:34:56.429" style="s2">to be in Ecuador and so it came across</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.099" end="00:34:59.010" style="s2">our local twitter feeds and at that</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.429" end="00:35:00.750" style="s2">point I looked at it and I was not happy</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.010" end="00:35:02.849" style="s2">to discover that the bat had been</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.750" end="00:35:05.510" style="s2">implicated as a bat biologist I always</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.849" end="00:35:08.039" style="s2">feel you know it&#39;s kind of a loss when</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.510" end="00:35:10.770" style="s2">more is added to the reasons to fear</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.039" end="00:35:13.319" style="s2">bats and anyway but I looked at it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.770" end="00:35:15.420" style="s2">it looked pretty plausible that this had</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.319" end="00:35:18.599" style="s2">come through the fish market through the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.420" end="00:35:21.240" style="s2">sale of bats and when I tweeted that</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.599" end="00:35:22.030" style="s2">this looked reasonable to me I got back</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.240" end="00:35:25.530" style="s2">in a media</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.030" end="00:35:29.800" style="s2">influx of people showing me a Chinese</p>

<p begin="00:35:32.500" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">of course I don&#39;t speak Bandar and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:38.350" style="s2">couldn&#39;t evaluate whether what I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:42.310" style="s2">seeing was actually even a real document</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.350" end="00:35:44.470" style="s2">much less what it said but I suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.310" end="00:35:47.590" style="s2">knew that there were things about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.470" end="00:35:49.510" style="s2">story I didn&#39;t understand because it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.590" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">an amazing coincidence for there to be a</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.510" end="00:35:53.830" style="s2">virology lab studying coronaviruses in</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:55.780" style="s2">Wuhan for the epidemic to have started</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.830" end="00:35:57.850" style="s2">there and for them to have been</p>

<p begin="00:35:57.850" end="00:36:03.340" style="s2">exact kinds of questions so I backed</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.460" end="00:36:05.980" style="s2">immediately off of that and I have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.340" end="00:36:08.230" style="s2">say in the period of time since then it</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.980" end="00:36:10.780" style="s2">has not gotten more likely that it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.230" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">the fish market it the more you chased</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.780" end="00:36:14.230" style="s2">down the various possibilities the less</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:17.230" style="s2">likely it looks so I was going to offer</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.230" end="00:36:18.940" style="s2">one suggestion going forward and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.230" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">done it myself and I would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.940" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">everybody who is interested in these</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:27.660" style="s2">questions do it also which is you make a</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:30.030" style="s2">kind of flute flowchart of the various</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.660" end="00:36:31.720" style="s2">different possibilities in play</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.030" end="00:36:34.150" style="s2">unfortunately we&#39;ve been given an</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.720" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">artificial it&#39;s either natural and it</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.150" end="00:36:39.610" style="s2">came from a bat with no lab involvement</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:41.500" style="s2">or somebody designed this virus you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.610" end="00:36:43.510" style="s2">in some extreme form and there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.500" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">intermediate possibilities but I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.510" end="00:36:47.350" style="s2">suggest you map them all out so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:50.290" style="s2">they&#39;re all on a piece of paper and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.350" end="00:36:52.300" style="s2">you put percentages based on what you</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.290" end="00:36:55.240" style="s2">know about the likelihood that it came</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.300" end="00:36:57.190" style="s2">this way that way and you fill the thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.240" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">out as much as possible and then you put</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.190" end="00:37:01.240" style="s2">a date on it so that you know as of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">date this is where I understood the</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.240" end="00:37:04.990" style="s2">likelihoods to be and you don&#39;t stick to</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:08.140" style="s2">it you know again I&#39;m still rooting for</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.990" end="00:37:09.970" style="s2">the natural came from nature without the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.140" end="00:37:11.350" style="s2">involvement of a lab hypothesis I just</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.970" end="00:37:13.450" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s very likely to be true</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.350" end="00:37:14.950" style="s2">so do you have this flow chart that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.450" end="00:37:18.340" style="s2">made it that you wanted Zack to show or</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.950" end="00:37:19.420" style="s2">or no we could do that and I just I want</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.340" end="00:37:21.400" style="s2">people to understand I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.420" end="00:37:24.630" style="s2">live or die by whether or not this flow</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.400" end="00:37:26.950" style="s2">chart generated yesterday and today is</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.630" end="00:37:28.510" style="s2">accurate again I&#39;m rooting for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.950" end="00:37:29.590" style="s2">wrong and I&#39;m just I haven&#39;t seen it yet</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.510" end="00:37:31.660" style="s2">so this could this could be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.590" end="00:37:32.420" style="s2">let&#39;s see it together if if you can show</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.660" end="00:37:37.400" style="s2">that ours</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.420" end="00:37:42.130" style="s2">so I can see it might have a copy of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.400" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">here well actually if dad has a copy</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.130" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">that&#39;s Zach our producer and our son</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:55.070" style="s2">so wait zach is our son which makes us</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.930" end="00:37:56.810" style="s2">his British true right yeah I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.070" end="00:37:59.090" style="s2">sure that&#39;s our cursive for sure yes</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.810" end="00:38:01.910" style="s2">okay oh great oh except we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.090" end="00:38:03.530" style="s2">read it but you have a cop goodness that</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.910" end="00:38:10.010" style="s2">is terrible can you fix that at all Zach</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.530" end="00:38:11.960" style="s2">no well is that supposed to be a PDF all</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.010" end="00:38:13.790" style="s2">right well I guess we can&#39;t really show</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.960" end="00:38:16.420" style="s2">you that in any sort of decent form okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.790" end="00:38:18.920" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s take it down then and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.420" end="00:38:21.470" style="s2">come back to it what do we have a better</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.920" end="00:38:24.070" style="s2">image maybe next time all right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.470" end="00:38:26.210" style="s2">just say you all saw what the image</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.070" end="00:38:29.150" style="s2">exactly what the image looks like</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.210" end="00:38:33.890" style="s2">roughly the bubbles contain various</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.150" end="00:38:35.690" style="s2">possibilities and the little percentages</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.890" end="00:38:37.070" style="s2">in between are an estimate of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.690" end="00:38:38.930" style="s2">likelihood that it went one way or</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.070" end="00:38:40.250" style="s2">another and the total should be about a</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.930" end="00:38:41.420" style="s2">hundred percent because it should be</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.250" end="00:38:45.110" style="s2">somewhere on the flow chart is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.420" end="00:38:46.250" style="s2">actual path it took to humanity you want</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.110" end="00:38:49.220" style="s2">to switch gears and talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.250" end="00:38:51.050" style="s2">about excess deaths sure yeah yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.220" end="00:38:52.900" style="s2">talk about excess dust this is a this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.050" end="00:38:58.040" style="s2">a concept that you&#39;ve raised a few times</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.900" end="00:38:59.330" style="s2">or we have raised a few times I guess</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.040" end="00:39:00.830" style="s2">let me let me set it up for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.330" end="00:39:02.660" style="s2">before you before you talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.830" end="00:39:05.090" style="s2">about it by saying that much has been</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.660" end="00:39:07.430" style="s2">made of late by those who are advocating</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.090" end="00:39:10.490" style="s2">for an end to lock downs and a return to</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.430" end="00:39:11.840" style="s2">normal return to normal in quotes that</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.490" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">we don&#39;t have an accurate count ounce of</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.840" end="00:39:15.860" style="s2">deaths or of underlying infection rates</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:17.750" style="s2">which has been one of my drumbeats that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.860" end="00:39:19.370" style="s2">without without widespread testing we</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.750" end="00:39:21.950" style="s2">don&#39;t know underlying infection rates</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.370" end="00:39:23.750" style="s2">and therefore we do not know we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.950" end="00:39:27.370" style="s2">possibly have an accurate case fatality</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.750" end="00:39:29.900" style="s2">rate or infection fatality rate but some</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.370" end="00:39:31.010" style="s2">people more likely to be on the right</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.900" end="00:39:34.370" style="s2">than the left at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.010" end="00:39:35.450" style="s2">unfortunately and by unfortunately by</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.370" end="00:39:39.740" style="s2">which I mean unfortunately it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.450" end="00:39:41.270" style="s2">polarized politically this way some</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.740" end="00:39:42.860" style="s2">people who believe or want us to believe</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.270" end="00:39:43.700" style="s2">that the threat of this virus is being</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.860" end="00:39:46.849" style="s2">overplayed</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.700" end="00:39:48.770" style="s2">we&#39;ll say things use the language of you</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.849" end="00:39:51.589" style="s2">don&#39;t die with a disease you die of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.770" end="00:39:56.030" style="s2">disease and this is prompted by I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.589" end="00:39:59.210" style="s2">it was dr. bricks is it because on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.030" end="00:40:00.680" style="s2">coronavirus task force saying that at</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.210" end="00:40:04.730" style="s2">the moment if you have tested positive</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.680" end="00:40:08.690" style="s2">for Koba 19 and you die that is being</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.730" end="00:40:11.510" style="s2">slated in the official death tolls as</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.690" end="00:40:12.829" style="s2">you died of coma at 19 and some people</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.510" end="00:40:18.040" style="s2">have said that&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.829" end="00:40:21.799" style="s2">you don&#39;t die with you die of and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.040" end="00:40:23.450" style="s2">you know if if if that critique is true</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.799" end="00:40:26.240" style="s2">it would skew the death toll higher</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.450" end="00:40:27.740" style="s2">towards coma 19 alright but this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.240" end="00:40:29.990" style="s2">dealt with I think really well by the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.740" end="00:40:32.660" style="s2">concept of excess deaths so you want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.990" end="00:40:35.210" style="s2">speak to that sure so you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.660" end="00:40:37.460" style="s2">that there&#39;s some sort of fluctuation in</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.210" end="00:40:39.260" style="s2">the amount of death that you will see at</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.460" end="00:40:40.760" style="s2">different times of year winter is harder</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.260" end="00:40:42.049" style="s2">on people you&#39;ll have more people dying</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.760" end="00:40:43.880" style="s2">during the winter than when times are</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.049" end="00:40:47.240" style="s2">easy something like that but by</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.880" end="00:40:49.339" style="s2">comparing one year to the next so you</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.240" end="00:40:52.069" style="s2">take a given week you know first week in</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.339" end="00:40:53.619" style="s2">January let&#39;s say and you compare how</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.069" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">many people died in this municipality</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.619" end="00:41:00.559" style="s2">this year versus next year or last year</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:02.089" style="s2">you see what the change is over time and</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.559" end="00:41:03.470" style="s2">you&#39;ll get some sort of noise you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.089" end="00:41:05.930" style="s2">some years you have a few more deaths</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.470" end="00:41:08.020" style="s2">some years you&#39;ll have a few less but in</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.930" end="00:41:11.450" style="s2">general you&#39;ll have some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.020" end="00:41:13.640" style="s2">expected level of death and then you</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.450" end="00:41:16.819" style="s2">have some major event like the kovat 19</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.640" end="00:41:18.589" style="s2">pandemic and you can compare in the Cova</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.819" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">19 pandemic you have this many people</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.589" end="00:41:23.030" style="s2">died in the given week in question</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:27.319" style="s2">compared to what normal would look like</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.030" end="00:41:31.460" style="s2">and you say well we&#39;ve got you know 270</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.319" end="00:41:32.210" style="s2">extra deaths that are not expected</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.460" end="00:41:35.630" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.210" end="00:41:37.190" style="s2">which of course doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.630" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">there are two things it doesn&#39;t mean one</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.190" end="00:41:41.329" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean those people even had</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:44.540" style="s2">Kovac 19 some of them may have died from</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.329" end="00:41:47.180" style="s2">consequences of kovat 19 that were not</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.540" end="00:41:51.980" style="s2">direct like they didn&#39;t go to the doctor</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.180" end="00:41:54.950" style="s2">when they had signs of a stroke and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.980" end="00:41:56.660" style="s2">killed them so it may be a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.950" end="00:41:58.750" style="s2">of kovat 19 but not a calm</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.660" end="00:42:00.859" style="s2">sequence of not a pathological</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.750" end="00:42:06.530" style="s2">consequence of it in the individual</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.859" end="00:42:09.319" style="s2">right so in any case I had a second</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.530" end="00:42:10.819" style="s2">category I was looking for I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.319" end="00:42:12.970" style="s2">you said it yet yeah what was it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.819" end="00:42:16.069" style="s2">remember I want to be in a second but</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.970" end="00:42:18.680" style="s2">but by and large the important thing is</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.069" end="00:42:22.970" style="s2">oh there&#39;s also you know noise you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.680" end="00:42:25.910" style="s2">have s reasons that people would there</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.970" end="00:42:27.349" style="s2">be there could be other on unknown</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.910" end="00:42:29.770" style="s2">reasons that you would have excess</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.349" end="00:42:32.539" style="s2">deaths in a year that would tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.770" end="00:42:33.770" style="s2">attributed to covet 19 because kovat 19</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.539" end="00:42:35.960" style="s2">was the big factor everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.770" end="00:42:38.030" style="s2">thinking about but by and large that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.960" end="00:42:39.859" style="s2">ought to be a small factor either that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.030" end="00:42:41.960" style="s2">or you ought to see the yearly variation</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.859" end="00:42:44.270" style="s2">is actually large in which case your</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.960" end="00:42:47.210" style="s2">goal would be large meaning you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.270" end="00:42:48.079" style="s2">very confident of the the usual baseline</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.210" end="00:42:51.410" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.079" end="00:42:55.000" style="s2">but anyway excess des is a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.410" end="00:42:57.170" style="s2">capturing that which is hard to parse</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.000" end="00:42:59.240" style="s2">specifically how many people are dying</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.170" end="00:43:01.309" style="s2">as a result of cope at 19 we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.240" end="00:43:03.260" style="s2">estimate it maybe better with excess des</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.309" end="00:43:06.980" style="s2">than we do with any other measure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.260" end="00:43:09.140" style="s2">exactly and I wanted to add just one</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.980" end="00:43:11.270" style="s2">thing to this which is that the concept</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.140" end="00:43:14.299" style="s2">of excess deaths the statistic of excess</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.270" end="00:43:17.900" style="s2">deaths how many people died in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.299" end="00:43:20.839" style="s2">place at this time compared to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.900" end="00:43:22.609" style="s2">deaths per capita at this place exactly</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.839" end="00:43:24.680" style="s2">a year ago to control for seasonality</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.609" end="00:43:29.589" style="s2">and to care to compare to control for</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.680" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">geography then this will find</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.589" end="00:43:35.660" style="s2">potentially other syndromes that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:39.170" style="s2">meaning epidemiologists virologists</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.660" end="00:43:42.740" style="s2">medical health professionals are not yet</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.170" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2">attributing to coronavirus so Zach if</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.740" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">you would put this up there is a strange</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.720" end="00:43:51.500" style="s2">new terrifying inflammatory condition in</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:53.779" style="s2">children pediatric cases which is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.500" end="00:43:57.140" style="s2">tending to kill children but it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.779" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">tending to leave them extremely sick and</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.140" end="00:44:02.470" style="s2">with who knows what level of long term</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:06.410" style="s2">consequences so in this particular case</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.470" end="00:44:10.160" style="s2">there are there are strong suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.410" end="00:44:11.660" style="s2">that that this pediatric inflammatory</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.160" end="00:44:13.039" style="s2">condition is indeed caused by</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.660" end="00:44:15.349" style="s2">coronavirus and so you&#39;ve got people</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.039" end="00:44:17.750" style="s2">looking into whether or not these</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.349" end="00:44:20.930" style="s2">children who have this many of them</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.750" end="00:44:22.520" style="s2">either test positive now or test</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.930" end="00:44:24.260" style="s2">positive for antibodies suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.520" end="00:44:28.849" style="s2">they&#39;ve been exposed to the corona virus</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.260" end="00:44:30.710" style="s2">in the past that that itself is a little</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.849" end="00:44:33.260" style="s2">alarming and it&#39;s in keeping with other</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.710" end="00:44:34.849" style="s2">things that we know about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.260" end="00:44:38.119" style="s2">progression of this disease and many</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.849" end="00:44:41.589" style="s2">people wherein you get sick those people</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.119" end="00:44:44.059" style="s2">who aren&#39;t asymptomatic get sick and</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.589" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">seem to be getting better and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.059" end="00:44:51.140" style="s2">plummet and then have some strong</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:53.630" style="s2">respiratory problem that causes causes</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.140" end="00:44:57.319" style="s2">them to in some cases die in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.630" end="00:44:59.960" style="s2">require ICU so the fact that this is you</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.319" end="00:45:05.599" style="s2">can take that town please the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.960" end="00:45:08.930" style="s2">this is found in children who have</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.599" end="00:45:11.390" style="s2">antibodies to SARS Cove - but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.930" end="00:45:13.520" style="s2">currently test positive again suggests</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.390" end="00:45:15.049" style="s2">that a there may be longer term</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.520" end="00:45:17.329" style="s2">consequence that the progression of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.049" end="00:45:19.700" style="s2">disease may be maybe have a much longer</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.329" end="00:45:21.609" style="s2">arc than people are imagining that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.700" end="00:45:25.369" style="s2">not like you get better and you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.609" end="00:45:27.289" style="s2">but also this you know if children were</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.369" end="00:45:29.029" style="s2">actually dying from this which it looks</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.289" end="00:45:30.410" style="s2">you know thankfully like children aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.029" end="00:45:33.650" style="s2">actually dying but they&#39;re getting very</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.410" end="00:45:36.140" style="s2">sick and we didn&#39;t yet attribute to this</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.650" end="00:45:37.549" style="s2">to possible coronavirus effects that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.140" end="00:45:40.490" style="s2">would still show up under excess deaths</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.549" end="00:45:42.799" style="s2">and this may well suggest that there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.490" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">other things like for instance strokes</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.799" end="00:45:47.779" style="s2">in otherwise healthy relatively young</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:49.160" style="s2">people people in their 30s and 40s who</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.779" end="00:45:51.950" style="s2">are suffering home strokes and very much</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.160" end="00:45:53.539" style="s2">higher levels right now well is there</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.950" end="00:45:56.750" style="s2">something else that&#39;s going on that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.539" end="00:45:59.089" style="s2">explanatory or is that somehow linked to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.750" end="00:46:02.000" style="s2">SARS Cove - either way</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.089" end="00:46:03.859" style="s2">it&#39;s a scary answer and it&#39;ll show up in</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.000" end="00:46:05.450" style="s2">the excess deaths count in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.859" end="00:46:09.289" style="s2">other metrics don&#39;t have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.450" end="00:46:12.859" style="s2">revealing yeah and it is a good it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.289" end="00:46:14.109" style="s2">good integrative measure that to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.859" end="00:46:16.849" style="s2">extent that we&#39;re trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.109" end="00:46:17.450" style="s2">policy wives what to do if we can go</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.849" end="00:46:19.280" style="s2">back to the disk</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.450" end="00:46:22.750" style="s2">we were having at the beginning it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.280" end="00:46:25.790" style="s2">really perhaps the key metric for</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.750" end="00:46:27.890" style="s2">actually capturing the hazard at least</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.790" end="00:46:30.320" style="s2">as far as it manifests in deaths and as</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.890" end="00:46:32.210" style="s2">you allude to that is not the only</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.320" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">frightening thing here it&#39;s not that if</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.210" end="00:46:35.930" style="s2">you get better you&#39;re better the fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:37.400" style="s2">that large numbers are a large fraction</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.930" end="00:46:40.910" style="s2">of people even who&#39;ve been asymptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.400" end="00:46:42.980" style="s2">have visible pathology on their x-rays</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.910" end="00:46:46.070" style="s2">after they&#39;ve recovered I suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.980" end="00:46:48.349" style="s2">this may indeed be a very dangerous life</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.070" end="00:46:51.820" style="s2">shortening condition even for the lucky</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.349" end="00:46:54.290" style="s2">ones who show no symptoms yep</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.820" end="00:46:56.089" style="s2">well there&#39;s a number of other things we</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.290" end="00:47:01.550" style="s2">could talk about here you have any</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.089" end="00:47:04.190" style="s2">preference between timing mmm more</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.550" end="00:47:06.520" style="s2">virulent strains or talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.190" end="00:47:10.010" style="s2">relative risks</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.520" end="00:47:13.099" style="s2">well more virulent strains is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.010" end="00:47:16.160" style="s2">worth talking about okay and maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.099" end="00:47:19.310" style="s2">should mention Johns Hopkins statistics</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.160" end="00:47:20.990" style="s2">which frankly I find so shocking that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.310" end="00:47:23.990" style="s2">feel there might be something wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.990" end="00:47:28.160" style="s2">them I don&#39;t have them up here maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.990" end="00:47:29.960" style="s2">well maybe we could mention those in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:31.250" style="s2">Q&amp;A because I don&#39;t use something to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.960" end="00:47:35.810" style="s2">my phone so I don&#39;t have them on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.250" end="00:47:38.329" style="s2">computer sorry about that um so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.810" end="00:47:40.550" style="s2">say you want to talk about a deuce train</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.329" end="00:47:47.329" style="s2">with higher virulence so let&#39;s see this</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.550" end="00:47:48.530" style="s2">is LA Times reports a new study I</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.329" end="00:47:52.190" style="s2">haven&#39;t actually looked at this much</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.530" end="00:47:57.349" style="s2">which is not pulling up because Internet</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.190" end="00:47:58.910" style="s2">is okay I&#39;m not sure what to say about</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.349" end="00:48:01.430" style="s2">this because we don&#39;t have anything on</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.910" end="00:48:03.829" style="s2">the screen here yes there&#39;s nothing on</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.430" end="00:48:09.380" style="s2">the screen there well let&#39;s see there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.829" end="00:48:10.880" style="s2">some there&#39;s some evidence that out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.380" end="00:48:14.780" style="s2">Los Alamos some researchers at Los</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.880" end="00:48:17.060" style="s2">Alamos that there are as we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.780" end="00:48:20.240" style="s2">about before a new small Teeple strains</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.060" end="00:48:21.920" style="s2">and that some of the strains that seemed</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.240" end="00:48:25.910" style="s2">at least one of the strains that seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.920" end="00:48:28.559" style="s2">to have traveled from Europe to the</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.709" end="00:48:37.049" style="s2">estimates very is a more virulent strain</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.979" end="00:48:39.539" style="s2">than the first one that was emerging in</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.539" end="00:48:46.589" style="s2">of 2019 and this is again an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.349" end="00:48:49.170" style="s2">has been wildly dismissed by some uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.589" end="00:48:50.699" style="s2">there aren&#39;t multiple strains and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.170" end="00:48:53.759" style="s2">know this this raises the question of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.699" end="00:48:55.589" style="s2">what what makes it a multiple what makes</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.759" end="00:48:58.170" style="s2">it a different strain clearly the thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.589" end="00:49:01.739" style="s2">is mutating it would because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.170" end="00:49:03.119" style="s2">made of RNA it&#39;s going to mutate and at</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.739" end="00:49:05.279" style="s2">what point hasn&#39;t mutated sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.119" end="00:49:08.009" style="s2">that someone has decided to call it a</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.279" end="00:49:10.519" style="s2">different strain and you know we we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.009" end="00:49:13.079" style="s2">more familiar with this over in</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.519" end="00:49:15.150" style="s2">non-viral organism space when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.079" end="00:49:16.499" style="s2">talking about often in vertebrates at</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.150" end="00:49:18.809" style="s2">what point do you call it a different</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.499" end="00:49:21.209" style="s2">species well it&#39;s a judgement call and</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.809" end="00:49:23.670" style="s2">the experts within that clade of</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.209" end="00:49:24.809" style="s2">organisms get to decide when we call out</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.670" end="00:49:26.009" style="s2">of different spaces and when we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.809" end="00:49:27.749" style="s2">and sometimes they reverse their</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.009" end="00:49:29.759" style="s2">decision and they say actually we think</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.749" end="00:49:31.199" style="s2">actually these these two things that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.759" end="00:49:34.709" style="s2">were calling different species are one</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.199" end="00:49:37.349" style="s2">or more often vice versa so with regard</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.709" end="00:49:38.939" style="s2">to a quickly evolving newly emerged</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.349" end="00:49:39.689" style="s2">virus that the world has never seen</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.939" end="00:49:43.019" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.689" end="00:49:44.519" style="s2">at what point is is it changed enough</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.019" end="00:49:45.809" style="s2">from its original that we&#39;re calling a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.519" end="00:49:47.579" style="s2">different strain at some level I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.809" end="00:49:50.130" style="s2">even find the question very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.579" end="00:49:51.029" style="s2">but you know that what do we call it</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.130" end="00:49:53.400" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.029" end="00:49:57.479" style="s2">but the hasn&#39;t mutated and are some of</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.400" end="00:49:59.489" style="s2">the lineages from the original one more</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.479" end="00:50:01.829" style="s2">virulent than others they would have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.489" end="00:50:03.869" style="s2">be well let&#39;s do have to be very instant</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.829" end="00:50:05.640" style="s2">virulence let&#39;s try to correct this so</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.869" end="00:50:07.890" style="s2">people understand what&#39;s really taking</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.640" end="00:50:09.839" style="s2">place and why this why the question</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.890" end="00:50:12.239" style="s2">turns out not to be a good one</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:14.039" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s very important one the</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.239" end="00:50:16.049" style="s2">question of how many strains how many</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.039" end="00:50:18.269" style="s2">strains are they here&#39;s the thing let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.049" end="00:50:21.079" style="s2">say you&#39;ve got kovat 19 or you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.269" end="00:50:23.759" style="s2">SARS co2 and our suffering from Koba 19</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.079" end="00:50:26.309" style="s2">you undoubtedly have multiple strains in</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.759" end="00:50:28.829" style="s2">you right there will have been mutations</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.309" end="00:50:30.359" style="s2">that will cause differences most of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.829" end="00:50:31.769" style="s2">those differences won&#39;t change anything</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.359" end="00:50:32.999" style="s2">about the way it functions so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.769" end="00:50:36.029" style="s2">never notice that there are differences</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.999" end="00:50:37.819" style="s2">and most of those changes will die with</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.029" end="00:50:40.099" style="s2">the end of the infection that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.819" end="00:50:42.680" style="s2">so some new strain comes into existence</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.099" end="00:50:44.269" style="s2">in some individual and then that person</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.680" end="00:50:47.119" style="s2">gets better and there are no live</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.269" end="00:50:48.890" style="s2">viruses left and that strain came into</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.119" end="00:50:51.109" style="s2">existence and went extinct without</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.890" end="00:50:54.829" style="s2">anybody recognizing it that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.109" end="00:50:57.859" style="s2">I would that in every single patient hmm</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.829" end="00:50:59.959" style="s2">I mean they&#39;re just simply boy am I</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.859" end="00:51:04.489" style="s2">gonna get this number wrong but I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.959" end="00:51:07.299" style="s2">guess there are hundreds of billions of</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.489" end="00:51:10.039" style="s2">copies of the virus in every sick person</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.299" end="00:51:11.630" style="s2">who has had the disease long enough for</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.039" end="00:51:14.930" style="s2">it to get to all the tissues it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.630" end="00:51:19.400" style="s2">get to that number could be trillions</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.930" end="00:51:20.959" style="s2">could be yeah or does a bank but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.400" end="00:51:23.299" style="s2">just say let&#39;s be conservative at let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.959" end="00:51:25.579" style="s2">say it&#39;s many millions okay chances that</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.299" end="00:51:27.349" style="s2">all of them are identical and have not</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.579" end="00:51:29.869" style="s2">had a mutation are pretty low given the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.349" end="00:51:31.969" style="s2">way mutation occurs and the chances that</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.869" end="00:51:34.670" style="s2">the one that has the mutation escapes to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.969" end="00:51:37.130" style="s2">the next person is pretty low given that</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.670" end="00:51:38.979" style="s2">most of them will be identical or near</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.130" end="00:51:41.029" style="s2">identical copies from the original</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.979" end="00:51:42.410" style="s2">occasionally a mutation will jump to</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.029" end="00:51:43.999" style="s2">somebody new but very often that</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.410" end="00:51:46.160" style="s2">mutation won&#39;t change anything about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.999" end="00:51:49.989" style="s2">functionality so we won&#39;t notice it and</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.160" end="00:51:49.989" style="s2">then it&#39;ll go extinct in the next person</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.380" end="00:51:57.529" style="s2">but every so often the virus will</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.119" end="00:51:59.930" style="s2">accidentally innovate something that</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.529" end="00:52:02.299" style="s2">makes it more effective than its</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.930" end="00:52:04.880" style="s2">ancestor when that happens the chances</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.299" end="00:52:07.400" style="s2">that it does persist to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.880" end="00:52:08.959" style="s2">next person goes up which doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.400" end="00:52:11.599" style="s2">it will make it but it does mean that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.959" end="00:52:15.079" style="s2">chances are greater yeah so at some</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.599" end="00:52:17.630" style="s2">point one of these lucky changes will</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.079" end="00:52:19.339" style="s2">make a leap and when it makes a leap the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.630" end="00:52:21.559" style="s2">lucky change will make a second leap and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.339" end="00:52:24.410" style="s2">as it fans out into more and more</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.559" end="00:52:27.140" style="s2">individuals the chances that that new</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.410" end="00:52:30.069" style="s2">slightly better version will take hold</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.140" end="00:52:32.599" style="s2">and be in an effective new patient zero</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.069" end="00:52:35.869" style="s2">right a new patient zero for that new</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.599" end="00:52:40.299" style="s2">strain that then fans out to a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.869" end="00:52:42.589" style="s2">people is fairly large can I do another</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.299" end="00:52:45.079" style="s2">potentially obnoxious semantic thing and</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.589" end="00:52:48.079" style="s2">center you use the term better which</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.079" end="00:52:51.400" style="s2">will be grabbed on to by the critics to</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.079" end="00:52:53.109" style="s2">suggest that you think it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.400" end="00:52:55.329" style="s2">and the virus becomes what more</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.109" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">virulence for awful to humanity what</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.329" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">does what does better mean to me right</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.240" end="00:53:01.990" style="s2">it means I&#39;m just I&#39;m trying to play</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:03.930" style="s2">your trail here yeah I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.990" end="00:53:07.329" style="s2">it&#39;s useful so hey you should know</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.930" end="00:53:09.069" style="s2">personality defect I very much dislike</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.329" end="00:53:13.240" style="s2">this virus but it&#39;s not right don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.069" end="00:53:14.950" style="s2">admire the beauty of its design I do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.240" end="00:53:16.839" style="s2">not rooting for it yeah but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.950" end="00:53:19.059" style="s2">want the virus lovers out there getting</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.839" end="00:53:22.180" style="s2">on your case I am perfectly capable of</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.059" end="00:53:25.569" style="s2">really disliking mosquitoes and finding</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.180" end="00:53:28.359" style="s2">them fascinating and an admirable feat</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.569" end="00:53:31.480" style="s2">of inadvertent design but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.359" end="00:53:33.190" style="s2">better means more capable of making it</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.480" end="00:53:34.839" style="s2">farther into the future I&#39;m rooting</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.190" end="00:53:36.789" style="s2">against the making in the future but</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.839" end="00:53:38.950" style="s2">when they do it&#39;s better from their</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.789" end="00:53:40.569" style="s2">perspective and what it is trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.950" end="00:53:42.760" style="s2">which is the opposite of what we want it</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.569" end="00:53:46.390" style="s2">to do yeah so when it gets better we</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.760" end="00:53:48.700" style="s2">lose more you want out to get there we</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.390" end="00:53:50.619" style="s2">want to stop it&#39;s better strains it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.700" end="00:53:55.960" style="s2">better lineages in their tracks</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.619" end="00:53:58.029" style="s2">yes except that it is possible that it I</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.960" end="00:54:00.160" style="s2">don&#39;t think we&#39;re anywhere near this but</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.029" end="00:54:01.599" style="s2">it&#39;s possible it could go benign and do</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.160" end="00:54:05.200" style="s2">things that are better for it and less</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.599" end="00:54:08.799" style="s2">costly to us in which case we might root</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.200" end="00:54:11.980" style="s2">for that but but in any case you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.799" end="00:54:18.160" style="s2">a virus trying to lodge itself into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.980" end="00:54:19.690" style="s2">future and mutation is the recipe for</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.160" end="00:54:21.730" style="s2">discovery or it is the first ingredient</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.690" end="00:54:25.710" style="s2">in the recipe for discovery of new</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.730" end="00:54:28.210" style="s2">mechanisms and I must say that this all</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.710" end="00:54:30.970" style="s2">echoes back to the question of where</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.210" end="00:54:32.470" style="s2">this thing came from and why a rational</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.970" end="00:54:35.319" style="s2">person would conclude one thing or</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.470" end="00:54:38.920" style="s2">another one of the salient facts about</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.319" end="00:54:40.510" style="s2">this virus is that several versions of</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.920" end="00:54:43.270" style="s2">it showed up in several early patients</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.510" end="00:54:46.119" style="s2">in wuhan who all apparently had the same</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.270" end="00:54:49.390" style="s2">sequence suggesting that this was not</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.119" end="00:54:51.880" style="s2">the result of experimentation on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.390" end="00:54:53.859" style="s2">part of the virus but that it was good</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.880" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">to go with respect to moving from one</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.859" end="00:55:03.309" style="s2">person to the next so the question of</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:04.420" style="s2">new strains is tied up in the question</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.309" end="00:55:07.990" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.420" end="00:55:12.220" style="s2">how likely is this virus to acquire a</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.990" end="00:55:15.640" style="s2">mutation that makes it less simple for</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.220" end="00:55:17.769" style="s2">us to control mm-hmm and so the new</p>

<p begin="00:59:45.490" end="00:59:50.050" style="s2">guests really low risk walking in a</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.950" end="01:00:00.400" style="s2">he these are these are informed guesses</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.780" end="01:00:02.290" style="s2">and this feels like the kind of analysis</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.400" end="01:00:04.540" style="s2">that we are not seeing nearly enough of</p>

<p begin="01:00:06.640" end="01:00:12.160" style="s2">exposures and this is basically based on</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.990" end="01:00:13.330" style="s2">so you know opening a door frequently</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.160" end="01:00:16.890" style="s2">that&#39;s been used by other people yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.330" end="01:00:19.570" style="s2">your risk is a lot higher then if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.890" end="01:00:21.130" style="s2">open a door that&#39;s been that&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="01:00:22.780" end="01:00:27.970" style="s2">people that&#39;s riskier than touching a</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.970" end="01:00:33.790" style="s2">of people but door handles are less</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.300" end="01:00:35.260" style="s2">risky than hugging but the more people</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.790" end="01:00:36.700" style="s2">who have touched that door handle or</p>

<p begin="01:00:36.700" end="01:00:44.520" style="s2">the higher your risk is so there&#39;s a we</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.170" end="01:00:47.440" style="s2">heard early in this crisis a lot about</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.520" end="01:00:50.680" style="s2">the risk of exponential growth of</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.440" end="01:00:53.290" style="s2">infections and the flip side of that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.680" end="01:00:55.150" style="s2">exponential decay of viral particles and</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.290" end="01:00:57.070" style="s2">I know that we&#39;ve talked about this a</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.150" end="01:00:59.080" style="s2">few times on past live streams but</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.070" end="01:01:03.310" style="s2">exponential decay of viral particles</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.080" end="01:01:04.930" style="s2">means in short that even if someone who</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.310" end="01:01:06.400" style="s2">was actively shedding viral particles</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.930" end="01:01:08.650" style="s2">who was currently sick and is actively</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.400" end="01:01:11.680" style="s2">shedding viral particles delivered a</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.650" end="01:01:14.560" style="s2">package to your door and we know that</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.680" end="01:01:18.490" style="s2">viral particles can live in the theory</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.560" end="01:01:20.320" style="s2">on cardboard for up to 48 hours the</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.490" end="01:01:22.990" style="s2">chance that any of those actually shed</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.320" end="01:01:25.840" style="s2">out the cardboard is low but it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.990" end="01:01:27.280" style="s2">more likely that you will end up with a</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.840" end="01:01:30.280" style="s2">viral particle that is active that</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.280" end="01:01:32.590" style="s2">transfers to your skin within five</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.280" end="01:01:34.840" style="s2">minutes of that cardboard being touched</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.590" end="01:01:37.870" style="s2">by a person who&#39;s actively sick than an</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.840" end="01:01:40.660" style="s2">hour or two hours or six hours or 24</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.870" end="01:01:43.240" style="s2">hours such that yes it is theoretically</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.660" end="01:01:44.049" style="s2">possible that a viral particle could be</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.240" end="01:01:47.140" style="s2">detected</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.049" end="01:01:49.660" style="s2">48 hours later but the chances of you</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.140" end="01:01:52.359" style="s2">getting sick from that are far far far</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.660" end="01:01:54.699" style="s2">lower than 24 hours later and they are</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.359" end="01:01:56.259" style="s2">far far far lower than 6 hours and 12</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.699" end="01:01:57.489" style="s2">hours later six hours later basically</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.259" end="01:02:00.489" style="s2">the farther out you go you have this</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.489" end="01:02:02.349" style="s2">exponential decay over time just like we</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.489" end="01:02:04.089" style="s2">were predicting and we seem to have seen</p>

<p begin="01:03:28.839" end="01:03:34.599" style="s2">people get out of this is that there is</p>

<p begin="01:03:59.119" end="01:04:02.809" style="s2">these numbers are accurate but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.679" end="01:04:05.329" style="s2">saying that their source is high-quality</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.809" end="01:04:08.269" style="s2">and they stopped me in my tracks when I</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.329" end="01:04:10.459" style="s2">read them the first one was this is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.269" end="01:04:13.880" style="s2">Johns Hopkins researcher I believe has</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.459" end="01:04:16.429" style="s2">written a short letter objecting to some</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.880" end="01:04:19.309" style="s2">of the characterizations of how bad the</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.429" end="01:04:20.899" style="s2">pandemic is is that right right and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.309" end="01:04:24.079" style="s2">think this plays into the question of</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.899" end="01:04:27.439" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a time to go back to</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.079" end="01:04:31.880" style="s2">normally etc and the two statistics I</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.439" end="01:04:34.039" style="s2">recall were that kovat 19 is now the</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.880" end="01:04:37.999" style="s2">leading cause of death in the United</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.039" end="01:04:39.649" style="s2">States I find that very surprising and</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.999" end="01:04:40.729" style="s2">you know the naysayers will say that</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.649" end="01:04:46.039" style="s2">lots of things are being attributed to</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.729" end="01:04:48.409" style="s2">kovat 19 that that shouldn&#39;t be but but</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.039" end="01:04:49.789" style="s2">at the very least kovat 19 is killing a</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.409" end="01:04:51.619" style="s2">huge number of people</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.789" end="01:04:53.569" style="s2">if the metrics that are being used</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.619" end="01:04:55.789" style="s2">suggest that it is killing more people</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.569" end="01:04:56.899" style="s2">than any other cause of death it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.789" end="01:04:58.969" style="s2">killing guard &#39;less of whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.899" end="01:05:03.889" style="s2">that number is flawed it is killing them</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.969" end="01:05:05.989" style="s2">with the lockpick yes so the concern is</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.889" end="01:05:07.789" style="s2">not only do we have an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.989" end="01:05:11.509" style="s2">hazard if we would lift a lockdown where</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.789" end="01:05:13.759" style="s2">the virus gets more room to discover new</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.509" end="01:05:16.339" style="s2">ways of infecting people and jumping</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.759" end="01:05:20.929" style="s2">from one place to another but we have</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.339" end="01:05:22.099" style="s2">just the simple virus as it exists doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.929" end="01:05:24.859" style="s2">more of what it does and killing more</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.099" end="01:05:27.319" style="s2">people the other statistic was that</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.859" end="01:05:28.729" style="s2">something like 1 in 500 New Yorkers and</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.319" end="01:05:30.499" style="s2">I think this is New York City that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.729" end="01:05:35.259" style="s2">talking about but one in 500 New Yorkers</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.499" end="01:05:39.109" style="s2">has died from this yeah just 0.2% and</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.259" end="01:05:41.689" style="s2">that&#39;s not 8.2% case fatality rate that</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.109" end="01:05:44.089" style="s2">is a point two percent mortality rate in</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.689" end="01:05:46.339" style="s2">the population so if a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.089" end="01:05:48.649" style="s2">of New Yorkers have been exposed which</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.339" end="01:05:50.989" style="s2">no one thinks they have then that means</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.649" end="01:05:52.549" style="s2">ok 0.2 percent of people who have this</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.989" end="01:05:55.009" style="s2">thing die that seems kind of low and</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.549" end="01:05:56.719" style="s2">it&#39;s still not okay but there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.009" end="01:05:58.249" style="s2">no one thinks that a hundred percent of</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.719" end="01:05:59.839" style="s2">New Yorkers have had this thing no one</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.249" end="01:06:02.449" style="s2">even really thinks that 50% of New</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.839" end="01:06:04.669" style="s2">Yorkers have had it so if 2 percent of</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.449" end="01:06:06.859" style="s2">New Yorkers have had it and point two</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.669" end="01:06:08.510" style="s2">percent of New Yorkers have died from it</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.859" end="01:06:10.970" style="s2">that&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.510" end="01:06:13.280" style="s2">of people who have it are dying and if</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.970" end="01:06:14.330" style="s2">more percentage higher percentage than</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.280" end="01:06:17.240" style="s2">that of New Yorkers I&#39;ve had it which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.330" end="01:06:22.070" style="s2">probably true then that fatality rate</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.240" end="01:06:25.670" style="s2">goes down but one in 500 New Yorkers are</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.070" end="01:06:28.040" style="s2">dead in the last few months from this</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.670" end="01:06:30.290" style="s2">and again with the caveat around you</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.040" end="01:06:32.300" style="s2">from versus with this disease and all</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.290" end="01:06:34.400" style="s2">that but that is a staggering number</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.300" end="01:06:36.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a staggering number and if we if</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.400" end="01:06:38.420" style="s2">we&#39;ve misunderstood the Johns Hopkins</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.350" end="01:06:39.950" style="s2">report let us know what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.420" end="01:06:44.359" style="s2">misunderstood but it seemed fairly</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.950" end="01:06:47.980" style="s2">straightforward I guess the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.359" end="01:06:52.460" style="s2">conclusion of all of this I think is</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.980" end="01:06:54.770" style="s2">let&#39;s be let&#39;s be decent about it there</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.460" end="01:06:57.530" style="s2">is something unprecedented and</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.770" end="01:07:01.180" style="s2">frightening about the lockdown and its</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.530" end="01:07:06.130" style="s2">consequences the idea that we cannot</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.180" end="01:07:08.900" style="s2">gather in large numbers is frankly it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.130" end="01:07:10.760" style="s2">presumably unconstitutional on the other</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.900" end="01:07:14.810" style="s2">hand what we are facing is so serious</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.760" end="01:07:17.900" style="s2">that we are having to navigate with new</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.810" end="01:07:20.290" style="s2">tools against an enemy that doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.900" end="01:07:22.310" style="s2">about or care about the Constitution so</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.290" end="01:07:24.800" style="s2">I&#39;m actually gonna push back on that</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.310" end="01:07:26.420" style="s2">like we we need to go yeah but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.800" end="01:07:28.310" style="s2">think it is unconstitutional and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.420" end="01:07:29.750" style="s2">a good analysis out there by someone</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.310" end="01:07:32.060" style="s2">who&#39;s actually on the right it was a</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.750" end="01:07:33.170" style="s2">legal scholar that I don&#39;t have today</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.060" end="01:07:37.540" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know you&#39;re going to go</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.170" end="01:07:41.480" style="s2">there that says no actually in times of</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.540" end="01:07:46.190" style="s2">mass risk which is specifically Public</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.480" end="01:07:47.990" style="s2">Health the Constitution the government</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.190" end="01:07:50.660" style="s2">is allowed to expand its powers so long</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.990" end="01:07:52.820" style="s2">as it restrict its restricts its powers</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.660" end="01:07:55.369" style="s2">again once the threat has passed well</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.820" end="01:07:57.050" style="s2">let me say this I believe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.369" end="01:08:00.770" style="s2">probably true and we do this all the</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.050" end="01:08:02.300" style="s2">time but then the Constitution and I</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.770" end="01:08:04.550" style="s2">believe this is right has to be treated</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.300" end="01:08:06.260" style="s2">as a living document the right to bear</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.550" end="01:08:07.190" style="s2">arms doesn&#39;t imply the right to have</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.260" end="01:08:10.910" style="s2">nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.190" end="01:08:12.410" style="s2">so obviously discretion is the key to</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.910" end="01:08:14.200" style="s2">making the document work and in this</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.410" end="01:08:17.000" style="s2">case I think the point would be that</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.200" end="01:08:19.640" style="s2">discretion used properly means that this</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.000" end="01:08:20.850" style="s2">is to the extent that disappears to</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.640" end="01:08:23.460" style="s2">challenge</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.850" end="01:08:25.440" style="s2">constitutional provision it is warranted</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.460" end="01:08:27.060" style="s2">which does not make all such things</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.440" end="01:08:29.250" style="s2">warranted we&#39;ve seen lots of stuff in</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.060" end="01:08:31.680" style="s2">light of terrorism where government</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.250" end="01:08:35.490" style="s2">overreach has been extreme and without</p>

<p begin="01:08:35.490" end="01:08:39.300" style="s2">gonna take a break for 15 minutes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.320" end="01:08:41.540" style="s2">gonna come back with Q&amp;A from super</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.300" end="01:08:45.690" style="s2">check questions if did they come in Zach</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.540" end="01:08:47.340" style="s2">yeah okay excellent and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.690" end="01:08:49.859" style="s2">start though we&#39;re gonna start the Q&amp;A</p>
