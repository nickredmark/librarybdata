<p begin="00:01:02.400" end="00:01:07.259" style="s2">that there seemed to be a growing</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">confluence between people who are</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.259" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2">interested in Buddhism and people who</p>

<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:17.730" style="s2">talk a little bit later as we go on what</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.980" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">cognitive science is but you know some</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.730" end="00:01:21.120" style="s2">of this already in the world at large</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:22.680" style="s2">because we&#39;re going through what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.120" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">called the mindfulness revolution</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.680" end="00:01:25.850" style="s2">mindfulness is being spoken of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:28.229" style="s2">everywhere I was in a bookstore</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.850" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">yesterday chapters and there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.229" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">section just on mindfulness itself so</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">why is the mindfulness revolution</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:35.340" style="s2">occurring well it&#39;s occurring</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:37.979" style="s2">particularly because of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.340" end="00:01:39.720" style="s2">intersection between Buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.979" end="00:01:42.930" style="s2">cognitive science but why is this</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.720" end="00:01:45.870" style="s2">happening and why is it you know so</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.930" end="00:01:47.909" style="s2">explosive in nature and what do we mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.870" end="00:01:49.440" style="s2">by mindfulness some of the work I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.909" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">done is trying to get clear about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.440" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about that in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:59.430" style="s2">in this series now there is also a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:02.369" style="s2">of other things that in my mind seem to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.430" end="00:02:04.049" style="s2">be convergent with this growing</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.369" end="00:02:06.689" style="s2">confluence between Buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.049" end="00:02:09.750" style="s2">cognitive science there is an increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:11.610" style="s2">interest both academically and in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:13.799" style="s2">public at large and the topic of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.610" end="00:02:16.260" style="s2">something that people did not talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.799" end="00:02:18.870" style="s2">very much not that long ago well the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.260" end="00:02:20.230" style="s2">wisdom is now a very hot topic within</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.870" end="00:02:23.620" style="s2">psychology and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.230" end="00:02:26.709" style="s2">and books offering to train you in</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.620" end="00:02:29.080" style="s2">wisdom are again becoming popular same</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.709" end="00:02:32.580" style="s2">bookstore experience yesterday I bought</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.080" end="00:02:36.250" style="s2">my son a book called how to be a stoic</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.580" end="00:02:37.989" style="s2">this is a this is like how is it that a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.250" end="00:02:40.360" style="s2">philosophical position from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.989" end="00:02:43.450" style="s2">Hellenistic era has become a popular</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.450" end="00:02:51.129" style="s2">there this hunger for wisdom and why are</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.709" end="00:02:51.730" style="s2">people meeting it with these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.129" end="00:02:54.459" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.730" end="00:02:56.260" style="s2">the stoicism the philosophies of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.459" end="00:02:57.940" style="s2">Hellenistic period we&#39;re gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.260" end="00:02:59.220" style="s2">about that I think there&#39;s good reason</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.940" end="00:03:01.510" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.220" end="00:03:04.840" style="s2">of course there&#39;s increasing academic</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.510" end="00:03:09.459" style="s2">and public interest in psychedelics I</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.840" end="00:03:13.000" style="s2">just gave a talk earlier this week</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.459" end="00:03:15.489" style="s2">Yale about psychedelics and the</p>

<p begin="00:03:15.489" end="00:03:19.450" style="s2">psychedelic experiences you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.799" end="00:03:21.489" style="s2">radical things with them people can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.450" end="00:03:24.060" style="s2">released from treatment-resistant</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.489" end="00:03:26.700" style="s2">addiction they can overcome</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.060" end="00:03:31.319" style="s2">post-traumatic stress disorder like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.700" end="00:03:33.250" style="s2">normal with the best therapy right</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.319" end="00:03:35.190" style="s2">solution rate for people with</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.250" end="00:03:38.470" style="s2">post-traumatic stress disorders about</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.190" end="00:03:41.410" style="s2">right you know things go really well 20%</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.470" end="00:03:43.750" style="s2">or so you introduce psychedelics into</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.410" end="00:03:47.549" style="s2">the therapy and you can get the right</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.750" end="00:03:49.900" style="s2">the healing rate up to 80 percent so</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.549" end="00:03:55.019" style="s2">what&#39;s going on there why is there this</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.900" end="00:03:59.440" style="s2">interest there&#39;s increasing public</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.019" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">interest which is matched by a huge</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.440" end="00:04:05.079" style="s2">academic in in the topics of happiness</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:07.389" style="s2">now we&#39;ve always been a happiness</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.079" end="00:04:09.849" style="s2">oriented culture life liberty and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.389" end="00:04:12.010" style="s2">pursuit of happiness and so forth right</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.849" end="00:04:14.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s taken a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.010" end="00:04:16.780" style="s2">interesting turn the topic of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.440" end="00:04:19.599" style="s2">and meaning in life is coming to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.780" end="00:04:20.739" style="s2">fore people in more and more are talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.599" end="00:04:23.800" style="s2">about not just sort of sheer</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.739" end="00:04:26.200" style="s2">contentedness but what it is for a human</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.800" end="00:04:29.050" style="s2">life to be meaningful and it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.200" end="00:04:31.390" style="s2">that meaning in life is terrifically</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.050" end="00:04:32.020" style="s2">important it&#39;s very predictive of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.390" end="00:04:33.730" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.020" end="00:04:36.310" style="s2">it&#39;s very predict</p>

<p begin="00:04:36.310" end="00:04:41.740" style="s2">in general so it is no wonder that our</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.950" end="00:04:43.420" style="s2">people are seeking it out now my my</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.740" end="00:04:45.100" style="s2">contention and what I&#39;m gonna argue is</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.420" end="00:04:47.470" style="s2">it&#39;s no coincidence that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.100" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">things are happening right now it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.470" end="00:04:52.420" style="s2">coincidence this confluence between</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:54.910" style="s2">Buddhism the mindfulness revolution the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.420" end="00:04:57.130" style="s2">interest in wisdom and ancient</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.910" end="00:04:58.570" style="s2">philosophies like stoicism the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.130" end="00:04:59.950" style="s2">increasing public interest in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.570" end="00:05:01.990" style="s2">psychedelics and transformative</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.950" end="00:05:03.070" style="s2">experiences and mystical experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.990" end="00:05:05.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.070" end="00:05:08.710" style="s2">the increasing academic and public</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.800" end="00:05:11.500" style="s2">interest in meaning in life there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.710" end="00:05:14.310" style="s2">a reason for there&#39;s there&#39;s a unifying</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.500" end="00:05:17.560" style="s2">account for why this is happening but</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.310" end="00:05:18.910" style="s2">there&#39;s another set of things this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.560" end="00:05:20.050" style="s2">sort of the light side of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.910" end="00:05:22.660" style="s2">talking about there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.050" end="00:05:26.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a set of dark factors that seem</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.660" end="00:05:29.110" style="s2">to be converging as well right we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.350" end="00:05:30.640" style="s2">what seems to be although they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.110" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">know people have disputing it but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.640" end="00:05:34.450" style="s2">think the evidence is becoming clearer</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.510" end="00:08:27.150" style="s2">one way you can note that is just by</p>

<p begin="00:08:43.830" end="00:08:49.710" style="s2">at one point right the you know movies</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.360" end="00:08:51.000" style="s2">demonstrating this had to be sort of</p>

<p begin="00:09:04.710" end="00:09:10.620" style="s2">going to argue throughout the course of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.050" end="00:09:16.310" style="s2">this series is that the positive factors</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.620" end="00:09:22.950" style="s2">and the negative factors all point to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.310" end="00:09:29.010" style="s2">unified explanation this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.950" end="00:09:31.050" style="s2">an idea that our culture is experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.010" end="00:09:33.210" style="s2">a profound meaning crisis a crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.050" end="00:09:38.430" style="s2">meaning and we&#39;re gonna have to talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.210" end="00:09:39.810" style="s2">about what does that meaning mean now</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.430" end="00:09:41.490" style="s2">I&#39;m not claiming that this is the only</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.810" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">crisis we&#39;re facing far from it what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.490" end="00:09:44.910" style="s2">want to do in fact is talk about how the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:48.330" style="s2">meaning crisis is interacting with other</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.910" end="00:09:51.840" style="s2">crises the environmental crisis -</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.330" end="00:09:54.960" style="s2">socio-economic crisis but in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.840" end="00:09:59.160" style="s2">those which are quite well discussed and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.960" end="00:10:01.320" style="s2">the public at large there is a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.160" end="00:10:03.030" style="s2">crisis which is being discussed quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.320" end="00:10:04.770" style="s2">significantly with that academia but</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.030" end="00:10:05.070" style="s2">needs to be brought to the public at</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.770" end="00:10:06.570" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.070" end="00:10:08.760" style="s2">because one of the things I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.570" end="00:10:10.440" style="s2">argue is that these three crises are not</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.760" end="00:10:11.880" style="s2">interesting not independent from each</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.440" end="00:10:17.240" style="s2">other they&#39;re interdependent in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.880" end="00:10:21.450" style="s2">important ways but what is this meaning</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.240" end="00:10:26.610" style="s2">that&#39;s coming to crisis why do we hunger</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.450" end="00:10:28.350" style="s2">for it how do we cultivate the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.610" end="00:10:31.260" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna argue wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.350" end="00:10:33.900" style="s2">ultimately about to generate enhance</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.260" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">this meaning wisdom is about realizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.900" end="00:10:39.960" style="s2">in both senses of the word becoming</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:42.000" style="s2">aware and making real it&#39;s about wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.960" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">is about realizing meaning in life in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.000" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">profound way how do we cultivate this</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:49.500" style="s2">wisdom what does it mean and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:51.150" style="s2">going to talk about that just</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.500" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">practically I&#39;m gonna talk of so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.150" end="00:10:54.210" style="s2">not just theoretically I&#39;m gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:57.180" style="s2">about that practically as well what are</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.210" end="00:10:59.810" style="s2">some practices that people can engage in</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.180" end="00:11:03.560" style="s2">and are engaging in to try and address</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.810" end="00:11:05.410" style="s2">this need for the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.560" end="00:11:08.410" style="s2">what role for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.410" end="00:11:16.419" style="s2">do mindfulness practices play within the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.410" end="00:11:17.709" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.419" end="00:11:19.569" style="s2">three questions that are we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.709" end="00:11:23.679" style="s2">keep coming back to again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.569" end="00:11:26.859" style="s2">again what is this meaning why do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.679" end="00:11:31.389" style="s2">hunger for it and how do we cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.859" end="00:11:32.679" style="s2">the wisdom to realize it so some of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.389" end="00:11:35.229" style="s2">topics of course we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.679" end="00:11:40.209" style="s2">addressing are centrally the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.229" end="00:11:42.549" style="s2">crisis how did this kind of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.209" end="00:11:45.699" style="s2">evolve what like what is it why is it so</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.549" end="00:11:46.919" style="s2">important to the evolution of our</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.699" end="00:11:49.419" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.919" end="00:11:52.389" style="s2">then more specifically the history of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.419" end="00:11:55.389" style="s2">the meaning crisis why did it arise what</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.389" end="00:11:57.069" style="s2">are the historical factors by doing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.389" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">we&#39;ll get in a historical accounted</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.069" end="00:12:00.519" style="s2">meaning we&#39;ll get a sense of what this</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.720" end="00:12:03.249" style="s2">meaning is that has come into crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.519" end="00:12:09.189" style="s2">that people individually feel they are</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.249" end="00:12:10.389" style="s2">lacking or losing in their lives we want</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.189" end="00:12:13.329" style="s2">to talk about connections between</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.389" end="00:12:15.279" style="s2">meaning wisdom and importantly self</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.329" end="00:12:17.169" style="s2">transcendence it&#39;s going to turn out</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.279" end="00:12:18.789" style="s2">that this notion of self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.169" end="00:12:21.009" style="s2">again which will have to develop and</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.789" end="00:12:23.589" style="s2">explicate be something that&#39;s a core</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.009" end="00:12:25.689" style="s2">need because it performs core functions</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.589" end="00:12:29.019" style="s2">for human beings and to bound up with</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.689" end="00:12:32.889" style="s2">these ideas of wisdom and of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.019" end="00:12:34.059" style="s2">meaning and along the way in fact right</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.889" end="00:12:35.439" style="s2">from the beginning we&#39;re going to start</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.059" end="00:12:37.539" style="s2">to see that there&#39;s deep connections</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.439" end="00:12:40.089" style="s2">between meaning wisdom self</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.539" end="00:12:44.109" style="s2">transcendence and altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.089" end="00:12:47.229" style="s2">consciousness why do human beings seek</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.109" end="00:12:48.879" style="s2">to alter their consciousness in fact not</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.229" end="00:12:51.669" style="s2">just human beings are there intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.879" end="00:12:54.129" style="s2">organisms seek to do this right</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:05.619" style="s2">of consciousness what is going on why</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.089" end="00:13:07.359" style="s2">does intelligence need to be conjoined</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.619" end="00:13:08.769" style="s2">to an altered state of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.359" end="00:13:12.039" style="s2">why in particular have human beings</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.769" end="00:13:14.439" style="s2">developed very sophisticated processes</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.039" end="00:13:16.600" style="s2">for generating harnessing and</p>

<p begin="00:13:45.010" end="00:13:49.990" style="s2">more important and transformative but</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.640" end="00:14:04.420" style="s2">from the mystical experience and say</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.730" end="00:19:21.889" style="s2">gonna have to have a much more expanded</p>

<p begin="00:22:31.390" end="00:22:39.250" style="s2">build an argument to try and show how we</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.770" end="00:22:41.169" style="s2">can awaken from the meaning crisis how</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.250" end="00:22:42.970" style="s2">that meaning crisis interacts with the</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.840" end="00:23:03.910" style="s2">always do my best to offer rigorous</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.970" end="00:23:54.640" style="s2">have to introduce terms to you and I</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.190" end="00:24:34.180" style="s2">so I want to start with how and why is</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.770" end="00:24:37.630" style="s2">this meaning so so so much a part of our</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.180" end="00:24:43.570" style="s2">humanity why is its own in to our</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.630" end="00:24:47.740" style="s2">humanity so much and I think the thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.570" end="00:24:53.710" style="s2">that we wanted we want to understand is</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.740" end="00:24:55.900" style="s2">I have to start somewhere right and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.710" end="00:24:57.970" style="s2">can be misleading because I think and</p>

<p begin="00:24:59.980" end="00:25:03.490" style="s2">concerned with right I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.660" end="00:25:04.990" style="s2">continuum question I think the deep</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.990" end="00:25:10.090" style="s2">cognition go deeply back into our</p>

<p begin="00:25:10.090" end="00:25:16.990" style="s2">humanity but that&#39;s right so the fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.710" end="00:25:18.670" style="s2">that I&#39;m starting somewhere is not meant</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.990" end="00:25:20.710" style="s2">to indicate that this is the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.670" end="00:25:23.820" style="s2">starting point what I want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.710" end="00:25:26.800" style="s2">point to a time when many people think</p>

<p begin="00:25:26.800" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">now came into form not fully like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.560" end="00:25:36.430" style="s2">way it is now because of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:39.850" style="s2">been lots of historical and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.430" end="00:25:43.530" style="s2">processes but the kind of humanity that</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.850" end="00:25:46.570" style="s2">we would recognize as us and how much</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.530" end="00:25:48.850" style="s2">this was bound up with meaning making in</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.570" end="00:25:50.860" style="s2">the way that I&#39;ve been talking about so</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.850" end="00:25:56.280" style="s2">this period is known as the Upper</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.860" end="00:25:59.760" style="s2">Paleolithic transition it occurs around</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.280" end="00:25:59.760" style="s2">40,000 BCE</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:06.400" style="s2">now with interesting about this is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.790" end="00:26:09.600" style="s2">biologically as a species we had existed</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.400" end="00:26:12.850" style="s2">much longer than this we existed about</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.600" end="00:26:15.310" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a there&#39;s some controversy</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.850" end="00:26:21.850" style="s2">around this but conservatively since</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.310" end="00:26:26.640" style="s2">about 200,000 BCE but around again</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.850" end="00:26:31.510" style="s2">roughly 40,000 BCE there&#39;s a change a</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.640" end="00:26:33.070" style="s2">radical change now again picking a</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.510" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">Pacific time</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.070" end="00:26:37.509" style="s2">look like there&#39;s this there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:38.649" style="s2">before there are no precursors some</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.509" end="00:26:40.929" style="s2">people have presented the upper</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.649" end="00:26:42.250" style="s2">paleolithic transition that way I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.929" end="00:26:44.490" style="s2">doing that I think that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.250" end="00:26:47.529" style="s2">there&#39;s a continuum you can see it back</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.490" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">but at some point there&#39;s this radical</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.529" end="00:26:52.269" style="s2">change the upper paleolithic transition</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:55.210" style="s2">you see things human beings doing things</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.269" end="00:26:58.950" style="s2">they&#39;re not doing before they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.210" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">art they&#39;re making representational art</p>

<p begin="00:27:02.080" end="00:27:09.970" style="s2">cave paintings we have good evidence</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.450" end="00:27:15.070" style="s2">they start making music what else are</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.970" end="00:27:18.509" style="s2">they doing well we have some pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.070" end="00:27:20.500" style="s2">evidence all right that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.509" end="00:27:26.590" style="s2">significant enhancement in their</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.500" end="00:27:29.399" style="s2">cognition how do we know this well we</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.590" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">have the first use of calendars</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.399" end="00:27:33.759" style="s2">obviously not with numbers and dates</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:36.159" style="s2">because numeracy hasn&#39;t been invented</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.759" end="00:27:38.500" style="s2">but you have the symbolic representation</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.159" end="00:27:41.409" style="s2">of the phases of the Moon and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.500" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">passage of days and so human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.409" end="00:27:46.149" style="s2">keeping track of time across very</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:50.549" style="s2">abstract patterns so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.149" end="00:27:50.549" style="s2">enhance their hunting abilities</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.580" end="00:27:57.460" style="s2">something else is happening which again</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.539" end="00:28:01.629" style="s2">it&#39;s so intrinsic to our humanity we</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.460" end="00:28:04.600" style="s2">right we&#39;re developing projectile</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.629" end="00:28:07.860" style="s2">weapons we&#39;re developing projectile</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.600" end="00:28:10.990" style="s2">weapons so the Neanderthals who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.860" end="00:28:13.750" style="s2">contemporaneous with Homo sapiens at</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.990" end="00:28:16.539" style="s2">this time don&#39;t have projectile weapons</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.750" end="00:28:19.720" style="s2">their spears are thick shafted heavy</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.539" end="00:28:22.299" style="s2">stone they&#39;re thrusting tools we know</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.720" end="00:28:25.059" style="s2">that they were getting in close to their</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.299" end="00:28:27.070" style="s2">quarry because they have bone damage</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.059" end="00:28:28.990" style="s2">that&#39;s similar to the kind of bone</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.070" end="00:28:32.019" style="s2">damage we see in human beings who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.990" end="00:28:35.250" style="s2">involved in cowboy rodeos where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.019" end="00:28:38.669" style="s2">messing around with large angry mammals</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.250" end="00:28:42.940" style="s2">the Homo sapiens do something different</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.669" end="00:28:45.639" style="s2">they start to develop very thin Spears</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.940" end="00:28:46.790" style="s2">not with stone tips but with bone tip</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.639" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">and bone is much harder to</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.790" end="00:28:52.610" style="s2">use the point about these is right there</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:55.550" style="s2">very good is projectile weapons they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.610" end="00:28:57.920" style="s2">very light and human beings develop the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.550" end="00:28:59.570" style="s2">spear thrower and sling and they start</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.920" end="00:29:02.870" style="s2">to develop the ability to carry multiple</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.570" end="00:29:07.750" style="s2">missiles and project them at a long</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.870" end="00:29:09.830" style="s2">distance now that requires right</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.750" end="00:29:14.420" style="s2">increased development of your frontal</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.830" end="00:29:16.310" style="s2">lobe area which is going to turn out to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.420" end="00:29:20.540" style="s2">be of course very important as we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.310" end="00:29:21.770" style="s2">for enhancing your intelligence think</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.540" end="00:29:26.500" style="s2">about how deep this is in your cognition</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.770" end="00:29:28.490" style="s2">this idea of like throwing right right</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.500" end="00:29:30.440" style="s2">think about how you talk about how you</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.490" end="00:29:36.550" style="s2">have a project that you&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.440" end="00:29:38.840" style="s2">right project it&#39;s from your throwing or</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.550" end="00:29:40.910" style="s2">people will talk about oh they&#39;re over</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.840" end="00:29:46.730" style="s2">there there&#39;s an object that means</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.910" end="00:29:49.270" style="s2">thrown against or I&#39;m the subject that</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.730" end="00:29:52.700" style="s2">means thrown under all day long</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.270" end="00:29:56.120" style="s2">cognitively you&#39;re throwing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.700" end="00:29:58.880" style="s2">because this throwing task is such a</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.120" end="00:30:00.860" style="s2">complex task I mean we take it so</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.880" end="00:30:02.420" style="s2">trivial that you know there&#39;s a moving</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.860" end="00:30:04.250" style="s2">target and I throw something I can hit</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.420" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">it but if you try and build artificial</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.250" end="00:30:07.340" style="s2">intelligence to do that as the military</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:10.010" style="s2">is discovered that turns out to be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.340" end="00:30:11.810" style="s2">really really hard problem so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.010" end="00:30:14.510" style="s2">the projectile weapons are developing</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.810" end="00:30:18.410" style="s2">the kolender --ax the music the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.510" end="00:30:19.940" style="s2">sculpture the paintings all right what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.410" end="00:30:24.100" style="s2">going on why is all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.940" end="00:30:26.750" style="s2">exploding now notice how all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.100" end="00:30:29.330" style="s2">associated with different aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.750" end="00:30:31.910" style="s2">what we mean by meaning obviously</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.330" end="00:30:35.030" style="s2">there&#39;s art and there&#39;s music that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.910" end="00:30:37.370" style="s2">somehow meaningful but there&#39;s also time</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.030" end="00:30:39.170" style="s2">as being made more meaningful it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.370" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">measured and understood and calendars</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.170" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">and even time and space are now more</p>

<p begin="00:35:20.960" end="00:35:24.259" style="s2">makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.099" end="00:35:25.789" style="s2">you meet somebody like you do that you</p>

<p begin="00:35:25.789" end="00:35:31.489" style="s2">then they move it up and down right this</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.930" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">is the show you have no weapons</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.489" end="00:35:34.759" style="s2">this is allow the person to touch you to</p>

<p begin="00:38:25.069" end="00:38:29.930" style="s2">that shows that they&#39;re really committed</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.410" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">to you they&#39;re really committed to your</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.930" end="00:38:36.559" style="s2">group but what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:38.359" style="s2">cognitively what does it mean for what</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.559" end="00:38:40.069" style="s2">how the mind gets trained you have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.359" end="00:38:44.029" style="s2">really improve your ability to regulate</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.069" end="00:38:48.019" style="s2">your emotion you have to really improve</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.029" end="00:38:48.799" style="s2">your ability to do what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.019" end="00:38:52.009" style="s2">decentering</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.799" end="00:38:56.450" style="s2">to let yourself right be in the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.009" end="00:38:59.480" style="s2">other people a non egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.450" end="00:39:01.490" style="s2">perspective because what&#39;s important now</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.480" end="00:39:04.190" style="s2">is not it&#39;s not centered on you the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.490" end="00:39:05.569" style="s2">ritual centered on you but you through</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.190" end="00:39:10.640" style="s2">the ritual are being centered on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.569" end="00:39:15.910" style="s2">group so this is having again tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:15.910" style="s2">impact on your cognition</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.290" end="00:39:25.790" style="s2">now there&#39;s a third kind of ritual that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:31.160" style="s2">starts to emerge and it seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.790" end="00:39:33.560" style="s2">picked up on these cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.160" end="00:39:35.240" style="s2">enhancements that the trade rituals and</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.560" end="00:39:36.830" style="s2">the initiation rituals bring so I need</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.240" end="00:39:40.700" style="s2">to introduce an idea to you that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.830" end="00:39:50.510" style="s2">to become pervasive this is the notion</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.700" end="00:39:53.930" style="s2">of exaptation exaptation now originally</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.510" end="00:39:55.850" style="s2">this is an idea from biology but the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.930" end="00:39:58.250" style="s2">work of Michael Anderson has brought it</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.850" end="00:40:01.660" style="s2">directly into understanding how the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.250" end="00:40:04.550" style="s2">brain operates how cognition operates</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.660" end="00:40:08.140" style="s2">acceptation in biological terms is an</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.550" end="00:40:11.810" style="s2">evolutionary mechanism so for example</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.140" end="00:40:14.660" style="s2">I&#39;m using my tongue now to speak okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.810" end="00:40:17.450" style="s2">tongues did not evolve for speech if</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.660" end="00:40:19.490" style="s2">they did all the animals that had</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.450" end="00:40:22.940" style="s2">tongues would be speaking at you and</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.490" end="00:40:24.260" style="s2">that&#39;d be terrifying especially your cat</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.940" end="00:40:28.610" style="s2">your cat talks to you I&#39;m sure that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.260" end="00:40:31.430" style="s2">would be terrifying so what did tongues</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.610" end="00:40:32.750" style="s2">evolved for they evolved to move food</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.430" end="00:40:36.200" style="s2">around in your mouth they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.750" end="00:40:38.050" style="s2">flexible and they&#39;re poison detectors so</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.200" end="00:40:41.240" style="s2">they have all these does your last</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.050" end="00:40:42.770" style="s2">defense right for poison yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.240" end="00:40:44.150" style="s2">so they have all of these nerve endings</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.770" end="00:40:47.570" style="s2">so you have this highly sensitive highly</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.150" end="00:40:51.440" style="s2">flexible muscle now just because of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.570" end="00:40:54.830" style="s2">way we evolved this muscle is also in</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.440" end="00:40:57.230" style="s2">the air passageway because evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.830" end="00:40:58.700" style="s2">not an intelligent designer you use the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.230" end="00:41:01.370" style="s2">same tube for breathing and for food</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.700" end="00:41:02.630" style="s2">very bad design but nevertheless that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.370" end="00:41:05.270" style="s2">how it is so your tongue it can</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.630" end="00:41:07.070" style="s2">interrupt your airflow flexible</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.270" end="00:41:09.680" style="s2">sensitive muscle that can interrupt air</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.070" end="00:41:11.930" style="s2">flow that&#39;s what I need for speech so</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.680" end="00:41:14.240" style="s2">the tongue was exempted evolution didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.930" end="00:41:17.000" style="s2">have to make a speaking machine from</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.240" end="00:41:19.790" style="s2">scratch it took something that evolved</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.000" end="00:41:24.350" style="s2">for one purpose and was able to exact it</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.790" end="00:41:26.690" style="s2">and use it for another so what Michael</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.350" end="00:41:28.010" style="s2">and Anderson and others are arguing is</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.690" end="00:41:30.970" style="s2">very often this is what the brain does</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.010" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">the brain will develop</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.970" end="00:41:35.320" style="s2">and ISM a little machine a set of</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:37.690" style="s2">cognitive processes for doing one thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.320" end="00:41:39.220" style="s2">and then it will use how to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.690" end="00:41:41.110" style="s2">reuse that for something totally</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.220" end="00:41:44.950" style="s2">different we&#39;re going to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.110" end="00:41:48.190" style="s2">repeatedly through this series so what</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.950" end="00:41:49.660" style="s2">happens is that these enhance mental</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.190" end="00:41:51.550" style="s2">abilities that are coming out of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.660" end="00:41:54.040" style="s2">trading and initiation rich will seem to</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.550" end="00:41:57.540" style="s2">be taken up into another set of rituals</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.040" end="00:42:01.140" style="s2">exempted into that seemed to be also</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.540" end="00:42:07.810" style="s2">pervasive these are shamanic rituals</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.140" end="00:42:10.530" style="s2">these are shamanic rituals we know that</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.810" end="00:42:14.350" style="s2">the ability to become aware of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.530" end="00:42:16.980" style="s2">right to control the mind to control</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.350" end="00:42:19.510" style="s2">your emotions or being trained as I said</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.980" end="00:42:21.970" style="s2">we know that human beings just because</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.510" end="00:42:23.620" style="s2">and we&#39;ll see more about this later</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.970" end="00:42:25.480" style="s2">just because they&#39;re highly intelligent</p>

<p begin="00:42:51.340" end="00:42:56.470" style="s2">men&#39;s work shows that pervasive through</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.980" end="00:43:00.220" style="s2">hunter-gatherer groups are right</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.470" end="00:43:04.660" style="s2">shamanic individuals in fact the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.220" end="00:43:07.990" style="s2">is such a pervasive historical figure</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.660" end="00:43:10.350" style="s2">that I think you can make a good case</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.990" end="00:43:14.950" style="s2">that it has become an archetypal figure</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.350" end="00:43:18.220" style="s2">something like you know the wise old man</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.950" end="00:43:23.320" style="s2">so Yoda and Merlin these are all</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.220" end="00:43:25.420" style="s2">shamanic figures what we know about</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.320" end="00:43:26.650" style="s2">shamanism is that they&#39;re the best</p>

<p begin="00:43:26.650" end="00:43:33.700" style="s2">long time right and we&#39;ll talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.640" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">and why that&#39;s the case we know that if</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.700" end="00:43:37.900" style="s2">you got a shaman in your group it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:39.340" style="s2">going to help to reduce right discord</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.900" end="00:43:43.060" style="s2">within your group it&#39;s going to enhance</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.060" end="00:43:47.140" style="s2">I I&#39;m a scientist I don&#39;t believe</p>

<p begin="00:43:47.140" end="00:43:52.150" style="s2">things like that so I seek an alternate</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.170" end="00:43:53.590" style="s2">and mattress a no and Michael</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.150" end="00:43:56.140" style="s2">Winckelmann I seek an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.590" end="00:44:00.640" style="s2">explanation of why are shamans so</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.140" end="00:44:02.940" style="s2">effective what is going on and what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.640" end="00:44:06.820" style="s2">want to talk about is how central</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.940" end="00:44:10.030" style="s2">shamanism was to the Upper Paleolithic</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.820" end="00:44:11.500" style="s2">transition because a plausible case can</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.030" end="00:44:13.660" style="s2">be made that it&#39;s the advent of</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.500" end="00:44:16.900" style="s2">shamanism that helps to explain how</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.660" end="00:44:20.170" style="s2">human beings are capable of this sudden</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.900" end="00:44:21.640" style="s2">explosion in their cognition this of</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.170" end="00:44:23.260" style="s2">course the thesis is the thesis of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.640" end="00:44:26.230" style="s2">several people as I mentioned Michael</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.260" end="00:44:29.980" style="s2">Winckelmann did Lewis Williams and</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.230" end="00:44:31.350" style="s2">others mattress I know because here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.980" end="00:44:35.050" style="s2">the issue</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.350" end="00:44:38.020" style="s2">right it&#39;s not a hardware changed the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.050" end="00:44:39.850" style="s2">brain has already existed for a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.020" end="00:44:41.560" style="s2">and sixty thousand years it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.850" end="00:44:45.340" style="s2">changing significantly during the Upper</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.560" end="00:44:49.120" style="s2">Paleolithic transition it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.340" end="00:44:50.830" style="s2">likely that it&#39;s not a hardware change</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.120" end="00:44:54.010" style="s2">in the brain it&#39;s a software change in</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.830" end="00:44:55.510" style="s2">how human beings are using the brain and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.010" end="00:44:57.430" style="s2">what part of what I want to argue is</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.510" end="00:45:00.550" style="s2">that shamanism is probably playing a</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.430" end="00:45:03.040" style="s2">significant role and that software</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.550" end="00:45:05.020" style="s2">changed so now I need to introduce yet</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.040" end="00:45:08.470" style="s2">one more other term and again this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.020" end="00:45:11.970" style="s2">going to be important this is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.470" end="00:45:11.970" style="s2">of a psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.800" end="00:45:22.040" style="s2">okay so technology means the systematic</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.420" end="00:45:28.190" style="s2">use of a tool which is a tool right here</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.040" end="00:45:30.619" style="s2">right the first thing to understand and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.190" end="00:45:32.510" style="s2">this is Andy Clarke&#39;s phrase you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.619" end="00:45:35.240" style="s2">natural born cyborg your brain has</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.510" end="00:45:38.930" style="s2">evolved across several species to use</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.240" end="00:45:40.430" style="s2">tools in fact when you start using a</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.930" end="00:45:42.770" style="s2">tool even for a very short period of</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.430" end="00:45:45.950" style="s2">time your brain will start to model it</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.770" end="00:45:47.329" style="s2">as part of your body that is why you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.950" end="00:45:49.550" style="s2">do weird things like when you&#39;re parking</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.329" end="00:45:50.809" style="s2">your car you can feel where the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.550" end="00:45:54.470" style="s2">your car is and all that sort of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.809" end="00:45:57.680" style="s2">you&#39;re a natural-born cyborg you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.470" end="00:46:00.950" style="s2">evolved to be integrated with machines</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.680" end="00:46:04.339" style="s2">look at me I&#39;m a cyborg look at this</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.950" end="00:46:08.089" style="s2">around me the only thing that&#39;s natural</p>

<p begin="00:46:08.089" end="00:46:12.349" style="s2">else is a tool everything else is these</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.390" end="00:46:16.069" style="s2">are tools</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.349" end="00:46:18.230" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t born with clothing I used this</p>

<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:38.059" style="s2">tools now what&#39;s interesting is that can</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.109" end="00:46:40.849" style="s2">be accepted your brain&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.059" end="00:46:47.299" style="s2">attach to a tool can move off of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.849" end="00:46:53.510" style="s2">physical thing onto a cognitive thing so</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.299" end="00:46:56.119" style="s2">a physical tool fits your biology C fits</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.510" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">your biology and enhances it right I can</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.119" end="00:47:00.470" style="s2">leave permanent marks that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:03.140" style="s2">otherwise do biologically on this board</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.470" end="00:47:05.000" style="s2">I have a bottle it fits my hand and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.140" end="00:47:06.200" style="s2">can carry liquids around if I had to</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.000" end="00:47:10.040" style="s2">carry it like that&#39;s the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.200" end="00:47:11.930" style="s2">liquid I can carry is minimal it fits</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.040" end="00:47:16.280" style="s2">your biology and enhances it a psycho</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.930" end="00:47:18.770" style="s2">technology fits your brain and enhances</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.280" end="00:47:19.849" style="s2">how it operates and you say what are you</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.849" end="00:47:27.010" style="s2">now look here&#39;s one right here</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.220" end="00:47:30.920" style="s2">it&#39;s called literacy you&#39;re not born</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.010" end="00:47:34.370" style="s2">literate you&#39;re born linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.920" end="00:47:36.380" style="s2">you&#39;re born learning how to talk right</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.370" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">Noam Chomsky all that sort of thing but</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.380" end="00:47:40.340" style="s2">you&#39;re not born literate in fact for</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:42.430" style="s2">most of our history we were completely</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.340" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">illiterate</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.430" end="00:47:48.550" style="s2">what does literacy do for you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.280" end="00:47:51.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a standard set of tools that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.550" end="00:47:54.500" style="s2">standardize how you process information</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.640" end="00:47:58.040" style="s2">notice is how it enhances your cognition</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.500" end="00:48:00.590" style="s2">I don&#39;t have to hold all these terms in</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.040" end="00:48:06.650" style="s2">my mind I can leave them there on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.590" end="00:48:08.360" style="s2">board I can write stuff down and come</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.650" end="00:48:11.570" style="s2">back to it later so notice what I can do</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.360" end="00:48:13.700" style="s2">I can take my brain now and link it to</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.570" end="00:48:16.700" style="s2">my brain back then and my brain in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.700" end="00:48:18.350" style="s2">future so those are I&#39;m networking all</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.700" end="00:48:21.800" style="s2">these instances together I&#39;m improving</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.350" end="00:48:26.030" style="s2">my cognition I can also network my brain</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.800" end="00:48:28.550" style="s2">with your brain and improve my ability</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.030" end="00:48:30.830" style="s2">to solve probably think of if I were to</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.550" end="00:48:32.780" style="s2">do this to you I&#39;m gonna take literacy</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.830" end="00:48:34.130" style="s2">out of your brain right now and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.780" end="00:48:39.200" style="s2">can&#39;t and I mean literacy in your head</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.130" end="00:48:41.540" style="s2">too you can&#39;t imagine words you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.200" end="00:48:43.520" style="s2">put stuff on paper you can&#39;t reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.540" end="00:48:48.440" style="s2">your own cognition I take that out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.520" end="00:48:51.350" style="s2">you your brain is the same hardware but</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.440" end="00:48:52.900" style="s2">then the problems you can solve collapse</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.350" end="00:48:55.820" style="s2">down dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.900" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">that&#39;s what psycho technologies do they</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.820" end="00:49:04.820" style="s2">do they enhance the software of your</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.520" end="00:49:07.340" style="s2">mission of your cognitive machinery now</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.820" end="00:49:10.910" style="s2">shamanism is a set of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.340" end="00:49:12.980" style="s2">technologies for altering your state of</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.910" end="00:49:19.360" style="s2">consciousness and enhancing your</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.980" end="00:49:21.700" style="s2">cognition so what does</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.360" end="00:49:25.890" style="s2">what does shamanism look like what are</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.700" end="00:49:30.010" style="s2">the kinds of things you do when write</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.890" end="00:49:32.200" style="s2">you&#39;re a shaman there are many people of</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.010" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">course claimed to be practicing</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.200" end="00:49:37.690" style="s2">shamanism today and that&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:39.250" style="s2">why this rise in neo shamanism what are</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.690" end="00:49:50.620" style="s2">people thinking they&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.250" end="00:49:53.170" style="s2">from it okay so the shaman does a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.620" end="00:50:00.310" style="s2">interesting things in order to get into</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.170" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">a particular state so the shaman will</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.310" end="00:50:08.530" style="s2">often engage in things like sleep</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:14.830" style="s2">deprivation intense long periods hours</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.530" end="00:50:19.840" style="s2">of singing dancing chanting the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.830" end="00:50:22.960" style="s2">will often engage in imitation put on</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.840" end="00:50:28.050" style="s2">the clothing mask that represents some</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.960" end="00:50:30.520" style="s2">other figures some other animal right</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.050" end="00:50:33.640" style="s2">sometime the shaman will go into periods</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.520" end="00:50:40.020" style="s2">of isolation social isolation go out</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.640" end="00:50:43.090" style="s2">into the wilderness and of course</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.020" end="00:50:44.920" style="s2">although it&#39;s not necessary but it has</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.090" end="00:50:48.310" style="s2">been pervasive shamans will make use of</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.920" end="00:50:53.040" style="s2">psychedelics in order to help bring</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.310" end="00:50:56.370" style="s2">about an altered state of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.040" end="00:50:56.370" style="s2">so so</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.410" end="00:51:03.350" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here Steve Taylor in his</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.250" end="00:51:05.720" style="s2">book waking from sleep talks about these</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.350" end="00:51:07.340" style="s2">disruptive strategies that people even</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.720" end="00:51:09.400" style="s2">today use in order to try and bring</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.340" end="00:51:11.540" style="s2">about what I called awakening</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.400" end="00:51:14.240" style="s2">experiences these radical</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.540" end="00:51:19.940" style="s2">transformations in people&#39;s sense of</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.240" end="00:51:25.060" style="s2">self and reality we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.940" end="00:51:28.460" style="s2">about that but one of the main ideas</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.060" end="00:51:33.890" style="s2">here is what a shaman is typically doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.460" end="00:51:35.180" style="s2">is trying to disrupt the normal ways in</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.890" end="00:51:39.620" style="s2">which you&#39;re finding patterns in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.180" end="00:51:41.090" style="s2">world why would you want to disrupt the</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.620" end="00:51:44.810" style="s2">normal way you find patterns in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.090" end="00:51:46.790" style="s2">world because the way you find patterns</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.810" end="00:51:48.620" style="s2">and member I said this the very thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.790" end="00:51:52.610" style="s2">that makes you adaptive also makes you</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.620" end="00:51:56.530" style="s2">subject to self-deception the way you</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.610" end="00:52:00.290" style="s2">find patterns right is very profound</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.530" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">so this is something I study as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.290" end="00:52:07.820" style="s2">scientist right many of you may have</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:10.280" style="s2">seen this all right so this is called</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.820" end="00:52:13.010" style="s2">the nine dot problem you have to join</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.280" end="00:52:16.190" style="s2">all nine dots with four straight lines</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.010" end="00:52:17.570" style="s2">you have to start the next line from the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.190" end="00:52:19.430" style="s2">terminus of the previous line then what</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.570" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">people see this they initially say well</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.430" end="00:52:22.160" style="s2">this is very easy of course I can do</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:26.330" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.160" end="00:52:29.450" style="s2">right one two three four oh wait I</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.330" end="00:52:33.530" style="s2">missed the middle dot okay one two three</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.450" end="00:52:36.020" style="s2">wait one two wait one two and then they</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.530" end="00:52:37.820" style="s2">pause this actually turns out to be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.020" end="00:52:40.550" style="s2">very difficult problem for people to</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.820" end="00:52:42.470" style="s2">solve joining all nine dots with four</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.550" end="00:52:47.030" style="s2">straight lines but why is it hard one</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.470" end="00:52:50.750" style="s2">line two lines three lines four lines</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.030" end="00:52:52.070" style="s2">what was hard about that and when you do</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.750" end="00:52:54.680" style="s2">that of course people get angry at you</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.070" end="00:52:57.590" style="s2">they say you cheated you went outside</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.680" end="00:52:59.120" style="s2">the box you went outside the square</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.590" end="00:53:04.940" style="s2">that&#39;s where think outside the box comes</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.120" end="00:53:07.619" style="s2">from now why that was hard is because</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.940" end="00:53:12.739" style="s2">you projected a pattern here</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.619" end="00:53:17.160" style="s2">the square and then you engaged</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.739" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">unconsciously unconsciously your skills</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.160" end="00:53:21.299" style="s2">of connecting the dots when you were a</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">kid you connected the dots and when you</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.299" end="00:53:26.160" style="s2">connect the dots you&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:27.630" style="s2">do this make a non dot turn you do that</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.160" end="00:53:29.400" style="s2">you won&#39;t get a picture of a picnic</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.630" end="00:53:35.390" style="s2">table you&#39;ll get like an acid trip</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.400" end="00:53:38.489" style="s2">psychedelic thing right so unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.390" end="00:53:41.309" style="s2">you project a pattern and then you</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.489" end="00:53:44.279" style="s2">activate the appropriate skills and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.309" end="00:53:45.989" style="s2">you&#39;re locked and you&#39;re blocked you</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.279" end="00:53:48.930" style="s2">can&#39;t solve that problem not because of</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.989" end="00:53:50.670" style="s2">anything there in the data but because</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.930" end="00:53:53.940" style="s2">of the way you have framed it you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.670" end="00:53:55.650" style="s2">to disrupt your framing we&#39;re gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.940" end="00:53:58.589" style="s2">a lot about that in order to get an</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.650" end="00:54:01.109" style="s2">insight in order to get an insight now</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.589" end="00:54:04.619" style="s2">let me tell you something again to start</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.109" end="00:54:07.499" style="s2">to introduce this to you saying to</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.619" end="00:54:08.549" style="s2">people think outside the box and this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.499" end="00:54:10.170" style="s2">kind of funny if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.549" end="00:54:13.190" style="s2">saying to people think outside the box</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.170" end="00:54:16.440" style="s2">does not help them with this problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.190" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">giving them the belief that they have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.440" end="00:54:23.640" style="s2">go outside the box does not help them to</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:25.979" style="s2">solve this problem that&#39;s what I meant</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.640" end="00:54:30.710" style="s2">when I said you shouldn&#39;t reduce all of</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.979" end="00:54:33.989" style="s2">your sense of knowing to believing</p>
