<p begin="00:00:00.110" end="00:00:06.420" style="s2">so hi everyone this is Joe Brewer here</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.259" end="00:00:09.660" style="s2">this morning I&#39;m working on creating a</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.420" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">detailed outline for bioregional</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.660" end="00:00:15.330" style="s2">regeneration course and I wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:18.150" style="s2">to you a little bit about why I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:21.390" style="s2">this and how the people that I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.150" end="00:00:23.789" style="s2">with really need it and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.390" end="00:00:25.619" style="s2">difficult to put together so far so</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.789" end="00:00:27.869" style="s2">first of all you&#39;re all aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.619" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">global crisis that were in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:32.460" style="s2">people frame it in ways around up</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:34.829" style="s2">pulling carbon dioxide out of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.460" end="00:00:37.739" style="s2">atmosphere and you know maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.829" end="00:00:39.540" style="s2">biodiversity and you know the other</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.739" end="00:00:42.360" style="s2">pieces that are really difficult to wrap</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.540" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">your head around from a systemic point</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.360" end="00:00:49.050" style="s2">of view it turns out there is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:53.969" style="s2">body of thinking and practice that goes</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.050" end="00:00:57.239" style="s2">back literally decades about how to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.969" end="00:00:59.850" style="s2">design work and restoration work at a</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.239" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">regional scale and this is everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.850" end="00:01:06.450" style="s2">from cleaning up the water in an entire</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">watershed managing the hydrological</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.450" end="00:01:12.500" style="s2">cycle of a mountain range trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:15.960" style="s2">preserve and maintain the health of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.500" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">fisheries and marine estuary of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.960" end="00:01:22.020" style="s2">ocean people have worked on these very</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">complex challenges for a long time in</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.020" end="00:01:26.580" style="s2">different parts of the world and I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:28.950" style="s2">surprised to learn just about two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.580" end="00:01:31.860" style="s2">ago that the place I grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.950" end="00:01:34.890" style="s2">southwest Missouri was the first place</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.860" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">that a bio regional conference was</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.890" end="00:01:41.070" style="s2">organized in the late 1970s around the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:43.710" style="s2">shared cultural identity and landscape</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.070" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">of the Ozarks these people were doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.710" end="00:01:49.229" style="s2">this work in the 1970s when I was just</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:51.090" style="s2">one year old so I&#39;m more than 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.229" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">old now this has been going on for</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.090" end="00:01:57.390" style="s2">decades what we&#39;re trying to do now is</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">take this bioregional way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.390" end="00:02:03.030" style="s2">that looks at how human societies are</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:05.939" style="s2">organized and in particular how they</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.030" end="00:02:09.170" style="s2">might potentially organize themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.939" end="00:02:12.140" style="s2">manage landscapes in their local areas</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.170" end="00:02:15.880" style="s2">that the work being done in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.140" end="00:02:18.740" style="s2">approach has mostly been project-based</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.880" end="00:02:21.230" style="s2">small-scale and difficult to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.740" end="00:02:23.540" style="s2">cooperation so you might find someone</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.230" end="00:02:26.830" style="s2">who&#39;s bought a twenty acre piece of land</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.540" end="00:02:29.390" style="s2">changed the way they do farming from</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.830" end="00:02:31.640" style="s2">industrial chemical based using</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.390" end="00:02:34.790" style="s2">petroleum and pesticides and herbicides</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.640" end="00:02:37.610" style="s2">to instead doing some kind of no-till</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.790" end="00:02:40.190" style="s2">organic gardening or organic farming or</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.610" end="00:02:41.660" style="s2">you might see some group that&#39;s taken a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.190" end="00:02:45.080" style="s2">piece of land and set it aside for</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.660" end="00:02:48.290" style="s2">conservation and done agroforestry and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.080" end="00:02:50.150" style="s2">reforestation things like this you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.290" end="00:02:52.760" style="s2">even this kind of work which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.150" end="00:02:54.470" style="s2">literally happening in thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.760" end="00:02:56.600" style="s2">places around the world most people</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.470" end="00:02:59.570" style="s2">don&#39;t know about it certainly it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.600" end="00:03:04.040" style="s2">recognized as a global movement so what</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.570" end="00:03:06.470" style="s2">we are doing is trying to address two of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.040" end="00:03:09.290" style="s2">the really critical pieces that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.470" end="00:03:11.830" style="s2">missing for going from decades of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.290" end="00:03:14.360" style="s2">thinking on regional scale work and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.830" end="00:03:16.790" style="s2">thousands of projects that are at a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.360" end="00:03:19.070" style="s2">smaller scale and there are two pieces</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.790" end="00:03:21.320" style="s2">that have been missing or that are not</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.070" end="00:03:25.700" style="s2">developed well enough for us to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.320" end="00:03:28.610" style="s2">larger scale impacts one of them is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.700" end="00:03:31.220" style="s2">focus on education when a group of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.610" end="00:03:34.010" style="s2">people set out to take a piece of land</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.220" end="00:03:36.920" style="s2">and start to regenerate it they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.010" end="00:03:39.620" style="s2">have other people around who have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.920" end="00:03:42.320" style="s2">knowledge and skill to just bring in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.620" end="00:03:44.750" style="s2">put them to work on the land and help</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.320" end="00:03:46.610" style="s2">them you know on that piece of land to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.750" end="00:03:49.700" style="s2">regenerate it there just aren&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.610" end="00:03:52.209" style="s2">people trained to do this so even if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.700" end="00:03:54.459" style="s2">were to have a kind of World War two</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.209" end="00:03:56.510" style="s2">mobilization for millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.459" end="00:03:59.269" style="s2">those people would have to be retrained</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.510" end="00:04:00.620" style="s2">and re-educated to do this because there</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.269" end="00:04:04.340" style="s2">just aren&#39;t enough people that know how</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.620" end="00:04:06.680" style="s2">so we found there&#39;s a huge missing piece</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.340" end="00:04:09.440" style="s2">and the education and training of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.680" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">the second missing piece is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.440" end="00:04:14.930" style="s2">institutional coordination at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:18.109" style="s2">regional scale and what I mean by this</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.930" end="00:04:20.489" style="s2">is bringing together a diverse set of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.109" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">people who live and work in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.489" end="00:04:29.789" style="s2">place convening them helping them to map</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">out the ecosystems the social systems of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.789" end="00:04:34.830" style="s2">food production and energy production</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:36.270" style="s2">transport the history of the culture and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.830" end="00:04:38.819" style="s2">how it&#39;s been managed in that place</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.270" end="00:04:41.069" style="s2">throughout time all of that coordination</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.819" end="00:04:44.520" style="s2">and mapping has not been done in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.069" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">systematic way in most places and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.520" end="00:04:49.949" style="s2">to coordinate and facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:52.889" style="s2">decision-making creating scenarios of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.949" end="00:04:55.889" style="s2">the future managing and planning how</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.889" end="00:04:58.380" style="s2">those scenarios relate to any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.889" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">shared agenda that a group of people in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.380" end="00:05:02.639" style="s2">the place might create and try to enact</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:06.210" style="s2">and then that leads very quickly into</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.639" end="00:05:09.030" style="s2">questions of funding and jurisdiction or</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.210" end="00:05:10.620" style="s2">who has the responsibility and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.030" end="00:05:13.139" style="s2">empowerment to make different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.620" end="00:05:15.509" style="s2">decisions how do they relate to systemic</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.139" end="00:05:18.210" style="s2">problems in the region there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.509" end="00:05:20.610" style="s2">body of knowledge tools and frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.210" end="00:05:22.650" style="s2">for how to do this but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.610" end="00:05:24.389" style="s2">generally taught which gets back to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.650" end="00:05:27.000" style="s2">education piece and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.389" end="00:05:29.460" style="s2">structured as organizational capacity</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.000" end="00:05:32.580" style="s2">which is the institution building piece</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.460" end="00:05:35.550" style="s2">so these two pieces together have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.580" end="00:05:38.250" style="s2">missing in my work in the last two</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.550" end="00:05:40.490" style="s2">months with the regenerative communities</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.250" end="00:05:43.590" style="s2">Network I have gotten to have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.490" end="00:05:46.889" style="s2">first-hand account of some of the best</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.590" end="00:05:48.780" style="s2">bioregional work being done on earth not</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.889" end="00:05:51.750" style="s2">all of it but just the sampling of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.780" end="00:05:53.130" style="s2">there&#39;s really a lot going on and as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.750" end="00:05:55.830" style="s2">talking to people in different places</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.130" end="00:05:57.930" style="s2">and learning what they&#39;re doing I see</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.830" end="00:06:02.190" style="s2">that these two missing pieces are</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.930" end="00:06:05.430" style="s2">absolutely essential and so I have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.190" end="00:06:08.759" style="s2">tasked with the responsibility to help</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.430" end="00:06:10.849" style="s2">design a curriculum that begins to train</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.759" end="00:06:14.159" style="s2">people in bio regional scale</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.849" end="00:06:16.349" style="s2">regenerative design so there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.159" end="00:06:18.449" style="s2">of people already doing education in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.349" end="00:06:21.719" style="s2">this area and not pretending that this</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.449" end="00:06:24.180" style="s2">is the first or the only effort but it</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.719" end="00:06:26.969" style="s2">is an effort recognizing these two</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.180" end="00:06:29.690" style="s2">missing pieces while at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.969" end="00:06:31.400" style="s2">seeing that this regional scale work is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.690" end="00:06:33.830" style="s2">emerging</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.400" end="00:06:37.639" style="s2">ten times with decades of previous work</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.830" end="00:06:39.949" style="s2">in many places around the world and let</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.639" end="00:06:42.020" style="s2">me just give two examples to show how</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.949" end="00:06:45.320" style="s2">deep this is happening if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.020" end="00:06:48.199" style="s2">the area of Devon in England which</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.320" end="00:06:49.340" style="s2">includes the town of Totnes those of you</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.199" end="00:06:51.370" style="s2">who know the transition town movement</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.340" end="00:06:53.479" style="s2">well know that this is a place that</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.370" end="00:06:55.790" style="s2">permaculture has been applied at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.479" end="00:06:57.830" style="s2">community scale for more than a decade</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.790" end="00:07:00.260" style="s2">it&#39;s also an area that includes</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.830" end="00:07:02.840" style="s2">Schumacher College which has been</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.260" end="00:07:06.110" style="s2">convening systems thinkers and doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.840" end="00:07:08.810" style="s2">regional scale permaculture work going</p>

<p begin="00:08:10.370" end="00:08:18.039" style="s2">to the Incas and in some cases even</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.680" end="00:08:20.930" style="s2">earlier where they built very complex</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.420" end="00:09:37.370" style="s2">at some of the work in Colombia Brazil</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.279" end="00:09:40.100" style="s2">other parts of South America that this</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.380" end="00:09:58.910" style="s2">decades so just looking at these two</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.420" end="00:10:01.670" style="s2">examples where as you dive in you would</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.910" end="00:10:03.770" style="s2">quickly begin to learn that a huge</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.670" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">amount has already been done a huge</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.779" end="00:10:18.680" style="s2">and there are many other places that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.000" end="00:10:21.050" style="s2">aren&#39;t as far along as these two</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.680" end="00:10:22.820" style="s2">examples I just named that need to get</p>
