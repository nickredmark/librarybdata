<p begin="00:00:20.050" end="00:00:27.830" style="s2">Well, I’m speaking today with Dr. Stephen<br />Hicks, who is a professor of philosophy in</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.830" end="00:00:34.390" style="s2">the Department of Philosophy at Rockford University<br />in Illinois. Professor Hicks has written a</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.390" end="00:00:40.010" style="s2">book—he’s written several books—but<br />he’s written one in particular that I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.010" end="00:00:45.930" style="s2">to talk to him about today called Explaining<br />Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.930" end="00:00:52.309" style="s2">Rousseau to Foucault, which was published<br />a fair while ago now, in 2004, but I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.309" end="00:00:56.649" style="s2">has become even more pertinent and relevant<br />today.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.649" end="00:01:02.699" style="s2">I have talked a lot to my viewers about your<br />book, and so let’s talk about Postmodernism</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.699" end="00:01:10.820" style="s2">and its relationship with Neo-Marxism. So<br />maybe you could tell the viewers here a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.820" end="00:01:13.860" style="s2">more about yourself and how you got interested<br />in this.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.860" end="00:01:21.470" style="s2">Well, I finished graduate school in philosophy<br />in the early 90s, originally from Canada,</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.470" end="00:01:27.640" style="s2">born in Toronto. At that point Pittsburgh<br />and Indiana had the two strongest philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.640" end="00:01:30.899" style="s2">of science and logic programs, and that’s<br />what I was interested in at the time. And</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.899" end="00:01:35.970" style="s2">so upon a professor’s recommendation, I<br />ended up at Indiana, and it worked out very</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.970" end="00:01:37.770" style="s2">nicely for me.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.770" end="00:01:43.090" style="s2">So most of my graduate work was actually in<br />epistemology, philosophy of science, logic,</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.090" end="00:01:49.910" style="s2">some cognitive science issues as well. So<br />a lot of the epistemological and philosophical/linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.910" end="00:01:56.200" style="s2">issues that come up in Postmodernism—the<br />groundwork so to speak was laid for that.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.200" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">When I finished grad school and started teaching<br />full-time, came to Rockford University. I</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:06.840" style="s2">was teaching in an honors program, and the<br />way that program worked was—it was essentially</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.840" end="00:02:11.830" style="s2">a Great Books program—and so it was like<br />getting a second education, wonderfully. But</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.830" end="00:02:17.700" style="s2">the way it was done was that each course was<br />taught by two professors to our honor students.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.700" end="00:02:23.510" style="s2">So the professors would be from different<br />departments, so I was paired with literature</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.510" end="00:02:28.170" style="s2">professors, history professors, and so on.<br />And this was now the middle of the 90s.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.170" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">I started to hear about thinkers I had not<br />read. I’d kind-of heard about them, but</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:39.540" style="s2">now I was reading them more closely and finding<br />that in history and literature and sociology</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.540" end="00:02:47.240" style="s2">and anthropology, names like Derrida and Foucault<br />and the others, if not omnipresent, were huge</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.240" end="00:02:56.030" style="s2">names. So I realized I had a gap in my education<br />to fill. So I started reading deeply in them.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.030" end="00:03:02.870" style="s2">My education in some ways was broad in the<br />history of philosophy but narrow at the graduate</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.870" end="00:03:08.270" style="s2">school level and I had focused mostly on Anglo-American<br />philosophy, so my understanding of the Continental</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.270" end="00:03:15.430" style="s2">traditions was quite limited. But by the time<br />I got to the end of the 90s, I realized there</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.430" end="00:03:20.630" style="s2">was something significant going on coming<br />out of Continental philosophy. And that’s</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.630" end="00:03:24.380" style="s2">where the book [published 2004] came out of.<br />When you say significant, what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.380" end="00:03:25.380" style="s2">by that? Do you mean intellectually? Do you<br />mean socially? Politically? There’s lots</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.380" end="00:03:26.410" style="s2">of different variants of “significant.”When<br />you say significant, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.410" end="00:03:30.840" style="s2">Do you mean intellectually? Do you mean socially?<br />Politically? There’s lots of different variants</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.840" end="00:03:33.510" style="s2">of “significant.”<br />At that point, “intellectually.” This</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.510" end="00:03:40.390" style="s2">was still in the 1990s so postmodernism was<br />not yet (outside of, say, art) a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.390" end="00:03:47.099" style="s2">force, but it was strongly an intellectual<br />force in that. At that point, young Ph.D.s</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.099" end="00:03:54.900" style="s2">coming out of sociology, literary criticism,<br />some sub-disciplines in the law (if you’re</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.900" end="00:04:03.130" style="s2">getting Ph.D. in the law), historiography<br />and so on, and certainly in departments in</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.130" end="00:04:09.390" style="s2">philosophy still dominated by Continental<br />traditional philosophy: almost all of them</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.390" end="00:04:17.790" style="s2">are primarily being schooled in what we now<br />call postmodern thinkers, so the leading gurus</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.790" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">are people like Derrida, Lyotard, from whom<br />we get the label post-modern condition, Foucault</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:30.340" style="s2">and the others.<br />So maybe you could walk us through what you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.340" end="00:04:36.460" style="s2">learned, because people are unfamiliar ... I<br />mean, you were advanced in your education,</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.460" end="00:04:43.220" style="s2">including in philosophy, and still recognized<br />your ignorance, say, with regards to postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.220" end="00:04:48.779" style="s2">thinking, so that’s obviously a condition<br />that is shared by a large number of people.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.779" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">Postmodernism is one of those words like Existentialism<br />that covers an awful lot of territory, and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:58.630" style="s2">so maybe we could zero in on exactly what<br />that means, and who these thinkers were: Derrida,</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.630" end="00:05:03.050" style="s2">Foucault, and Lyotard, and what you learned<br />about them.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.050" end="00:05:08.779" style="s2">Fair enough. Well, all of the thinkers you<br />just named—they think broadly, they think</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.779" end="00:05:14.330" style="s2">strategically, and they do have a very strong<br />historical perspective on their disciplines,</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.330" end="00:05:19.189" style="s2">and at the same time they are trying to assess<br />where they think we are culturally, politically,</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.189" end="00:05:26.279" style="s2">socially—and all of them are making a very<br />dramatic claim: that to some extent or in</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.279" end="00:05:34.159" style="s2">some way Modernism has either ended or it<br />has reached its nadir, or all of the … kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.159" end="00:05:41.129" style="s2">of the pathologies and negative traits within<br />the modern world are reaching a culmination</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.129" end="00:05:47.389" style="s2">in their generation, and so it’s time for<br />us to both recognize that Modernism has come</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.389" end="00:05:52.460" style="s2">to an end, and that we need some sort of new<br />intellectual framework, a post-modern-like</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.460" end="00:05:57.210" style="s2">framework.<br />And the Modernism that they’re criticizing,</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.210" end="00:06:02.009" style="s2">how would you characterize that? That’s<br />Enlightenment values? Scientific rationalism?</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.009" end="00:06:06.820" style="s2">How would you characterize it, exactly?<br />All of those would be elements of it. But</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.820" end="00:06:12.589" style="s2">then of course there are some discipline-specific<br />differences: so literature people and philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.589" end="00:06:19.550" style="s2">people and historians will use Modernism slightly<br />differently. But the idea at core is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.550" end="00:06:27.910" style="s2">if you look at the pre-modern world—essentially<br />the world of the Middle Ages, say—that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.910" end="00:06:34.870" style="s2">was itself broken up by a series of revolutions:<br />the Renaissance, Reformation, Counter Reformation,</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.870" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">early scientific revolutions—and all of<br />this is going on in historically short chunks</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:44.159" style="s2">of time: 1500s and 1600s.</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.159" end="00:06:50.839" style="s2">And so if you look at both the intellectual<br />world and the social world, comparing, say,</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.839" end="00:06:58.580" style="s2">the 1400s with the 1700s, culturally and intellectually<br />you’re in a different universe at that point.</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.580" end="00:07:04.360" style="s2">So the features then of the modern world—now<br />I’m going to use my philosophical labels</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.360" end="00:07:12.499" style="s2">here—are that we are now naturalistic in<br />our thinking. We are no longer primarily supernaturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.499" end="00:07:17.379" style="s2">in our thinking. So we might still be open<br />to the idea that there’s a God or some sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.379" end="00:07:22.129" style="s2">of supernatural dimension, the way Deists<br />are, but first and foremost we’re taking</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.129" end="00:07:28.409" style="s2">the natural world as a more or less self-contained,<br />self-governing world that operates according</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.409" end="00:07:31.460" style="s2">to cause and effect, and we’re going to<br />study it in its terms.</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.460" end="00:07:37.560" style="s2">We’re not seeing the natural world as derivative<br />of a “higher” world or that everything</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.560" end="00:07:43.509" style="s2">that happens in the natural world is part<br />of “God’s plan” where we read omens</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.509" end="00:07:45.020" style="s2">and so forth into everything.</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.020" end="00:07:50.599" style="s2">So metaphysically then there’s been a revolution:<br />We’re naturalistic.</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.599" end="00:07:56.379" style="s2">Epistemologically—in terms of knowledge—there<br />also has been a revolution. How do we know</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.379" end="00:08:01.389" style="s2">the important truths? How do we acquire the<br />beliefs that we’re fundamentally going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.389" end="00:08:07.119" style="s2">commit our lives to? Well, by the time we<br />become Moderns we take experience seriously,</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.119" end="00:08:13.169" style="s2">personal experience. We do that more rigorously<br />and we’re developing scientific method (the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.169" end="00:08:19.389" style="s2">way of organizing the data), we’re taking<br />logic and all the sophisticated tools of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.389" end="00:08:22.819" style="s2">and developing those increasingly ...</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.819" end="00:08:26.770" style="s2">And so our opposition then is: Either you<br />know something because you can experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.770" end="00:08:33.210" style="s2">it and verify it for yourself, or we&#39;ve done<br />the really hard work of scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.210" end="00:08:38.320" style="s2">and as a result of what comes out of that,<br />that’s what we can call knowledge or our</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.320" end="00:08:39.320" style="s2">best approximation to that.</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.320" end="00:08:47.339" style="s2">And that’s also revolutionary because the<br />prior intellectual framework was much more</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.339" end="00:08:54.449" style="s2">intellectually authoritarian in its framework.<br />You would accept in the Catholic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.449" end="00:08:59.421" style="s2">the authority of the Church. And who are you<br />to question the authority of the Church? And</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.421" end="00:09:04.279" style="s2">who are you to mouth empirical-rational arguments<br />against the authority of the Church?</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.279" end="00:09:09.690" style="s2">Or, you take the authority of Scripture, or<br />you accept on faith that you&#39;ve had a mystical</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.690" end="00:09:11.310" style="s2">revelation of some sort.</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.310" end="00:09:17.620" style="s2">So, in all of those cases you have non-rational<br />epistemologies that are dominating intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.620" end="00:09:22.460" style="s2">discourse. That is all by and large swept<br />away in the modern world.</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.460" end="00:09:29.259" style="s2">Okay, so prior to the emergence of the modern<br />world, we’ll say, people are dominated essentially</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.259" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">by their willingness to adhere to a shared<br />tradition and that shared tradition is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:38.670" style="s2">tyrannically enforced. But there’s no real<br />alternative in terms of epistemology [epistemology:</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.670" end="00:09:39.670" style="s2">the theory of knowledge, especially with regard<br />to its methods, validity and scope: the investigation</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.670" end="00:09:41.560" style="s2">of what distinguishes justified belief from<br />opinion] let’s say. And then as the modern</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.560" end="00:09:48.509" style="s2">world emerges, people discover the technologies<br />of science and the value of rigorously applied</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.509" end="00:09:55.480" style="s2">method and the comparison of shared experiences<br />and that makes us technologically powerful</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.480" end="00:09:59.009" style="s2">in a new way and philosophically different<br />from what we were before. ]</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.009" end="00:10:04.270" style="s2">Yes, the shared tradition phrase that you<br />added there, that’s an important one. So</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.270" end="00:10:08.500" style="s2">I’d say in the early modern world there’s<br />not necessarily a skepticism about shared</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.500" end="00:10:12.870" style="s2">traditions—so there would be an acceptance<br />of shared traditions—but the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.870" end="00:10:18.860" style="s2">you would not uncritically accept your tradition.<br />You may accept your tradition, but only after</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.860" end="00:10:21.790" style="s2">you&#39;ve thought it through and made your own<br />independent judgment.</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.790" end="00:10:26.870" style="s2">Okay, okay, so you’re elevated to the status<br />of someone who’s capable of taking a stance</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.870" end="00:10:31.819" style="s2">with regards to the tradition, and assessing<br />its presuppositions and so forth.</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.819" end="00:10:34.640" style="s2">Absolutely.<br />So there’s an elevation of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:41.079" style="s2">and the critical intellect along with the<br />elaboration of the scientific method. Okay,</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.079" end="00:10:46.980" style="s2">so then we might note, perhaps, that that’s<br />a tremendously effective transformation, although</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.980" end="00:10:51.110" style="s2">maybe it leads in a somewhat nihilistic direction<br />metaphysically—we can leave that to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.110" end="00:10:56.019" style="s2">side. But it’s a very, very successful revolution,<br />because by the time, at least the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.019" end="00:11:01.399" style="s2">of the 20th century comes along, there’s<br />this staggering (and of course before that,</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.399" end="00:11:06.259" style="s2">the Industrial Revolution), there’s this<br />staggering transformation of technology and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.259" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">technological and conceptual power, and then<br />a stunning increase in the standard of living.</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:18.149" style="s2">And that starts at about 1890, to really move<br />exponentially in the 1890s, or at least to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.149" end="00:11:24.420" style="s2">get to the really steep part of the exponential<br />curve. Okay, so that seems to be going well.</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.420" end="00:11:27.829" style="s2">So what is it that the postmodernists are<br />objecting to precisely?</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.829" end="00:11:36.589" style="s2">Just on those two issues: (1) the metaphysical<br />naturalism, and then (2) the elevation of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.589" end="00:11:45.620" style="s2">kind of a critical empiricism and a belief<br />that we can, through science—even not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.620" end="00:11:51.110" style="s2">a science, but social scientists and so on—we<br />can come to understand powerful general principles</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.110" end="00:11:54.660" style="s2">about humanity and social systems.</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.660" end="00:11:58.290" style="s2">Those two revolutions both are then subjected<br />to counter-attacks.</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.290" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">And again, what happens in this case is there<br />is a revolution. Probably by the time we get</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:14.250" style="s2">to 1800—the height of the Enlightenment—there<br />are the beginnings of more powerful skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.250" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">traditions that come to be developed, so thinkers<br />are starting to say things like: Well, if</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:26.330" style="s2">scientific method at root is based on the<br />evidence of the senses—we observe the natural</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.330" end="00:12:31.140" style="s2">world: that’s our first point of contact—and<br />then on the basis of that we form abstractions,</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.140" end="00:12:37.050" style="s2">and then we put those abstractions into propositions,<br />and then we take those propositions and put</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.050" end="00:12:42.790" style="s2">them in networks that we call theories, and<br />so on—so we start to critically examine</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.790" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">each of the elements of scientific method,<br />and over time, weaknesses in the existing</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:55.920" style="s2">accounts of how all of those “rational operations”<br />work come to be teased out, and philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.920" end="00:12:58.740" style="s2">then starts to go down a more skeptical path.</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.740" end="00:13:07.320" style="s2">So if, for example, you take perception as<br />fundamental—it’s you know, the individual</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.320" end="00:13:11.889" style="s2">subject’s first point of contact with the<br />natural world—then you have to immediately</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.889" end="00:13:20.149" style="s2">deal with issues of perceptual illusions,<br />or the possibility that people will have hallucinations,</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.149" end="00:13:28.069" style="s2">or that the way you report your perceptual<br />experience is at odds with how I report my</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.069" end="00:13:29.420" style="s2">perceptual experience.</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.420" end="00:13:36.410" style="s2">Tell me if I’ve got this right. So, with<br />the dawning of the “Empirical Age,” let’s</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.410" end="00:13:42.639" style="s2">say, there’s this idea that you can derive<br />valid information from sense data—especially</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.639" end="00:13:47.240" style="s2">if you contrast that sense data rigorously<br />with that of others—okay? So that’s sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.240" end="00:13:49.500" style="s2">of the foundation for the scientific method<br />in some sense.</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.500" end="00:13:54.540" style="s2">But then—I think this is with Immanuel Kant—there’s<br />an objection to that, which is that, Well,</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.540" end="00:14:00.690" style="s2">you can’t make the presupposition that that<br />sense data enters your cognitive apparatus,</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.690" end="00:14:05.610" style="s2">your apparatus of understanding, without a<br />priori structuring, and it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.610" end="00:14:08.430" style="s2">that’s where the postmodernists really go<br />after the modernists. It’s that, given that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.430" end="00:14:14.540" style="s2">you have to have a very complex perceptual<br />structure (that modern people might say was</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.540" end="00:14:19.259" style="s2">instantiated as a consequence of biological<br />evolution), you can’t make the case that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.259" end="00:14:22.600" style="s2">what you’re receiving from the external<br />world is something like “pure information”:</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.600" end="00:14:30.470" style="s2">it’s always subject—to some very-difficult-to-delimit<br />degree—to “interpretation.”</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.470" end="00:14:34.770" style="s2">And then you also have to take into account<br />the fact of that a priori structure and what</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.770" end="00:14:41.100" style="s2">it might mean for your concept of “objective<br />reality.” And that’s Kant, I think, if</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.100" end="00:14:42.100" style="s2">I’ve got that right.</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.100" end="00:14:46.230" style="s2">Right. Well, the postmodernists will use both<br />of those strategies: (1) the anti-empiricist</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.230" end="00:14:50.910" style="s2">strategy, and (2) the anti-rationalist strategy.<br />And what’s important about Kant is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.910" end="00:14:57.959" style="s2">Kant is integrating both of those “anti”<br />strategies. So in the generations before Kant,</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.959" end="00:15:01.949" style="s2">the skeptical arguments about perception which<br />were directed against the empiricists … the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.949" end="00:15:06.310" style="s2">empiricists want to say that everything is<br />based on observational data, but then if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.310" end="00:15:11.500" style="s2">don’t have good answers about hallucinations<br />and relativity and illusions and so forth,</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.500" end="00:15:17.910" style="s2">then it seems like your intellectual structure,<br />whatever it seems to be, if it’s based on</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.910" end="00:15:22.860" style="s2">probabilistic or possibly faulty perceptual<br />data—then the whole thing is a tottering</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.860" end="00:15:23.860" style="s2">mess. [Empiricism: the theory stating that<br />knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.860" end="00:15:24.860" style="s2">experience. Empirical research, including<br />experiments and validated measurement tools,</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.860" end="00:15:25.860" style="s2">guide the scientific method.]</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.860" end="00:15:32.209" style="s2">And by the time we get to Kant, the Empiricist<br />tradition is largely unable to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.209" end="00:15:35.949" style="s2">those kinds of objections. And so Kant is<br />recognizing and saying: All right, we’ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.949" end="00:15:41.300" style="s2">been trying now for a couple of centuries,<br />we haven’t been able to do so successfully—we’re</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.300" end="00:15:43.249" style="s2">not going to be able to do so.</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.249" end="00:15:49.980" style="s2">Now, you also nicely emphasized that one of<br />the other responses had been on the Rationalist</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.980" end="00:15:55.790" style="s2">side, which is to say, “Well, no you don’t<br />start with pure empirical data—instead we</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.790" end="00:16:02.680" style="s2">do have perhaps some innate a priori structures<br />built into the human mind—how they got there,</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.680" end="00:16:08.550" style="s2">maybe they’re put there by God, maybe they’re<br />put there naturalistically or whatever—but</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.550" end="00:16:14.600" style="s2">what enables us to have legitimate knowledge<br />is that our empirical data comes in and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.600" end="00:16:20.360" style="s2">is filtered and structured by these pre-existing<br />cognitive structures as well.”</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.360" end="00:16:26.059" style="s2">Now the problem with that side of the line—and<br />this is also well worked out by the time you</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.059" end="00:16:30.639" style="s2">get to the Kantians—is to say: Well, if<br />you’re starting with in-built cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:35.309" style="s2">structures, and everything that comes in,<br />so to speak, goes through this structuring</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.309" end="00:16:41.949" style="s2">machine and you’re aware of the outputs—because<br />that’s what is presented to your mind—well</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.949" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">how do you know those in-built structures<br />have anything to do with the way reality actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:48.730" style="s2">is out there?</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.730" end="00:16:56.519" style="s2">It seems like then what you are stuck with<br />is the end result of a subjective processing,</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.519" end="00:17:00.699" style="s2">and there is no way for you, so to speak,<br />to “jump outside of your head” to compare</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.699" end="00:17:06.680" style="s2">the end result with the way the world actually<br />is, independently of how your mind has structured</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.680" end="00:17:07.680" style="s2">the awareness.</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.680" end="00:17:12.320" style="s2">So once again, you’re stuck in a rather<br />subjective place.</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.320" end="00:17:16.480" style="s2">And again, the importance of Kant here is<br />then he’s also looking at this more Rationalist</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.480" end="00:17:19.630" style="s2">tradition and he’s saying, Well look, again<br />we’ve been trying now for a couple of centuries</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.630" end="00:17:25.540" style="s2">to work these things out from Descartes to<br />Spinoza, Leibniz and the others, and Rationalism</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.540" end="00:17:30.930" style="s2">also has reached a dead end, so we’re not<br />going to be able to do so.</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.930" end="00:17:35.110" style="s2">So Kant is, in effect, standing at the end<br />of these two traditions and saying, “You</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.110" end="00:17:41.270" style="s2">know, the skeptics have it right on both sides:<br />both the Empiricist and the Rationalist traditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.270" end="00:17:47.230" style="s2">fail. There is no way for us to objectively<br />come to know an external reality. We’re</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.230" end="00:17:50.010" style="s2">stuck in some sort of deep subjectivism.”</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.010" end="00:17:55.580" style="s2">Okay, so I don’t know now whether to talk<br />a little bit about the American Pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.580" end="00:18:00.220" style="s2">approach to that, or whether to ... Maybe<br />we should go ahead and continue our discussion</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.220" end="00:18:02.880" style="s2">of the postmodernists, because they’re developing<br />these claims.</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.880" end="00:18:07.110" style="s2">Absolutely, and some of the postmodernists<br />do describe themselves as Neo-Pragmatists,</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.110" end="00:18:13.064" style="s2">like Richard Rorty for example. So yes, that’s<br />exactly a direction that’s worth going.</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.064" end="00:18:19.080" style="s2">Okay, okay. So my understanding of that, if<br />I was going to defend the Modernist tradition,</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.080" end="00:18:25.570" style="s2">let’s say, I would say that we have instantiated<br />within us an a priori perceptual structure</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.570" end="00:18:31.100" style="s2">that’s a consequence of millions—billions<br />of years for that matter—of biological evolution,</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.100" end="00:18:38.670" style="s2">and it has emerged in tandem with continual<br />correction of its presuppositions by the selection</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.670" end="00:18:45.400" style="s2">process. But it’s still subject to error<br />because we have a very limited viewpoint as</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.400" end="00:18:52.790" style="s2">specific individuals, and not only are we<br />limited, but we can also make, you might say,</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.790" end="00:18:57.180" style="s2">moral errors, and I’ll get back to that,<br />that cloud our judgment.</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.180" end="00:19:03.930" style="s2">And so, in an attempt to “expand our purview”<br />and rectify those errors, we do two things:</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.930" end="00:19:09.080" style="s2">(1) We test our hypothesis practically against<br />the world, which is to say, we say, “Here’s</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.080" end="00:19:13.630" style="s2">a theory of reality.” We act it out. If<br />the theory of reality is sufficiently correct,</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.630" end="00:19:18.670" style="s2">when we act it out, we get what we want, and<br />then that’s sufficient proof for the validity</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.670" end="00:19:22.110" style="s2">of the theory. It’s not absolute proof,<br />but it’s sufficient proof. And then the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.110" end="00:19:26.260" style="s2">other thing we do (and I think this has been<br />paid attention to much less except by thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.260" end="00:19:33.580" style="s2">such as Piaget) is that: (2) We further constrain<br />our presuppositions about reality with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.580" end="00:19:38.770" style="s2">necessity of constructing theories that are<br />also acceptable to the people around us.</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.770" end="00:19:46.251" style="s2">So they have to be integrate-able within the<br />currently existing social contract, and they</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.251" end="00:19:51.120" style="s2">have to be functionally appropriate in the<br />external world.</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.120" end="00:19:54.621" style="s2">And that’s a nice set of constraints, and<br />it seems to me that that, at least in some</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.621" end="00:20:04.301" style="s2">part, goes a long ways to answering the objections<br />to the limits of the scientific method that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.301" end="00:20:07.260" style="s2">have been discussed historically, and which<br />you just summarized.</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.260" end="00:20:17.590" style="s2">All right, I’m sympathetic to much of what<br />you just went through. In fact a five-point</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.590" end="00:20:21.390" style="s2">response to the kinds of arguments that have<br />been laid out, where you’re actually putting</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.390" end="00:20:28.680" style="s2">me in the position then of defending the postmodern<br />tradition about how it would undercut each</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.680" end="00:20:30.310" style="s2">of those components.</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.310" end="00:20:34.255" style="s2">So, if you take for example evolutionary epistemology<br />[epistemology: investigation into the origin,</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.255" end="00:20:36.990" style="s2">nature, methods and limits of human knowledge],<br />and you gave a nice sketch of one standard</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.990" end="00:20:43.260" style="s2">evolutionary epistemological frame in which<br />you say: Maybe we have in-built a priori structures,</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.260" end="00:20:49.020" style="s2">but we can rely upon them because here we<br />are standing at the long end of hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.020" end="00:20:55.170" style="s2">thousands or millions of years of evolution,<br />and they would not have survived or enabled</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.170" end="00:21:02.550" style="s2">us to survive had they not served some sort<br />of reliable cognitive role in accurately representing</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.550" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">the way the world works.</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:10.861" style="s2">This is actually too early for the postmoderns,<br />although the postmoderns will agree with this.</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.861" end="00:21:16.810" style="s2">This is to say that all of that kind of begs<br />the question in a very deep way against the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.810" end="00:21:24.610" style="s2">kind of skeptical objections that we’re<br />raising. Because in order to make that paragraph-long</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.610" end="00:21:30.540" style="s2">description of what evolutionary epistemology<br />is, what I have to do is take for granted</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.540" end="00:21:37.720" style="s2">basic assumptions, certain truths about the<br />world: that, for example, there is an external</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.720" end="00:21:45.960" style="s2">world; that we are biological creatures; that<br />we have in-built structures; that those structures</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.960" end="00:21:53.510" style="s2">are evolutionarily responsive and conditioned<br />by changing forces; and so forth.</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.510" end="00:21:59.990" style="s2">And if you take those assumptions to be true,<br />then as a consequence or as a conclusion,</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.990" end="00:22:08.690" style="s2">you can infer that therefore the intellectual<br />products that come out of our cognitive processing</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.690" end="00:22:12.710" style="s2">are reliable.</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.710" end="00:22:19.110" style="s2">But where did you get those four premises<br />from? How do you know that there is an external</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.110" end="00:22:25.310" style="s2">world? How do you know that we are biological<br />creatures? How do you know that evolution</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.310" end="00:22:29.970" style="s2">is true, with all of the historical knowledge<br />that’s necessary to reach the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.970" end="00:22:37.510" style="s2">that evolution is true? All of that presupposes<br />that we have legitimate cognitive methods</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.510" end="00:22:42.790" style="s2">to come to understand the world. But our having<br />legitimate cognitive processes to understand</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.790" end="00:22:47.520" style="s2">the world—that’s exactly what we are arguing<br />about in the first place, and you can’t</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.520" end="00:22:51.960" style="s2">just assume that, for then the sake of coming<br />up with some premises that are then in turn</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.960" end="00:22:55.390" style="s2">going to validate those cognitive processes.</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.390" end="00:23:02.450" style="s2">So something like that they will say is a<br />big circle or a circular-reasoning problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.450" end="00:23:06.010" style="s2">that evolutionary epistemology finds itself<br />trapped in.</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.010" end="00:23:11.200" style="s2">Now I think that there are some responses<br />to that, and this is just the first “back</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.200" end="00:23:15.690" style="s2">and forth” on that particular debate. But<br />that is the kind of response that would be</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.690" end="00:23:20.980" style="s2">The third and fourth response (if I’m keeping<br />track accurately) is to say that we also have</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.980" end="00:23:30.021" style="s2">constraints with respect to ourselves: that<br />if we have a certain set of hypotheses or</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.021" end="00:23:36.650" style="s2">a certain set of theories and we’re testing<br />them out, we will accept those that give us</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.650" end="00:23:40.380" style="s2">“what we want,” what I want, so to speak.</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.380" end="00:23:46.140" style="s2">And I’m also necessarily in a social situation<br />so what I need to do is check my results against</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.140" end="00:23:51.090" style="s2">the results of others: peer review, experiment<br />replication and so forth.</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.090" end="00:23:53.450" style="s2">[smiles] ... ability to live in the same household<br />...</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.450" end="00:23:58.870" style="s2">[laughs] Yes, absolutely, right? More prosaically,<br />“sharing our frameworks with others,”</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.870" end="00:24:00.060" style="s2">right? And so on...</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.060" end="00:24:06.550" style="s2">And so if, so to speak—and this is the more<br />Pragmatist orientation—if we then say we</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.550" end="00:24:13.680" style="s2">have a theory or a set of principles or guidelines<br />or whatever, and they do enable me successfully</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.680" end="00:24:19.870" style="s2">to navigate the world to get what I want,<br />or they do enable me to navigate my social</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.870" end="00:24:26.660" style="s2">world to get us what we want—then they’re<br />reliable, true, or some sort of “success”</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.660" end="00:24:28.870" style="s2">label, epistemologically, that we’re going<br />to give to them.</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.870" end="00:24:33.500" style="s2">Okay, so let me ask you a question about that.<br />This is a place where I got augured in very</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.500" end="00:24:39.510" style="s2">badly with Sam Harris when we were discussing<br />metaphysical presumptions. So you know—and</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.510" end="00:24:44.440" style="s2">I’m confused about this I would say to some<br />degree conceptually because I’m a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.440" end="00:24:49.521" style="s2">and certainly operate most of the time under<br />the presupposition of an “independent objective</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.521" end="00:24:56.980" style="s2">world”—but then I also have some difficulty<br />with the idea that it’s objective truth</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.980" end="00:25:01.720" style="s2">within which all other truths are “nested.”<br />And that’s something that Sam and the people</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.720" end="00:25:06.220" style="s2">that he represents in some sense are very<br />dead set on insisting.</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.220" end="00:25:11.430" style="s2">Now it seems to me though that the crux of<br />the matter is something like “the method</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.430" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">of proof.” And this strikes me as very important<br />because, “My theory is correct enough if,</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:24.301" style="s2">when I implement it, I get what I want”<br />is not the same as the claim “My theory</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.301" end="00:25:29.370" style="s2">is true because it’s in accordance with<br />some independently existing objective world.”</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.370" end="00:25:35.190" style="s2">I mean, both of those things could exist at<br />the same time, but I think the more appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.190" end="00:25:40.260" style="s2">claim to make with regards to human knowledge<br />is something like its “biological functionality,”</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.260" end="00:25:45.910" style="s2">which is that your knowledge is of sufficient<br />accuracy (which is about the best you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.910" end="00:25:51.530" style="s2">hope for because of your fundamental ignorance)<br />if, when you implement it, it reliably produces</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.530" end="00:25:55.210" style="s2">the results that are commensurate, say, with<br />your continued existence.</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.210" end="00:25:59.211" style="s2">Now it seems to me that that’s a reasonable<br />claim from a Darwinian perspective [Charles</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.211" end="00:26:01.510" style="s2">Darwin, 1809-1882] and it also seems to me<br />that it’s very much in keeping with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.510" end="00:26:07.330" style="s2">claims of the American Pragmatists. And I<br />mean, it’s not like they were radical postmodernists</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.330" end="00:26:08.330" style="s2">...</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.330" end="00:26:09.330" style="s2">Right...</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.330" end="00:26:13.131" style="s2">...because they weren’t. But they were trying<br />to solve this problem to some degree of our</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.131" end="00:26:18.041" style="s2">fundamental ignorance and our inability to<br />be certain about the nature of the reality</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.041" end="00:26:19.330" style="s2">that surrounds us.</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.330" end="00:26:26.500" style="s2">Yes, okay. Let’s set aside Sam Harris’s<br />version of this and focus on the Pragmatist</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.500" end="00:26:29.570" style="s2">tradition here. So, no, you’re absolutely<br />right.</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.570" end="00:26:33.230" style="s2">The Pragmatists, William James [1842-1910],<br />John Dewey [1859-1952], and the others, late</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.230" end="00:26:41.870" style="s2">1800s, early 1900s; they are coming a century<br />after the Kantian revolution [Immanuel Kant,</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.870" end="00:26:46.150" style="s2">1724-1804], after Hegelianism [G. W. F. Hegel,<br />1770-1831], and so forth—and so they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.150" end="00:26:52.420" style="s2">very much trying to solve this problem. One<br />way—and this is kind of a very American</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.420" end="00:27:00.540" style="s2">way—is like: Look, maybe the problem with<br />philosophy is that we have been too intellectualizing</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.540" end="00:27:08.210" style="s2">of cognition, that we’re not just disembodied<br />brains or disembodied minds that are trying</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.210" end="00:27:15.110" style="s2">to contemplate abstract truths in some other<br />realm. Maybe what we need to do is understand</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.110" end="00:27:22.040" style="s2">the mind and cognition as a naturalistic process<br />and that the purpose of knowledge is not to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.040" end="00:27:26.630" style="s2">come up with these pure and beautiful Truths<br />that are going to be kind of museum pieces</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.630" end="00:27:33.070" style="s2">that we will admire, but rather the purpose<br />of knowledge is functional. The purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.070" end="00:27:41.620" style="s2">knowledge is to guide action. And so they<br />will then hearken back to the earlier Baconian</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.620" end="00:27:48.020" style="s2">tradition that knowledge is not an end in<br />itself. As Bacon put it, Francis Bacon [1561-1626]:</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.020" end="00:27:55.390" style="s2">Knowledge is power, and by its fruits, so<br />to speak, is how you know its worth.</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.390" end="00:27:56.530" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.530" end="00:28:04.950" style="s2">And so what we then should do is to see that<br />the test of truth is not whether it meets</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.950" end="00:28:12.460" style="s2">purely intellectual standards of logic and<br />mathematics, but rather, when we put it into</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.460" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">practice, when we act upon it, we actually<br />get good results, or we want the results we</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:24.160" style="s2">want, or I get the results I want. And it<br />can come in more individualistic form or more</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.160" end="00:28:25.180" style="s2">socialized form.</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.180" end="00:28:29.070" style="s2">Right, because then we can get on with things,<br />too. Like, despite our ignorance, in some</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.070" end="00:28:30.070" style="s2">sense.</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.070" end="00:28:34.710" style="s2">So there are two things which are being packaged<br />here, right? One is to say that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.710" end="00:28:39.610" style="s2">is functional. And that part I think is important<br />and I think it’s a very nice correction</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.610" end="00:28:45.130" style="s2">by the Pragmatists. It’s not original with<br />them but they are reemphasizing it in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.130" end="00:28:54.490" style="s2">19th century. Knowledge needs to be put to<br />the test and its ability to enable us to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.490" end="00:28:58.510" style="s2">pragmatic in the real world, is its test.</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.510" end="00:29:04.530" style="s2">[28:59] There’s a coda to that as well.<br />And I think this is relevant to Thomas Kuhn’s</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.530" end="00:29:09.800" style="s2">[1922-1996] discussion of scientific revolutions,<br />because Kuhn is often read as positing a sequence</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.800" end="00:29:18.130" style="s2">of, in some sense, discontinuous revolutions,<br />and that the conceptual structure that characterized</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.130" end="00:29:26.170" style="s2">one “epoch,” let’s say—like the Medieval<br />epoch—was so totally different in its presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.170" end="00:29:30.700" style="s2">from the conceptions that characterized the<br />next epoch … that you can&#39;t even mediate</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.700" end="00:29:32.500" style="s2">between them in some sense.</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.500" end="00:29:37.070" style="s2">Now the reason I’m bringing this up is because<br />Kuhn is at least read as hypothesizing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.070" end="00:29:42.070" style="s2">there’s not any necessary “progress”<br />when you make leaps from one conceptual system</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.070" end="00:29:46.650" style="s2">to another. But if you take this pragmatic<br />approach—the one that we&#39;ve been outlining—it</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.650" end="00:29:53.140" style="s2">seems to me that you can say, Well, it’s<br />something like this: Your conceptions of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.140" end="00:29:59.830" style="s2">world are more tool-like than objective-truth-like,<br />and tools can have a greater or lesser range</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.830" end="00:30:04.510" style="s2">of convenience. And so if you come up with<br />a really good tool—which would also be something</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.510" end="00:30:08.150" style="s2">that would look objectively true, generally<br />speaking—then that’s something that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.150" end="00:30:12.850" style="s2">can use in almost every situation and it will<br />never fail you. And I would think of something</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.850" end="00:30:18.120" style="s2">like Newtonian physics in that regard, or<br />even more particularly, quantum mechanics,</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.120" end="00:30:19.880" style="s2">because it’s never failed us.</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.880" end="00:30:24.120" style="s2">And so it seems to me the Pragmatic approach<br />in some sense allows you to have your cake</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.120" end="00:30:29.910" style="s2">and eat it too. You can posit a hierarchy<br />of truths, moving towards absolute truth even,</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.910" end="00:30:35.200" style="s2">but also retain your belief in your own ignorance<br />and not have to beat the drum too hard about</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.200" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">the “eternal accuracy” of your objective<br />presuppositions.</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:47.680" style="s2">Okay. Again I’m sympathetic I think with<br />about 80 percent of that. But let me put my</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.680" end="00:30:55.140" style="s2">skeptical hat back on and say how the postmodernists<br />or the critics of Pragmatism—critics really</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.140" end="00:31:03.960" style="s2">of first-generation Pragmatism—will respond<br />to that. So if we then say: All of these cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.960" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">results … I’m going to rephrase that.</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:08.600" style="s2">Okay.</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.600" end="00:31:14.530" style="s2">So if we’re going to assess all of our cognitive<br />results or cognitive hypotheses in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.530" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">their workability, or their “getting what<br />I want” or “what we want,” well then</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:25.890" style="s2">the big question we have to turn to is to<br />say, How do we judge whether something works?</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.890" end="00:31:26.890" style="s2">Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.890" end="00:31:35.930" style="s2">Or how do I say that, “It’s good because<br />I get what I want” or “We get what we</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.930" end="00:31:42.230" style="s2">want.” Well, what is a “want”? And where<br />did these “wants” come from? And why should</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.230" end="00:31:49.580" style="s2">we accept “wants” and “desires” and<br />“achieving certain goals” as our bottom</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.580" end="00:31:50.960" style="s2">line, so to speak?</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.960" end="00:31:55.410" style="s2">Right, okay. That’s right. So you can start<br />to question the framework, the validity of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.410" end="00:31:58.080" style="s2">the framework within which you’re constructing<br />the answer.</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.080" end="00:32:01.740" style="s2">That’s right. And at this point we’re<br />reading epistemology [epistemology: the theory</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.740" end="00:32:02.740" style="s2">of knowledge, especially with regard to its<br />methods, validity and scope: the investigation</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.740" end="00:32:03.820" style="s2">of what distinguishes justified belief from<br />opinion] “neutrally” so to speak; and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.820" end="00:32:12.040" style="s2">moving into normative issues, then the whole<br />status of normative goals—ends and the means</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.040" end="00:32:15.990" style="s2">that are going to enable us to reach those<br />ends—comes into play.</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.990" end="00:32:21.480" style="s2">So if I want to say, “The most important<br />thing is that I”—I’ll put it very baldly</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.480" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">here—“I get what I want,” right? And<br />I’m going to assess intellectual structures</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:33.980" style="s2">and beliefs and hypotheses in terms of, “Do<br />they give me what I want?” Well, that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.980" end="00:32:42.060" style="s2">already sounds like a fairly normatively subjectivistic<br />standpoint. Like, why should you take your</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.060" end="00:32:49.460" style="s2">“wants” as having some sort of high status<br />that everything has to be evaluated in terms</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.460" end="00:32:50.460" style="s2">of?</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.460" end="00:32:51.460" style="s2">Uh huh.</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.460" end="00:32:54.760" style="s2">And then philosophically we say: Where do<br />“wants” come from? And of course there’s</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.760" end="00:33:01.100" style="s2">a long anthropological and psychological set<br />of literature here. What’s the source of</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.100" end="00:33:06.890" style="s2">our “wants”? Are they based in biological<br />drives? Are they instinctual? Are they acquired?</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.890" end="00:33:13.060" style="s2">Are they intellectual? Do they have any relationship<br />to our rational capacities? When I&#39;m acting,</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.060" end="00:33:17.320" style="s2">should I act on my desires and my wants, and<br />so forth?</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.320" end="00:33:22.900" style="s2">So there’s that whole tradition, and we<br />have to have a sophisticated theory about</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.900" end="00:33:27.580" style="s2">how all of that is going to work if we’re<br />going to say we’ll solve all of these cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.580" end="00:33:32.850" style="s2">epistemological issues in terms of “wants”<br />or the satisfaction of “desires” or the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.850" end="00:33:38.070" style="s2">“achievement of goals” the way pragmatists<br />want us to do.</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.070" end="00:33:43.400" style="s2">And again, it’s fairly easy to imagine what<br />the skeptical argument is likely going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.400" end="00:33:47.810" style="s2">be. If it’s a matter of what I want—well,<br />isn’t science supposed to be about coming</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.810" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">up with general truths or maybe even universal<br />truths?</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:53.320" style="s2">Okay …</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.320" end="00:33:56.590" style="s2">And if it’s immediately going to devolve<br />into whatever individuals want, well then</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.590" end="00:33:58.730" style="s2">we’re going to go in fairly scattered directions.</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.730" end="00:34:05.140" style="s2">Okay, so that also opens up a good point for<br />a segue into the potential link between Neo-Marxism,</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.140" end="00:34:07.400" style="s2">let’s say, and Postmodernism.</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.400" end="00:34:08.400" style="s2">Sure.</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.400" end="00:34:14.710" style="s2">Because maybe you could say: Once you&#39;ve opened<br />the door to an admission that you can criticize</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.710" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">the idea of “want” as a social construct,<br />let’s say—which is one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:25.369" style="s2">you intimated (not the only thing, obviously)—then<br />you open the door to also making the claim</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.369" end="00:34:30.450" style="s2">that that social construct that governs the<br />“wants,” that governs the “truth,”</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.450" end="00:34:34.190" style="s2">can be governed by “power relationships,”<br />something like that, and then by “unfair</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.190" end="00:34:35.190" style="s2">power relationships.”</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.190" end="00:34:36.190" style="s2">Exactly.</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.190" end="00:34:38.520" style="s2">So you can spin off down that aisle.</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.520" end="00:34:42.220" style="s2">And that’s the other thing I really want<br />to talk to you about, because on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.220" end="00:34:48.360" style="s2">the postmodernists are following this intellectual<br />tradition of the critique of Western thinking,</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.360" end="00:34:53.950" style="s2">which is exactly in some sense what philosophy<br />should be doing. But in another way, they</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.950" end="00:34:59.090" style="s2">seem simultaneously to be introducing, almost<br />by sleight of hand, a kind of social critique</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.090" end="00:35:06.040" style="s2">that has its origin more in political revolution<br />and class-based theory, and they do that under</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.040" end="00:35:11.660" style="s2">the guise of pure philosophy, in some sense,<br />but with the intent and motivation of something</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.660" end="00:35:18.080" style="s2">like justifying the social revolution, or<br />continuing the Marxist analysis of power differential.</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.080" end="00:35:22.380" style="s2">It can go both ways, yes. Right? It is possible<br />to follow the road that we’ve just been</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.380" end="00:35:27.380" style="s2">going down, to say, Well, you know, if it’s<br />a matter about ‘what works for you,’ then</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.380" end="00:35:33.640" style="s2">that immediately starts to sound too relativistic<br />and subjectivistic and we don’t have an</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.640" end="00:35:36.980" style="s2">answer to all the weirdos who want to do strange<br />things—because that’s what they want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.980" end="00:35:42.030" style="s2">do—so we might introduce as a corrective<br />a socializing of the process.</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.030" end="00:35:43.030" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.030" end="00:35:46.130" style="s2">So we might then say, No, it’s not so much<br />what you want as an individual, but rather</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.130" end="00:35:50.620" style="s2">what we want, and we have to achieve some<br />sort of a consensus here.</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.620" end="00:35:54.680" style="s2">So that’s a slightly cartoon version, but<br />the difference between William James, who</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.680" end="00:35:59.800" style="s2">was more individualistic, and John Dewey in<br />the next generation who collectivized things</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.800" end="00:36:05.480" style="s2">a bit more. So then we have a corrective on<br />all of the individual weirdos—who knows</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.480" end="00:36:07.590" style="s2">what their desires and goals are going to<br />be?</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.590" end="00:36:08.590" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.590" end="00:36:12.010" style="s2">But anyway, of course we just confront the<br />same problem there, as soon as we start doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.010" end="00:36:16.500" style="s2">anthropology, because then if we say: Well,<br />if we relativize it to the social group, when</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.500" end="00:36:20.820" style="s2">we start looking at different social groups,<br />obviously different social groups have dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.820" end="00:36:25.080" style="s2">different wants and needs and desires, and<br />they’ve evolved very different traditions.</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.080" end="00:36:31.691" style="s2">And if it’s a matter of saying “What’s<br />true is what works for the group,” there</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.691" end="00:36:39.960" style="s2">is then no über group or highest group of<br />all groups that has status over all of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.960" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">others.</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:45.720" style="s2">And if you do—and this is the second point<br />that you said exactly right—then you’re</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.720" end="00:36:51.620" style="s2">saying, Well, no, no, this group’s norms<br />and its goals are better than that group’s</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.620" end="00:36:52.620" style="s2">goals or norms …</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.620" end="00:36:53.620" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.620" end="00:37:00.030" style="s2">… and so then you’re into what the critics<br />are going to call “imperialism” of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.030" end="00:37:01.030" style="s2">inappropriate form …</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.030" end="00:37:07.650" style="s2">Right, and so that leaves us with our current<br />political situation in some sense, because</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.650" end="00:37:16.100" style="s2">that idea has been taken to … that’s a<br />logical conclusion, and that logical conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.100" end="00:37:21.740" style="s2">has now been instantiated to a large degree<br />as an intellectual and political activist</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.740" end="00:37:23.240" style="s2">movement, I would say.</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.240" end="00:37:26.930" style="s2">Right, sure, absolutely. So it can start as<br />an intellectual movement and what we’re</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.930" end="00:37:29.930" style="s2">trying to do is some hard-core epistemology<br />[epistemology: the theory of knowledge, especially</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.930" end="00:37:30.930" style="s2">with regard to its methods, validity and scope:<br />the investigation of what distinguishes justified</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.930" end="00:37:33.780" style="s2">belief from opinion] and we go the Empiricists<br />and the Rationalists and the Kantian revolution</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.780" end="00:37:37.530" style="s2">and the Pragmatists, right? And now we’re<br />in the second-generation Pragmatism where</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.530" end="00:37:43.090" style="s2">we relativize into various cognitive groups<br />and then we’re just stuck in a kind of group</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.090" end="00:37:48.590" style="s2">relativism, and in the operational principles<br />socially then is going to be that each group</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.590" end="00:37:54.600" style="s2">so to speak should stick to itself and not<br />think that it can impose its ideas and its</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.600" end="00:38:00.720" style="s2">norms on any other group, right? All groups,<br />so to speak, are equal.</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.720" end="00:38:06.380" style="s2">Yeah, well, at least they have an equal claim<br />to their formulation of the truth. The problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.380" end="00:38:14.460" style="s2">with the postmodern conjunction with Neo-Marxism<br />to me seems to be the acceptance of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.460" end="00:38:21.050" style="s2">that there’s an intrinsic moral claim by<br />the “dispossessed” to the obtaining of</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.050" end="00:38:25.700" style="s2">status, and that actually constitutes a higher<br />moral calling in and of itself! So they’re</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.700" end="00:38:31.450" style="s2">swallowing a moral claim in making it “universal”<br />in some sense at the same time they criticize</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.450" end="00:38:34.880" style="s2">the idea of, say, “general narratives”<br />or “universal moral claims.”</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.880" end="00:38:38.680" style="s2">Okay, now that’s also right. That’s the<br />other way to say that. Rather than starting</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.680" end="00:38:45.380" style="s2">with epistemology and getting to a kind of<br />cultural relativism, you can start, of course,</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.380" end="00:38:47.050" style="s2">committed to a certain normative [normative:<br />implying, creating, or prescribing a norm</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.050" end="00:38:52.910" style="s2">or standard] framework or a certain ideological<br />framework (as Marxism is) where you’re very</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.910" end="00:38:59.181" style="s2">critical of one of those traditions, and then<br />the cultural relativism can be a part of that,</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.181" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">that you use, to criticize the tradition “internally”<br />so to speak. Now then we’re explicitly into—not</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:13.770" style="s2">kind of “meta-ethics” and asking where<br />do we get our ethical principles off the ground—but</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.770" end="00:39:18.980" style="s2">where do they come from in the first place,<br />but kind of a robust “normative” ethics</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.980" end="00:39:26.020" style="s2">where people have commitments to fairly strong<br />ethical principles and ethical ideals.</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.020" end="00:39:34.360" style="s2">This is where the debate between, say, Nietzsche<br />and Marx becomes relevant. This is a late</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.360" end="00:39:40.190" style="s2">19th century debate. So suppose we say, as<br />both the Marxists do and the Nietzscheans</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.190" end="00:39:46.540" style="s2">do, let’s say: There is no “Truth” in<br />any objective sense. All we have is subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.540" end="00:39:52.350" style="s2">and relativity of various sorts, and we have<br />different individuals and different groups,</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.350" end="00:40:00.020" style="s2">and they are in antagonistic conflict relations<br />with each other, and that means there’s</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.020" end="00:40:06.260" style="s2">not really going to be any rational and civil<br />resolution [40:04] of these discussions with</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.260" end="00:40:11.320" style="s2">each other; instead, it all comes down to<br />power.</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.320" end="00:40:15.190" style="s2">Yeah, and that’s the strange sleight of<br />hand claim there too, because why it has to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.190" end="00:40:20.350" style="s2">come down to power? Again that seems to introduce<br />the idea of “necessary need” ….</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.350" end="00:40:25.760" style="s2">Okay, okay, yes, all right. That’s another<br />thing. Let’s set that aside just for a moment.</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.760" end="00:40:26.930" style="s2">Yep, okay.</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.930" end="00:40:31.850" style="s2">So then we say: Okay, so we have power. And<br />one thing that we can say is: While we don’t</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.850" end="00:40:39.530" style="s2">think any one individual, or any one group,<br />has a better objective claim to truth or better</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.530" end="00:40:46.150" style="s2">ideals, it is nonetheless the case that some<br />individuals and groups have more power than</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.150" end="00:40:53.530" style="s2">others, and so then we have to make our allegiance<br />clear in this unequal power struggle: Are</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.530" end="00:40:58.430" style="s2">we on the side of those who have more power<br />or are we on the side of those who have less</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.430" end="00:40:59.430" style="s2">power?</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.430" end="00:41:04.120" style="s2">And that’s where when we get then a Nietzschean<br />and a Marxian “fork in the road.” So the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.120" end="00:41:10.190" style="s2">Nietzscheans, following Nietzsche, will say:<br />Look, it’s all about power. We can try on</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.190" end="00:41:16.560" style="s2">some crude evolutionary thinking here: It’s<br />only by the exercise of power by the stronger,</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.560" end="00:41:23.110" style="s2">the fitter, the healthier, and so forth, who<br />are willing to impose their power on the weaker</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.110" end="00:41:27.720" style="s2">and use them for their own ends, that we as<br />individuals and groups are going to make any</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.720" end="00:41:33.330" style="s2">sort of progress toward the next best thing,<br />whatever that is. So in the power struggle</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.330" end="00:41:41.330" style="s2">there is no objective morality, no objective<br />truth. We just throw our lot in with the stronger,</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.330" end="00:41:46.280" style="s2">with the richer, with the more powerful, and<br />say: Whatever it is that they do to advance</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.280" end="00:41:52.380" style="s2">themselves, that’s the normative best that<br />we can do. And of course there’s a long</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.380" end="00:41:57.970" style="s2">kind of aristocratic tradition in normative<br />thinking that one can draw on to support that.</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.970" end="00:42:03.720" style="s2">And then the Marxists of course are just on<br />the other side of that equation, where their</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.720" end="00:42:11.700" style="s2">sympathies initially are going to be to say,<br />in any power struggle: “Our a priori commitments</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.700" end="00:42:18.990" style="s2">should always be to the weaker, to those on<br />the losing end of history, those who suffer,”</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.990" end="00:42:24.820" style="s2">and so forth, and it’s always the bad, rich<br />and powerful people who are oppressing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.820" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">harming them. And so we throw our lot in with<br />the weaker and we’re willing to use power,</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:34.280" style="s2">whatever amount of power we have, on behalf<br />of the weaker.</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.280" end="00:42:35.280" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.280" end="00:42:39.430" style="s2">And then we’re just into what I think of<br />as the major false alternative that really</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.430" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">has driven much of 20th century intellectual<br />life: Are you a Nietzschean or are you a Marxist?</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:49.890" style="s2">Right, right. Well okay. So now we can get<br />to the crux of the matter here to some degree,</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.890" end="00:42:54.680" style="s2">because to even engage in that argument means<br />to accept the a priori position, which you’ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.680" end="00:43:00.310" style="s2">made quite rationally compelling, let’s<br />say, that “It’s power. It’s power. Because</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.310" end="00:43:04.810" style="s2">there’s no other way of differentiating<br />between the claims of different groups, it’s</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.810" end="00:43:06.570" style="s2">power that’s the determining issue.”</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.570" end="00:43:07.570" style="s2">Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.570" end="00:43:11.580" style="s2">But that’s something that I really have<br />a problem with. And I think it’s of crucial</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.580" end="00:43:17.090" style="s2">importance. Because first of all I think there’s<br />a big difference between power and authority</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.090" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">and competence. Those are all not the same<br />thing, because you might be willing to cede</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.400" end="00:43:28.280" style="s2">greater status to me in some domains if there<br />are things I can do, that you value, that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.280" end="00:43:33.160" style="s2">you can’t do. And that’s not power exactly.<br />Power seems to be more that I’m willing</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.160" end="00:43:39.130" style="s2">to use force to impose my interpretation of<br />the world to get my wants fulfilled on you,</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.130" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">and it seems to me that where the Marxists<br />make a huge mistake—not that the Nietzscheans</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:47.070" style="s2">aren’t making mistakes as well—but where<br />the Marxists make a huge mistake is that they</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.070" end="00:43:52.830" style="s2">fail to properly differentiate between hierarchies<br />of interpretation that are predicated on tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.830" end="00:43:59.220" style="s2">power, and hierarchies of interpretation that<br />are predicated on authority, competence, and</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.220" end="00:44:03.230" style="s2">mutual consent.</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.230" end="00:44:07.380" style="s2">The other issue that they fail to contend<br />with—and I believe this is a form of willful</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.380" end="00:44:14.160" style="s2">blindness—is that it isn’t obviously the<br />case that “every society is set up equally</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.160" end="00:44:19.900" style="s2">to only fulfil the desires of the people who<br />are, in principle, situated at the pinnacles</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.900" end="00:44:23.730" style="s2">of the hierarchies.” I actually don’t<br />think that that’s fundamentally characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.730" end="00:44:27.950" style="s2">of the Western tradition, because it has a<br />very strong emphasis—weirdly enough, and</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.950" end="00:44:36.700" style="s2">this is how I think it “extracts” itself<br />out of the conundrum which accepting a socialized</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.700" end="00:44:43.410" style="s2">version of truth presents to you: The West<br />does two things: (1) It says, We have a social</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.410" end="00:44:47.240" style="s2">contract that constrains our views of the<br />world and our actions in it, but (2) that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.240" end="00:44:54.250" style="s2">contract is also simultaneously subordinate<br />to the idea of the sovereignty of each individual.</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.250" end="00:45:00.580" style="s2">And so the social contract then is bound to<br />serve the needs of each individual—not any</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.580" end="00:45:04.619" style="s2">privileged set of individuals, although sometimes<br />it works out that way—and I don’t believe</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.619" end="00:45:10.270" style="s2">that the postmodernists have contended with<br />that properly, with their criticism of “logocentrism”</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.270" end="00:45:13.060" style="s2">for example, which was something that characterized<br />Derrida.</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.060" end="00:45:17.140" style="s2">‘Cause I think that that … ‘cause I<br />… It doesn’t … it never has seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.140" end="00:45:24.050" style="s2">me that what you had with Stalinist Russia<br />and the Marxist view of the world, and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.050" end="00:45:30.580" style="s2">you had on the side of the West, was merely<br />a matter of a difference of opinion between</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.580" end="00:45:35.450" style="s2">two equally valid socialized modes of interpreting<br />the world, you know? There’s something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.450" end="00:45:42.520" style="s2">about … There’s something more to the<br />view of the West than what’s embodied in</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.520" end="00:45:46.550" style="s2">the conflict between, say, capitalism and<br />socialism. Because it could have just been</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.550" end="00:45:52.610" style="s2">a matter of argumentation and opinion, but<br />I think that that’s faulty.</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.610" end="00:45:56.580" style="s2">I thought this way in part because of Piaget<br />[Jean Piaget, 1896-1980], you know, because</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.580" end="00:46:01.480" style="s2">Piaget was interested in what the intrinsic<br />constraints were on a social contract, and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.480" end="00:46:09.660" style="s2">he said … and he was trying to address this<br />issue of the insufficiency of want as a tool</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.660" end="00:46:15.290" style="s2">to justify your claims to truth. That’s<br />when he introduced the idea of the equilibrated</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.290" end="00:46:21.970" style="s2">state. So, if you’re sophisticated, you<br />have to put forward your want and then meet</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.970" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">it in a way that will meet it today, and tomorrow,<br />and next month, and next year, and in a decade—so</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:35.640" style="s2">you have to iterate yourself across time,<br />and you have to take all of the iterations</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.640" end="00:46:40.650" style="s2">of yourself across time with some degree of<br />seriousness, and then you also have to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.650" end="00:46:44.470" style="s2">the same thing as you extend yourself out<br />into the social community. So it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.470" end="00:46:50.660" style="s2">“what’s good for me now” and repetitively<br />into the future in a manner that’s simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.660" end="00:46:53.600" style="s2">good for you now and simultaneously into the<br />future.</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.600" end="00:46:54.600" style="s2">Uh huh.</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.600" end="00:46:58.080" style="s2">And that starts to become … and he thought<br />about that as “the playable game,” something</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.080" end="00:47:02.220" style="s2">like that. The “voluntarily playable game.”<br />And there’s something deep about that, because</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.220" end="00:47:07.060" style="s2">it includes the idea of iteration, you know,<br />iterated interpretations into the equation,</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.060" end="00:47:09.760" style="s2">which strikes me as of crucial importance.</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.760" end="00:47:19.180" style="s2">Okay, yes, right? Again, I count about six<br />very interesting sub-topics built into that,</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.180" end="00:47:25.040" style="s2">and the latter part is a very nice statement<br />I think of a kind of Enlightenment humanism</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.040" end="00:47:31.241" style="s2">where we’re going to take power seriously,<br />but we’re going to constrain power in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.241" end="00:47:37.980" style="s2">way that respects the individual and simultaneously<br />enables individuals to form mutually beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.980" end="00:47:43.680" style="s2">social networks across time, and so on.</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.680" end="00:47:51.300" style="s2">And I’m very sympathetic to that overall<br />construction. And that comes out of then the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.300" end="00:47:53.990" style="s2">first part which is a taxonomy [taxonomy:<br />the science or technique of classification]</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.990" end="00:47:59.220" style="s2">you’re offering about the nature of power—and<br />that taxonomy does differ significantly from</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.220" end="00:48:02.420" style="s2">both the Marxist and the Nietzschean ones.</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.420" end="00:48:11.250" style="s2">Now what I’d say is that I think it’s<br />better to take power more neutrally so there’s</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.250" end="00:48:15.180" style="s2">a continuity with what the physicists do.<br />And my understanding there is that power is</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.180" end="00:48:18.770" style="s2">just the ability to get work done.</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.770" end="00:48:21.150" style="s2">Uh hmm.</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.150" end="00:48:28.380" style="s2">So you can put that in tool and functionality<br />language: Power is what gets you from A to</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.380" end="00:48:29.380" style="s2">B.</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.380" end="00:48:33.970" style="s2">Right, right. Which is also … I love that<br />description, because it fits very nicely in</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.970" end="00:48:39.010" style="s2">with the narrative conceptualization of being,<br />because narratives seem to be descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.010" end="00:48:42.070" style="s2">of something like “How to get from point<br />A to point B.”</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.070" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">Right. But it also doesn’t say anything<br />about B and the status of B: How we choose</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:54.730" style="s2">where we should be going, what our ends are,<br />or what our goals are—so in that sense power</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.730" end="00:49:03.040" style="s2">is normatively neutral—it’s a means to<br />an end, and that means when we try to evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.040" end="00:49:10.800" style="s2">the uses of power, we’re going to be evaluating<br />power in terms of the ends toward which it</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.800" end="00:49:15.990" style="s2">is put, if I can end with that preposition<br />there.</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.990" end="00:49:21.240" style="s2">So now … Then we say: Okay, well, power<br />comes in all kinds of forms. I’m quite happy</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.240" end="00:49:26.600" style="s2">to say that there’s intellectual power:<br />that’s the ability to use our minds to address</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.600" end="00:49:32.980" style="s2">and solve certain problems. There’s muscular<br />power: the ability to move physical objects.</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.980" end="00:49:38.740" style="s2">There’s social power: people respect you<br />and are willing to spend time with you and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.740" end="00:49:43.020" style="s2">divert resources to you voluntarily, and so<br />forth. There’s military power; political</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.020" end="00:49:48.830" style="s2">power—and so we can have a whole set of<br />subspecies of power. And what they all have</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.830" end="00:49:53.970" style="s2">then in common is in each of those domains<br />there are goals, and having the power enables</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.970" end="00:49:57.130" style="s2">you to achieve your goals in those domains.</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.130" end="00:50:02.750" style="s2">Right, and we shouldn’t fall prey to the<br />illusion that there’s necessarily any—like,</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.750" end="00:50:07.300" style="s2">what would you call it—“unifying matrix”<br />that makes all those different forms of power</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.300" end="00:50:13.260" style="s2">importantly similar except for the terminology,<br />you know? I mean—and this is another thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.260" end="00:50:17.840" style="s2">that bothers me about both the Nietzschean<br />and the Marxist view, is that there’s this</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.840" end="00:50:24.060" style="s2">proclivity to collapse these multiple modes<br />of power into power itself, and that’s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.060" end="00:50:29.340" style="s2">reasonable because it’s reasonable to note<br />that many of the forms of power that you just</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.340" end="00:50:34.530" style="s2">described contend against one another, rather<br />than mutually fortify one another. It’s</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.530" end="00:50:38.530" style="s2">like the balance of power in a polity like<br />the American polity.</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.530" end="00:50:43.570" style="s2">Yes, I think that’s a deep point that you’re<br />making, and I think that both the Marxists</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.570" end="00:50:50.869" style="s2">and the Nietzscheans do end up collapsing<br />power into a unitary type, and that’s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.869" end="00:50:58.270" style="s2">mistake. But it’s a mistake only if you<br />deny, as both the Marxists and the Nietzscheans</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.270" end="00:51:05.800" style="s2">do, that there is a deep individuality about<br />the world. So if you think, by contrast, about</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.800" end="00:51:12.020" style="s2">the kind of individual human-rights-respecting<br />Enlightenment vision that you’re articulating,</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.020" end="00:51:20.310" style="s2">and that I agree with as well: normatively<br />that wants to devolve social power to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.310" end="00:51:26.960" style="s2">individual, and leave individuals with a great<br />deal of self-responsibility and control over</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.960" end="00:51:32.770" style="s2">their own domain so to speak. And the idea<br />then is that if we’re going to form social</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.770" end="00:51:39.220" style="s2">relationships, or any sort of social interaction,<br />it has to be mutually respecting: that I have</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.220" end="00:51:45.200" style="s2">to respect your control over your domain and<br />you respect my control over my domain, but</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.200" end="00:51:49.470" style="s2">we agree to share domains, so to speak, voluntarily<br />to a certain point.</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.470" end="00:51:55.350" style="s2">It also means—and this is a place where<br />I think the postmodernists are really open</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.350" end="00:52:02.600" style="s2">to, you might say, conceptual assault—is<br />that you know, in order to have that freedom</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.600" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">devolve upon the individual in that manner,<br />it also means that the individual has to take</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:07.640" style="s2">responsibility …</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.640" end="00:52:08.640" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.640" end="00:52:13.750" style="s2">… for acting as a locus of power in the<br />world, actual responsibility, and cannot conceive</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.750" end="00:52:18.050" style="s2">of themselves or act in a manner that only<br />makes them an avatar of a social movement.</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.050" end="00:52:25.260" style="s2">And I think that part of the perfervid anti-individualism<br />of the radical Left is precisely predicated</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.260" end="00:52:29.550" style="s2">on that refusal to take responsibility, and<br />I think that’s also reflected in the fact</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.550" end="00:52:34.070" style="s2">that, by temperament, they’re low in “trait<br />conscientiousness,” so it’s deep, it’s</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.070" end="00:52:38.680" style="s2">not merely an opinion; it’s an expression<br />of something that’s even deeper than opinion.</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.680" end="00:52:43.630" style="s2">Okay, yes, that phrase “locus of responsibility,”<br />“locus of power,” “locus of control”—you’re</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.630" end="00:52:52.290" style="s2">right that the far Left in Marxist and Neo-Marxist<br />form does deny that, but you also find that</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.290" end="00:52:53.580" style="s2">in the far Right …</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.580" end="00:52:56.369" style="s2">Yes, you find that among ideologues in general.</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.369" end="00:53:01.790" style="s2">Right. So this is a bit of cartoon intellectual<br />history, but then if you try to trace it to</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.790" end="00:53:07.310" style="s2">the Marxists on the Left and the Nietzscheans<br />on the Right, both of them do deny that individuals</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.310" end="00:53:13.600" style="s2">are loci of responsibility. Both of them in<br />their views of human nature have strongly</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.600" end="00:53:20.970" style="s2">deterministic views. What we can an “individual,”<br />according to both of them, is just a “vehicle”</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.970" end="00:53:23.660" style="s2">through which “outside forces are flowing,”<br />so to speak. [Determinism: the doctrine that</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.660" end="00:53:25.810" style="s2">all events, including human action, are ultimately<br />determined by causes external to the will.</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.810" end="00:53:26.810" style="s2">Some philosophers have taken determinism to<br />imply that human beings have no free will</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.810" end="00:53:27.810" style="s2">and cannot be held morally responsible for<br />their actions.]</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.810" end="00:53:31.340" style="s2">Right. Well, you can also see that in some<br />sense as a perverse consequence of the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.340" end="00:53:32.340" style="s2">revolution …</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.340" end="00:53:33.340" style="s2">Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.340" end="00:53:35.869" style="s2">…because you still see this among modern<br />scientists: It’s like, “Okay, what are</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.869" end="00:53:41.170" style="s2">the causal forces that regulate human behavior?<br />Okay, there’s two primary sources: Nature/biology</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.170" end="00:53:42.440" style="s2">and culture.”</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.440" end="00:53:48.220" style="s2">So it’s the crude “Nature vs. Nurture”<br />debate being played out through them, yes.</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.220" end="00:53:56.480" style="s2">Right! And so in my opinion—and I’ve derived<br />this conclusion from studying mythology, mostly—there’s</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.480" end="00:54:02.310" style="s2">a missing third element there which is whatever<br />it is that constitutes the active force of</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.310" end="00:54:07.201" style="s2">individual consciousness. And we don’t have<br />a good conceptual schema for that.</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.201" end="00:54:14.830" style="s2">Right, self-responsibility and being an independent<br />initiator of power instead of merely a responder</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.830" end="00:54:19.920" style="s2">to other power forces, or a vehicle through<br />which those other power forces operate.</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.920" end="00:54:20.920" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.920" end="00:54:26.991" style="s2">So yes, the individualism that is built into<br />Enlightenment humanism—you start to see</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.991" end="00:54:32.520" style="s2">it developing in Renaissance humanism—is<br />to take seriously the notion that individuals</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.520" end="00:54:39.210" style="s2">have some significant measure of control over<br />their thoughts, over their actions, to shape</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.210" end="00:54:40.210" style="s2">their own character …</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.210" end="00:54:41.210" style="s2">Right!</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.210" end="00:54:45.720" style="s2">… to shape their own destinies, and that<br />that is fundamental to one’s moral dignity</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.720" end="00:54:55.800" style="s2">as a human being. And so that view of human<br />nature is built into the ethics fundamentally,</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.800" end="00:55:01.300" style="s2">and then all of social relationships have<br />to be respectful of that individuality, and</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.300" end="00:55:05.690" style="s2">then, consequently, when we start to turn<br />to political theory and we talk about very</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.690" end="00:55:12.290" style="s2">heavy-duty uses of power, such as the police<br />and the military—we want to have serious</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.290" end="00:55:18.680" style="s2">constraints on government power to make sure<br />that we are respecting individual sovereignty.</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.680" end="00:55:25.940" style="s2">Okay. And here’s something perverse, too,<br />that emerges as a consequence of something</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.940" end="00:55:30.400" style="s2">you pointed out earlier in the conversation,<br />you know. You mentioned that when Modernism</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.400" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">emerged out of Medievalism, that two things<br />happened. One was the elaboration of the conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.760" end="00:55:40.480" style="s2">frames that enabled us to deal with the external<br />world. But the other was the elevation of</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.480" end="00:55:45.660" style="s2">the individual to the status of valid critic,<br />predicated on the idea that there was something</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.660" end="00:55:48.920" style="s2">actually valid about individual experience<br />as such.</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.920" end="00:55:53.630" style="s2">Now the problem there, as far as I can tell—and<br />maybe this is part of the reason we’re in</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.630" end="00:56:00.320" style="s2">this conundrum—is that the elaboration of<br />the objective scientific viewpoint left us</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.320" end="00:56:04.980" style="s2">with the idea that it was either “nature”<br />or “nurture” that was the source of human</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.980" end="00:56:06.560" style="s2">motive power.</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.560" end="00:56:10.981" style="s2">But the missing element there is: Well, if<br />that’s the case, then why grant to the individual</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.981" end="00:56:14.650" style="s2">to begin with the role of independent social<br />critic?</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.650" end="00:56:15.650" style="s2">Exactly.</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.650" end="00:56:21.720" style="s2">Like, on what grounds do you … It’s like<br />a residual belief in something like the autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.720" end="00:56:27.480" style="s2">of the soul, which you can’t just sneak<br />in and not justify, without problems! Like</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.480" end="00:56:28.480" style="s2">the ones that we have now!</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.480" end="00:56:35.109" style="s2">Yes. Now that’s well put. And I think it’s<br />fair to say that we still are in the infancy</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.109" end="00:56:40.520" style="s2">of the psychological sciences—you can speak<br />to this better than I can—but as someone</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.520" end="00:56:45.240" style="s2">in philosophy, I think we’re still at the<br />beginnings. And we are still in the grip of</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.240" end="00:56:53.110" style="s2">early and crude versions of scientific understandings<br />of how cause and effect operates. So what</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.110" end="00:56:59.300" style="s2">we are starting with is very mechanical understandings,<br />and we can understand how people then are</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.300" end="00:57:03.520" style="s2">pushed around by biological forces. We can<br />understand to some extent how they’re pushed</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.520" end="00:57:08.710" style="s2">around by external physical and mechanical<br />forces. But we do not yet have a sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.710" end="00:57:13.520" style="s2">enough understanding of the human brain, the<br />human mind, human psychology, to understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.520" end="00:57:20.980" style="s2">how a volitional consciousness can be a causal<br />force, a causal power in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.980" end="00:57:26.260" style="s2">Right. That’s perfectly well put. So, I<br />do a detailed analysis that some of the people</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.260" end="00:57:31.300" style="s2">who watch me are familiar with, of this movie<br />“Pinocchio,” and Pinocchio has got a very</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.300" end="00:57:37.099" style="s2">classical mythological structure, and it basically<br />introduces three elements of being: so there’s</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.099" end="00:57:41.750" style="s2">(1) the element of being that’s associated<br />with Geppetto; and also (2) the evil tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.750" end="00:57:46.630" style="s2">forces that are kind of patriarchal in nature,<br />and that’s sort of the “conceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.630" end="00:57:50.830" style="s2">of society”—a benevolent element and a<br />malevolent element, say. And then there’s</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.830" end="00:57:55.310" style="s2">(3) the introduction of this other causal<br />factor and it’s personified in the form</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.310" end="00:58:01.260" style="s2">of the Blue Fairy. The Blue Fairy is a manifestation<br />of Mother Nature, and she animates Pinocchio.</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.260" end="00:58:06.730" style="s2">So Geppetto creates him, and then sets up<br />a wish for his independence, and then Nature</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.730" end="00:58:11.090" style="s2">appears in the guise of the Blue Fairy and<br />grants that wish. So you have “culture”</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.090" end="00:58:17.470" style="s2">and “nature” conspiring to produce a puppet<br />that could in fact disentangle itself from</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.470" end="00:58:22.650" style="s2">its strings. But the movie insists—and it<br />does this on profound mythological grounds—that</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.650" end="00:58:27.990" style="s2">the puppet itself has a causal role to play<br />in its own … what would you call it … in</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.990" end="00:58:35.010" style="s2">its own capacity to transcend the deterministic<br />chains, the deterministic processes which</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.010" end="00:58:37.490" style="s2">have given rise to it, that also enslave it.</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.490" end="00:58:38.490" style="s2">Um hmm.</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.490" end="00:58:43.081" style="s2">You know in all of our profound narratives,<br />I would say—and this is part of the way</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.081" end="00:58:47.550" style="s2">that they differ from the scientific account—there’s<br />always that third element. There’s always</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.550" end="00:58:53.510" style="s2">the autonomous individual who is, in some<br />sense, you know, lifting himself up by his</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.510" end="00:58:54.510" style="s2">own bootstraps.</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.510" end="00:58:55.510" style="s2">Yes…</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.510" end="00:59:00.110" style="s2">And I don’t think it’s a problem that<br />science is unable to account for, but it’s</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.110" end="00:59:06.030" style="s2">a very big problem when scientists who are<br />unable to account for that deny that it exists,</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.030" end="00:59:09.040" style="s2">because they can’t explain it. That becomes<br />extraordinarily dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.040" end="00:59:16.380" style="s2">Right. Yes. Once you stop looking, you stop<br />trying, right? Then you’re left with an</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.380" end="00:59:22.450" style="s2">impoverished account. So in a way, there’s<br />a kind of hubris built into the skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.450" end="00:59:27.660" style="s2">that says, “I know that this is a problem<br />that we just can’t solve, so I’m not going</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.660" end="00:59:29.570" style="s2">to try anymore.”</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.570" end="00:59:36.010" style="s2">Yeah, well there’s a performative contradiction<br />as well, which is much worth pointing out—because</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.010" end="00:59:41.020" style="s2">on the one hand, the scientist might well<br />claim, “As far as I’m concerned, from</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.020" end="00:59:46.630" style="s2">an epistemological perspective, the only two<br />causal forces are ‘nature’ and ‘culture.’</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.630" end="00:59:51.690" style="s2">But then I’ll go about my actions in the<br />normative world, as an existential being,</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.690" end="00:59:57.500" style="s2">acting in the world, and I will swallow whole-heartedly<br />the proposition that ‘each individual is</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.500" end="01:00:01.380" style="s2">responsible for his own actions’—because<br />that’s how I constantly interact with everyone</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.380" end="01:00:05.010" style="s2">in the world. And I get very irritated if<br />they violate that principle.”</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.010" end="01:00:12.280" style="s2">Yes, right. So how you live with your skepticism<br />or your relativism in a way that doesn’t</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.280" end="01:00:17.060" style="s2">ensnarl you in tensions and contradictions—that’s<br />a hard project itself.</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.060" end="01:00:25.250" style="s2">Well, it does seem to me, I think it’s reasonable<br />to point out that it’s not possible to find</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.250" end="01:00:31.290" style="s2">a person who acts as if he or anyone else<br />is “biologically or culturally determined.”</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.290" end="01:00:35.430" style="s2">We just don’t behave that way in the real<br />world. We act as if we’re responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.430" end="01:00:38.020" style="s2">our own actions, and the consequences of those<br />actions.</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.020" end="01:00:41.390" style="s2">Right. So then we have a tension between what<br />our “intellectual theories” are telling</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.390" end="01:00:48.560" style="s2">us, and what our kind of “empirical data”<br />is telling us—we don’t have a way to put</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.560" end="01:00:53.690" style="s2">those two together, and then what you as an<br />individual do in response to that tension</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.690" end="01:00:59.000" style="s2">between theory and practice—that’s a whole<br />other can of things to explore.</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.000" end="01:01:00.000" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.000" end="01:01:07.670" style="s2">But to back up to our discussion about power—<br />It’s interesting that the way our discussion,</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.670" end="01:01:14.310" style="s2">up to that point, then integrates three things:<br />(1) We started talking about truth, and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.310" end="01:01:22.520" style="s2">(2) we started talking about goals and normative<br />ends and ideals, and then (3) we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.520" end="01:01:23.520" style="s2">power.</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.520" end="01:01:29.760" style="s2">So there we’ve got already the big three:<br />Truth, Ideals, and Power.</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.760" end="01:01:36.500" style="s2">Our discussion about Truth took us into epistemological<br />issues in philosophy; our discussion about</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.500" end="01:01:42.720" style="s2">Ideals takes us into ethics and meta-ethics<br />issues and also into philosophy; and our discussion</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.720" end="01:01:48.700" style="s2">of Power takes us into issues about human<br />nature, all of which traditionally comprise</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.700" end="01:01:51.420" style="s2">a branch of philosophy and its sub-disciplines.</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.420" end="01:01:56.480" style="s2">So we already have to have a theory of epistemology<br />[epistemology: the theory of knowledge, especially</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.480" end="01:01:57.480" style="s2">with regard to its methods, validity and scope:<br />the investigation of what distinguishes justified</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.480" end="01:02:00.470" style="s2">belief from opinion]; a theory of human nature;<br />a theory of ethics—and we can sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.470" end="01:02:06.720" style="s2">try to integrate those—and postmodernism<br />is going to be an integration of certain views</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.720" end="01:02:10.310" style="s2">that develop in philosophical traditions in<br />all three of those areas.</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.310" end="01:02:19.180" style="s2">So maybe one way to put it is this: If you<br />contrast it to kind of a—again, taking the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.180" end="01:02:25.339" style="s2">Enlightenment as our touchstone—I think<br />we’re both fans of the Enlightenment—we</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.339" end="01:02:33.520" style="s2">say: All right, we’re fine with power. Knowledge<br />is power, and we want to empower the individual.</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.520" end="01:02:39.599" style="s2">We want to eliminate slavery and empower people.<br />We want to eliminate old-fashioned sexism</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.599" end="01:02:43.099" style="s2">and empower women. So power is…</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.099" end="01:02:48.630" style="s2">Yes, we actually want to remove arbitrary<br />and unnecessary impediments to the expression</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.630" end="01:02:49.630" style="s2">of proper power.</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.630" end="01:02:56.310" style="s2">That’s right. So there are illegitimate<br />uses of power that are stopping and disempowering</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.310" end="01:03:02.100" style="s2">people. So it’s the double-edged sword.<br />And as long as power is properly directed</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.100" end="01:03:08.270" style="s2">or properly located, then we are confident<br />that, by and large, people individually and</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.270" end="01:03:15.660" style="s2">socially will use their power to put together<br />useful lives, build successful economies and</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.660" end="01:03:16.660" style="s2">societies, and so forth.</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.660" end="01:03:25.930" style="s2">So it’s actually a very optimistic overall<br />assessment about power. But power is then</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.930" end="01:03:32.609" style="s2">structured as a means to an end: we want to<br />empower people cognitively—teach them how</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.609" end="01:03:39.690" style="s2">to read, teach them how to think, so that<br />they themselves can understand the truth and</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.690" end="01:03:43.680" style="s2">discover new truths. So “power leads to<br />truth.”</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.680" end="01:03:54.170" style="s2">But we also then want people to be free to<br />act on the basis of their power, because then</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.170" end="01:03:59.150" style="s2">we think that if people are respected as individual<br />agents, they’re going to be happier and</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.150" end="01:04:06.900" style="s2">so they will achieve good goals, and they<br />will mutually work out together fair agreements</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.900" end="01:04:12.520" style="s2">and deals— a kind of “justice,” right?<br />Society will get better and better, and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.520" end="01:04:13.520" style="s2">forth.</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.520" end="01:04:21.290" style="s2">So power is in the service of just social<br />relations, and power is in the service of</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.290" end="01:04:22.290" style="s2">truth.</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.290" end="01:04:29.240" style="s2">Yes, so now that’s a great “justification,”<br />say, for the Enlightenment viewpoint, and</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.240" end="01:04:34.820" style="s2">it seems—I don’t want to stop you from<br />pursuing that—but it also seems to me that,</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.820" end="01:04:40.920" style="s2">to the degree that that’s true (a valid<br />description of the Enlightenment aims), and</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.920" end="01:04:46.380" style="s2">to the degree that that has actually manifested<br />itself in reality in the current state of</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.380" end="01:04:54.050" style="s2">human affairs, that it’s perhaps unwise<br />of us to allow our Marxist or our Nietzschean</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.050" end="01:05:00.392" style="s2">presuppositions to take too careless a swing<br />at that foundation, given that it’s actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.392" end="01:05:04.470" style="s2">…<br />Absolutely right, and that’s why the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.470" end="01:05:10.450" style="s2">articulation “Power is good if it’s in<br />the service of truth”— or “Power is</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.450" end="01:05:15.810" style="s2">good if it’s in the service of justice”—then<br />we’re fine. And we’re optimistic enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.810" end="01:05:21.030" style="s2">about human beings, cognitively and morally,<br />that we think that “empowering” them—</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.030" end="01:05:25.700" style="s2">giving them lots of freedoms— is going to<br />increase the net stock of truth, and it’s</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.700" end="01:05:30.090" style="s2">going to increase the net stock of justice.<br />So that entire “Enlightenment package”</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.090" end="01:05:36.890" style="s2">is precisely what the Counter-Enlightenment<br />attacks. It attacked very fundamentally so</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.890" end="01:05:42.830" style="s2">that by the time we get two to three generations<br />later— to the generations of Marx and Nietzsche—</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.830" end="01:05:47.380" style="s2">it has been hollowed out.<br />So on the epistemological side we don’t</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.380" end="01:05:53.230" style="s2">believe that there is such a thing as “truth”<br />anymore. So it’s not the case that “power”</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.230" end="01:05:58.710" style="s2">is in the search of “truth,” because we<br />don’t believe that human beings are capable</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.710" end="01:06:03.400" style="s2">of getting to any sort of objective truth<br />anymore. So we’re just left with “power.”</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.400" end="01:06:08.210" style="s2">And also on the normative side, we don’t<br />believe in “justice” anymore. We don’t</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.210" end="01:06:16.140" style="s2">believe that any sort of normative principles<br />or ethical ideals can be objectively grounded.</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.140" end="01:06:20.901" style="s2">And so then, once again, maybe we’re left<br />with subjective desires and so forth, but</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.901" end="01:06:22.930" style="s2">we’re just left again with “power.”</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.930" end="01:06:27.720" style="s2">So power in the service of Truth; power in<br />the service of Justice: that goes away. All</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.720" end="01:06:28.720" style="s2">that we are left with is Power.</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.720" end="01:06:37.160" style="s2">Okay, so then we could mount a psycho-analytic<br />critique of that set of objections. Because</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.160" end="01:06:48.940" style="s2">I could say, Okay, here’s some reasons.<br />Let’s assume you’re doing something simple</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.940" end="01:06:53.970" style="s2">and easy instead of complicated and difficult<br />with your objections. And so here’s the</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.970" end="01:06:56.869" style="s2">simple and easy explanation:</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.869" end="01:07:01.280" style="s2">You want to dispense with the idea of “justice”<br />and “truth” because that lightens your</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.280" end="01:07:05.320" style="s2">existential load because now there’s nothing<br />difficult and noble that you have to strive</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.320" end="01:07:09.690" style="s2">for, and you want to reduce everything to<br />“power” because that justifies your use</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.690" end="01:07:16.869" style="s2">of power in your pursuit of those immediate<br />goals that you no longer even have to justify</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.869" end="01:07:21.460" style="s2">because you don’t have to make reference<br />to any higher standards of, say, “justice”</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.460" end="01:07:29.880" style="s2">or “truth.” And so I would say: That’s<br />a deep, impulsive and resentful nihilism that’s</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.880" end="01:07:32.480" style="s2">manifesting itself as a glorious intellectual<br />critique. [Nihilism: a viewpoint that traditional</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.480" end="01:07:33.540" style="s2">values and beliefs are unfounded and that<br />existence is senseless and useless.]</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.540" end="01:07:39.410" style="s2">Now, I understand as well that there is the<br />history of genuine intellectual critique that</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.410" end="01:07:43.950" style="s2">you’ve been laying out, which is not trivial—<br />but those things have to be differentiated,</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.950" end="01:07:48.660" style="s2">you know. It’s certainly not reasonable<br />either for those who claim that “all there</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.660" end="01:07:53.650" style="s2">is is power,” that they’re not themselves<br />motivated equally by that power.</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.650" end="01:07:58.780" style="s2">Sure. So in one way, all right, what you can<br />always say, in effect, is that philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.780" end="01:08:04.390" style="s2">is autobiographical. In many cases philosophers<br />will put their pronouncements in third-person</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.390" end="01:08:09.900" style="s2">form, or in generalized form, but if you always<br />put it down to third-person formulations,</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.900" end="01:08:13.380" style="s2">it can be profoundly self-revelatory.</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.380" end="01:08:18.920" style="s2">So if you say, for example, “Human beings<br />are scum”—there you have some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.920" end="01:08:24.270" style="s2">a pessimistic assessment of the human condition.<br />Well, built into that then is the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.270" end="01:08:28.270" style="s2">I, if I “first-personalize it,” that “I<br />am scum.” What you’re really doing is</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.270" end="01:08:34.900" style="s2">a first-person confession. And it’s always<br />then an illegitimate move to exempt yourself</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.900" end="01:08:37.269" style="s2">from the general principle.</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.269" end="01:08:38.269" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.269" end="01:08:47.069" style="s2">Or: “Everything just is “power relations”<br />and “people imposing their agendas on other</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.069" end="01:08:52.069" style="s2">people.” Then what you’re saying is: “Well,<br />my fundamental commitment is power, and I</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.069" end="01:08:55.369" style="s2">just want to impose my agenda on other people.”</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.369" end="01:08:59.980" style="s2">So I do think you’re right— that it can<br />go both ways: It can of course be that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.980" end="01:09:07.489" style="s2">have people who, for whatever reason, have<br />a predisposition to nihilistic, amoral power</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.489" end="01:09:16.560" style="s2">seeking, and when they become adults and “intellectual,”<br />they latch onto theories that indulge them,</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.560" end="01:09:19.079" style="s2">that enable them to rationalize their predispositions.</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.079" end="01:09:26.290" style="s2">And so in many cases, yes, a lot of Postmodernism,<br />in some of its manifestations, is disingenuous</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.290" end="01:09:33.670" style="s2">in that form. People don’t necessarily buy<br />into the postmodern philosophical framework,</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.670" end="01:09:41.279" style="s2">but rather, in kind of pragmatic form, Postmodernism<br />as a set of “tools” is useful for them</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.279" end="01:09:46.659" style="s2">to advance their own personal and social agendas,<br />whatever those happen to be.</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.659" end="01:09:55.090" style="s2">Okay. So let’s switch a little bit. Let’s<br />switch over into that a little bit. I’ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.090" end="01:09:59.849" style="s2">found our discussion extremely useful on the<br />philosophical end, but now I would like to</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.849" end="01:10:02.719" style="s2">make it a bit more personal, if you don’t<br />mind.</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.719" end="01:10:04.949" style="s2">You’re written this book Explaining Postmodernism:<br />Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.949" end="01:10:11.239" style="s2">Foucault. And it’s a fairly “punchy,”<br />let’s say, critique of Postmodernism and</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.239" end="01:10:17.500" style="s2">its alliance with Neo-Marxism. And you’ve<br />done a careful job of laying out the historical</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.500" end="01:10:22.560" style="s2">development of both of those movements and<br />their alliance.</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.560" end="01:10:31.080" style="s2">(1) What was your motivation for doing that;<br />and what have you experienced as a consequence</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.080" end="01:10:36.320" style="s2">(1) of writing the book, and (2) as a consequence<br />of being a professor who’s in the midst</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.320" end="01:10:42.130" style="s2">of an academic society that’s basically<br />running on postmodern principles?</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.130" end="01:10:48.780" style="s2">[laughs] Yes, that’s a good trio of questions<br />there. Well, my motivations for writing the</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.780" end="01:10:59.150" style="s2">book were: One, as an intellectual exercise:<br />here was a movement that was complex, many</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.150" end="01:11:05.979" style="s2">philosophical and cultural strands coming<br />together, and I enjoy intellectual history</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.979" end="01:11:11.719" style="s2">very much—so it was a pleasure for me to<br />read back into the histories and to tease</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.719" end="01:11:16.499" style="s2">out all of the lines of developments, and<br />how things were packaged and repackaged—so</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.499" end="01:11:24.320" style="s2">that the postmodern synthesis (as it came<br />together in the second third of the 20th century)</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.320" end="01:11:34.699" style="s2">came into being. As a purely intellectual<br />historical enterprise, I found that fulfilling.</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.699" end="01:11:41.789" style="s2">Partly also this was the 1990s, late 1990s,<br />it’s end of the Cold War. One of the things</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.789" end="01:11:47.420" style="s2">I had done—not professionally, but just<br />out of personal interest—was read a lot</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.420" end="01:11:53.409" style="s2">of political philosophy, read a lot about<br />the Cold War and the intellectual developments—and</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.409" end="01:11:57.840" style="s2">call it political developments—that had<br />gone on there. So I had a very good, I’d</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.840" end="01:12:04.170" style="s2">say, amateur working knowledge, before I started<br />researching the book, about the history of</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.170" end="01:12:07.999" style="s2">Marxism and the history of Cold War geo-politics.</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.999" end="01:12:13.270" style="s2">And sort of one of the big questions on everyone’s<br />mind of course in the late 1990s with the</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.270" end="01:12:17.949" style="s2">fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the<br />Cold War is: What’s going to happen next?</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.949" end="01:12:22.010" style="s2">So what’s the new geo-political alignment<br />going to be?</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.010" end="01:12:30.110" style="s2">Then from my academic position, the big question<br />inside the intellectual word is: Since far-left</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.110" end="01:12:39.059" style="s2">politics had been so prominent and that for<br />generations, intellectuals inside the academic</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.059" end="01:12:45.479" style="s2">world had largely given the benefit of the<br />doubt to far-leftist experiments—even going</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.479" end="01:12:51.860" style="s2">out of their way to be fellow travelers, and<br />so forth—that by the time you get to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.860" end="01:12:59.270" style="s2">end of the Cold War, basically everybody,<br />except for a few true believers, is rethinking.</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.270" end="01:13:04.539" style="s2">So what does this mean for—not necessarily<br />left politics more broadly, but certainly</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.539" end="01:13:12.809" style="s2">for far-left politics? And so even the far-leftists<br />of the leftists are recognizing that they’re</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.809" end="01:13:18.619" style="s2">going to have to come up with some sort of<br />a new strategy in order to remain intellectually</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.619" end="01:13:25.409" style="s2">respectable, and some sort of a new strategy<br />in order to become culturally and politically</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.409" end="01:13:26.699" style="s2">feasible.</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.699" end="01:13:33.739" style="s2">So I did have a kind of a cultural/political<br />interest in what the thinking was on the far</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.739" end="01:13:39.620" style="s2">left about what they’re going to do now<br />that the Soviet Union has collapsed and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.620" end="01:13:45.900" style="s2">whole world is shifting more toward a market<br />liberalism or to some sort of “third way”</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.900" end="01:13:46.900" style="s2">centrism.</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.900" end="01:13:50.650" style="s2">Yeah, and now that all the corpses have floated<br />up on the beach, so to speak …</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.650" end="01:13:55.840" style="s2">Right. Yes! So you have a huge then amount<br />of empirical data that you have to confront</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.840" end="01:14:01.730" style="s2">and…Now, I think this is going to be part<br />of the postmodern package, but there’s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.730" end="01:14:08.199" style="s2">lot of denial of the relevance of empiricism;<br />there’s a lot of denial of the relevance</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.199" end="01:14:14.540" style="s2">of logic and social-scientific statistical<br />methods of aggregating that data and reaching</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.540" end="01:14:19.239" style="s2">normative conclusions on the basis of that.<br />So we can understand the temptation on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.239" end="01:14:25.760" style="s2">part of a lot of people to find psychological<br />devices that will enable them to deny the</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.760" end="01:14:32.249" style="s2">Gulag and the various other horrible things.<br />By the time the 90s …</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.249" end="01:14:38.929" style="s2">Right. When the facts, as even you [of the<br />left] would have construed them, are stacking</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.929" end="01:14:44.469" style="s2">up viciously in contradiction to your theory,<br />it’s time to mount an all-out assault on</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.469" end="01:14:46.090" style="s2">what constitutes a “fact.”</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.090" end="01:14:50.369" style="s2">Okay, that’s one strategy, and that’s<br />again one of the sub-strategies I think that</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.369" end="01:14:57.709" style="s2">postmoderns will use. So, if you then have<br />philosophers and social scientists, and people</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.709" end="01:15:02.350" style="s2">who are up to speed in their epistemology,<br />who are telling you, Well, you know, there</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.350" end="01:15:07.309" style="s2">are just different narratives that are out<br />there, and there are no such things as objective</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.309" end="01:15:13.349" style="s2">facts, and logic does not necessarily point<br />us in one direction: there are “poly-logics”</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.349" end="01:15:17.949" style="s2">or “multiple frameworks”—then if you<br />have one “framework” that says, “No.</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.949" end="01:15:25.110" style="s2">There are objective facts and the logic is<br />all going against your version of political</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.110" end="01:15:29.010" style="s2">idealism,” then it’s going to be very<br />tempting for you to say, “Well, I can just</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.010" end="01:15:34.139" style="s2">dismiss that as just one narrative way of<br />constructing the historical facts: I can come</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.139" end="01:15:38.110" style="s2">up with a different narrative that softens<br />or denies altogether …”</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.110" end="01:15:43.729" style="s2">And certainly some of the bad-faith postmodernists<br />do go down that road very much.</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.729" end="01:15:47.329" style="s2">So in part that was my motivation for writing<br />the book.</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.329" end="01:15:55.139" style="s2">And in part I did feel that I was in a good<br />position intellectually to do so because my</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.139" end="01:16:01.400" style="s2">Ph.D. work had been in logic, philosophy of<br />science and epistemology, so I was up to speed</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.400" end="01:16:09.659" style="s2">on the entire history of epistemology from<br />the modern world on through the way things</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.659" end="01:16:15.449" style="s2">were in the 80s and the early 1990s. So I<br />was reading the same people that Rorty had.</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.449" end="01:16:21.530" style="s2">I have to say I learned an enormous amount<br />from reading Richard Rorty. He’s first rate,</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.530" end="01:16:27.460" style="s2">even though I end up disagreeing fundamentally<br />with him about everything … Foucault’s</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.460" end="01:16:33.410" style="s2">Ph.D. also was in philosophy; he also had<br />a Ph.D. in psychology. Derrida—another philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.410" end="01:16:40.280" style="s2">Ph.D. Lyotard—another philosophy Ph.D. So,<br />not necessarily putting myself on the same</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.280" end="01:16:47.640" style="s2">stature intellectually, but all of us, so<br />to speak, are first-rate educated in epistemology.</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.640" end="01:16:52.000" style="s2">So I know where they’re coming from and<br />where all of that is going.</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.000" end="01:16:59.079" style="s2">At the same time, my undergraduate and master’s<br />degree at Guelph (just down the road from</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.079" end="01:17:06.440" style="s2">you) in history of philosophy—so I had a<br />long-standing passion for how arguments and</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.440" end="01:17:14.190" style="s2">movements develop over time, so I thought<br />I was in a good position to see how postmodernism</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.190" end="01:17:19.650" style="s2">had evolved out of various other earlier movements<br />that had developed over time—and I am enough</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.650" end="01:17:25.929" style="s2">of a political animal to be interested in<br />political philosophy. And I believe that abstract</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.929" end="01:17:30.829" style="s2">philosophical theory, when it gets put into<br />practice, makes life-and-death practical differences</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.829" end="01:17:31.829" style="s2">…</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.829" end="01:17:37.519" style="s2">So the stakes are high. So I was motivated<br />then to put it all together: How does the</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.519" end="01:17:43.080" style="s2">history and the philosophy and the politics<br />all come together in Postmodernism? So I wrote</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.080" end="01:17:44.080" style="s2">the book.</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.080" end="01:17:52.659" style="s2">Now, yes. How it has affected me personally<br />in academic life. Well, let me see. In one</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.659" end="01:17:58.909" style="s2">way I think I was fortunate that I had tenure<br />by the time the book was published, and my</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.909" end="01:18:04.749" style="s2">university is by and large a tolerant place.<br />We have some issues here, but by and large</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.749" end="01:18:13.840" style="s2">my colleagues are reasonable, decent people,<br />and at least I was able to get tenure on the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.840" end="01:18:21.400" style="s2">strength of my teaching abilities and my publication.<br />And so it wasn’t that I was going to lose</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.400" end="01:18:23.929" style="s2">my job over this.</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.929" end="01:18:29.000" style="s2">But of course there is blowback. I did have<br />difficulty getting the book published in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.000" end="01:18:35.449" style="s2">first place. Actually I finished writing the<br />book by the year 2000. I had taken a sabbatical</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.449" end="01:18:40.929" style="s2">from 1999-2000 and wrote the book then, but<br />I was not able to get the book published until</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.929" end="01:18:50.229" style="s2">2004, and the reason for that was a number<br />of “desk rejections”—you know, the editor</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.229" end="01:18:55.229" style="s2">just sends a form letter back. I got a few<br />of those. But, more seriously, what happened</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.229" end="01:19:00.479" style="s2">three times, possibly four times, I don’t<br />remember exactly now, was it would get past</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.479" end="01:19:06.479" style="s2">the editor at the press, and then it would<br />be sent out to two or three reviewers—and</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.479" end="01:19:12.679" style="s2">in each case what happened was I would get<br />split and polarized-split reviews. One would</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.679" end="01:19:17.909" style="s2">come back and say, “This is a really good<br />book; he’s done his homework, it’s a good</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.909" end="01:19:22.229" style="s2">argument, it’s a fresh argument … I don’t<br />necessarily agree with all of it, but this</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.229" end="01:19:28.099" style="s2">really ought to be out there as a book”;<br />and then the other review on the other side</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.099" end="01:19:33.590" style="s2">would be equally savaging: “This is a terrible<br />book; he doesn’t know his history of philosophy,</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.590" end="01:19:38.289" style="s2">he’s butchered this that and the other thing,<br />and I strongly recommend that you don’t</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.289" end="01:19:44.739" style="s2">publish this book.” And then almost always<br />in that situation, the editor just says, “No.”</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.739" end="01:19:53.031" style="s2">So it wasn’t until late 2003, early 2004,<br />that Scholargy Publishing, which was then</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.031" end="01:19:59.369" style="s2">a small press working out of Arizona, took<br />the book on, and I’m happy to say that after</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.369" end="01:20:02.920" style="s2">it was published, it’s been in print consistently<br />since then.</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.920" end="01:20:04.590" style="s2">Yes, that’s remarkable. That’s remarkable.</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.590" end="01:20:06.929" style="s2">Yes, so I’m very happy about that …</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.929" end="01:20:09.599" style="s2">For any book, let alone an academic book.</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.599" end="01:20:15.380" style="s2">Yes, and then multiple translations, and those<br />continue, so I’m happy about that.</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.380" end="01:20:23.929" style="s2">Now I’d say the scholarly responses have<br />been from moderate liberals: so kind of traditional</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.929" end="01:20:30.699" style="s2">… don’t necessarily want to use the word<br />“traditional,” but from rational, naturalistic,</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.699" end="01:20:37.349" style="s2">liberal thinkers, conservatives and libertarians:<br />the reviews have all been strong, and strongly</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.349" end="01:20:38.349" style="s2">positive.</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.349" end="01:20:47.749" style="s2">But I have not received any formal reviews<br />from any of the postmodern or far-left journals,</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.749" end="01:20:52.829" style="s2">so I’m not sure what that means, but there<br />is, at least at some level, an unwillingness</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.829" end="01:20:53.829" style="s2">to engage ...</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.829" end="01:20:56.999" style="s2">Well, it might be a sign of respect.</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.999" end="01:21:00.821" style="s2">Well there is one sign of respect that comes<br />out, and that is that every… I’d say once</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.821" end="01:21:06.369" style="s2">a year or so … probably a dozen times since<br />the book has been published, I’ve been asked</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.369" end="01:21:13.690" style="s2">by the editor of a postmodern or close fellow-traveler,<br />critical-theory-type of journal, to be a second</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.690" end="01:21:19.969" style="s2">reviewer on one of their articles. So I’m<br />“in their Rolodex,” so to speak—to use</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.969" end="01:21:25.519" style="s2">the old-fashioned label—when they are actually<br />looking for someone who is likely to give</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.519" end="01:21:31.639" style="s2">an objective but critical perspective on some<br />article that’s been submitted to the journal—once</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.639" end="01:21:35.360" style="s2">in a while my name floats up and they’ll<br />send it out to me, so I’ll just do the standard</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.360" end="01:21:40.079" style="s2">thing of reading it and giving my professional<br />opinion of it.</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.079" end="01:21:44.210" style="s2">So I think they are aware of me, but there<br />hasn’t really been any direct intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.210" end="01:21:46.760" style="s2">engagement, which is kind of sad.</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.760" end="01:21:53.769" style="s2">Right. Yes. So now when you set yourself up<br />to write the book, were you thinking of writing</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.769" end="01:22:00.110" style="s2">a critique of postmodernism, or were you thinking<br />of conducting an exploration of postmodernism?</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.110" end="01:22:06.869" style="s2">Well, right now I’m working on the critique.<br />The first book ends—I don’t want to say</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.869" end="01:22:14.760" style="s2">abruptly—but it does end with the door open<br />to saying: How then do we respond to this</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.760" end="01:22:20.920" style="s2">dead end of Counter-Enlightenment thought<br />in postmodernism? So we’re at a point culturally</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.920" end="01:22:27.150" style="s2">where the meaning of postmodernism has now<br />infected the academy and you see problems</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.150" end="01:22:31.059" style="s2">there, but it’s also left the academy, and<br />so thoughtful people outside the academy are</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.059" end="01:22:35.999" style="s2">seeing the results. And so the big question<br />is: What do we do next?</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.999" end="01:22:41.699" style="s2">So I am actively working on the sequel to<br />Explaining Postmodernism now. And I did go</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.699" end="01:22:47.719" style="s2">back and forth in the writing of it. My first<br />purpose was to write a straight diagnosis</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.719" end="01:22:54.989" style="s2">and intellectual history of postmodernism,<br />and that’s where I ended up leaving it,</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.989" end="01:23:01.900" style="s2">because in one sense this was a bit artificial,<br />but I really like 200-page books. It’s long</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.900" end="01:23:07.530" style="s2">enough for you to get into a subject deeply<br />enough and to make a good, pointed, integrated</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.530" end="01:23:09.909" style="s2">argument and then stop.</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.909" end="01:23:16.550" style="s2">And so I realized if I wrote the sequel then,<br />it would be a 400-page book, and I thought</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.550" end="01:23:20.749" style="s2">it was more important to get this self-contained<br />intellectual history of postmodernism out</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.749" end="01:23:34.429" style="s2">there. So I brought things to I think a logical<br />conclusion where I ended the book, and now</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.429" end="01:23:36.010" style="s2">I’m working on the next.</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.010" end="01:23:37.079" style="s2">What’s the next one called?</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.079" end="01:23:41.289" style="s2">The working title … it changes every few<br />months or so—sometimes I think about, The</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.289" end="01:23:47.849" style="s2">Fate of the Enlightenment or something to<br />do with Neo-Enlightenment or—it won’t</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.849" end="01:23:55.039" style="s2">be this—but Post-Postmodernism or After<br />Postmodernism—something like that.</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.039" end="01:23:59.059" style="s2">Okay. We’ve been struggling with terminology<br />as well with the people I’m been talking</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.059" end="01:24:00.320" style="s2">with about such things.</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.320" end="01:24:07.671" style="s2">It’s a very hard thing to do, because as<br />we’ve seen philosophically, Postmodernism</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.671" end="01:24:12.670" style="s2">is multi-dimensional: it’s a metaphysical<br />critique, it’s a normative critique, it’s</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.670" end="01:24:17.809" style="s2">a political critique, it’s an epistemological<br />set of views. And so the alternative then</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.809" end="01:24:24.519" style="s2">also has to be integrated philosophically.<br />There has to be an entire philosophical package—so</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.519" end="01:24:32.100" style="s2">what label is going to capture all of that<br />and at the same time make a connection to</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.100" end="01:24:38.090" style="s2">postmodernism—and also, I’m basically<br />an optimistic positive guy, so I want something</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.090" end="01:24:40.519" style="s2">that has a positive …</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.519" end="01:24:42.539" style="s2">Yes, illuminates the pathway forward.</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.539" end="01:24:47.219" style="s2">Yes, that’s right, yes. Making the world<br />a better place</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.219" end="01:24:53.519" style="s2">Right. Exactly, exactly. So look—I think<br />an hour-and-a-half interview is approximately</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.519" end="01:24:55.499" style="s2">the equivalent of a 200-page book.</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.499" end="01:24:57.119" style="s2">So we’re done.</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.119" end="01:25:04.539" style="s2">Why don’t we end with that, and what I would<br />like to propose is that we have another discussion</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.539" end="01:25:10.159" style="s2">in a couple of months about what you’re<br />thinking about with regards to what you’re</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.159" end="01:25:11.159" style="s2">writing now.</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.159" end="01:25:15.400" style="s2">So, like, we’ve covered the intellectual<br />territory; we’ve covered the historical</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.400" end="01:25:21.789" style="s2">territory; and done a reasonably good job<br />I think of both “justifying” postmodernism</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.789" end="01:25:25.709" style="s2">in this discussion, and also pointing out<br />its pitfalls and dangers.</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.709" end="01:25:26.739" style="s2">Sure, yes.</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.739" end="01:25:34.510" style="s2">We haven’t outlined much for an alternative<br />vision except making tangential reference</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.510" end="01:25:42.079" style="s2">to the potency of individual capacity, but<br />that would seem to be reasonable grounds for</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.079" end="01:25:43.310" style="s2">the next discussion. So …</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.310" end="01:25:48.739" style="s2">What else would be worth, next time we chat,<br />talking about are the current culture war</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.739" end="01:25:53.559" style="s2">issues. You know, one of the things I’m<br />very interested in is younger people in particular</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.559" end="01:25:59.539" style="s2">who are in the front lines in universities,<br />so to speak, and they’re surrounded and</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.539" end="01:26:06.039" style="s2">bewildered and angry, and in some cases, intimidated<br />by all of this “micro-aggressions” and</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.039" end="01:26:08.949" style="s2">so forth, and in some cases the indoctrination<br />they’re getting …</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.949" end="01:26:13.619" style="s2">But I’m actually kind of glad that we didn’t<br />talk about the more political end of it today,</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.619" end="01:26:17.289" style="s2">because it enabled us to have a conversation<br />that was almost entirely philosophical in</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.289" end="01:26:23.059" style="s2">nature, and I really think that’s the right<br />level of analysis, because the battle that’s</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.059" end="01:26:27.130" style="s2">occurring in our culture is actually occurring<br />at a philosophical level. I mean, there’s</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.130" end="01:26:32.130" style="s2">other levels as well, but that’s even more<br />important than the political level as far</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.130" end="01:26:33.130" style="s2">as I’m concerned.</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.130" end="01:26:37.030" style="s2">Well said. I agree one-hundred percent. Nicely<br />put.</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.030" end="01:26:39.349" style="s2">All right. Well, it was a pleasure speaking<br />with you—it was very much worthwhile.</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.349" end="01:26:40.429" style="s2">For me too, thanks much.</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.429" end="01:26:45.310" style="s2">You have a remarkable capacity for tracking<br />the content of conversations and keeping them</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.310" end="01:26:49.979" style="s2">on point, so that’s quite amazing to see,<br />because we did branch out in a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.979" end="01:26:55.920" style="s2">directions, more or less simultaneously, and<br />it was quite helpful in keeping the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.920" end="01:27:00.870" style="s2">on track that you could so rapidly organize<br />the … You know, it was almost like you were</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.870" end="01:27:04.139" style="s2">putting a paragraph structure in the conversation<br />as it occurred, so that was something that</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.139" end="01:27:05.729" style="s2">was really interesting to see.</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.729" end="01:27:09.610" style="s2">So, anyways, it was a pleasure meeting you,<br />and thanks very much for talking with me.</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.610" end="01:27:12.869" style="s2">I’ll obviously put a link … I’ve been<br />recommending your book like …</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.869" end="01:27:17.409" style="s2">My pleasure. Much respect for the work you’re<br />doing. Thanks for having me on your show,</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.409" end="01:27:19.499" style="s2">and will be happy to talk again.</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.499" end="01:27:21.090" style="s2">Great. Good. We’ll set that up.</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.090" end="01:27:22.389" style="s2">All right. Thanks Jordan. Bye.</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.389" end="01:27:23.679" style="s2">See you. Yep. Bye bye.</p>
