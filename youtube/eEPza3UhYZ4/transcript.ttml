<p begin="00:00:10.639" end="00:00:16.720" style="s2">so we were going to talk today</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.160" end="00:00:19.520" style="s2">about uh reinventio reinventing</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.720" end="00:00:20.720" style="s2">yeah uh art right you wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.520" end="00:00:24.960" style="s2">about art</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.720" end="00:00:26.880" style="s2">yes and the importance of art and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:28.800" style="s2">some false notions we have about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.880" end="00:00:30.560" style="s2">that is and or some</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:33.200" style="s2">some limited notions we have about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.560" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">that is and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.200" end="00:00:40.559" style="s2">and how do we make art relevant again</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:42.239" style="s2">um for this time and which means going</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:42.960" style="s2">again like all of our discussions to a</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.239" end="00:00:44.480" style="s2">meta level</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.960" end="00:00:46.559" style="s2">and saying what is art and what is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.480" end="00:00:48.879" style="s2">function of art what is the function of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.559" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">art for the human soul</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.879" end="00:00:53.120" style="s2">uh and all that so this is you know this</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:56.320" style="s2">is what i want to hear from you</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.120" end="00:00:59.440" style="s2">you guys about which i think you might</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.320" end="00:01:01.120" style="s2">get andrew i&#39;d like to add one more</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.440" end="00:01:02.559" style="s2">thing to that one more question one more</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.120" end="00:01:05.920" style="s2">dimension</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.559" end="00:01:07.360" style="s2">i&#39;m actually also interested in what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.920" end="00:01:10.400" style="s2">the role of art within</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.360" end="00:01:11.439" style="s2">the logos and dialectic right i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.400" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.439" end="00:01:15.040" style="s2">this exploration of art for its own sake</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">sorry for the pun</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.040" end="00:01:18.799" style="s2">uh but i&#39;m also interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.799" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">art for how i can better understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.119" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">the role and function of art within the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">practice of dialectic and theologists</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s to me what&#39;s most uppermost on my</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:36.079" style="s2">mind right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:38.079" style="s2">okay um so that&#39;s interesting because i</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.079" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">think art is always a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.079" end="00:01:45.200" style="s2">dialectic of some kind um</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:46.960" style="s2">i mean uh you know i&#39;ve been a musician</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.200" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">and i&#39;ve there&#39;s there&#39;s a dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.960" end="00:01:50.240" style="s2">between the artist and the audience</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">there&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to express</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.240" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">and how people receive that and um</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">what do you what do you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">what specifically</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:03.280" style="s2">would art have uh what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:04.719" style="s2">what does dialogues have to do with with</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.280" end="00:02:07.840" style="s2">art</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.719" end="00:02:09.440" style="s2">well thank you that&#39;s a very uh it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.840" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">very platforming question you just gave</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">i i remember i&#39;m influenced by scary&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:19.520" style="s2">work on beauty and the way beauty trains</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:20.800" style="s2">us for truth and justice</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">and we&#39;ve already discussed that at</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.800" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">length um and i&#39;m similarly influenced</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:29.920" style="s2">by collingwood&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">that what art does is get us to remember</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.920" end="00:02:33.200" style="s2">um the non-categorical identity of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.200" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">uh kind of the sexiness and and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">that brings me into is that i see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:40.959" style="s2">happening in art is a serious playing</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.959" end="00:02:45.920" style="s2">and through our salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">and i think one of the things that art</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.920" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">can do for us</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">and one of the things art should do for</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">us is to take us into that liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">where we&#39;re trying to improve our</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:03:02.000" style="s2">capacity for discernment</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">see so in i i&#39;m also deeply influenced</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.000" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">by fisher&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">on you know uh the aesthetics of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">the rainbow and rare experiences where</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">he talks about how art puts us on what</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:14.959" style="s2">he calls the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">horizon of intelligibility so i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.959" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">art therefore puts us into situations</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">at least superficially look like</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">in that often in art so what what do i</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">in art uh sorry in bullshit let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">there first</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">in bullshit one of the defining features</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">of it is things are salient beyond our</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:38.319" style="s2">things are sailing beyond our right our</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:40.000" style="s2">our ability to grasp them</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.319" end="00:03:41.920" style="s2">and we&#39;re just caught up in how salient</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.000" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">things are independent of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.920" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:47.360" style="s2">but in art at least initially we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.840" end="00:03:49.280" style="s2">be getting into something similar</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.360" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">where often especially in great works of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.280" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">art right we&#39;re finding things salient</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">before we have an understanding often</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:03:59.439" style="s2">art</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:03:59.439" style="s2">is triggering</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.680" end="00:04:04.720" style="s2">you incoh feelings and thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.439" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">conceptions and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.720" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">when you say in kuwait you mean art gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">us in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:12.080" style="s2">what we don&#39;t quite yet already know</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.080" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">exactly exactly so art is</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">often and this is what i take fisher to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">mean by the horizon of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">right art is often ascending it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">trying to point us</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">into a space beyond where we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">and now the thing about that is like i</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">said that at least is superficially very</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">similar to bullshit but there seems to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">be a difference between them</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:38.639" style="s2">um and and and fischer makes his</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">connection to socrates in his book</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.639" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">he talks about yeah but with art</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">right what&#39;s happening is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing a state of wonder</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing a state of opening</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">and trying to recover a deeper sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:59.360" style="s2">truth or realness</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">whereas in bullshit the opposite is</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.360" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">happening the opposite is happening is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">one is pretending to know all that one</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:06.479" style="s2">needs to know</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:08.080" style="s2">and one has become indifferent to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.479" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">truth so wonder is an</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:13.919" style="s2">opening so it&#39;s an extensive opening</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">where bullshit is an ostentatious</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.919" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">closing</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.800" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">so although they escape perhaps right</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">sometimes an escape but i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:23.360" style="s2">what the bullshit artist wants you to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">is to not think anymore</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.360" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">right the bullshit artist is really</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">trying to get you caught up</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:30.320" style="s2">in not thinking and not caring about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:31.199" style="s2">truth that was frankford&#39;s central</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.320" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">notion</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.199" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">whereas the work of art where are it</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">well it might look like bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">initially because we&#39;re like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:42.080" style="s2">perplexed</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">but that wonder i think at least should</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if it always is intended to</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:48.479" style="s2">be but that wonder</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:49.440" style="s2">should be in the service of drawing us</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.479" end="00:05:52.479" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.440" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">a deeper getting uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.479" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">re-awakening our concern for what</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">matters for what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">right and so i think if that argument is</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">is plausible and this also maybe is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:06.639" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">between actual art and let&#39;s say um</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.639" end="00:06:10.319" style="s2">mindless entertainment which is yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">bullshit right</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.319" end="00:06:13.759" style="s2">yeah yes exactly that&#39;s that&#39;s how i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">trying that&#39;s exactly where i was going</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.759" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">to go with this andrew</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:20.479" style="s2">so thank you for that foresight so if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:22.560" style="s2">if we do have that kind of a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:23.759" style="s2">one of the things art does for us in</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.560" end="00:06:25.759" style="s2">contrast</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.759" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">to entertainment and this is an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">thesis that a lot of artists won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">initially like because of romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:33.919" style="s2">but art has an</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:34.720" style="s2">educational function in that what art is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.919" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">supposed to do is</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.720" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">tutor us in it right into actively</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">learning how to discern between</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:47.520" style="s2">bullshit and wonder how to actively</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:48.960" style="s2">right allow our salience landscaping to</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.520" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">be restructured</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.960" end="00:06:54.400" style="s2">in the service of the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">truth or a deeper connection as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.400" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">to as you said</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:59.199" style="s2">an escape or an isolation or a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">misdirection</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.199" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">right or as you said entertainment where</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:05.919" style="s2">we just sort of try to cut ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:07.520" style="s2">off for a while from reality i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.919" end="00:07:08.880" style="s2">opposed to entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.520" end="00:07:12.000" style="s2">but i&#39;m opposed to entertainment as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.880" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">way of life um and i think art</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.000" end="00:07:16.560" style="s2">when art is distinct from entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">art is helping to portend a way of life</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.000" end="00:07:25.120" style="s2">i&#39;m going to jump on that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:29.199" style="s2">an independent but i think complementary</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.120" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">thought which is that the opening</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.199" end="00:07:33.919" style="s2">the affordance of opening of worlding if</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:36.160" style="s2">i can put it that way that art allows</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.919" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">is that art as a function i think one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">the things that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:40.720" style="s2">does functionally is it helps to</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">transcribe</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.720" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">the logos of a given notion of again a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">given encounter</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">into mythos it it it involves a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.879" end="00:07:52.879" style="s2">dispersal</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">of an experience into a landscape that</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.879" end="00:07:57.840" style="s2">can then be regathered</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:08:00.160" style="s2">and retrieved and cohered</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.840" end="00:08:00.960" style="s2">as a world unto itself and so then made</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.160" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.960" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">and so then when it&#39;s recovered and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">recollected it is recovered and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">recollected in such a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">is i think disposed more elegantly</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">right so that one of the things that art</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">actually allows us to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">is take the logos of a given experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">and telescope it out in an accordion</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:23.680" style="s2">so that it can actually become something</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">to be traversed</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.680" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">and indwelled and known from within and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:30.400" style="s2">cohered from within</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">so that in the regathering of it it can</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.400" end="00:08:34.959" style="s2">be known more fully and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:36.399" style="s2">known through right so i think of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.959" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">something like narrative narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:39.519" style="s2">certainly by no means the only form of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">art but i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.519" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">for for a good reason it&#39;s often a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">canonical form when people give such</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:46.000" style="s2">examples</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">storytelling for instance so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.000" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">things that storytelling does is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:51.519" style="s2">takes a given pattern</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">and makes that pattern participable it</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.519" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">makes it traversable explorable and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">infinitely discoverable right you make a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">out of a concept a world out of a notion</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">and your encounter with the notion</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">speciates encounters</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">that can then be re-gathered and cohered</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">in your understanding your episteme of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">that particular pattern</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:14.720" style="s2">and i think i think that the function of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">art has something to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.720" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">speciating of different forms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:21.760" style="s2">encounter</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:24.240" style="s2">from our ultimate encounter with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.760" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">logos</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.240" end="00:09:27.440" style="s2">are you saying that art has like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:30.480" style="s2">parabolic function yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.440" end="00:09:33.760" style="s2">yes exactly the way in the republic</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.480" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">uh you know socrates proposes blowing</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.760" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">the psyche up</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.640" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">magnifying it into the state so that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">can get a better understanding of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:41.200" style="s2">politically and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">re-internalize that back and become</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.200" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">different because of that is that yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.519" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">exactly like as if you know let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">let&#39;s say our our intent is to look to</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:52.240" style="s2">know the logos of nature</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">one of the things that art does is it it</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">produces the flora</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:57.839" style="s2">and fauna that allow us to explore it so</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">that we can better gather</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.839" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">and re-gather and re-gather still with</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">with appreciating precision perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:08.560" style="s2">ontologically the logos of nature at</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:10.320" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.560" end="00:10:12.399" style="s2">and and and there&#39;s some so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.320" end="00:10:13.920" style="s2">something exploratory about art that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.399" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2">actually allows us to to</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.920" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">i think this is a neoplatonic idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.600" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">although i think gadamer talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">a little bit too</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">that we disperse it so as to better</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">recover it</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">so as to recollapse it together this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:28.560" style="s2">one question i have</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">uh and and that is you know in plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.560" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">republic</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:32.800" style="s2">plato is quite sensorious about about</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:34.399" style="s2">art right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.800" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">art should be like this and not like</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.399" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">this and he&#39;s very particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">so that the danger is art becomes a kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">of moralism right</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:47.279" style="s2">it becomes a kind of uh uh tale of</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">uh good or evil right where sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">you know in edgar allan poe when when</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">the guy is stabbing the the the cat with</p>

<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">this is like that&#39;s the thing that opens</p>

<p begin="00:10:59.839" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">educational or moralistic quality to it</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:07.839" style="s2">it&#39;s just opens you up to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:10.480" style="s2">to a kind of naked perspective so</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.839" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">i hear you john and i agree that art has</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.480" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">this sort of educational</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">uh quality but but then i&#39;m afraid</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">of it becoming a kind of moralism yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">wasn&#39;t i wasn&#39;t trying to add i</p>

<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying andrew</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.959" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">i was trying to and i want to gather</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">together with what just said it</p>

<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:34.720" style="s2">of art that i would answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">you posed to me</p>

<p begin="00:11:38.079" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">i was proposing to that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:45.360" style="s2">analogous to how philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">plays with concepts art plays with our</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.040" end="00:12:00.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a training in wonder</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:02.959" style="s2">it&#39;s a training and wonder where wonder</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">is something that allows us to discern</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.959" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">between the opening up right to</p>

<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">more than what we have seen or known and</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.839" end="00:12:17.680" style="s2">see the thing about poe is poe is there</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.399" end="00:12:18.560" style="s2">is still the aesthetic there that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.680" end="00:12:20.560" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.560" end="00:12:22.320" style="s2">because you know the moments in po those</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.560" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">those moments of horror</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.320" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">right horror is another way of getting</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">you outside of the categorical</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">like identity of things those moments of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:33.200" style="s2">horror we realized potential in</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">the in the world that we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.200" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">realize before and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:38.399" style="s2">and post horror is directed towards</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">getting us to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.399" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">to be more in touch with reality as it</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">is poe is trying to break</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:47.200" style="s2">through the veneer of civilized</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:50.079" style="s2">existence and remind us no no</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.200" end="00:12:50.560" style="s2">remember underneath all of this veneer</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.079" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:53.760" style="s2">this and this is really there so i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:56.079" style="s2">poe</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.760" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">actually is a good example of exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.079" end="00:12:59.360" style="s2">what i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.200" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">because i think horror well we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.360" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">about this i think horror and awe and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:04.399" style="s2">wonder</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:06.639" style="s2">are all on a continuum and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.399" end="00:13:08.880" style="s2">horror is a way in which we telescope</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:10.720" style="s2">the way chris is saying our salience</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.880" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">landscaping so that we can move</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.720" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">into we can seriously play ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">into that liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">where we can wonder again about</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">ourselves and the world but if that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:22.399" style="s2">became too explicit</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:23.839" style="s2">or or then then it would lose its power</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.839" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">it has to be very angular or something</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:29.360" style="s2">it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">it shouldn&#39;t be philosophy art shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.360" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">be philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:33.839" style="s2">yeah right now that art shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">philosophy i keep saying that because</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.839" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what i&#39;m saying i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.519" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">art is working with a different</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:42.959" style="s2">part of our cognitive faculties that</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">you know that need to be addressed and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.959" end="00:13:46.839" style="s2">educated independent</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:49.040" style="s2">of our capacity for reflective</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.839" end="00:13:53.040" style="s2">conceptualization very much</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.040" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">but you see i&#39;ve noticed that whenever</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.040" end="00:13:56.160" style="s2">whatever degree i&#39;ve been trained in an</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:13:59.760" style="s2">art i&#39;ve noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">what happens is i get a training in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.760" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">kind of discernment</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:04.639" style="s2">that i&#39;m talking about and again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">not it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a propositional</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.639" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">it&#39;s an actual</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">sensory motor discernment that allows me</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">distinguish between when people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">manipulating the salience</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.480" end="00:14:15.760" style="s2">to bullshit me and when they&#39;re manipu</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:20.399" style="s2">manipulating the salience in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">that i yeah i don&#39;t know i&#39;m slightly</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.399" end="00:14:23.920" style="s2">confused but that confusion is</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">ultimately towards a good end because</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.920" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">that&#39;s why air is so important because</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:30.240" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really allow you to bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">some of it like well you can&#39;t it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:33.839" style="s2">propositionally bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">you can&#39;t make something you can make a</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">kind of simulacrum of something</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s but you know that it&#39;s a fake</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">right uh if if you have the eye of</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">discernment and can tell what is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">genuine work of art you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.440" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:49.600" style="s2">and what it is that&#39;s that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:51.600" style="s2">the work of of contemplating a worker</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.600" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">i think that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly it i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.600" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">trying to situate</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">think about think about how we train</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:58.959" style="s2">discernment we train the sermon by</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">by by putting ourselves into contrasting</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:03.199" style="s2">situations and i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">art gets us like art is training us to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.199" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">discernment in contrast to entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">on one side and propaganda on another</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">propaganda looks like art but i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.160" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">doing that kind of thing it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">trying to make you not think it&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">to bullshit you</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.480" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to get you self-enclosed</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:23.279" style="s2">within an ideological framework</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:25.120" style="s2">yeah right which is why art is really</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.279" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">i think one of its functions is to take</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.120" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">the closed ends of the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">and make them porous again yes right to</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">reopen</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:34.720" style="s2">the world in such a way that the that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">the the to to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:38.079" style="s2">perhaps to refrain to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">language we&#39;ve been using in our</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.079" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">previous discussions to take this to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">take the such of an encounter and use it</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">as a way of presencing the want for more</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">yes exactly right that&#39;s why there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:50.079" style="s2">inherent and implicit errors to art is</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:52.320" style="s2">that it&#39;s somehow</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.079" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">it&#39;s somehow recollective of its own</p>

<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">of these craft-oriented activities that</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:39.919" style="s2">she&#39;s undertaking</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">habitually in the course of her daily</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.919" end="00:17:43.840" style="s2">life take on this</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:47.360" style="s2">pregnancy they take on this great sense</p>

<p begin="00:17:47.360" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">and then she realizes at one point she</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:52.880" style="s2">has this insight</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:54.559" style="s2">where she actually realizes that all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.880" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">the these</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.559" end="00:18:00.080" style="s2">these new loves that she is encountering</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">and all of these different forms of arts</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.080" end="00:18:03.919" style="s2">and crafts</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">are all species of the same love that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.919" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">she has for this man</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">that has been visiting and so these</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">these arts become a way of affining</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">the specific encounters that she has</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">with any one of these activities</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">with the way in which they are all being</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.919" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">gathered and the force in virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">which they are all being gathered</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:30.000" style="s2">which isn&#39;t to say that this man is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">end of love but that he becomes a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">unto the form of love that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:36.400" style="s2">separate encounters</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:37.919" style="s2">are being gathered and cohered by and in</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.400" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">the undertaking of all of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.919" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">different activities</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:42.559" style="s2">and they&#39;re cohering together she comes</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:45.440" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.559" end="00:18:48.000" style="s2">this this more this this fuller</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.440" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">understanding of what such a thing means</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.000" end="00:18:51.600" style="s2">and so i think in some ways that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">i mean by the like it&#39;s the dispersal</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:18:56.720" style="s2">and then the retrieval of in order to</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">gather it into</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.720" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">into something by which to see so</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">so that&#39;s a process of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:06.559" style="s2">evolution and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:08.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a process by which we&#39;re evolving</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.559" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">right we&#39;re evolving</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.400" end="00:19:12.640" style="s2">our our you know our capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:13.039" style="s2">sensory motor interaction with the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:14.640" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.039" end="00:19:16.000" style="s2">you&#39;re sending out like you said you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.640" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">sending out all the variations your</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:18.880" style="s2">speech</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">you even use the language of speciating</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.880" end="00:19:21.280" style="s2">and then you put right and then you try</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:23.760" style="s2">to gather back</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">what is it that they all gather to and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.760" end="00:19:26.160" style="s2">belong to</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">and then of course that&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:30.000" style="s2">stop there presumably</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:31.600" style="s2">you know you&#39;re going to keep having</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.000" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">that kind of cycle</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.600" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s what i mean about i think how</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">art is there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s this it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">of an educated</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:45.520" style="s2">socially constructed evolution</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:47.280" style="s2">of our sensorium in a in in a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.520" end="00:19:49.679" style="s2">comprehensive manner</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.280" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">yeah i can relate to to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">saying um</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">kristoff in terms of my you know in my</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:57.760" style="s2">20s i wrote a lot of songs</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">and i i think the songs that i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.760" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">that had some quality</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">to them probably were written without me</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:05.280" style="s2">being able to like they took me over on</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:07.520" style="s2">some level</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.280" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">they were not propositional in any way</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.520" end="00:20:10.640" style="s2">they were like something i discovered</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:12.159" style="s2">it&#39;s like wow what&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.640" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">um and i didn&#39;t know what i was doing at</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.159" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">all and that would</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.159" end="00:20:17.919" style="s2">the more i didn&#39;t know what i was doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">the more i was in in</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">an area that was alive which sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">a kind of romanticism so</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:24.559" style="s2">i was throwing all these things out</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:27.360" style="s2">there and they would</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.559" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">form something that was and when i</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.360" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2">became much more</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">conscious of what i was doing was harder</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.400" end="00:20:35.679" style="s2">to do it was much harder to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">to actually construct something like</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.679" end="00:20:38.640" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to construct a work of art i</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:41.200" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">it seems to be reliant somehow on on</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.200" end="00:20:45.919" style="s2">inspiration on something</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.640" end="00:20:49.039" style="s2">beyond does that make any sense um</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.919" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">yeah i think it relies on the i mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.039" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">speaking as a cognitive scientist i</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:54.320" style="s2">think what we have this term that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.880" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">very helpful creativity</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.320" end="00:20:57.440" style="s2">and i think creativity is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.440" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">uh you know cognitive processes of</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.600" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">insight</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">uh meta metaframing processes where</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">we&#39;re switching between italic mode and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:06.799" style="s2">the peritonic mode</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2">there&#39;s all these processes at many</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.799" end="00:21:11.480" style="s2">levels of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.400" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">analysis at which we engage in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.480" end="00:21:15.280" style="s2">restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:17.520" style="s2">of what we find salient and relevant not</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.280" end="00:21:19.120" style="s2">by doing something you can&#39;t do it you</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.520" end="00:21:22.159" style="s2">can&#39;t do an insight</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.120" end="00:21:23.840" style="s2">right but what we do is we do things</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.159" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">that trigger the process to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.840" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">self-organize</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:28.159" style="s2">and then we bear witness to that</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.159" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">to use roots and uh very pregnant phrase</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.720" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what i think actually happens the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:37.679" style="s2">most of the work actually is is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">actually the artistic expression it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.679" end="00:21:42.400" style="s2">just training it&#39;s just training</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.520" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s just opening yourself up for</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.400" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">muse or spirit to arrive at your</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:49.919" style="s2">doorstep and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:50.559" style="s2">on some level but that&#39;s exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.919" end="00:21:51.919" style="s2">you have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.559" end="00:21:54.080" style="s2">you have to write a lot of bullshit out</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.919" end="00:21:55.679" style="s2">of your system before i mean i know this</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.080" end="00:21:57.679" style="s2">for writing poetry for</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.679" end="00:21:59.039" style="s2">for decades you have to write a lot out</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.679" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s what i mean about</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">we we we tend to focus too much on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">product of art</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:06.000" style="s2">and what i&#39;m trying to do right now in</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.559" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">this in what we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.000" end="00:22:09.120" style="s2">and this is how i think it&#39;s connected</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:11.520" style="s2">to the dialectic is focus</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.120" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">get us to focus on the process of art</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.520" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">what what</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">what has to happen right in people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">development</p>

<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:22.480" style="s2">they need to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:23.760" style="s2">such that the things that we call art</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.480" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">are produced by them</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:28.159" style="s2">rather than fixating on the product and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:28.720" style="s2">trying to determine what art is from</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.159" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.720" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m suggesting that&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">think that&#39;s absolutely right i think it</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.400" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">also serves to explain why you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:37.520" style="s2">a lot of artists will tell you at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:38.799" style="s2">the prodigious ones will tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.520" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">they dis-identify</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.799" end="00:22:42.159" style="s2">from the products from whatever whatever</p>

<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">whatever is left behind in that arena</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.559" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">once the agency</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">is evolved and practiced and practices</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">its way out of that arena whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:06.640" style="s2">left over in the arena is in a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">incidental it&#39;s incidental at least</p>

<p begin="00:23:13.600" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">and also also it can trap the artist</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.480" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:20.960" style="s2">he can he can create a product and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:23.039" style="s2">that can define him</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:24.080" style="s2">yeah exactly and then and then he slips</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.039" end="00:23:26.000" style="s2">into the hopping mode</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.080" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t get stuck in the having mode</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.000" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">and he doesn&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t keep learning because he</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">becomes uh he becomes</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">his the image of himself as an artist</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">and his product becomes crystallized</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">so he can&#39;t transform in the way it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:42.559" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:45.440" style="s2">um to continue to create a living art</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.559" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">you know yes yes which often i what i</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:48.159" style="s2">find is and that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.720" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">what i thought when john was speaking</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.159" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">was the problem is is almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:54.799" style="s2">youth in a sense in terms of how we see</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">art you know in popular culture is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.799" end="00:23:57.840" style="s2">people get famous or and they create art</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">very young and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.840" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a full life as an artist</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">because they become defined</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">in in some kind of a way and that um</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">maturing process has to has to occur</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">for an artist to be a generative</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.080" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">personality instead of a destructive</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.240" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">one i think that&#39;s very well said very</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.039" end="00:24:19.200" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:21.919" style="s2">so my concern is</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.200" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">that there should be some there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">transfer relationship</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:27.200" style="s2">between this training and discernment so</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.200" end="00:24:31.520" style="s2">reliably discriminate between bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.159" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">and wonder</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.520" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">that that that should that that should</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">find a place within</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:38.720" style="s2">dialectic as a practice and via logos as</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">a process</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.720" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">that&#39;s what i mean about their that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:44.799" style="s2">how i think art</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.559" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">right and the fact that dialogos is</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.799" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">committed to emergence</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:50.880" style="s2">it&#39;s committed to taking us to like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">horizon of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.880" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">that it&#39;s committed to getting us to see</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:56.799" style="s2">things in their non-categorical identity</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.360" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">again we&#39;re trying to do it right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.799" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to reinvent the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:01.840" style="s2">art we&#39;re trying to step outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:03.360" style="s2">categories i see all of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.840" end="00:25:05.279" style="s2">as finding a proper home within</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.360" end="00:25:07.679" style="s2">dialectic so i do think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.279" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">deep connections between the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.679" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">art and the practice of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.320" end="00:25:15.120" style="s2">yeah i also know people have kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">limited idea of what art is</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.120" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s limited to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">performance or the plastic arts or</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">music or or whatever but fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:26.559" style="s2">your whole life should be an art on some</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:28.880" style="s2">level i mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.559" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a grandiose statement but</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.880" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:33.120" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">well i think that&#39;s making sense here i</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.120" end="00:25:37.919" style="s2">know we have to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:39.919" style="s2">it&#39;s an artistic process and and what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.919" end="00:25:41.440" style="s2">you know what is painting and music and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.919" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">that kind of thing but</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.440" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">i i i want i want there to be a larger</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:50.640" style="s2">definition of of the project of heart</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">some narrow sort of uh activity of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.640" end="00:25:54.240" style="s2">you know playing guitar and writing a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.919" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">song or painting a painting or</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.240" end="00:25:57.279" style="s2">but but that that was nietzsche&#39;s hope</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:25:59.679" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.279" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">but the problem is the way that the term</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.679" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">he used the term he</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:04.799" style="s2">originated has degenerated and it no</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:06.240" style="s2">longer has that reference</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.799" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">nietzsche came up with the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.240" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">lifestyle and the whole point about a</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">lifestyle was exactly what you were</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">articulating thereafter</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">it was trying to bring the like the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">the education and and evolution</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.480" end="00:26:21.760" style="s2">in in the practice of art into one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:23.480" style="s2">life as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.760" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">because he was trying to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.480" end="00:26:26.159" style="s2">non-religious or maybe post-religious</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.159" end="00:26:29.600" style="s2">for the cultivation of virtue because he</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">saw the need for it and he came up with</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.600" end="00:26:31.840" style="s2">the idea of lifestyle but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:34.159" style="s2">with the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.840" end="00:26:35.679" style="s2">lifestyle right and if you read when he</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.159" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">talks about it he&#39;s got these amazing</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:38.240" style="s2">passages of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">you&#39;re trying like you&#39;re all of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.240" end="00:26:41.279" style="s2">impulses within you are</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:43.120" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying to shape them into</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.279" end="00:26:44.640" style="s2">something right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.120" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s not what it means anymore</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.640" end="00:26:50.720" style="s2">lifestyle has been generated into</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">you know a particular fashion uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.720" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">or branding of oneself uh that has</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">nothing to do with what nietzsche was</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:27:00.400" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:27:03.440" style="s2">but i think the idea of right having</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.400" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">um an aesthetic even this isn&#39;t gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.440" end="00:27:06.640" style="s2">deep enough but something like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:07.440" style="s2">profound aesthetic style to one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.640" end="00:27:10.080" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.440" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">as an ideal for one&#39;s life i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.080" end="00:27:12.159" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:14.000" style="s2">exactly what nietzsche was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.159" end="00:27:17.840" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:19.200" style="s2">yeah maybe the issue with nietzsche is</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.840" end="00:27:22.320" style="s2">that his idea was too</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.200" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">much based on the individual artist</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.320" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">yes rather than perhaps the collective</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:29.919" style="s2">experience of creating art in</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">in in a community or with other people</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.919" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">or which which i don&#39;t know you can be a</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">solo artist or you can be in a band</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">uh you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:41.360" style="s2">i think yeah i think his antipathy</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:44.320" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.360" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">socrates and plato are really blocked</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.320" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">him from seeing</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">um the sort of dialogic and distributed</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">aspects</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:52.000" style="s2">of art i think that&#39;s true and i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:54.559" style="s2">also i find</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.000" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">like he lost he lost the idea about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.559" end="00:27:58.799" style="s2">dynamic balance between the apollonian</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:27:59.919" style="s2">and the dionysian within the work of art</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.799" end="00:28:01.600" style="s2">like if you look right</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.919" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">the spirit you know the birth of tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.600" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">from the spirit of music it&#39;s clear that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">the two are supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:09.440" style="s2">um you know held in equal balance</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">because that he becomes increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.440" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">antagonistic towards the apollonian</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">right as he goes on and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.360" end="00:28:16.720" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:18.060" style="s2">um very detrimental to his his overall</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:20.480" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.060" end="00:28:22.559" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.480" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">right so we need to keep in mind then</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.559" end="00:28:26.000" style="s2">the choral elements</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">as we talked about i think in our last</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.000" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">conversation the three of us right we</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">talked about the core</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:32.080" style="s2">the choral elements of dialectic and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:34.799" style="s2">dialogue says</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.080" end="00:28:35.440" style="s2">foundational to its place yeah uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.799" end="00:28:38.480" style="s2">related yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.440" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">coral as in relating to the chorus um</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">that are that are fundamental to its</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:45.440" style="s2">situation within meta dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">right that the the the choral presence</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.440" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">is what we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">the more of the meta dialogue that helps</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:52.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">to gather the relevance of whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.240" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">situated within a particular practice</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">yeah because i&#39;m sorry to interrupt but</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">but it&#39;s not an individual expression</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:04.240" style="s2">is it it goes decidedly not you know we</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">kind of consider art to be an individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.240" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">expression of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.720" end="00:29:10.559" style="s2">even if you&#39;re a solo artist i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">think it&#39;s an individual expression</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.559" end="00:29:14.640" style="s2">no it&#39;s i think that&#39;s kind of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of one of the lies of how we</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.640" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">consider art to be it&#39;s about expressing</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">but i think yes you&#39;re right if you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:23.120" style="s2">the coral the coral is always working</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:25.600" style="s2">with you</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.120" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">and and you&#39;re you&#39;re synthesizing all</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.600" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">of these voices</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">in into some unique expression that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:33.840" style="s2">that&#39;s beyond you</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">well i think it&#39;s more i i i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.840" end="00:29:37.679" style="s2">actually arguing</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.039" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">against the romantic proposal that art</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.679" end="00:29:41.120" style="s2">is fundamentally self-expression i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.720" end="00:29:44.159" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.120" end="00:29:45.279" style="s2">arguing that art is fundamentally a form</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.159" end="00:29:48.000" style="s2">of self-cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.279" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">and self-transformation um and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.000" end="00:29:53.120" style="s2">you&#39;re not trying to express</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to make a new way of being</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.120" end="00:29:58.159" style="s2">possible for yourself and for others</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">a work of art like chris said he said</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.159" end="00:30:02.159" style="s2">this a few minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:03.919" style="s2">it should open it should give you a</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.159" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">serious play and practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">of opening up another world that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:13.120" style="s2">a great work of art does for you</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">like ultimately like ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.120" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">if if you are not already pre-committed</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">to an unjustified individualism why is</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:22.080" style="s2">self-expression</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">such a valorized thing who cares</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.080" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">i mean really i&#39;m saying i&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">to be i&#39;m not trying to be like</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">cruel i mean but who cares like like</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">what is that for</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">well i mean i would search for something</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:35.600" style="s2">universal in a song not something about</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.600" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">if i was trying to write a song yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">would have to be it would be something</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">that would</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">would would ground me in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:44.720" style="s2">community and and make me confront</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:47.440" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.720" end="00:30:50.720" style="s2">now that rather than rather than give me</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.440" end="00:30:52.320" style="s2">a strong definition of who i am</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.720" end="00:30:54.399" style="s2">yeah you don&#39;t want to be planting a</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.320" end="00:30:55.279" style="s2">flag on yourself that&#39;s not what art</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.399" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.279" end="00:30:59.399" style="s2">right i mean well our art art works with</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:00.720" style="s2">the material of the self it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.399" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">self-cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">but i mean it&#39;s ultimately right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:08.320" style="s2">the meaning all the meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:10.640" style="s2">literature shows that what</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.320" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">really gives us meaning in life is to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.640" end="00:31:13.760" style="s2">is to matter</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:16.559" style="s2">to be connected to something beyond</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.760" end="00:31:19.039" style="s2">ourself that has a value independent of</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.559" end="00:31:22.399" style="s2">our egocentric concerns</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.039" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">self-expression by definition fails that</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.399" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">project so it fails to contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m getting so passionately</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">critical of it whereas if i&#39;m engaging</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.200" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">in self-cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">that transforms me such that i become a</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">vehicle for a world opening up to other</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:38.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">that is mattering that is making a</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.240" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">difference beyond myself</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">and that is meaningful i was</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:46.640" style="s2">i was listening to your video with</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:50.960" style="s2">jonathan pagio um</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.640" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">today and oh yes he&#39;s a very fine artist</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.960" end="00:31:54.640" style="s2">yes but he and he&#39;s also also in a way</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:57.279" style="s2">he&#39;s a traditionalist</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.640" end="00:31:58.399" style="s2">right because he wants to create icons</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.279" end="00:32:00.159" style="s2">and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.399" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">at the time when icons were being</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.159" end="00:32:02.720" style="s2">created you were looking through the eye</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:05.120" style="s2">of god</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.720" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">right probably like that that and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.120" end="00:32:08.559" style="s2">suddenly humanism came along in what</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">13th 14th century</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.559" end="00:32:12.720" style="s2">and you&#39;re supposed to look through the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">eye of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.720" end="00:32:16.240" style="s2">okay and then i don&#39;t know maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">could you know more about the history of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.240" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">ideas than me john but then i guess we</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:21.360" style="s2">have einstein and relativity</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:22.720" style="s2">and then we have when you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.360" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">post-modernism and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.720" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">the self starts to dissolve and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:28.159" style="s2">there is no such thing as a self anymore</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:30.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.159" end="00:32:32.000" style="s2">um so i was thinking about the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.640" end="00:32:34.799" style="s2">what jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.000" end="00:32:37.039" style="s2">does and and i was also thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.799" end="00:32:37.679" style="s2">about my desire for post-traditional art</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.039" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.679" end="00:32:42.159" style="s2">and what would that look like because</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">i&#39;m not just satisfied with with</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.159" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">iconography and i do think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">modern about what he&#39;s doing at the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:51.279" style="s2">time i i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.760" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">accuse him of being uh being um you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.279" end="00:32:55.039" style="s2">but you know but but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:56.880" style="s2">you know i think iconography is is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.039" end="00:32:58.720" style="s2">beautiful form of expression but</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.880" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">but but there is something to modern art</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">is there not that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">is perhaps close i don&#39;t know to zuchin</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:06.399" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">something like that&#39;s not narrative or</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.399" end="00:33:09.039" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m throwing out a lot of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:13.840" style="s2">here excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">am i am i can you pick up on any of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.840" end="00:33:17.760" style="s2">yeah i did i picked up uh i picked up on</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.240" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">a few things and then i&#39;ll turn things</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.760" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">over to chris</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">i think the one of the great importances</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">important things about modern art</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">whatever that is supposed to point to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">is precisely the fact that it reminds</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">us of the possibility of non-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:36.399" style="s2">wonder</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:37.760" style="s2">of non-narrative uh self-cultivation it</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.399" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">liberates us</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.760" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">i i don&#39;t think it should be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">excluding narrative because as chris</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">rightly says</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:48.399" style="s2">narrative is a important feature of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">many genres of art but modern art uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.399" end="00:33:52.080" style="s2">tried to liberate us from that to some</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">degree because</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.080" end="00:33:55.279" style="s2">i think it would and i i you see this in</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:33:57.840" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.279" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">uh oh what&#39;s the name of the guy who oh</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.840" end="00:34:03.039" style="s2">he was synesthetic start with a k</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:05.840" style="s2">he wrote the spiritual name yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.039" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2">yeah yes right and he talked you can see</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.840" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">clearly and he&#39;s one of the fathers of</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">modern art right</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:15.119" style="s2">he he&#39;s he he sees the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">as a way of freeing us from narrative as</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">a way of freeing us from egocentrism</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">as a way of get bringing back the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">in art</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.040" end="00:34:24.399" style="s2">so i i think that that is an important</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:26.639" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.399" end="00:34:28.639" style="s2">in it um now i don&#39;t think that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.639" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">problem for jonathan because as you said</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.639" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">jonathan sees these as icons he sees</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">them as</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:36.960" style="s2">you know windows but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">remember remember eckhart you did</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:40.320" style="s2">the i by which you see god is the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.960" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">eye by which he sees you</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.320" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not right right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">a transjective bi-directional thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:48.399" style="s2">jonathan sees that but for people caught</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:52.480" style="s2">humanism they don&#39;t have that there</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">isn&#39;t that translucency</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:55.599" style="s2">right and so i think what modern art was</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:57.680" style="s2">trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.599" end="00:34:58.960" style="s2">when it when it went post-humanist and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.680" end="00:35:01.760" style="s2">went abstract</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.960" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">right at least initially kadinsky you</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.760" end="00:35:05.119" style="s2">can see this</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">is it&#39;s trying to open us back up to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.119" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">transit going</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">by liberating us from the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:12.320" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:13.839" style="s2">ego and narrative are very bound</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.320" end="00:35:15.599" style="s2">together very inter-defining</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.839" end="00:35:17.359" style="s2">so i think your allusion to it being</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.599" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">something like a buddhist having a</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:21.440" style="s2">component to it i think that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:22.960" style="s2">placed i think that&#39;s well said</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.440" end="00:35:25.200" style="s2">yeah there seems to be a tension between</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.960" end="00:35:27.599" style="s2">the narrative and the post narrative</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.200" end="00:35:29.839" style="s2">story and maybe they&#39;re both necessary</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">um well i like the discussion between</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.839" end="00:35:33.839" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:34.240" style="s2">uh non-duality and and person that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.839" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">should there be a person personal god</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:38.720" style="s2">versus sort of the impersonal versus the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:40.880" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.720" end="00:35:43.200" style="s2">those two have to be i think those two</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.880" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">we have to transcend the non-duality and</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">also transcend the personal but they</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">both have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:50.400" style="s2">come together yeah i think i think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">is properly the project of non-theism</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.400" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">uh but yeah i i think that&#39;s right i i</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:58.079" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.960" end="00:36:00.079" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s there&#39;s areas of art that</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.079" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">maybe we don&#39;t there&#39;s areas of art that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.079" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">maintain a closer connection</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">to the sacred precisely because they</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">have this structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.599" end="00:36:09.680" style="s2">you just said you know there&#39;s where you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">have a narrative structure that</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.680" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">undermines</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">its narrative and undermines any it</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:18.400" style="s2">destabilizes you trying to take up</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">any self-satisfied ego role within them</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.400" end="00:36:20.720" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what the parables of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:22.240" style="s2">jesus are</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.720" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">the parables of jesus are these</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.240" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">narratives like when you read</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">parable of the product of the sun you</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">think there&#39;s this story but when you</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:32.640" style="s2">try to put yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">any of the roles you fund you fall under</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">god&#39;s judgment</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:38.560" style="s2">right they don&#39;t work and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">and sally mcfag does all this great work</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.560" end="00:36:43.280" style="s2">on and the soupies have similar things</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">where the parables are narratives that</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.280" end="00:36:45.839" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:47.040" style="s2">deconstruct themselves as narratives</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.839" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">because they&#39;re designed to</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.040" end="00:36:54.640" style="s2">explode you beyond an egocentric uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:56.240" style="s2">way of being and i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.640" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s what i meant what i</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">was trying to say earlier about</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:02.079" style="s2">you know there&#39;s almost and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">how this could go together with what</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.079" end="00:37:05.359" style="s2">chris is saying you can see how a</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">parable right</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.359" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">gets you to telescope out the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">intelligibility in the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">but then it collapses the narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2">you get the re-gathering</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:16.640" style="s2">and you have to transcend to something</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">in that regathering so it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.640" end="00:37:19.200" style="s2">gathering back</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a gathering that then pushes you</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.200" end="00:37:22.800" style="s2">beyond this the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">the space that was originally drawn by</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.800" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">the narrative and i think in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:29.040" style="s2">we should we should we should talk more</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">often in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.040" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">about appropriate connections between</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">art and parable</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:36.720" style="s2">that and and i think that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:40.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">uh that needs to be explored more and</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.160" end="00:37:44.480" style="s2">more right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">because we&#39;ve gotten too much into</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.480" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">again like you said art as a product</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:51.040" style="s2">that is some</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">kind for art&#39;s sake yeah which i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.040" end="00:37:55.680" style="s2">i ultimately don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:57.040" style="s2">agree with uh exactly we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.680" end="00:37:59.520" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t be creating wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.040" end="00:38:01.839" style="s2">trophies uh of self-expression</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.520" end="00:38:03.839" style="s2">we should be we should be creating</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.839" end="00:38:06.560" style="s2">parables that constantly propel us</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.839" end="00:38:06.560" style="s2">beyond ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">yeah well that it seems to be that for</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.880" end="00:38:15.920" style="s2">all of the reasons that art</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">those instances where we those instances</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.920" end="00:38:21.119" style="s2">where we believe of art of any given</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:22.560" style="s2">instance of it that it is genuine art</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.119" end="00:38:25.359" style="s2">right because there&#39;s a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:28.480" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of a normative distinction</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:30.079" style="s2">i think uh uh a kind of ineffable</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.480" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">normative distinction that people make</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.079" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">when they say some this is real art they</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">we don&#39;t typically we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">what we mean by that when we say it but</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">you hear people saying it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">ah you see</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:40.720" style="s2">that story or that novel or that show or</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:42.800" style="s2">that whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.720" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">that&#39;s real art as opposed to this other</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.800" end="00:38:46.800" style="s2">pulpy stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.320" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">and i think like what what that is what</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.800" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">that means</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">um well uh yeah i think that part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">what that means</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:58.079" style="s2">which i think is is is which</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">refers back to everything that the two</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.079" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">of you have just said in the last three</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">is that when when</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">when the purported subject of art</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.839" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">happens to be at the top and the time</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">seems to become conscious that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">lives in reference to some necessity</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:26.000" style="s2">snares guided by that that it is not of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">itself or for itself but that</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.000" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">it exists only in so far it is it exists</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">as a gesture</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:35.359" style="s2">a beyond word gesture away from itself</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2">i think under those circumstances we say</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.359" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">of something that it is true or genuine</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:41.599" style="s2">art</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:42.480" style="s2">and so i that when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.599" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">about the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.480" end="00:39:45.920" style="s2">self-expression i thought that was kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">of interesting and you spoke of it both</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.920" end="00:39:48.720" style="s2">of you spoke</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:50.079" style="s2">the idea of self-expression pejoratively</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.720" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">but i think and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.079" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">fairly so but if we were to</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">to capitalize the s at the end of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:40:00.079" style="s2">self i think we would find</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:01.680" style="s2">that that expression took on something</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.079" end="00:40:03.920" style="s2">of a different meaning</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.680" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">because it would recollect divine double</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.920" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">then right</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:08.560" style="s2">exactly it would be an expression of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">divine double if what art is is</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.560" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">self-expression and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">also simultaneously self-impression that</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:16.640" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">mimetic it is my medic of the inarable</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.640" end="00:40:18.720" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:20.800" style="s2">mimetic of something that has not been</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.720" end="00:40:23.599" style="s2">fully retrieved right</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.800" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s we are it and that and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.599" end="00:40:26.000" style="s2">brings</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">that brings into the question of art</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.000" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">this idea of ontological conformity</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">that if what it is doing is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">get itself into conformity of that which</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:35.599" style="s2">is not</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">imminently retrievable then it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.599" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">way of</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">rendering an impression of a self yet</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:41.920" style="s2">undiscovered</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:44.079" style="s2">that capital self that divine double</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.920" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">cell for the sacred second self</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.079" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">right and so every time you produce</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:53.599" style="s2">there is a kind of there is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">attempted imitation at</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.599" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">the self that is out of reach to bring</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">it into presence</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:41:01.839" style="s2">and it&#39;s not that you would have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:03.839" style="s2">express that self perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.839" end="00:41:05.839" style="s2">it would it would be that you would have</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.839" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">to gesture towards it i would say i</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.839" end="00:41:08.079" style="s2">would say that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:10.240" style="s2">and that is you&#39;re not going to express</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.079" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">it the word a work of art is a gesture</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.240" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not a complete um uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:17.520" style="s2">telling of what that is that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:19.280" style="s2">which is why it has to be translucent</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.520" end="00:41:21.200" style="s2">right it has to be porous it has to its</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.280" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">boundaries have to be permeable because</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.839" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">it&#39;s an it&#39;s approximation it&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:26.480" style="s2">ever approximation it&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.280" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">approximation right</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.480" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">that&#39;s why a true i&#39;m sorry i keep</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:31.040" style="s2">coming back to narrative not not because</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">it&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.040" end="00:41:34.880" style="s2">the case but just because it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:36.800" style="s2">easily retrievable example for me</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">but one of the things that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.800" end="00:41:40.079" style="s2">things that we find in a truly truly</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.560" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">truly good story</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.079" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">is that its specificity seems to provide</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:47.119" style="s2">the current</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">for a universality and those things seem</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.119" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">to be and there seems to be an entity</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:52.240" style="s2">there they seems to be in contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.960" end="00:41:55.440" style="s2">but of course they&#39;re not right because</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.240" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">the more such the such of the story is</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.440" end="00:41:59.599" style="s2">the more it seems to presence the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">possibility of being more</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.599" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">the more it&#39;s the more it&#39;s mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:05.200" style="s2">finessing</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:08.800" style="s2">seems to gather its arms around</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">something of of appreciating realism</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.800" end="00:42:12.319" style="s2">that&#39;s why magical realism as a form of</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:14.640" style="s2">narrative is often so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.319" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">because magical realism as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">sub-genre of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">seems to actually make a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:23.839" style="s2">conscious of this very dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s when it gets that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.839" end="00:42:27.440" style="s2">when it gets parabolic chris</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">exactly yeah that&#39;s i&#39;m saying this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.440" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">all very this is all convergent with</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:34.079" style="s2">that observation</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:38.000" style="s2">yeah parabolic is is is that different</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.079" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">than let&#39;s say uh symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.000" end="00:42:41.839" style="s2">um yeah i think what&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">because because</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.839" end="00:42:45.520" style="s2">you would say that we need parabolic art</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.920" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">and i would say i find</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">symbolism and art very powerful and i</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">think jonathan pagio was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">showing us that um and that we&#39;ve sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">of lost our</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">um symbolic literal uh literacy like</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">symbolically illiterate a bit and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">people used to express themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:06.960" style="s2">these powerful symbols</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.599" end="00:43:08.880" style="s2">and now now people are are often</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.960" end="00:43:11.119" style="s2">creating something that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.880" end="00:43:13.680" style="s2">poor kind of realism right it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.119" end="00:43:15.760" style="s2">documentary style it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.680" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">it&#39;s just uh it&#39;s like werner herzog</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.760" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">says it&#39;s like reading the phone book</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:20.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:23.440" style="s2">you try to create realism but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.960" end="00:43:25.920" style="s2">have that magic to it because</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.440" end="00:43:26.560" style="s2">because realism in a sense is is is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.920" end="00:43:30.160" style="s2">bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.560" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">that it&#39;s real realism um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.160" end="00:43:34.000" style="s2">i think that&#39;s right um i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:35.599" style="s2">these i don&#39;t think those two claims are</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.000" end="00:43:36.960" style="s2">in competition with each other</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.599" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">i think they&#39;re they they should be</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.960" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">unfolded together i think i agree with</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:42.319" style="s2">you and i agree with jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">that really you know and i know chris</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.319" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">does too you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">recovering our symbolic sensibilities in</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.240" end="00:43:49.599" style="s2">a proper way</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:51.839" style="s2">a wise way a way that affords</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.599" end="00:43:53.359" style="s2">discernment is exactly one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.839" end="00:43:55.040" style="s2">that art should be doing especially</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.359" end="00:43:58.480" style="s2">right now uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.040" end="00:44:00.319" style="s2">but but i think if we oh well let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">what jonathan makes</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.319" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">the icon right the point about the point</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">about the icon is it&#39;s ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:07.680" style="s2">parabolic</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">right if you get locked into the icon</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.680" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">then you you turn it into an idol that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">what john mcmarian talks about right</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:16.319" style="s2">in the god beyond being right you right</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">it always has to have this parabolic</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.319" end="00:44:19.599" style="s2">structure to it because</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:21.280" style="s2">it has to meet you where you are but</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.599" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">then it has to explode</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.280" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">so that you are propelled beyond</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.839" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">infinite expression and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">as as as christoph says porous right</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:31.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what immediate</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:32.720" style="s2">and translucent rather than a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.280" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">closed system</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.720" end="00:44:36.160" style="s2">exactly the thing it has to do is it has</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">to like</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.160" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">chris is right though right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:42.240" style="s2">not an amorphous infinite</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s not the indeterminate</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">it&#39;s the infinite that has been poured</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.000" end="00:44:48.560" style="s2">into the finite so that it glows</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">with something beyond the finite but is</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.560" end="00:44:52.560" style="s2">never anything other than</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:54.000" style="s2">finite for you right that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:54.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s what i&#39;m trying to get</p>

<p begin="00:44:54.720" end="00:44:58.400" style="s2">and and and the notion that chris was</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">mentioning about</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.400" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">uh the self-expression with the castle</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:04.240" style="s2">capital s as he was saying that i was</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">thinking of one of his favorite</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.240" end="00:45:07.760" style="s2">authors somebody who actually transcends</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">the boundary between</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.760" end="00:45:10.800" style="s2">uh philosophy and art which maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">undermines what i said a few minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.800" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">but i&#39;m thinking of kirkegaard and</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:16.000" style="s2">thinking about how kirkegaard writes</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">these parabolic narratives</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.000" end="00:45:19.599" style="s2">that are designed right to do exactly</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:21.839" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking they&#39;re designed to</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.599" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">sort of suck you into a particular role</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">and then explode that role so that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">come to realize</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.920" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">that you have within you something that</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">is the potential for any and every role</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:34.160" style="s2">and that that&#39;s something your soul has</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">a relationship to something much more</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.160" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:38.720" style="s2">than any one of these roles or ways of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">life and again i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.720" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">one of the pre if that&#39;s what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:45.040" style="s2">by self-expression chris</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.040" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what i can i can agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.040" end="00:45:51.839" style="s2">yeah yeah no that&#39;s beautifully said</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:51.839" style="s2">that&#39;s precisely it precisely it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:56.240" style="s2">i just don&#39;t like i just don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.680" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">phrase because of its sort of standard</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.240" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">right yeah of course of course and and i</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be inclined to use it either</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">but if we were to if we were to</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">try and recall something of an original</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:09.520" style="s2">within the commonplace expression it</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">would require that minor</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.520" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">augmentation i think that was my only</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">point in saying that um</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:16.640" style="s2">just as a way of of playing with it i</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:18.480" style="s2">mean part of our practice of reinventio</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">here is to take what is common</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.480" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">and play with its communists as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.560" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">recollecting its original meaning</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:26.079" style="s2">um and and this is i think that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">just part of the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.079" end="00:46:30.160" style="s2">um practice well i don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:31.200" style="s2">happenstance that you mentioned those</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.160" end="00:46:32.079" style="s2">two because i think there&#39;s deep</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.200" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.079" end="00:46:35.440" style="s2">between how we&#39;re talking about art and</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">the practice of inventio</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.440" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">where we&#39;re trying to get between we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:40.160" style="s2">trying to get between inventing</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.040" end="00:46:42.560" style="s2">and discovering that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.160" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">talking about here may i raise a</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.560" end="00:46:45.119" style="s2">question for</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">all of us because i think it was also</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.119" end="00:46:48.800" style="s2">implicit in what andrew was asking</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">and we&#39;ve lost the thread and i want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.800" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">make sure we go back to it which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">does art have to be beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.359" end="00:47:01.520" style="s2">right so i&#39;ve argued that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.440" end="00:47:04.640" style="s2">concentrating more on the process</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.520" end="00:47:05.280" style="s2">rather than the product but does the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:08.319" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.280" end="00:47:09.359" style="s2">always have to be in service of being</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.319" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">drawn by</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.359" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">induced by beauty or are there other</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:19.440" style="s2">that properly afford and draw art</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.440" end="00:47:26.079" style="s2">i i would stage on that beauty the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:28.640" style="s2">practice of art is not suffused</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.079" end="00:47:29.520" style="s2">constantly with beauty but it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.640" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">constantly</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.520" end="00:47:35.280" style="s2">guided by its search right</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:36.839" style="s2">that like i i&#39;m just thinking on a on a</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.280" end="00:47:40.319" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.839" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">i thinking on a very hands-on</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.319" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">just trying to the process of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:47.200" style="s2">produce something whatever it may be</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">right whether trying to produce a paper</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.200" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">or trying to produce a song</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">which i have no experience with andrew</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.960" end="00:47:56.800" style="s2">but you&#39;ll be able to just be</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.200" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">stupid you know it&#39;s it&#39;s mostly um</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.800" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">i think you&#39;re i think you&#39;re i it it</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.079" end="00:48:03.599" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">yeah i believe it i believe it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.599" end="00:48:08.000" style="s2">most irritating thing in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.599" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s kind of laborious right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.000" end="00:48:11.599" style="s2">glorious and irritating</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2">because and it&#39;s melodies get in your</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.599" end="00:48:15.280" style="s2">head and you hate them</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:16.960" style="s2">and you somehow have to go to the end on</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.280" end="00:48:18.880" style="s2">some level and get the thing out</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.960" end="00:48:20.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like as i said the midwife it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.880" end="00:48:23.839" style="s2">like you have the birth</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.160" end="00:48:25.359" style="s2">yeah right right the eras right because</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.839" end="00:48:28.480" style="s2">the era the eras right the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.359" end="00:48:30.160" style="s2">the in the the the instinct of eros is</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.480" end="00:48:31.280" style="s2">guided by beauty but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.160" end="00:48:34.720" style="s2">that every</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.280" end="00:48:37.599" style="s2">that that the um that that eros is</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.720" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">is always disposed to be beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.599" end="00:48:40.640" style="s2">though it seeks beauty</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">and i think perhaps that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.640" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">difference is that the the air the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:47.599" style="s2">erosive art is is guided</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">attentionally in the pursuit of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.599" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:52.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s incidence is not always</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.559" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">just as i would say that my answer to</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">john&#39;s question is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.720" end="00:49:03.280" style="s2">um yes art always has to be beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">but our definition of what beauty is is</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.280" end="00:49:06.640" style="s2">probably problematic</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:08.319" style="s2">usually because we think of beauty in in</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:10.640" style="s2">in a very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.319" end="00:49:11.440" style="s2">sentence yeah yeah and that beauty</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.640" end="00:49:14.960" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.440" end="00:49:17.200" style="s2">can can be found in the most</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.960" end="00:49:19.119" style="s2">banal it can be found in something</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.200" end="00:49:20.559" style="s2">grandiose it can be found in the baroque</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.119" end="00:49:22.480" style="s2">it can be found in</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.559" end="00:49:23.839" style="s2">it can be found anywhere and in any</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:25.680" style="s2">circumstance and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.839" end="00:49:27.920" style="s2">and so it doesn&#39;t have to it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.680" end="00:49:31.760" style="s2">have to conform to let&#39;s say a platonic</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.920" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">ideal of what beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.760" end="00:49:38.079" style="s2">or symmetry or any of that but</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:39.520" style="s2">but i i&#39;m not sure if i i&#39;ve answered</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.079" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">the question myself but i think the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.520" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">answer is yes that art has to be related</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.440" end="00:49:44.480" style="s2">to beauty</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:46.559" style="s2">but we also have to broaden the notion</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.480" end="00:49:49.520" style="s2">of what what beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.559" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">to not be something um cliche and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.520" end="00:49:52.400" style="s2">you know very well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:54.000" style="s2">let&#39;s play with this because i want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.400" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">by the way i just want to make no</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.000" end="00:49:57.040" style="s2">tell you in the middle of art you were</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:49:59.119" style="s2">invoking midwifery</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.040" end="00:50:00.480" style="s2">which of course is also the project of</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.119" end="00:50:04.400" style="s2">socratic dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.480" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">yeah but socrates dialogue with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.400" end="00:50:08.559" style="s2">you know yeah don&#39;t you call that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:10.559" style="s2">vertical dialectic or something like</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.559" end="00:50:12.079" style="s2">that you&#39;re dialoguing with with higher</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.559" end="00:50:14.880" style="s2">powers or</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.079" end="00:50:16.160" style="s2">um but but let&#39;s play with this what you</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.880" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">guys have both said</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.160" end="00:50:19.280" style="s2">so what came to my mind when i asked</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.400" end="00:50:22.400" style="s2">this question</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.280" end="00:50:24.400" style="s2">was it was a painting that i&#39;ve often</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.400" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">found very powerful and i consider it a</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.400" end="00:50:27.200" style="s2">bonafide</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">great work of art many other people do</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.200" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">is picasso&#39;s guernica</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.119" end="00:50:35.280" style="s2">right guernica um which</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:37.119" style="s2">is it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard for me to when</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.280" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">i&#39;m standing in the presence of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.119" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">uh painting to say i&#39;m experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">anything like beauty</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:48.559" style="s2">i&#39;m experiencing shock horror</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:50.240" style="s2">i i&#39;m experiencing um even the</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.559" end="00:50:50.960" style="s2">perversion of the sacred you know how he</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:53.119" style="s2">has that big</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">yes the light at the top that&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.119" end="00:50:56.000" style="s2">the the electric light that&#39;s taking the</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">place of god</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.000" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">right in the painting uh and and and yet</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">all of this is because</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:03.200" style="s2">and this is where collingwood&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">comes in and that&#39;s why i&#39;m asking this</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.200" end="00:51:05.599" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:07.359" style="s2">because collingwood says that because he</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.599" end="00:51:09.839" style="s2">actually uses this example</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:11.520" style="s2">collingwood said the point of that is to</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">try and get us and i&#39;m going to use the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.520" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">language we&#39;ve been using</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:16.480" style="s2">is picasso doesn&#39;t want us to think of</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.079" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.480" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">battle of the bombing of guernica</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">categorically</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t want us to swat it in all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:26.720" style="s2">other bombings all the other tragedies</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">he wants us to directly experience the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.720" end="00:51:31.079" style="s2">ineffable</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:32.240" style="s2">horrible suchness of that moment the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.079" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">non-categorical</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.240" end="00:51:38.720" style="s2">ah of guernica that can&#39;t be captured</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:40.400" style="s2">categorically because only that horror</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.720" end="00:51:43.200" style="s2">is appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.400" end="00:51:43.760" style="s2">to the tragedy that was unfolding that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.200" end="00:51:47.119" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.760" end="00:51:50.319" style="s2">right relationship to the event yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.119" end="00:51:52.079" style="s2">you see you see what i&#39;m i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.319" end="00:51:52.800" style="s2">that i&#39;ve refuted you guys or anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.079" end="00:51:54.720" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.800" end="00:51:56.400" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to say that isn&#39;t it any</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.720" end="00:51:58.880" style="s2">beauty is the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.400" end="00:52:00.400" style="s2">uh like between you and the dating it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.880" end="00:52:03.040" style="s2">not the painting itself</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.400" end="00:52:04.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the relationship it affords</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.040" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what came to mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.480" end="00:52:08.480" style="s2">well okay so that&#39;s what i that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.160" end="00:52:09.680" style="s2">was wondering because it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.480" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">in the picking example what you said</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.680" end="00:52:13.760" style="s2">andrew i&#39;ve been trying to reorient this</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:16.559" style="s2">off the product of our to the process</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.760" end="00:52:17.359" style="s2">can we reorient from a product notion of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.559" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">beauty</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.359" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">to a process notion of beauty yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:25.440" style="s2">i think that&#39;s right because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:28.640" style="s2">we have to do in fact</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.440" end="00:52:30.400" style="s2">um so some of what some of what you seem</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.640" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">to be just describing john is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.400" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">one thing one experience you have when</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.880" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">you look at the picasso painting</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">is that yes so it it it</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">it accommodates an uncategorical</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:46.559" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2">of of such a</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.559" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">phenomenon but what it also does i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.400" end="00:52:55.040" style="s2">in in in the way that you you&#39;ve given</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember where this example</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.040" end="00:52:57.599" style="s2">comes from originally it might be yours</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:52:59.280" style="s2">john but when you talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.599" end="00:53:00.559" style="s2">suchness of the trees and the moreness</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.280" end="00:53:01.520" style="s2">of the trees that you encounter a</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.559" end="00:53:04.720" style="s2">beautiful tree</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.520" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">such that it is unique and incomparable</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.720" end="00:53:07.839" style="s2">and you also encounter in this beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:10.640" style="s2">the same tree</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.839" end="00:53:12.839" style="s2">the the the just the the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.640" end="00:53:15.359" style="s2">possibility of treeness and all of its</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.839" end="00:53:17.599" style="s2">beauty</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.359" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">and then i think so then one way then of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.599" end="00:53:20.400" style="s2">thinking about art and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">you&#39;ve just described it with this</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.400" end="00:53:23.359" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.359" end="00:53:26.720" style="s2">is and i think you just said this andrew</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.359" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">is an appreciation of the relation</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.720" end="00:53:30.960" style="s2">between those two uncategorical</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.839" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.960" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">of the the infinite more of the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:38.319" style="s2">of something</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:41.200" style="s2">and the and the such of its beauty</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.319" end="00:53:41.599" style="s2">and being able to relate those two and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:45.119" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.599" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">and two and to um</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.119" end="00:53:49.040" style="s2">to intimate and make more intimate their</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:52.240" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.040" end="00:53:54.160" style="s2">in the experience of a given work oh so</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.240" end="00:53:56.160" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me to be slightly poetic</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.160" end="00:53:59.440" style="s2">then what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.160" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2">that picasso&#39;s guernica uh actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:03.839" style="s2">presences</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.480" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">the soul of the battle yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.839" end="00:54:08.640" style="s2">and yeah was it&#39;s the courage of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">artist</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.640" end="00:54:13.040" style="s2">to to express that in its most naked</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:15.520" style="s2">form</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.040" end="00:54:17.760" style="s2">which also makes it beautiful yes i</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.520" end="00:54:20.319" style="s2">think i i think there is a connection to</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.760" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">i mean he&#39;s definitely trying to train</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.319" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">discernment</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:27.280" style="s2">in fact it&#39;s hard to justify um the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">the that that painting without it having</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.280" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">if it just sort of horrified me</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:34.800" style="s2">towards no end right but what he what</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:36.720" style="s2">he&#39;s i mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.800" end="00:54:38.079" style="s2">i mean his intent was ultimately even</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.720" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">political there right</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.079" end="00:54:42.480" style="s2">he was trying to wake people up he was</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:45.119" style="s2">trying to get them to discern</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:45.839" style="s2">uh what was actually going on in this</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.119" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">battle</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.839" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">uh in a profound way yeah so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:50.960" style="s2">highly shock</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">value which is that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.960" end="00:54:55.440" style="s2">problems with</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">with contemporary art right yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.440" end="00:54:57.920" style="s2">that&#39;s right and the shock</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:00.319" style="s2">and the shock does not have the</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.920" end="00:55:01.920" style="s2">conjugate doesn&#39;t have content to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.319" end="00:55:03.920" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t because it doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.920" end="00:55:04.480" style="s2">same kind of invocation because the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.920" end="00:55:07.280" style="s2">shock</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:08.960" style="s2">actually dissociates from its realism</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.280" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">rather than impressing it</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.960" end="00:55:12.319" style="s2">the shock actually doesn&#39;t conjure the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">soul of an experience</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.319" end="00:55:15.920" style="s2">what shock does is actually i find what</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:18.240" style="s2">shock does is actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.920" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">dissociate from the soul of an</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.240" end="00:55:22.559" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:25.680" style="s2">so this idea of this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.559" end="00:55:29.200" style="s2">art being a kind of being a way of</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.680" end="00:55:32.720" style="s2">presencing the logos um</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:34.000" style="s2">i think being a way of presencing and</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.720" end="00:55:37.040" style="s2">this this then goes back</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.000" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">to to the idea you brought up andrew of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.040" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">of of um of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:46.000" style="s2">the renewing this renewing</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">so what it does i think in some ways is</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.000" end="00:55:51.520" style="s2">it it it makes</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:55:52.480" style="s2">of a particular rendering a symbol that</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.520" end="00:55:55.090" style="s2">presences</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.480" end="00:55:57.920" style="s2">the soul of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.090" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.920" end="00:56:00.960" style="s2">so this then circles back to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:04.640" style="s2">argument i made</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.960" end="00:56:04.640" style="s2">that virtue is the beauty of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.160" end="00:56:11.920" style="s2">so there is a process so a relational</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.040" end="00:56:14.000" style="s2">transactive</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.920" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">process notion of beauty that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.000" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">appropriate then</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:18.559" style="s2">and then would ally with our attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.839" end="00:56:20.640" style="s2">redirect</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.559" end="00:56:22.559" style="s2">the discussion of art off the product</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.640" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">and onto the process again</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.559" end="00:56:29.200" style="s2">yeah off the it and and back to the vow</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:33.280" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s well right right</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:35.359" style="s2">beautiful beautiful so that the product</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.280" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">the product serves to invocate the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.359" end="00:56:41.200" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:43.920" style="s2">yeah so this and to and to reproduce it</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.200" end="00:56:44.480" style="s2">to midwife it again yeah product has to</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.920" end="00:56:47.280" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.480" end="00:56:47.839" style="s2">not be like a campbell soup can it has</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:50.400" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.839" end="00:56:51.680" style="s2">as it has to well it has to go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.400" end="00:56:53.920" style="s2">the campbell soup can</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.680" end="00:56:55.440" style="s2">right and keep reproducing itself it has</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.920" end="00:56:56.480" style="s2">to be generative that&#39;s the word i was</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.440" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">thinking of when i was asked to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.480" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">focused</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.119" end="00:57:02.880" style="s2">you know you watch some films and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.119" end="00:57:06.240" style="s2">you just feel you know when i watch</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.880" end="00:57:07.680" style="s2">these like expensive superhero movies</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:09.760" style="s2">that everybody avengers and</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.680" end="00:57:11.440" style="s2">people think are so great i just feel</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.760" end="00:57:13.440" style="s2">exhausted afterwards like i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.440" end="00:57:14.799" style="s2">i&#39;ve been depleted of energy</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.440" end="00:57:16.640" style="s2">but then there&#39;s other films you watch</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.799" end="00:57:18.400" style="s2">like i imagine werner herzog&#39;s film</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.640" end="00:57:19.520" style="s2">somehow they they have this texture and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.400" end="00:57:21.920" style="s2">depth to them and you</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.520" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">watch them and you feel like you&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.920" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve been nourished</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:26.400" style="s2">in some kind of a way right you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">been like you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.400" end="00:57:29.440" style="s2">you know that&#39;s what plato says right</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.799" end="00:57:31.599" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.440" end="00:57:33.040" style="s2">art can be a kind of rape you know it</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.599" end="00:57:35.599" style="s2">can be like not art but</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.040" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">cheap entertainment it can be kind of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.599" end="00:57:40.960" style="s2">rapes it rapes your soul</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.760" end="00:57:44.640" style="s2">but the real kind of art is just like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.960" end="00:57:46.799" style="s2">an opening of of as you say arrows</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:48.240" style="s2">it is and it&#39;s infinitely realizable for</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.799" end="00:57:49.280" style="s2">that very reason right the difference</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.240" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">between watching</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.280" end="00:57:53.200" style="s2">the good film and the bad film right or</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">the strong film the artful film and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.200" end="00:57:58.960" style="s2">unartful film is that the artful film</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:57:59.200" style="s2">the artful film is you can interrogate</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.960" end="00:58:02.079" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.200" end="00:58:04.960" style="s2">endlessly because when it when it when</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.079" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">it ext when it articulates itself out</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.960" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">the um it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:12.319" style="s2">there&#39;s something that is shining forth</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:16.079" style="s2">through the medium</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.319" end="00:58:19.599" style="s2">of the the work that is not of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.079" end="00:58:20.799" style="s2">of of the work itself and you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.599" end="00:58:23.920" style="s2">don&#39;t that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.799" end="00:58:26.319" style="s2">um that&#39;s not true of of every year</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.920" end="00:58:27.760" style="s2">again i think that depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.319" end="00:58:30.880" style="s2">integrity of the artists it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.760" end="00:58:34.079" style="s2">bit what you know john is saying about</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.880" end="00:58:36.880" style="s2">um you know all of these uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.079" end="00:58:38.160" style="s2">like um qualities like wisdom and virtue</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.880" end="00:58:41.599" style="s2">if the artist</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.160" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">is being motivated by that by by</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.599" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">those those qualities you know that</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:47.520" style="s2">integrity</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:49.359" style="s2">then that then that shines through if</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.520" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">he&#39;s being motivated by</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.359" end="00:58:54.000" style="s2">by some kind of um something else</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:55.760" style="s2">who knows what that other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.000" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.760" end="00:58:59.040" style="s2">trying to please uh the mob or something</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:02.640" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.040" end="00:59:06.319" style="s2">then then then it comes off as being uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.640" end="00:59:07.520" style="s2">you know empty so there&#39;s two things</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.319" end="00:59:08.799" style="s2">that came out of what you guys were just</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.520" end="00:59:09.520" style="s2">talking i kept interrupting and i</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.799" end="00:59:12.960" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t though</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.520" end="00:59:15.920" style="s2">because you guys kept unfolding more um</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.960" end="00:59:17.520" style="s2">what when andrew to gather back to</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.920" end="00:59:19.680" style="s2">previous discussions we had we talked</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.520" end="00:59:22.880" style="s2">about this how plato talks about</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.680" end="00:59:24.960" style="s2">you know the the beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.880" end="00:59:26.559" style="s2">like when we&#39;re talking about hans work</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.960" end="00:59:28.079" style="s2">that the responsive beauty should not</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.559" end="00:59:28.799" style="s2">ultimately be consumptive it should be</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.079" end="00:59:30.480" style="s2">generative</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.799" end="00:59:32.640" style="s2">the response to beauty is the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.480" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">generate more beauty and then you guys</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.640" end="00:59:38.240" style="s2">linked that i think very astutely to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:39.359" style="s2">to the notion uh you know of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.240" end="00:59:40.559" style="s2">inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.359" end="00:59:42.640" style="s2">an inexhaustible fountain of</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.559" end="00:59:44.319" style="s2">intelligibility and then what you did</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.640" end="00:59:46.880" style="s2">to my mind and tell me if you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.319" end="00:59:47.440" style="s2">this but you wear beauty and art and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.880" end="00:59:49.680" style="s2">sacred</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.440" end="00:59:50.880" style="s2">as all intertwined and interwoven</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.680" end="00:59:53.280" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.880" end="00:59:54.960" style="s2">that sacredness because that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.280" end="00:59:56.240" style="s2">is when we find something</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.960" end="00:59:58.720" style="s2">an inexhaustible fountain of</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.240" end="01:00:00.799" style="s2">intelligibility and that we find</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.720" end="01:00:01.839" style="s2">within it a beauty that makes us want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.799" end="01:00:03.440" style="s2">generate beauty</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.839" end="01:00:05.920" style="s2">isn&#39;t that a really good definition of</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.440" end="01:00:08.799" style="s2">the sacred</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.920" end="01:00:10.319" style="s2">yeah absolutely it it also starts to</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.799" end="01:00:12.720" style="s2">explain why art</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.319" end="01:00:14.640" style="s2">art whatever alleges to be art if it</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.720" end="01:00:17.760" style="s2">does not</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.640" end="01:00:20.160" style="s2">if it does not invoke the sacred it</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.760" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">appears not to be art</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.160" end="01:00:24.319" style="s2">you know the same activity perhaps that</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:26.160" style="s2">means that</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.319" end="01:00:28.319" style="s2">this is what does that mean like because</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.160" end="01:00:31.839" style="s2">art can contain all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.319" end="01:00:34.799" style="s2">unsacred things and that again</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.839" end="01:00:36.799" style="s2">but again your point is it the process</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.799" end="01:00:38.640" style="s2">or the product we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.799" end="01:00:39.839" style="s2">if the point is to put those unticked</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.640" end="01:00:41.760" style="s2">things in to</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.839" end="01:00:42.880" style="s2">wake us up from how we have perhaps turn</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.760" end="01:00:44.400" style="s2">them into idols</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.880" end="01:00:45.920" style="s2">or perhaps why we&#39;ve lost touch with</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.400" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">their original meaning or</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.920" end="01:00:49.359" style="s2">if it&#39;s to wake us up to the sacred</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">again that i think it&#39;s art if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.359" end="01:00:52.880" style="s2">to be irreverent</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:55.359" style="s2">then i don&#39;t think that would count as</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.880" end="01:00:56.960" style="s2">good art to my mind</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.359" end="01:00:59.440" style="s2">no i mean what we&#39;re doing here is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.960" end="01:01:02.720" style="s2">critiquing i mean we have launched</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.440" end="01:01:04.400" style="s2">a deep critique of you know the romantic</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.720" end="01:01:06.480" style="s2">slogan arts for ark&#39;s sake</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.400" end="01:01:08.240" style="s2">we&#39;re saying art to be art should never</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.480" end="01:01:10.319" style="s2">be for art&#39;s sake</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.240" end="01:01:11.599" style="s2">yes and we&#39;re also making an implicit</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.319" end="01:01:14.799" style="s2">platonic argument that</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.599" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">only good art qualifies the definition</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.799" end="01:01:19.599" style="s2">yes yes if if it is not of the good</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.160" end="01:01:21.359" style="s2">if the art is not of the good then it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.599" end="01:01:25.839" style="s2">not art by definition which is a very</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.359" end="01:01:25.839" style="s2">platonic argument</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.319" end="01:01:35.760" style="s2">somehow i think that i think that it</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.880" end="01:01:35.760" style="s2">can&#39;t be narrowed</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.920" end="01:01:39.119" style="s2">to to platonic ideals because i because</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.160" end="01:01:41.680" style="s2">that would</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.119" end="01:01:43.520" style="s2">that would that would that would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.680" end="01:01:47.680" style="s2">didactic or</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.520" end="01:01:49.359" style="s2">is that the right word um well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.680" end="01:01:51.200" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna ask you andrew to do what you</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.359" end="01:01:53.760" style="s2">did earlier when i made a proposal</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.200" end="01:01:54.640" style="s2">you said maybe we need to reinvent your</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.760" end="01:01:56.160" style="s2">sense of beauty</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.640" end="01:01:57.839" style="s2">to be appropriate to where the argument</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.160" end="01:01:59.599" style="s2">is leading us like we have to go all the</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.839" end="01:02:00.880" style="s2">way up and all the way down is what i</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.599" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">want to say we want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.880" end="01:02:04.400" style="s2">you have to see the art and the garbage</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:07.200" style="s2">we have to see the art in um</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.400" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">you know distorted electric guitars and</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.200" end="01:02:11.039" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:11.760" style="s2">you know okay yeah yeah we also have to</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.039" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">see art</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.760" end="01:02:18.160" style="s2">and uh and and these you know uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:20.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t want uh a moralistic christian</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.160" end="01:02:22.799" style="s2">version of art i&#39;m sorry jonathan</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.400" end="01:02:24.960" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry i don&#39;t want that i want the</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.799" end="01:02:26.960" style="s2">ramones and the sex pistols too</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.960" end="01:02:28.640" style="s2">uh even though they they are irreverent</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.960" end="01:02:30.880" style="s2">but there&#39;s some authenticity</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.640" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">coming through there but absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.880" end="01:02:33.200" style="s2">there is i don&#39;t think anything that</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.400" end="01:02:35.039" style="s2">we&#39;ve said in</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.200" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">my mind in my mind this is good to</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.039" end="01:02:39.359" style="s2">resolve then in my mind nothing</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:40.319" style="s2">nothing we&#39;ve just said excludes</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.359" end="01:02:43.680" style="s2">excludes the</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.319" end="01:02:45.839" style="s2">grungiest forms of art imaginable to me</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.680" end="01:02:46.880" style="s2">to me this definition includes all of</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.839" end="01:02:50.240" style="s2">that because</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.880" end="01:02:52.240" style="s2">because because we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.240" end="01:02:53.359" style="s2">we&#39;re with a great breath we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.240" end="01:02:55.119" style="s2">to expand</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.359" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">the definition of what we mean by beauty</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.119" end="01:02:59.119" style="s2">in the first instance i don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:03:00.720" style="s2">is to the exclusion of anything that</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.119" end="01:03:02.480" style="s2">seems like it has dirt under its</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.720" end="01:03:04.079" style="s2">fingernails i i don&#39;t see it as</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.480" end="01:03:05.920" style="s2">excluding that</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.079" end="01:03:08.960" style="s2">yeah and so i was proposing andrew that</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.920" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">we uh we do an inventio on</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.960" end="01:03:12.160" style="s2">or i think we are already doing it an</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:15.280" style="s2">inventory on</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.160" end="01:03:16.400" style="s2">the sort of platonic notions of art</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.280" end="01:03:18.319" style="s2">that&#39;s what i think is actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.400" end="01:03:20.400" style="s2">happening here um i don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.319" end="01:03:22.319" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.400" end="01:03:24.160" style="s2">i think there has been a mistake and</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.319" end="01:03:25.039" style="s2">plato bear some responsibility for this</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.160" end="01:03:26.640" style="s2">and so do</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.039" end="01:03:28.480" style="s2">uh some of the neoplatelets so i think</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.640" end="01:03:30.400" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s well said but i think there</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.480" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">has been a mistake of</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.400" end="01:03:34.480" style="s2">reducing all of this to what nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">would call the apollonian</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.480" end="01:03:39.359" style="s2">and that should never be the case i mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:42.319" style="s2">the frame making of the apollonia</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.359" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">always has to be inextricably wed to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.319" end="01:03:45.680" style="s2">frame breaking of the dionysian or you</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:48.799" style="s2">never get the insight</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.680" end="01:03:49.440" style="s2">again that&#39;s right is cold right with</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.799" end="01:03:52.480" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.440" end="01:03:55.920" style="s2">the apollonian generative chaos of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.480" end="01:03:57.520" style="s2">of the of the of the um</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.920" end="01:03:59.280" style="s2">i think that&#39;s unfair to the apollonian</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.520" end="01:03:59.920" style="s2">because of of the way the dichotomy has</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.280" end="01:04:01.920" style="s2">unfolded</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.920" end="01:04:04.240" style="s2">i think the apollonian is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.920" end="01:04:07.200" style="s2">warm but it&#39;s supposed to be warm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.240" end="01:04:08.559" style="s2">you know with light and with stable form</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.200" end="01:04:10.960" style="s2">and the dionysian</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.559" end="01:04:12.400" style="s2">is supposed to be the warmth of heat and</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.960" end="01:04:13.680" style="s2">rupture they&#39;re both warm but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.400" end="01:04:15.599" style="s2">warm in different ways</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.680" end="01:04:17.200" style="s2">they&#39;re generative in different ways</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.599" end="01:04:19.520" style="s2">right i mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.200" end="01:04:20.799" style="s2">i mean birth requires a really painful</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.520" end="01:04:22.640" style="s2">breaking and separating</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.799" end="01:04:24.000" style="s2">but but it also has to come into a</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.640" end="01:04:27.920" style="s2">stable being</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.000" end="01:04:31.039" style="s2">right a child or or or or or</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.920" end="01:04:34.799" style="s2">it turns into a disaster um so</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.039" end="01:04:36.240" style="s2">i i agree so with that that aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.799" end="01:04:38.480" style="s2">the nation critique</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.240" end="01:04:39.520" style="s2">of what i think fairly has been called</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.480" end="01:04:41.200" style="s2">the platonic</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.520" end="01:04:42.880" style="s2">i think that&#39;s right but i think what</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.200" end="01:04:46.079" style="s2">chris was alluding to</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.880" end="01:04:48.640" style="s2">was the notion that that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.079" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">i still think is recoverable from plato</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.640" end="01:04:52.400" style="s2">of art as something</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:54.720" style="s2">ultimately aspirational something that</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.400" end="01:04:56.960" style="s2">is ultimately cultivating wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.720" end="01:04:58.240" style="s2">as a defining feature of the art and i</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.960" end="01:05:01.920" style="s2">do think that there</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.240" end="01:05:04.960" style="s2">is wisdom to be found in</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.920" end="01:05:07.359" style="s2">some of the things i mean i think</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.960" end="01:05:09.280" style="s2">you know hendrix guitar riffs we were</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.359" end="01:05:10.640" style="s2">definitely doing simultaneously frame</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.280" end="01:05:13.200" style="s2">breaking and frame making</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.640" end="01:05:14.559" style="s2">and he was talking about a way of being</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.200" end="01:05:16.640" style="s2">a way of seeing the world</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.559" end="01:05:19.039" style="s2">right he was that was what was going on</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.640" end="01:05:20.640" style="s2">there i was thinking of cezanne who he</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.039" end="01:05:21.440" style="s2">you know he mastered all the classical</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.640" end="01:05:23.680" style="s2">forms</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.440" end="01:05:24.720" style="s2">and then you know he he couldn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.680" end="01:05:26.640" style="s2">anything that</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.720" end="01:05:28.640" style="s2">mattered to him and all that and so he</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.640" end="01:05:30.400" style="s2">took a big bonfire and he just he burned</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.640" end="01:05:32.720" style="s2">everything he&#39;d ever done for</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.400" end="01:05:33.920" style="s2">40 years and then he came up with this</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.720" end="01:05:37.119" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.920" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">a art where he would you know do the</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.119" end="01:05:39.839" style="s2">mountain</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">you know of san victoria over and over</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.839" end="01:05:42.640" style="s2">again millions of times from different</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:44.640" style="s2">angles and you can see it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.640" end="01:05:46.640" style="s2">you know that he threw out perspective</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.640" end="01:05:47.440" style="s2">and invented color invented a whole new</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.640" end="01:05:49.200" style="s2">form</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.440" end="01:05:51.119" style="s2">it looks very much like a postcard to us</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.200" end="01:05:52.079" style="s2">now but at that time it was something</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.119" end="01:05:54.400" style="s2">radical yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.079" end="01:05:55.680" style="s2">through the destruction of the old right</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.400" end="01:05:57.760" style="s2">and he had</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.680" end="01:05:59.039" style="s2">the more you kind of destroy of that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.760" end="01:06:00.799" style="s2">have there&#39;s this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.039" end="01:06:02.880" style="s2">that&#39;s perhaps the dionysian is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.799" end="01:06:06.079" style="s2">destructive exactly</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.880" end="01:06:10.400" style="s2">exactly and i think if plato had been</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.079" end="01:06:12.640" style="s2">more connected to his proposal</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.400" end="01:06:13.760" style="s2">which i think he is really really</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.640" end="01:06:16.319" style="s2">proposed</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.760" end="01:06:17.359" style="s2">of the generativity as the primary</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.319" end="01:06:20.240" style="s2">response</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.359" end="01:06:22.160" style="s2">uh to the beauty he would have seen that</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.240" end="01:06:24.319" style="s2">all generativity has within it</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.160" end="01:06:25.200" style="s2">both the frame breaking dionysian and</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.319" end="01:06:27.680" style="s2">the frame making</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.200" end="01:06:29.119" style="s2">apollonian and this generosity let&#39;s say</p>

<p begin="01:06:29.119" end="01:06:31.920" style="s2">because that&#39;s what he was criticizing</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.559" end="01:06:34.000" style="s2">right is the theater and all its</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.920" end="01:06:36.799" style="s2">garishness and all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:37.359" style="s2">and he he yeah he he didn&#39;t like the way</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.799" end="01:06:38.799" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.359" end="01:06:40.000" style="s2">poetry means something much more than it</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.799" end="01:06:40.960" style="s2">means for us he didn&#39;t like because</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:44.000" style="s2">poetry also meant</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.960" end="01:06:44.799" style="s2">writing plays and right so he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.000" end="01:06:47.839" style="s2">like the way</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.799" end="01:06:50.559" style="s2">in which uh that was the</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.839" end="01:06:50.960" style="s2">now it&#39;s clear that he likes sort of the</p>

<p begin="01:06:50.960" end="01:06:54.160" style="s2">some of the classics like sophocles</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.359" end="01:06:56.079" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.160" end="01:06:57.280" style="s2">and he he clearly likes homer because he</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.079" end="01:07:01.039" style="s2">cites when we&#39;re repeating but he wants</p>

<p begin="01:07:07.039" end="01:07:10.480" style="s2">see this this is plato&#39;s worry and this</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.599" end="01:07:12.160" style="s2">is why i</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.480" end="01:07:13.599" style="s2">propose it as the initial connect</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.160" end="01:07:15.520" style="s2">question plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.599" end="01:07:16.640" style="s2">worried about people not being able to</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.520" end="01:07:20.000" style="s2">tell the difference</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.640" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">between wonder and bullshit right that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:07:22.480" end="01:07:25.119" style="s2">he was worried about the way in which</p>

<p begin="01:07:25.119" end="01:07:29.520" style="s2">can bullshit people yeah so he was</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.599" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">criticizing netflix uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.520" end="01:07:33.680" style="s2">more or less like he was in a sense he</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:35.920" style="s2">was criticizing this popular</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.680" end="01:07:36.880" style="s2">sort of um well and he might have</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.920" end="01:07:39.039" style="s2">ultimately been</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.880" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">wrong i think about some aspects of art</p>

<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:46.880" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:47.599" style="s2">plato i think was at least cottoning on</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.880" end="01:07:50.799" style="s2">to the fact</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.599" end="01:07:53.920" style="s2">that this stock can</p>

<p begin="01:07:53.920" end="01:07:58.880" style="s2">into entertaining bullshit in which</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.799" end="01:08:01.920" style="s2">people are self-satisfied</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.880" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">with not needing to learn</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.920" end="01:08:06.160" style="s2">not needing to be educated i mean and</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.640" end="01:08:08.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what bullshit again that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.160" end="01:08:10.079" style="s2">that&#39;s its defining feature</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.000" end="01:08:11.520" style="s2">the point about a commercial about a</p>

<p begin="01:08:11.520" end="01:08:16.080" style="s2">frankfurt&#39;s a bullshit is to make you</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.839" end="01:08:18.960" style="s2">stop questioning about the product</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.080" end="01:08:20.960" style="s2">so that you&#39;ll buy it right if right</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.960" end="01:08:22.640" style="s2">it&#39;s or the point of the commercial is</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.960" end="01:08:23.359" style="s2">to make you to stop reflecting about the</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.640" end="01:08:26.000" style="s2">candidate</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.359" end="01:08:27.839" style="s2">and vote for them but the point of a</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.000" end="01:08:30.880" style="s2">work of art is to make you</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.839" end="01:08:31.920" style="s2">reflect more about this thing or make</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.880" end="01:08:35.040" style="s2">you reflect more</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.920" end="01:08:38.319" style="s2">about this person political then</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.040" end="01:08:40.080" style="s2">it can art be political it&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.319" end="01:08:42.719" style="s2">well it depends i think it could be</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.080" end="01:08:45.920" style="s2">political in the aristotelian sense of</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.719" end="01:08:48.319" style="s2">politics whereas we are recognizing i</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.920" end="01:08:50.159" style="s2">mean what i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.319" end="01:08:52.560" style="s2">when i say not political i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.159" end="01:08:55.600" style="s2">politics in the aristotelian sets i mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.560" end="01:08:58.480" style="s2">the aristotle&#39;s sense is that this idea</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.600" end="01:09:00.640" style="s2">that most of our cognition is done and</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.480" end="01:09:02.640" style="s2">should be done in distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.640" end="01:09:04.080" style="s2">and that is where we are at as fast</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.640" end="01:09:06.080" style="s2">unfortunately aristotle</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.080" end="01:09:08.239" style="s2">by by an accident in history only wrote</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.080" end="01:09:10.960" style="s2">monologues so that sort of got lost</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.239" end="01:09:11.359" style="s2">but the political i mean insofar as an</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.960" end="01:09:14.719" style="s2">artist</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.359" end="01:09:15.520" style="s2">is trying to get us and i mean this word</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.719" end="01:09:19.040" style="s2">now deeply</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.520" end="01:09:22.080" style="s2">to wonder about distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.040" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">and its sacred capacity for us i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.080" end="01:09:26.480" style="s2">it can properly be political art</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:27.040" style="s2">to the degree to which it is not calling</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.480" end="01:09:29.920" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.040" end="01:09:31.520" style="s2">to explore and try and refine ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.920" end="01:09:32.880" style="s2">into a more conforming right</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.520" end="01:09:34.319" style="s2">relationship with reality</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.880" end="01:09:36.159" style="s2">to the region which is trying to get us</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.319" end="01:09:38.319" style="s2">to be closed and finished</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.159" end="01:09:39.199" style="s2">and think we have both you know break</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.319" end="01:09:40.799" style="s2">the godellion</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.199" end="01:09:42.640" style="s2">picture that we claim to have both</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.799" end="01:09:45.440" style="s2">completeness and consistency</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.640" end="01:09:45.839" style="s2">and we&#39;re all done so in that degree</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.440" end="01:09:48.239" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.839" end="01:09:49.520" style="s2">when it tries to be ideological in that</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.239" end="01:09:51.040" style="s2">it becomes propaganda</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.520" end="01:09:52.719" style="s2">then it becomes propaganda that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.040" end="01:09:56.000" style="s2">exactly what i would argue</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.719" end="01:09:58.880" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.000" end="01:10:00.080" style="s2">which is why which is why i think any</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.880" end="01:10:03.040" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.080" end="01:10:04.239" style="s2">any ostensive work of art that has</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.040" end="01:10:06.960" style="s2">prefigured</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.239" end="01:10:07.440" style="s2">its objective to close the ends of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.960" end="01:10:10.000" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.440" end="01:10:11.280" style="s2">into a knot that establishes firm</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.000" end="01:10:14.719" style="s2">ideological boundaries</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.280" end="01:10:17.040" style="s2">to me can never constitute good art</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.719" end="01:10:18.960" style="s2">because it can never it can never</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.040" end="01:10:22.080" style="s2">reflect</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.960" end="01:10:23.840" style="s2">that right relation to the real</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.080" end="01:10:25.840" style="s2">right and so to go back to one of our</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.840" end="01:10:27.360" style="s2">examples i think guernica is an example</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.840" end="01:10:30.239" style="s2">of political art</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.360" end="01:10:31.440" style="s2">that is not ideological right he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.239" end="01:10:34.480" style="s2">trying to get us to</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.440" end="01:10:37.760" style="s2">realize the evil the</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.480" end="01:10:39.280" style="s2">truth of the ineffable evil</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.760" end="01:10:41.120" style="s2">that human beings are capable of</p>

<p begin="01:10:41.120" end="01:10:44.640" style="s2">and sometimes it doesn&#39;t even need to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.560" end="01:10:47.920" style="s2">that extreme sometimes it&#39;s simply to</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.640" end="01:10:50.560" style="s2">call into question the unquestioned</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.920" end="01:10:52.480" style="s2">certitude of certain the prevailing</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.560" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">climb of false beliefs right i mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.480" end="01:10:54.800" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:57.120" style="s2">you know like one of the things one of</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.800" end="01:11:00.159" style="s2">the one of the art forms i enjoy</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.120" end="01:11:01.840" style="s2">most and and it&#39;s often a very low brow</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.159" end="01:11:02.560" style="s2">art form if we&#39;re talking about that in</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.840" end="01:11:05.040" style="s2">those terms</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.560" end="01:11:06.640" style="s2">is comedy like stand-up comedy for me</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.040" end="01:11:08.719" style="s2">like those that do it well</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.640" end="01:11:10.080" style="s2">are among the greatest artists i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.719" end="01:11:12.800" style="s2">of our time</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.080" end="01:11:14.719" style="s2">precisely because they have a knack they</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.800" end="01:11:16.640" style="s2">have a penchant for inducing the</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.719" end="01:11:18.560" style="s2">apparatic experience</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.640" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">in relation to that which goes</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.560" end="01:11:22.000" style="s2">unquestioned</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.000" end="01:11:24.080" style="s2">and and that&#39;s why they&#39;re particular</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.000" end="01:11:25.679" style="s2">forms of trends and the more transgress</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.080" end="01:11:27.440" style="s2">like when they are artfully</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.679" end="01:11:30.640" style="s2">transgressive in that way</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.440" end="01:11:33.920" style="s2">they are profoundly profoundly powerful</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.640" end="01:11:34.800" style="s2">for that very reason but but but i mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.920" end="01:11:37.679" style="s2">part of that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.800" end="01:11:38.000" style="s2">at least because i mean i would argue</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.679" end="01:11:40.239" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.000" end="01:11:41.840" style="s2">humor i mean the thing of the advantage</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.239" end="01:11:44.719" style="s2">that humor has then</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.840" end="01:11:47.440" style="s2">um is that sorry the advantage that</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.719" end="01:11:49.679" style="s2">comedy has in so far as it invokes humor</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.440" end="01:11:50.560" style="s2">is that humor is engaging the machinery</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.679" end="01:11:53.199" style="s2">of insight</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.560" end="01:11:54.080" style="s2">and so it&#39;s already getting insight into</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.199" end="01:11:56.000" style="s2">into play</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.080" end="01:11:57.679" style="s2">they&#39;re like i mean if your jokes are</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.000" end="01:11:59.440" style="s2">falling flat then there isn&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.679" end="01:12:01.440" style="s2">insight in what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.440" end="01:12:02.800" style="s2">so the the the thing that i would then</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.440" end="01:12:06.080" style="s2">ask you then is</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.800" end="01:12:08.159" style="s2">chris i&#39;m granting you that i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.080" end="01:12:11.679" style="s2">comedy has a special role</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.159" end="01:12:12.719" style="s2">because of the way it it invokes insight</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.679" end="01:12:15.120" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.719" end="01:12:16.719" style="s2">uh request it it actually we have to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.120" end="01:12:18.400" style="s2">we have to we have to do insight in</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.719" end="01:12:20.400" style="s2">order to follow the comedy so i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.400" end="01:12:23.360" style="s2">that&#39;s a point in its favor</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.400" end="01:12:24.080" style="s2">but but the but the opposite of course</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.360" end="01:12:28.159" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.080" end="01:12:31.600" style="s2">um right many comedies are merely</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.159" end="01:12:33.280" style="s2">entertaining right</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.600" end="01:12:35.120" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not that&#39;s right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.280" end="01:12:37.600" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.120" end="01:12:39.679" style="s2">it&#39;s not something being incidentally</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.600" end="01:12:43.520" style="s2">humorous that makes it artful</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.679" end="01:12:45.440" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the provocation</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.520" end="01:12:48.239" style="s2">of humor</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.440" end="01:12:48.719" style="s2">in service of insight i think that is</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.239" end="01:12:51.199" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.719" end="01:12:53.840" style="s2">art of the practice but i was going to</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.199" end="01:12:56.400" style="s2">say i guess some people like lenny bruce</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.840" end="01:12:57.280" style="s2">in the beginning they they did have</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.400" end="01:12:59.600" style="s2">really something</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.280" end="01:13:01.440" style="s2">powerful to say about you know about</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.600" end="01:13:04.640" style="s2">about race and and</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.440" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">things like that and but the way</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.640" end="01:13:09.120" style="s2">their way of putting it it was quite i</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:11.520" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.120" end="01:13:13.840" style="s2">beyond entertainment i mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.520" end="01:13:14.239" style="s2">laughing at the worst parts of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.840" end="01:13:16.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.239" end="01:13:17.840" style="s2">you&#39;re laughing at you&#39;re laughing at me</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.640" end="01:13:18.320" style="s2">you know you&#39;re laughing at seeing</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.840" end="01:13:20.159" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.320" end="01:13:22.159" style="s2">inside out you&#39;re laughing at seeing</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.159" end="01:13:26.159" style="s2">your your um you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.159" end="01:13:28.719" style="s2">the comedy is the best comedians are are</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.159" end="01:13:29.600" style="s2">most self-mocking of themselves in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.719" end="01:13:30.640" style="s2">sense right right</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.600" end="01:13:32.800" style="s2">because i think one thing that good</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.640" end="01:13:34.560" style="s2">comedians do is they call attention to</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.800" end="01:13:36.320" style="s2">the form of life that inculcates our</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.560" end="01:13:37.280" style="s2">experience and conditions it</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.320" end="01:13:40.560" style="s2">unthinkingly</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.280" end="01:13:43.679" style="s2">right the forms of life that that that</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.560" end="01:13:45.040" style="s2">that um you know the proponents of our</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.679" end="01:13:47.600" style="s2">habits the proponents of</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.040" end="01:13:48.640" style="s2">the way that we behave the the</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.600" end="01:13:52.960" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.640" end="01:13:55.199" style="s2">we live by that go unseen by us</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.960" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">um through most of our days are</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.199" end="01:13:58.159" style="s2">precisely those</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:14:00.159" style="s2">i mean good observational comics that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.159" end="01:14:02.080" style="s2">what they do in effect right they call</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.159" end="01:14:03.679" style="s2">our attention down to the fundaments to</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.080" end="01:14:05.600" style="s2">the to the to the rudiments that</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.679" end="01:14:07.920" style="s2">structure our behavior</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.600" end="01:14:09.040" style="s2">and then turn our attention back to</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.920" end="01:14:11.199" style="s2">those things it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.040" end="01:14:13.199" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t mean to over attribute</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.199" end="01:14:16.000" style="s2">brilliance to the genre but there is a</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.199" end="01:14:19.120" style="s2">certain amount of socratic self-inquiry</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.000" end="01:14:22.239" style="s2">that good comedians induce and induce</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.120" end="01:14:23.199" style="s2">very deliberately well i&#39;ve heard it</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.239" end="01:14:27.199" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.199" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">um that tragedy is the art that reminds</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.199" end="01:14:32.320" style="s2">us of our capacity for transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.840" end="01:14:33.520" style="s2">and comedy is the art that reminds us of</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.320" end="01:14:35.360" style="s2">our finitude</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.520" end="01:14:37.360" style="s2">uh so that we never think of ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.360" end="01:14:38.320" style="s2">as gods and then remember jonathan</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.360" end="01:14:40.960" style="s2">miller saying</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.320" end="01:14:43.040" style="s2">if you want to present a tragedy well</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.960" end="01:14:45.520" style="s2">try to highlight the comedy in the play</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.040" end="01:14:46.320" style="s2">yeah you want to present the comedy well</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.520" end="01:14:48.640" style="s2">try and</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.320" end="01:14:49.520" style="s2">try and highlight the tragedy within the</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.640" end="01:14:51.040" style="s2">show because</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.520" end="01:14:52.560" style="s2">and isn&#39;t that isn&#39;t that the most</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.040" end="01:14:56.400" style="s2">dialectical thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.560" end="01:14:58.719" style="s2">is horrible i mean it&#39;s totally tragic</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.400" end="01:14:59.840" style="s2">you know where and i guess i guess</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.719" end="01:15:03.120" style="s2">tragedy uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.840" end="01:15:05.120" style="s2">always has this beyond the tragic</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.120" end="01:15:06.640" style="s2">so so they there&#39;s might be an inverse</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.120" end="01:15:08.080" style="s2">there or</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.640" end="01:15:10.080" style="s2">well i don&#39;t think there is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.080" end="01:15:12.320" style="s2">dialectical relationship between tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.080" end="01:15:13.679" style="s2">and comedy and that they kind of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.320" end="01:15:15.760" style="s2">almost a yin yang</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.679" end="01:15:17.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t mean that one&#39;s yang but you</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.760" end="01:15:18.800" style="s2">know the way the yin and yang</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.120" end="01:15:19.840" style="s2">interpenetrate and interdefine each</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.800" end="01:15:23.040" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.840" end="01:15:24.719" style="s2">um because i i mean this is what um</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.040" end="01:15:26.800" style="s2">this is what drew highland argues is the</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.719" end="01:15:28.320" style="s2">core of socratic dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.800" end="01:15:29.920" style="s2">because he wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.320" end="01:15:32.400" style="s2">transcendence uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.920" end="01:15:34.159" style="s2">trans what is it transcendence and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.400" end="01:15:36.159" style="s2">finite or transcendence of finitude</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.159" end="01:15:38.080" style="s2">the point is that plato is always trying</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.159" end="01:15:40.640" style="s2">to keep us moored both</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.080" end="01:15:42.880" style="s2">in our capacity for transcendence and</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.640" end="01:15:44.880" style="s2">our mortality as finite beings</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.880" end="01:15:45.920" style="s2">because if we give into if we give in to</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.880" end="01:15:48.640" style="s2">just the finite</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.920" end="01:15:50.320" style="s2">we become enslaved to despair and if we</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.640" end="01:15:52.960" style="s2">give in to just the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.320" end="01:15:53.920" style="s2">we become inflationary and arrogant and</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.960" end="01:15:56.000" style="s2">destructive</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.920" end="01:15:57.760" style="s2">uh-huh that makes sense yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.000" end="01:15:58.880" style="s2">interestingly those two things can</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.760" end="01:16:02.320" style="s2">sometimes combine</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.880" end="01:16:05.600" style="s2">into the morality tale</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.320" end="01:16:08.800" style="s2">what the tragedy of comedy yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.600" end="01:16:10.560" style="s2">yeah because because</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.800" end="01:16:11.920" style="s2">what you&#39;ve described is the dialectical</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.560" end="01:16:13.840" style="s2">relationship between them and that</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.920" end="01:16:15.679" style="s2">dialectical relationship does seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.840" end="01:16:18.080" style="s2">essential to the narrative form</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.679" end="01:16:20.239" style="s2">and sometimes those two are collapsed</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.080" end="01:16:22.400" style="s2">and then reformulated into a</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.239" end="01:16:24.159" style="s2">a third model that becomes a morality</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.400" end="01:16:25.280" style="s2">play i&#39;m not saying that every morality</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.159" end="01:16:27.600" style="s2">play has</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.280" end="01:16:28.560" style="s2">constitutes itself in that dialectic but</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.600" end="01:16:31.040" style="s2">some of them do</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.560" end="01:16:32.960" style="s2">and when it when when that happens i</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.040" end="01:16:34.480" style="s2">think that that synthesis is remarkably</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.960" end="01:16:36.000" style="s2">powerful for that reason</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.480" end="01:16:38.320" style="s2">well i was thinking of dante when you</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.000" end="01:16:39.679" style="s2">said that ex well there we go</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.320" end="01:16:42.320" style="s2">yeah i couldn&#39;t think of a better</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.679" end="01:16:45.440" style="s2">example than that</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.320" end="01:16:47.679" style="s2">right so we have the divine tragedy in</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.440" end="01:16:49.120" style="s2">the divine comedy in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.679" end="01:16:50.480" style="s2">and they interweave with each other and</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.120" end="01:16:53.360" style="s2">you know what we now describe we&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.480" end="01:16:53.360" style="s2">described the bible</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.800" end="01:16:58.860" style="s2">that that that&#39;s usually a sign that</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.480" end="01:17:00.560" style="s2">we&#39;re on to something</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.860" end="01:17:02.560" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.560" end="01:17:04.159" style="s2">well i did want to sort of i wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.560" end="01:17:06.560" style="s2">come back to the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.159" end="01:17:07.840" style="s2">the connection of art and religio i</p>

<p begin="01:17:19.520" end="01:17:23.199" style="s2">art is a as a something you create with</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.760" end="01:17:24.960" style="s2">with people and then art is something</p>

<p begin="01:17:28.880" end="01:17:32.400" style="s2">well i mean like i&#39;ve been making an</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.960" end="01:17:36.000" style="s2">argument throughout that art</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.400" end="01:17:37.760" style="s2">is a specific although kirkegaard</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.000" end="01:17:39.199" style="s2">says and dante says that art and</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.760" end="01:17:41.760" style="s2">philosophy can overlap</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.199" end="01:17:43.120" style="s2">but i was arguing that art is a specific</p>

<p begin="01:22:17.840" end="01:22:22.880" style="s2">of perhaps the i don&#39;t want to be so</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.280" end="01:22:24.320" style="s2">reductive as to say it&#39;s a play about</p>
