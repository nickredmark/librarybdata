<p begin="00:00:06.230" end="00:00:11.940" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been fascinated ever since we</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.480" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">interviewed Richard tarnis and I saw on</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.940" end="00:00:16.710" style="s2">Richard Thomas&#39;s book a quote from you</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:17.940" style="s2">and then also realized after we</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.710" end="00:00:20.369" style="s2">interviewed Iain McGilchrist that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.940" end="00:00:23.430" style="s2">were friends with him also and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.369" end="00:00:25.619" style="s2">really interested in what it is that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.430" end="00:00:28.080" style="s2">that you find compelling about about</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.619" end="00:00:31.109" style="s2">their thought they&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.080" end="00:00:34.140" style="s2">things that I find most interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.109" end="00:00:38.430" style="s2">most important which are a long way from</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.140" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">what most people interested in because</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.430" end="00:00:43.020" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been interested in stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">do with psychology of almost every time</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.020" end="00:00:50.700" style="s2">and I&#39;m also interested in spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:55.500" style="s2">stuff in a very weakened form which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.700" end="00:00:58.710" style="s2">what I what I call why we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.500" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">is there a purpose of life and of course</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.710" end="00:01:05.970" style="s2">the current scientific paradigms there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">no purpose at all consciousness is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.970" end="00:01:12.049" style="s2">epiphenomenon caused by chemical so</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:15.570" style="s2">chemical reaction which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.049" end="00:01:18.299" style="s2">complete nonsense it reminds me of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.570" end="00:01:20.299" style="s2">George Orwell once said which was only</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.299" end="00:01:22.680" style="s2">an intellectual could believe that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.299" end="00:01:24.150" style="s2">Richard Thomas in particular I read</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.680" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">passion of the Western mind in</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.150" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">University and I think it had more</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:29.729" style="s2">impact on me than anything else I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:32.280" style="s2">ever read you were interested in</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.729" end="00:01:32.909" style="s2">Richards work before Ian&#39;s or what was</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.280" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">the sequence</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.909" end="00:01:38.610" style="s2">I read the passion of the rest of world</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:40.700" style="s2">before I met Richard Thomas and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.610" end="00:01:45.930" style="s2">moment we met</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.700" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">and that was at Esalen we just clicked</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.930" end="00:01:52.409" style="s2">and I love being around people who are</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:55.110" style="s2">much much cleverer and wiser than I am</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.409" end="00:01:56.520" style="s2">and what is it about his work and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.110" end="00:01:58.110" style="s2">obviously having spent time with him as</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.520" end="00:02:01.500" style="s2">well that you find interesting the point</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.110" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">about Richard and you would never find</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.500" end="00:02:08.970" style="s2">this I think in the UK is that he</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:11.489" style="s2">teaches at a place called C I s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.970" end="00:02:13.280" style="s2">California Institute of integral studies</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.489" end="00:02:15.190" style="s2">in which he&#39;s deal</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.280" end="00:02:19.060" style="s2">with almost everything that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.190" end="00:02:21.560" style="s2">important and looking at all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.060" end="00:02:24.140" style="s2">influences on us that are normally</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.560" end="00:02:27.860" style="s2">gnawed by modern science I meet these</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.140" end="00:02:30.080" style="s2">people whenever I stop working in a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.860" end="00:02:32.390" style="s2">of time off because they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:34.730" style="s2">about what I think really matters and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.390" end="00:02:41.569" style="s2">lot of it would be regarded as very</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.730" end="00:02:43.790" style="s2">strange my the volvo i mean if i sat at</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.569" end="00:02:45.950" style="s2">it in a table in london and started</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.790" end="00:02:48.410" style="s2">talking about the afterlife which i</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.950" end="00:02:50.720" style="s2">believe through these people that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.410" end="00:02:54.680" style="s2">there&#39;s ample evidence that something</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.720" end="00:02:56.750" style="s2">goes on the table would go quiet because</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.680" end="00:02:59.330" style="s2">they would be embarrassed that I&#39;d gone</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.750" end="00:03:03.950" style="s2">off my rocker and I think that this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.330" end="00:03:07.459" style="s2">an indication of just how crazy the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.950" end="00:03:09.560" style="s2">intellectual world I won&#39;t say has</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.459" end="00:03:12.319" style="s2">become as it may always have been like</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.560" end="00:03:16.730" style="s2">this but how crazy the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:18.440" style="s2">world is I mean for 60 years we learned</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.730" end="00:03:21.410" style="s2">that fats for the course of heart</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.440" end="00:03:23.959" style="s2">disease then suddenly we discover oh no</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.410" end="00:03:26.600" style="s2">they&#39;re not its it sugar well 60 years</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.959" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">you know in behaviorism which is simply</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.600" end="00:03:31.510" style="s2">observing what you can observe and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:35.180" style="s2">pretending everything else doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.510" end="00:03:38.150" style="s2">which is insane in itself you know that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.180" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">dominated psychology for 60 years what</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.150" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">annoys me about says it&#39;s not they make</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">a lot of mistakes but they are so</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:48.769" style="s2">resistant to changing their mistakes and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:51.950" style="s2">I think it&#39;s because nobody likes to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.769" end="00:03:54.230" style="s2">change paradigms if their previous work</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.950" end="00:03:57.290" style="s2">was dependent on the paradigm because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.230" end="00:03:59.090" style="s2">devalues their work if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.290" end="00:04:01.459" style="s2">certainly says well the theory you based</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.090" end="00:04:02.510" style="s2">it on isn&#39;t quite right so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.459" end="00:04:04.549" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.510" end="00:04:06.769" style="s2">the need for a paradigm shift and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.549" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">guess Richard on a sandy McGilchrist are</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.769" end="00:04:08.690" style="s2">both involved in whatever that might</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:10.310" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.690" end="00:04:12.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve obviously been interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.310" end="00:04:14.180" style="s2">for a while what do you make of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.410" end="00:04:17.930" style="s2">what is the paradigm shift that&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.180" end="00:04:20.989" style="s2">do you think well it&#39;s to move away from</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.930" end="00:04:23.990" style="s2">the idea that this is a reductionist</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.989" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">materialist universe which a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.990" end="00:04:30.950" style="s2">obviously very clever people</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:33.170" style="s2">like Dawkins and Steven Pinker are</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.950" end="00:04:35.090" style="s2">absolute dead settle and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.170" end="00:04:37.430" style="s2">from what I know and after all these are</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.090" end="00:04:40.310" style="s2">my ideas I just hear other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.430" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">ideas and I think I can spot good ones</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.310" end="00:04:47.570" style="s2">this is a ridiculous and the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.960" end="00:04:50.390" style="s2">that disproves it just gets pushed out</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.570" end="00:04:53.060" style="s2">of the way I mean Rupert Sheldrake whom</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.390" end="00:04:54.770" style="s2">I admire greatly was on television BBC</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.060" end="00:04:57.710" style="s2">of course science department which is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.770" end="00:05:00.050" style="s2">very primitive sort of production is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.710" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">reductionist of the department I went on</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.050" end="00:05:05.660" style="s2">was with Dawkins and when Dawkins became</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:08.780" style="s2">very dismissive I mean I shall raign</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.660" end="00:05:12.050" style="s2">asked him about the stuff that Sheldrake</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.780" end="00:05:13.850" style="s2">had sent him to read and and Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.050" end="00:05:16.460" style="s2">said I didn&#39;t bother to read it because</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.850" end="00:05:18.770" style="s2">it knows nonsense which is like Galileo</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.460" end="00:05:20.870" style="s2">saying you know when he&#39;d invented the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.770" end="00:05:22.850" style="s2">telescope and he invites the top fever</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.870" end="00:05:24.970" style="s2">from the Catholic Church he says please</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.850" end="00:05:27.140" style="s2">come and look through my beautiful new</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.970" end="00:05:30.080" style="s2">telescope to see the craters on the moon</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.140" end="00:05:32.000" style="s2">and the Scholastic&#39;s a gallon a we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.080" end="00:05:34.669" style="s2">need to look through a telescope we know</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:37.190" style="s2">they&#39;re not there now we laugh at that</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.669" end="00:05:39.770" style="s2">medieval church we have a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.190" end="00:05:42.470" style="s2">similar feelings in today&#39;s science and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.770" end="00:05:44.180" style="s2">in McGilchrist work talks about the left</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.470" end="00:05:45.440" style="s2">brain and the right brain as different</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.180" end="00:05:47.419" style="s2">ways of looking at the world the left</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.440" end="00:05:49.550" style="s2">brain very atomistic reductionist and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.419" end="00:05:53.330" style="s2">the right brain much more open to nuance</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.550" end="00:05:55.790" style="s2">and the mystery what why do you think</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.330" end="00:05:57.890" style="s2">that&#39;s a really significant because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.790" end="00:06:02.570" style="s2">don&#39;t think that the world is a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.890" end="00:06:05.419" style="s2">happy place and IANS point really is</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.570" end="00:06:07.550" style="s2">that the left brain likes to dominate or</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.419" end="00:06:10.310" style="s2">left hemisphere likes to dominate the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.550" end="00:06:13.640" style="s2">right hemisphere and it seems to have</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.640" end="00:06:19.760" style="s2">it has speech on its side it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.729" end="00:06:23.800" style="s2">strong in speech the left brain wants to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.760" end="00:06:26.990" style="s2">control and exploit and produce and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.800" end="00:06:28.940" style="s2">analyze and divide in order to find out</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.990" end="00:06:31.760" style="s2">more about it was the right brain sees</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.940" end="00:06:35.539" style="s2">the whole thing and it&#39;s in the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.760" end="00:06:36.120" style="s2">hemisphere that we get our feelings that</p>

<p begin="00:06:36.120" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">for this in life which i think is why so</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.730" end="00:06:44.130" style="s2">many of the philosophers are rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.880" end="00:06:45.900" style="s2">depressed because there in the left</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.130" end="00:06:47.850" style="s2">brain and of course that&#39;s the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.900" end="00:06:49.710" style="s2">they write because if you&#39;re happy you</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.850" end="00:06:52.139" style="s2">write happy things and have happy</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.710" end="00:06:54.449" style="s2">thoughts and if you&#39;re sad you write sad</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.139" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">things because you have sad thought so</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.389" end="00:07:11.190" style="s2">people sort of said get rid of that</p>

<p begin="00:07:31.680" end="00:07:39.180" style="s2">that people who are very very analytical</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.820" end="00:07:41.850" style="s2">tend not to have very good senses of</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.850" end="00:07:50.100" style="s2">narrow kind of comedy the sort of wit</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.310" end="00:07:54.510" style="s2">comedy whereas the part of us that loves</p>

<p begin="00:08:11.700" end="00:08:16.770" style="s2">I think again that there&#39;s lots going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.250" end="00:08:20.520" style="s2">that modern science denies but I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.770" end="00:08:22.440" style="s2">the great sadness is that you will start</p>

<p begin="00:08:26.760" end="00:08:34.110" style="s2">worthwhile is to do with trying to break</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.150" end="00:08:35.969" style="s2">down the power of our egos and if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.110" end="00:08:38.099" style="s2">look at the Beatitudes which is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.969" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">heart of Christ&#39;s teaching when he says</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.099" end="00:08:44.820" style="s2">blesses of the meekness into the</p>

<p begin="00:08:46.110" end="00:08:51.000" style="s2">oh yeah when when when Jesus is at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.690" end="00:08:52.890" style="s2">attitude he says blessed are the pure in</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.000" end="00:08:55.620" style="s2">heart you know bless the poor in spirit</p>

<p begin="00:08:55.620" end="00:09:00.029" style="s2">is about people who are not running</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.959" end="00:09:02.130" style="s2">around sticking their chest out and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.029" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">saying how important they are it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.130" end="00:09:07.709" style="s2">a quietness do you see what I mean and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:10.980" style="s2">receptiveness which means that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.709" end="00:09:12.510" style="s2">some kind of divine and Stuart divine</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.980" end="00:09:14.820" style="s2">experience can come through if you get</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.510" end="00:09:17.690" style="s2">in that mood which is why some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.820" end="00:09:20.640" style="s2">more interesting origins emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.690" end="00:09:23.850" style="s2">meditation you see what I mean but the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.640" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">moment that people come along they and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.850" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">they say not to Christ but to people</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:29.220" style="s2">like Christ well well you could have</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:31.290" style="s2">gotta get organized you you know we need</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.220" end="00:09:33.089" style="s2">a marketing department and what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.290" end="00:09:35.399" style="s2">finish up with is the Catholic Church</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.089" end="00:09:37.910" style="s2">which is supposed to be teaching Christ</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.399" end="00:09:40.980" style="s2">teaching which is humility poverty and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.910" end="00:09:44.279" style="s2">tolerance and of course it&#39;s a very rich</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.980" end="00:09:47.339" style="s2">powerful authoritarian organization and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.279" end="00:09:49.740" style="s2">this is the ultimate paradox isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.339" end="00:09:51.570" style="s2">lightest word and that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.740" end="00:09:54.079" style="s2">with organized religion whereas I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.570" end="00:09:57.149" style="s2">there are people sometimes who have</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.079" end="00:09:58.649" style="s2">insights into what religion is really</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.149" end="00:10:00.660" style="s2">about where they don&#39;t think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.649" end="00:10:03.870" style="s2">very good at organizing except for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.660" end="00:10:06.449" style="s2">Buddhists who insist on personal</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.870" end="00:10:08.699" style="s2">transmission so it&#39;s not lost because</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.449" end="00:10:09.990" style="s2">people read books and misunderstand them</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.699" end="00:10:12.060" style="s2">because they&#39;re at a low level of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.990" end="00:10:14.820" style="s2">spiritual development and I understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.060" end="00:10:17.370" style="s2">you&#39;ve met the Dalai Lama yes how was</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.820" end="00:10:19.800" style="s2">that was wonderful I was injured I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.370" end="00:10:21.660" style="s2">asked if I wanted to meet him and I said</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.800" end="00:10:23.970" style="s2">well of course and I went up and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.660" end="00:10:25.829" style="s2">thought well I&#39;ll try not to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.970" end="00:10:28.529" style="s2">everything too but now like you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.829" end="00:10:31.829" style="s2">where did you get your sandal so how was</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.529" end="00:10:33.540" style="s2">this particular reincarnation going so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.829" end="00:10:36.360" style="s2">stood there waiting for the spirit to</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.540" end="00:10:38.399" style="s2">move me and I just started laughing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.360" end="00:10:41.370" style="s2">he started laughing and we stood there</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.399" end="00:10:44.910" style="s2">laughing together for about 15 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.370" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">and then I said thank you very much and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.910" end="00:10:49.630" style="s2">the something about being around that</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:52.270" style="s2">man and those think are made</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.630" end="00:10:54.340" style="s2">was that you suddenly become Li as I</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.270" end="00:10:56.020" style="s2">secret just ago you suddenly become less</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.340" end="00:10:59.050" style="s2">worried about making a fool of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.020" end="00:11:01.000" style="s2">of this worried about letting something</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.050" end="00:11:04.450" style="s2">slip which will embarrass you and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.000" end="00:11:06.070" style="s2">become much more relaxed hmm and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.450" end="00:11:07.900" style="s2">had a lot of people on our channel talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.070" end="00:11:09.910" style="s2">about what we&#39;re calling the the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.900" end="00:11:12.070" style="s2">crisis the crisis of meaning or the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.910" end="00:11:14.020" style="s2">god-shaped hole in the culture even</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.070" end="00:11:15.700" style="s2">though that&#39;s underneath a lot of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.020" end="00:11:18.310" style="s2">of what with a lot of the conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.700" end="00:11:21.520" style="s2">division that we&#39;re seeing yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.310" end="00:11:24.910" style="s2">that was a time when people had some</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.520" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">sort of feeling that their lives were</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.910" end="00:11:33.220" style="s2">meaningful and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">intellectuals that came along and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.220" end="00:11:37.870" style="s2">know the existentialist and so forth it</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:39.460" style="s2">was a meaningless universe do you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.870" end="00:11:42.100" style="s2">you might as well just do anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.460" end="00:11:44.200" style="s2">because you know at least it&#39;s authentic</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.100" end="00:11:47.200" style="s2">for you and I don&#39;t think happiness</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.200" end="00:11:50.530" style="s2">lives that way and I think if people</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.200" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">just sat and meditated for 10 minutes a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.530" end="00:11:56.710" style="s2">day I think the country would become</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:59.620" style="s2">much happier in about 4 days people have</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.710" end="00:12:01.960" style="s2">forgotten what&#39;s important and money has</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.620" end="00:12:03.460" style="s2">become all-important particularly sadly</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.960" end="00:12:05.770" style="s2">in England now in the way that it used</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.460" end="00:12:08.950" style="s2">to be in America but it&#39;s now in England</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.770" end="00:12:10.900" style="s2">with that kind of mindset I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.950" end="00:12:13.480" style="s2">we can expect much to happen but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.900" end="00:12:16.150" style="s2">never know I mean I remember I was with</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.480" end="00:12:17.950" style="s2">two family therapists once and they said</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.150" end="00:12:19.630" style="s2">very kindly about a couple they&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.950" end="00:12:22.300" style="s2">seeing I think they one of them said I</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.630" end="00:12:25.450" style="s2">think that what this couple needs is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.300" end="00:12:27.580" style="s2">nice crisis because people only change</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.450" end="00:12:29.170" style="s2">in crises so maybe there will be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.580" end="00:12:31.750" style="s2">crisis yeah but I think if people</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.170" end="00:12:36.130" style="s2">actually started to think what might</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.750" end="00:12:38.830" style="s2">make me happy in other other than not</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.130" end="00:12:41.020" style="s2">what like maybe richer or more important</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.830" end="00:12:42.550" style="s2">people would become much happier or</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.020" end="00:12:44.500" style="s2">straightaway be familiar at all with</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.550" end="00:12:47.320" style="s2">Jordan Peterson I know that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.500" end="00:12:50.620" style="s2">Peterson has fallen foul of the PC crowd</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.320" end="00:12:52.210" style="s2">which means he must be good because Ian</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.620" end="00:12:55.060" style="s2">McGilchrist had a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.210" end="00:12:56.950" style="s2">conversation with Jordan Peterson the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.060" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">that was sort of this incredible</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.950" end="00:13:01.930" style="s2">exploratory conversation about religious</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:03.529" style="s2">truth and the structure of the mind and</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.930" end="00:13:05.060" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.529" end="00:13:09.470" style="s2">but you have to remember now that</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.060" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">religion is just a bad thing and things</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.470" end="00:13:13.610" style="s2">are either good or bad and we have this</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:16.940" style="s2">kind of binary thing in feeling now</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.610" end="00:13:18.620" style="s2">somebody&#39;s good or bad which is cause</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.940" end="00:13:21.410" style="s2">nothing to do with real life as my</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.620" end="00:13:23.449" style="s2">mother used to say we&#39;re super there she</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.410" end="00:13:26.360" style="s2">would say as good and bad in all of us</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.449" end="00:13:28.010" style="s2">and this idea that certain things are</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.360" end="00:13:32.899" style="s2">good and certain things are bad you take</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.010" end="00:13:34.269" style="s2">someone like colonial the idea of</p>

<p begin="00:13:34.269" end="00:13:39.500" style="s2">all right it&#39;s largely bad but there</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.130" end="00:13:41.420" style="s2">were also good things and people would</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.500" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">get very angry with a true mom say no no</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.420" end="00:13:46.220" style="s2">it was all bad at all times and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with white skinned</p>

<p begin="00:14:18.980" end="00:14:22.760" style="s2">have you ever been on the receiving end</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.019" end="00:14:24.589" style="s2">of any of this PC police</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.760" end="00:14:27.560" style="s2">oh yeah eight years ago I said that</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.589" end="00:14:29.959" style="s2">London wasn&#39;t an English city anymore</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.560" end="00:14:32.870" style="s2">which is immediately taken as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.959" end="00:14:40.010" style="s2">racialist remark I mean I&#39;m all in favor</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.870" end="00:14:42.680" style="s2">of people staying with their cultures if</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.010" end="00:14:44.870" style="s2">they come to England you know they</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.680" end="00:14:46.730" style="s2">should bring their Caribbean culture</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.870" end="00:14:49.279" style="s2">with them or whatever of course they</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.730" end="00:14:52.130" style="s2">were but they should also be interested</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.279" end="00:14:53.959" style="s2">in the the culture of the country to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.130" end="00:14:56.060" style="s2">which they come it&#39;s old-fashioned thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.959" end="00:14:57.319" style="s2">with its When in Rome do as the Romans I</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.060" end="00:15:00.230" style="s2">mean if I was going to live in another</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.319" end="00:15:02.389" style="s2">country the first thing I do is learn</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.230" end="00:15:05.209" style="s2">the language and then I would find out a</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.389" end="00:15:07.940" style="s2">bit about the history and maybe a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.209" end="00:15:10.100" style="s2">bit about the literature but what I see</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.940" end="00:15:12.180" style="s2">is the English culture just fading away</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.100" end="00:15:14.820" style="s2">because nobody bothers to</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.180" end="00:15:17.310" style="s2">promote it at all but everyone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.820" end="00:15:19.589" style="s2">culture is more important no they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.310" end="00:15:21.750" style="s2">important and I also don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.589" end="00:15:24.630" style="s2">all cultures are equal for example a</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.750" end="00:15:27.900" style="s2">culture that actually turns a blind eye</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.630" end="00:15:30.900" style="s2">or even tolerates female genital</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.900" end="00:15:32.820" style="s2">mutilation is not as good as a culture</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.900" end="00:15:37.370" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t but that will make people</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.820" end="00:15:39.120" style="s2">go who you just say that&#39;s my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.370" end="00:15:41.430" style="s2">because there was some press coverage</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.120" end="00:15:43.860" style="s2">accusing you of racism for that so</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.430" end="00:15:47.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between racism and</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.860" end="00:15:48.630" style="s2">culturalism that is if you are of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.070" end="00:15:51.150" style="s2">particular race there&#39;s not much you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.630" end="00:15:53.700" style="s2">do about it but so far as culture&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.150" end="00:15:57.060" style="s2">concern you can choose exactly which</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.700" end="00:15:59.010" style="s2">culture or which cultures you like so</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.060" end="00:16:00.570" style="s2">you have freedom to choose with culture</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.010" end="00:16:02.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.570" end="00:16:05.670" style="s2">not talking about color I mean most of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:09.779" style="s2">the time most of the trouble and London</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.670" end="00:16:11.310" style="s2">at the moment is that the nice houses in</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.779" end="00:16:17.760" style="s2">the centre of London have been brought</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.310" end="00:16:19.950" style="s2">up by Ukrainian oligarchs we&#39;ve paid 40</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.760" end="00:16:21.630" style="s2">million spent another 20 million on it</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.950" end="00:16:23.910" style="s2">and it&#39;s for their auntie or their</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.630" end="00:16:25.980" style="s2">mother-in-law who then comes to London</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.910" end="00:16:29.010" style="s2">for weeks in the year and leaves the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.980" end="00:16:31.650" style="s2">place empty for 48 weeks in the year</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.010" end="00:16:34.920" style="s2">what one Belgravia it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.650" end="00:16:36.990" style="s2">deserted well is that a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.920" end="00:16:39.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how are you crazy too but</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.990" end="00:16:41.339" style="s2">it&#39;s all of them dominating the culture</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.180" end="00:16:43.320" style="s2">I don&#39;t really one side he preaches that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.339" end="00:16:45.570" style="s2">sort of racing up the down Sloane Street</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.320" end="00:16:47.760" style="s2">the small hours of the morning I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.570" end="00:16:49.890" style="s2">that&#39;s not English and also we have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.760" end="00:16:52.200" style="s2">lot of knife pride now what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.890" end="00:16:54.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember that forty years ago it</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.200" end="00:16:56.370" style="s2">was that people didn&#39;t use knives in</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.240" end="00:16:58.620" style="s2">those days so there&#39;s a lot of changes</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.370" end="00:17:01.220" style="s2">taking place and in some ways I prefer</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.620" end="00:17:05.449" style="s2">the old England which I think was more</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.220" end="00:17:09.990" style="s2">tolerant and more humorous and more</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.449" end="00:17:12.179" style="s2">relaxed and took things a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.990" end="00:17:14.309" style="s2">more easily you know the thing I</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.179" end="00:17:16.270" style="s2">remember from history was Sir Francis</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.309" end="00:17:18.490" style="s2">print a few no he&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.270" end="00:17:22.209" style="s2">on the bowling-green in Plymouth and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.490" end="00:17:24.550" style="s2">they say sir francis the armed artists</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.209" end="00:17:26.350" style="s2">on the way and francis says yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.550" end="00:17:28.449" style="s2">they won&#39;t be here for some time let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.350" end="00:17:30.760" style="s2">finish the game it was that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.449" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">quality which you don&#39;t really see much</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.760" end="00:17:36.640" style="s2">of these days so I regret that going but</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:38.950" style="s2">I don&#39;t want a cosmopolitan ization of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:41.080" style="s2">all cities if I go to Berlin I like it</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.950" end="00:17:43.930" style="s2">to feel vaguely German if I go to Rome</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.080" end="00:17:49.390" style="s2">I&#39;d like it to feel vaguely Italian is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.930" end="00:17:51.430" style="s2">it the shrillness of the culture angry</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.390" end="00:17:53.290" style="s2">about you know I mean young people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.430" end="00:17:55.210" style="s2">angry because they can&#39;t get into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.290" end="00:17:56.950" style="s2">property market in London and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.210" end="00:18:00.100" style="s2">totally sympathetic with that and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.950" end="00:18:03.130" style="s2">reason is that the extremely rich people</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.100" end="00:18:05.140" style="s2">from completely undemocratic societies</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.130" end="00:18:07.480" style="s2">and now to dominate the property market</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.140" end="00:18:09.400" style="s2">in London and people young people can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.480" end="00:18:12.130" style="s2">get their foot on the ladder that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.400" end="00:18:14.290" style="s2">wrong hmm and what I find really</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.130" end="00:18:16.240" style="s2">interesting about this kind of fury over</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.290" end="00:18:17.890" style="s2">the last couple of weeks is that one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.240" end="00:18:19.570" style="s2">the big things that drove bricks it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.890" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">people&#39;s feeling this isn&#39;t my country</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.570" end="00:18:23.220" style="s2">anymore and I think you put your your</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:26.410" style="s2">finger on that kind of division as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.220" end="00:18:28.600" style="s2">yes I mean I spoke out because I knew it</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.410" end="00:18:30.580" style="s2">would upset people and when you&#39;ve as</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.600" end="00:18:33.940" style="s2">old as I am when you&#39;ve upset people as</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.580" end="00:18:35.800" style="s2">regularly as I did right from pride you</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.940" end="00:18:38.020" style="s2">know that the whole thing just passes</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.800" end="00:18:40.930" style="s2">it&#39;s just storm in a teacup in churches</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.020" end="00:18:45.160" style="s2">as a storming in espresso cup so was it</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.930" end="00:18:46.900" style="s2">deliberate yes or no yeah I love getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.160" end="00:18:48.610" style="s2">people cross with and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.900" end="00:18:51.910" style="s2">they&#39;re very smart because I can then</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.610" end="00:18:54.970" style="s2">ask them questions like when I when they</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.910" end="00:18:57.940" style="s2">I said that I thought that race was</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.970" end="00:19:00.700" style="s2">genetic now it doesn&#39;t seem to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.940" end="00:19:02.830" style="s2">an inflammatory comment I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.700" end="00:19:05.980" style="s2">expect people of color to have children</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.830" end="00:19:08.260" style="s2">of color and white people to have white</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.980" end="00:19:10.570" style="s2">children I mean it seems to me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.260" end="00:19:16.660" style="s2">some sort of connection between genetics</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.570" end="00:19:18.340" style="s2">and race and then a lot of geneticists</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.660" end="00:19:23.380" style="s2">write to me and say no there&#39;s no such</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.340" end="00:19:25.600" style="s2">thing as race and so I think well why</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.380" end="00:19:27.250" style="s2">don&#39;t you better tell the race relations</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.600" end="00:19:28.210" style="s2">people and they have obviously got to</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.250" end="00:19:31.629" style="s2">come up with a new</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.210" end="00:19:33.820" style="s2">I don&#39;t know people get excited and they</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.629" end="00:19:36.249" style="s2">don&#39;t really listen to what I say but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.820" end="00:19:39.309" style="s2">make a huge difference between culture</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.249" end="00:19:41.860" style="s2">and race I believe races are completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.309" end="00:19:44.649" style="s2">equal in the sense that they have all</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.860" end="00:19:47.619" style="s2">the rights that any other race head I</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.649" end="00:19:50.019" style="s2">mean I noticed that some people run</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.619" end="00:19:51.759" style="s2">faster than others another swim better</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.019" end="00:19:53.710" style="s2">than others and that&#39;s in itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.759" end="00:19:55.629" style="s2">interesting so we&#39;re not perhaps equal</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.710" end="00:19:57.610" style="s2">in every single way because some people</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.629" end="00:19:59.559" style="s2">are more talented here and less talented</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.610" end="00:20:01.629" style="s2">there and there&#39;s always a great thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.559" end="00:20:03.159" style="s2">about race about intelligence well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.629" end="00:20:05.320" style="s2">one of those people who&#39;s read Howard</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.159" end="00:20:07.299" style="s2">gardener and I know that there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.320" end="00:20:09.159" style="s2">different type of intelligence and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.299" end="00:20:11.649" style="s2">can be very high on what intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.159" end="00:20:14.619" style="s2">and very low on another like have you</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.649" end="00:20:16.749" style="s2">ever seen a philosopher dance we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.619" end="00:20:18.909" style="s2">what I mean so I just feel that it</p>
