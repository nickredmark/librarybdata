<p begin="00:00:01.599" end="00:00:04.080" style="s2">of fourth and somebody comes to you and</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.280" end="00:00:07.680" style="s2">says the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.080" end="00:00:09.760" style="s2">unconditional love quite often the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.680" end="00:00:13.120" style="s2">that you imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.760" end="00:00:16.000" style="s2">is kind of like unlimited money</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.120" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">you think of it as oh i can do anything</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.000" end="00:00:19.439" style="s2">and still have</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:21.039" style="s2">approval something like that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:22.240" style="s2">actually know what love even vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.039" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">means and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.240" end="00:00:26.000" style="s2">unconditional love you haven&#39;t got a</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.760" end="00:00:27.439" style="s2">clue what it actually means</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.000" end="00:00:29.840" style="s2">now if you think about it in the context</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.439" end="00:00:30.800" style="s2">of just good parenting so every parent</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.840" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">should give their child</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.800" end="00:00:34.399" style="s2">unconditional love i&#39;m going to say that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:35.680" style="s2">absolutely categorically</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.399" end="00:00:37.520" style="s2">right there if there&#39;s anything in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.680" end="00:00:38.480" style="s2">world that i believe with experience it</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.520" end="00:00:40.239" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.480" end="00:00:41.680" style="s2">now that does not mean that every parent</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.239" end="00:00:43.520" style="s2">should indulge their child by giving</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.680" end="00:00:45.039" style="s2">them their</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.520" end="00:00:46.239" style="s2">approval certainly doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.039" end="00:00:47.360" style="s2">every parent should give their child</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.239" end="00:00:48.879" style="s2">unconditional candy</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.360" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">right right candy and love are not the</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.879" end="00:00:53.120" style="s2">same thing right there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">boundaries right unconditional love is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.120" end="00:00:58.399" style="s2">crucible more than it is anything else</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:59.680" style="s2">right unconditional love is that i make</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.399" end="00:01:02.800" style="s2">a commitment</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.680" end="00:01:04.960" style="s2">to so fully love you that i</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.800" end="00:01:06.159" style="s2">seek in all ways through that love to</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.960" end="00:01:08.320" style="s2">support you</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.159" end="00:01:10.240" style="s2">in becoming the highest version of</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.320" end="00:01:11.200" style="s2">yourself and i am in partnership with</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.240" end="00:01:14.240" style="s2">your soul</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:15.680" style="s2">and your soul is not kind now your soul</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.240" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">knows that to grow you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.680" end="00:01:19.119" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">there&#39;s an undergoing in growth and to</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.119" end="00:01:23.200" style="s2">unconditional love is to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">fully in relationship with your soul&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.200" end="00:01:25.840" style="s2">calling</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">for you to grow into becoming who it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.840" end="00:01:28.960" style="s2">you are to become on this earth</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:31.040" style="s2">which may actually have a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.960" end="00:01:32.560" style="s2">suffering involved right</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.040" end="00:01:34.079" style="s2">right if i see a man on the street i</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.560" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">actually remember this and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.079" end="00:01:39.439" style="s2">um sort of out myself a little bit i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">in i was in an ayahuasca ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.439" end="00:01:43.360" style="s2">and the the question the increase that i</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">put to myself was the question of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.360" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:49.920" style="s2">what is mine to do and as it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:51.759" style="s2">in in the ceremony there was a young man</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:54.560" style="s2">probably in his early 20s</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.759" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">who had been able to get his father his</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.560" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">grandmother and his aunt but not his</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.840" end="00:01:58.640" style="s2">mother i don&#39;t know what happened there</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:01:59.920" style="s2">to join them and they were they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.640" end="00:02:02.000" style="s2">definitely not the kind of folks you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.920" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">expect to be in this kind of a scenario</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:06.880" style="s2">and dad was sitting next to me and dad</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:08.560" style="s2">had a very tough time</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.880" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">my dad was undergoing some serious</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">suffering probably under and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:12.640" style="s2">i think he may have been a vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:13.599" style="s2">veteran so he was going to some</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.640" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">world-class</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.599" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">suffering and part of me wanted to reach</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:19.360" style="s2">out to him</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:20.959" style="s2">and i was feeling his suffering and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.360" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">was feeling a oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.959" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">and then all of a sudden it just came</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:26.400" style="s2">clear to me of oh this is my lesson</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">my lesson is to actually love him</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">unconditionally which does not mean to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.760" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">carry his cross for him</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:33.280" style="s2">quite the opposite is to actually figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:34.319" style="s2">out with as much discernment as i can</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">muster which may</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.319" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">not be much right now um</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:40.480" style="s2">precisely what his mind to do in</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:42.800" style="s2">relationship to him and precisely what</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.480" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">it is to do in relationship to himself</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">and there are that&#39;s parenting again</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">right parenting as a child</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">your job as a parent is not to lift your</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">child&#39;s burden and your</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">job is not to put on your child of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:54.319" style="s2">burdensome medicines to carry</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:56.560" style="s2">is to support them in growing in their</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.319" end="00:02:58.159" style="s2">own capacity to discover for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">to build in themselves in increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.159" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">capacity to notice</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2">what is theirs to do and how to actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">hold the cross that is theirs to hold</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.920" end="00:03:07.280" style="s2">for the whole and for themselves to grow</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">into who it is there they become</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">it is an infinitely challenging task and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">you will always get it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">that is it though that&#39;s the whole story</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">that&#39;s the beginning of the end and i</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">would just call that friendship by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">way once you recognize that every</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:20.239" style="s2">relationship is that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">and every relationship where you either</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.239" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">try to lift or to impose a burden into</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">is a sin is an error of the of the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">grievous sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:31.519" style="s2">and that your own your own journey is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">journey that gives you more capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.519" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">how to under how to discern that then i</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">just start to get to deep stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">well that&#39;s what peter was trying to do</p>
