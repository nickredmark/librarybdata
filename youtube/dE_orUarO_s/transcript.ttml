<p begin="00:00:41.910" end="00:00:45.539" style="s2">well known to many of our listeners has</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.530" end="00:00:48.239" style="s2">been on the show twice before Jordan is</p>

<p begin="00:01:04.890" end="00:01:10.740" style="s2">I&#39;ve asked Jordan to come on and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:14.070" style="s2">gonna talk broadly about complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.740" end="00:01:16.650" style="s2">dynamics and the ability to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.070" end="00:01:19.020" style="s2">crises like this but not only this</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.650" end="00:01:20.759" style="s2">because this is not the only crisis our</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.020" end="00:01:23.549" style="s2">civilizations gonna confront over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.759" end="00:01:26.790" style="s2">next 20 or 30 years so with that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.549" end="00:01:29.460" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s jump in why don&#39;t we start</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.790" end="00:01:32.250" style="s2">by talking about the intelligence to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.460" end="00:01:33.930" style="s2">action our which we sometimes call sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.250" end="00:01:35.880" style="s2">making if we you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.930" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">I notice about our current crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:41.310" style="s2">there were intelligence reports floating</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">up as early as late December that there</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.310" end="00:01:46.170" style="s2">was a chance of a seer of a pandemic you</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:49.740" style="s2">know chances unknown but much higher</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.170" end="00:01:51.990" style="s2">than 1% at that point it would have</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.740" end="00:01:54.869" style="s2">seemed reasonable for the our</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.990" end="00:01:56.610" style="s2">civilization our country to invest at</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.869" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">let&#39;s say 10 million dollars in doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.610" end="00:02:02.130" style="s2">some early pre ramp for testing by</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:03.740" style="s2">January there are much stronger signals</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.130" end="00:02:07.590" style="s2">coming in from the intelligence field</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.740" end="00:02:10.770" style="s2">and it would have been optimal to spend</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.590" end="00:02:12.629" style="s2">50 million maybe to get real testing</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.770" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">ramped up put in some pre-orders for</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.629" end="00:02:16.380" style="s2">ventilators</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">etc but none of that was done the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.380" end="00:02:22.680" style="s2">intelligence was never turned into cents</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">which was never bridged to action if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.680" end="00:02:27.270" style="s2">were designing a complex dynamic system</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:30.240" style="s2">to be able to respond to situations like</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.270" end="00:02:31.590" style="s2">this how would we do it differently well</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.240" end="00:02:33.000" style="s2">I think one of the things this actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.590" end="00:02:36.840" style="s2">has been noticed in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.000" end="00:02:38.490" style="s2">environment is a non-trivial fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.840" end="00:02:40.730" style="s2">the people in the country were in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.490" end="00:02:42.750" style="s2">aware of the situation we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.730" end="00:02:44.670" style="s2">strong recommendations and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.750" end="00:02:46.170" style="s2">themselves making good choices so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.670" end="00:02:48.150" style="s2">actually kind of an interesting what</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.170" end="00:02:51.480" style="s2">millon called like a sense making mono</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.150" end="00:02:52.830" style="s2">cropping problem and I&#39;m gonna you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.480" end="00:02:54.870" style="s2">frankly point back to the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.830" end="00:02:57.330" style="s2">blue church as being a significant issue</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.870" end="00:02:58.620" style="s2">so if you recall the basic structure of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.330" end="00:03:01.140" style="s2">the blue church is that you have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.620" end="00:03:03.480" style="s2">of very centralized decision-making yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.140" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">you have sensors out to the edge you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.480" end="00:03:06.450" style="s2">got intelligence agencies for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:08.100" style="s2">that are watching what&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.450" end="00:03:10.170" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of handing information</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.100" end="00:03:12.060" style="s2">analysis up chain it gets handoff to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.170" end="00:03:14.970" style="s2">epidemiologist and epidemiology can you</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.060" end="00:03:16.980" style="s2">cut this large network of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.970" end="00:03:18.570" style="s2">vertically oriented structures that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.980" end="00:03:21.330" style="s2">trying to take information since make up</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.570" end="00:03:23.370" style="s2">up up but to make choices there&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.330" end="00:03:25.290" style="s2">of a miss bottlenecks right certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.370" end="00:03:28.040" style="s2">decision makers have to make choices and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.290" end="00:03:31.080" style="s2">oftentimes if an event occurs where the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.040" end="00:03:32.610" style="s2">is if the speed of the event right this</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.080" end="00:03:34.410" style="s2">exponential growth rate is a real</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.610" end="00:03:37.049" style="s2">problems what we&#39;re dealing with or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.410" end="00:03:38.549" style="s2">complexity of the event the the set of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.049" end="00:03:39.989" style="s2">characteristics that make it difficult</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.549" end="00:03:41.730" style="s2">to really even understand the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.989" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">what&#39;s happening maybe ones little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.730" end="00:03:46.980" style="s2">more detail on that in a moment or we</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:49.260" style="s2">might call it like a subtlety like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.980" end="00:03:51.750" style="s2">fact that there is a probabilistic this</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.260" end="00:03:54.060" style="s2">fat tail characteristic that uh Nassim</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.750" end="00:03:56.220" style="s2">Taleb talks about a lot those three</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.060" end="00:03:58.980" style="s2">kinds of things just really really hard</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.220" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">for that kind of sense making a choice</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.980" end="00:04:03.570" style="s2">making infrastructure to respond to well</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:05.130" style="s2">I mean either has to over prepare</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.570" end="00:04:07.650" style="s2">because it&#39;s just kind of designed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.130" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">move at that thickness or it has to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.650" end="00:04:12.450" style="s2">under prepare so what would be would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:16.229" style="s2">potentially very nice would be to have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.450" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">mechanism where we have a substantially</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.229" end="00:04:22.740" style="s2">more distributed capacity to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:24.990" style="s2">choices and and where the sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.740" end="00:04:27.660" style="s2">fabric is wired up to that in a number</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.990" end="00:04:30.630" style="s2">of different levels so you could imagine</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.660" end="00:04:31.770" style="s2">that if there was a way for her manage</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.630" end="00:04:36.180" style="s2">of you if you could highly highly</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.770" end="00:04:37.500" style="s2">distributed CDC kind of function and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.180" end="00:04:38.820" style="s2">were getting some signals in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.500" end="00:04:41.070" style="s2">environment that there was something to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.820" end="00:04:42.780" style="s2">be taken care of and like nine people</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.070" end="00:04:45.720" style="s2">could decide we&#39;re gonna ramp up our</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.780" end="00:04:47.310" style="s2">spending on this kind of medical supply</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.720" end="00:04:48.870" style="s2">and you didn&#39;t actually have to ramp it</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.310" end="00:04:50.640" style="s2">up to a large department head but a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.870" end="00:04:52.200" style="s2">small number of people could could</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.640" end="00:04:53.580" style="s2">choose they had resources that make it</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.200" end="00:04:54.870" style="s2">allocate to particular levels of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.580" end="00:04:57.660" style="s2">protection and then would end up</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.870" end="00:04:59.190" style="s2">happening is as the signal became</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.660" end="00:05:01.260" style="s2">stronger you would actually just see a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.190" end="00:05:05.220" style="s2">larger fraction of the overall portfolio</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.260" end="00:05:06.330" style="s2">of choice makers making concerted</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.220" end="00:05:08.310" style="s2">actions and in fact you can even see</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.330" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">them build into larger you know larger</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.310" end="00:05:13.830" style="s2">collections of choices and so what would</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:16.740" style="s2">then occur is that if the event actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.830" end="00:05:18.390" style="s2">hit you would have a a reasonably well</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.740" end="00:05:20.910" style="s2">designed response plan already in place</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.390" end="00:05:23.790" style="s2">and then also because if you design the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.910" end="00:05:26.430" style="s2">system smoothly like the way the special</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.790" end="00:05:29.190" style="s2">operations in the military work the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.430" end="00:05:30.300" style="s2">ability to then rapidly upgrade capacity</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.190" end="00:05:32.250" style="s2">on the basis of things that have already</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.300" end="00:05:34.500" style="s2">been prototyped but also be part of your</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.250" end="00:05:35.640" style="s2">design that makes sense absolutely I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.500" end="00:05:37.320" style="s2">don&#39;t know and I&#39;m gonna extend it a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.640" end="00:05:39.180" style="s2">little bit and you know let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.320" end="00:05:42.060" style="s2">know if you think this is resident with</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.180" end="00:05:44.760" style="s2">what you said suppose we had allocated a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.060" end="00:05:48.330" style="s2">billion dollars a year for these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.760" end="00:05:51.030" style="s2">of adaptive responses so that right out</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.330" end="00:05:52.470" style="s2">of the tax payers money through some</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.030" end="00:05:55.710" style="s2">selection mechanism hopefully with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.470" end="00:05:58.470" style="s2">fair amount of randomness and it had you</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.710" end="00:06:00.330" style="s2">know ten thousand people involved in</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.470" end="00:06:02.730" style="s2">making these decisions you know any</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.330" end="00:06:05.070" style="s2">group of ten ten thousand people could</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.730" end="00:06:07.830" style="s2">allocate some level of authority which</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.070" end="00:06:09.690" style="s2">they had to invest right yeah for this</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.830" end="00:06:11.580" style="s2">thing could have something like a crowd</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.690" end="00:06:14.600" style="s2">funding mechanism so any one of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.580" end="00:06:16.740" style="s2">ten thousand people could kick up a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.600" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">crowdfunding site based on their reading</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.740" end="00:06:22.200" style="s2">of the intelligence and say hmm I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:25.169" style="s2">putting some money into getting ready</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.200" end="00:06:26.660" style="s2">for testing in December of 2019 is smart</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.169" end="00:06:29.190" style="s2">and ahead of the curve and oh by the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.660" end="00:06:30.870" style="s2">my signing authority or my little pot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.190" end="00:06:34.500" style="s2">ten people though I can get the cosign</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.870" end="00:06:36.240" style="s2">with me our signing Authority is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.500" end="00:06:37.650" style="s2">hundred grand so we&#39;re putting a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.240" end="00:06:39.450" style="s2">grand on this and by the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.650" end="00:06:41.430" style="s2">setting this notice out to the other ten</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.450" end="00:06:42.750" style="s2">thousand that we have done this</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.430" end="00:06:44.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s a signal which will cause</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.750" end="00:06:46.140" style="s2">other people to look at the evidence and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.280" end="00:06:48.360" style="s2">either say hey these guys are ass clowns</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.140" end="00:06:49.020" style="s2">and are worried about something that</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.360" end="00:06:51.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.020" end="00:06:54.480" style="s2">maybe I ought to think about this this</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.420" end="00:06:57.540" style="s2">way we get a swarming adaptive gradual</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.480" end="00:07:00.000" style="s2">and partial buildup of resources aimed</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.540" end="00:07:01.410" style="s2">at these problems prior to the point</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.000" end="00:07:03.960" style="s2">where you have to get a bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.410" end="00:07:05.910" style="s2">person to make a decision yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.960" end="00:07:08.010" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a you know oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.910" end="00:07:09.660" style="s2">all kinds of holes in that design but it</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.010" end="00:07:11.340" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a bad direction I</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.660" end="00:07:12.630" style="s2">think it&#39;s a good direction of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.340" end="00:07:14.250" style="s2">would be a very functional design it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.630" end="00:07:17.570" style="s2">it&#39;s actually interesting to notice that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.250" end="00:07:19.920" style="s2">one of my friends I gotta Adam Robinson</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.570" end="00:07:21.240" style="s2">uses the signals in the financial</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.920" end="00:07:23.340" style="s2">markets to help him get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.240" end="00:07:24.750" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in the world and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.340" end="00:07:27.180" style="s2">actually not that different you know so</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.750" end="00:07:29.580" style="s2">for example if you if you take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.180" end="00:07:33.320" style="s2">the stock prices you actually saw for</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.580" end="00:07:35.490" style="s2">example the airline stocks particularly</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.320" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">International Airlines began to move</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.490" end="00:07:40.140" style="s2">into a strong negative territory in</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:43.050" style="s2">comparison to sort of broader markets</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.140" end="00:07:44.280" style="s2">quite early into the into the event and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.050" end="00:07:46.310" style="s2">so the people who are in a position</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.280" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">where they have skin in the game and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.310" end="00:07:51.540" style="s2">have and therefore both interest and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:53.250" style="s2">motivation to have really sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.540" end="00:07:53.670" style="s2">awareness and what&#39;s likely to happen in</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.250" end="00:07:55.920" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.670" end="00:07:57.720" style="s2">we&#39;re already discounting airline stocks</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.920" end="00:07:59.850" style="s2">well and it looked like like early</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.720" end="00:08:01.260" style="s2">January late December and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.850" end="00:08:03.390" style="s2">rooming Chinese airline stocks I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.260" end="00:08:04.770" style="s2">internationally non stocks and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.390" end="00:08:06.330" style="s2">could imagine if there was a way he&#39;ll I</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.770" end="00:08:08.370" style="s2">don&#39;t know exactly how to do if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.330" end="00:08:10.200" style="s2">a way for them to kind of like create a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.370" end="00:08:13.710" style="s2">long position which is basically what</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.200" end="00:08:15.060" style="s2">you&#39;re saying in response mechanisms you</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.710" end="00:08:16.290" style="s2">know in some sense like right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.060" end="00:08:19.230" style="s2">funny like if you took a trading pair</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.290" end="00:08:21.420" style="s2">and you compared like an airline stocks</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.230" end="00:08:24.030" style="s2">to like telecommunications companies</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.420" end="00:08:25.500" style="s2">like zoom conferencing you would see of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.030" end="00:08:27.240" style="s2">course that the zoom conferencing has</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.500" end="00:08:30.030" style="s2">gone way up and every one cycle got way</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.240" end="00:08:31.830" style="s2">down so you were kind of long a social</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.030" end="00:08:33.300" style="s2">infrastructure that is responsive to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.830" end="00:08:34.770" style="s2">environment now if you could what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.300" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">basically saying is can we build a an</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.770" end="00:08:39.660" style="s2">infrastructure that&#39;s more in the direct</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:42.210" style="s2">hands-on that has a similar construct</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.660" end="00:08:44.400" style="s2">you know a bunch of people reverse with</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.210" end="00:08:47.610" style="s2">some form of skin in the game and have</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.400" end="00:08:49.260" style="s2">some mechanism to you choose to make on</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.610" end="00:08:51.150" style="s2">their own on their own on their own</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.260" end="00:08:52.950" style="s2">account on their decision authority</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.150" end="00:08:54.600" style="s2">certain qualities of investment on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.950" end="00:08:54.910" style="s2">basis of what they think is unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.600" end="00:08:56.740" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.910" end="00:08:59.710" style="s2">has some mechanism where other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.740" end="00:09:00.820" style="s2">can and again I&#39;m sorry so yes you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.710" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">do that and then the next thing I just</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.820" end="00:09:07.540" style="s2">wanted to bring up is this notion of how</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:09.760" style="s2">do we say it right it&#39;s like chaos in</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.540" end="00:09:12.880" style="s2">the trends in the transform from chaos</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.760" end="00:09:14.980" style="s2">into order the very earliest stages are</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">the hardest right you just haven&#39;t got a</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.980" end="00:09:18.550" style="s2">clue what&#39;s going on I&#39;ll give you an</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:20.860" style="s2">example right now in hospitals and this</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.550" end="00:09:21.670" style="s2">is not the case in China or Italy</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.860" end="00:09:25.270" style="s2">because they&#39;ve already been through it</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.670" end="00:09:28.780" style="s2">so you know the details of what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.270" end="00:09:31.630" style="s2">is going to go wrong in hospitals as the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.780" end="00:09:33.970" style="s2">as the case count starts to ramp the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.630" end="00:09:37.330" style="s2">answer is we don&#39;t know it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.970" end="00:09:39.240" style="s2">mystery it&#39;s fog of war and so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.330" end="00:09:42.490" style="s2">learning curve on that front is</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.240" end="00:09:44.200" style="s2">extremely high but once you&#39;ve learned a</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.490" end="00:09:46.180" style="s2">little bit if you have mechanisms in</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.200" end="00:09:48.520" style="s2">place to scale those learnings across</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.180" end="00:09:50.710" style="s2">the entire system you can very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.520" end="00:09:52.900" style="s2">respond right so if you actually wire</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.710" end="00:09:54.970" style="s2">per system we&#39;ve got highly distributed</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.900" end="00:09:56.920" style="s2">capacities to allow people to use their</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.970" end="00:09:58.680" style="s2">local sense making and the choices that</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.920" end="00:10:00.700" style="s2">they make appropriately skin in the game</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.680" end="00:10:02.290" style="s2">send signal out to the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.700" end="00:10:04.390" style="s2">environment and actually prepare the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.290" end="00:10:06.730" style="s2">actual infrastructure in a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.390" end="00:10:08.170" style="s2">heterogeneous way and then you&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.730" end="00:10:10.270" style="s2">built a mechanism for being able to take</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.170" end="00:10:12.220" style="s2">early prototypes and scale the learnings</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.270" end="00:10:14.500" style="s2">of those prototype systems why quickly</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.220" end="00:10:17.800" style="s2">then you have a responsive for structure</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.500" end="00:10:20.980" style="s2">that can handle both rapid and complex</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.800" end="00:10:22.990" style="s2">and subtle systems dynamics yes however</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.980" end="00:10:24.490" style="s2">yes you can wait to learn from</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.990" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">experience but I would have suggest</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.490" end="00:10:31.150" style="s2">another potential use of shall we call</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:33.430" style="s2">it this anticipation fund is one could</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.150" end="00:10:36.070" style="s2">do simulations I mean you know with live</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.430" end="00:10:37.900" style="s2">bodies right for not a lot of money a</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.070" end="00:10:40.330" style="s2">few million dollars you could test a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.900" end="00:10:42.730" style="s2">medium-sized County someplace and say</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.330" end="00:10:46.750" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna literally overrun it with</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.730" end="00:10:49.390" style="s2">bodies and simulate a pandemic and see</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.750" end="00:10:51.100" style="s2">what breaks awesome it&#39;s funny if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.390" end="00:10:52.750" style="s2">could just find a way to construct us an</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.100" end="00:10:55.480" style="s2">environment where people were empowered</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.750" end="00:10:57.970" style="s2">and incentivized to do that we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.480" end="00:10:59.380" style="s2">know making the wrong bet cause them to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.970" end="00:11:00.730" style="s2">feel some kind of negative consequence</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.380" end="00:11:02.290" style="s2">we&#39;re making the right bag gave them an</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.730" end="00:11:03.940" style="s2">asymmetric positive consequence then</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.290" end="00:11:05.230" style="s2">yeah you could absolutely see some small</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.940" end="00:11:06.670" style="s2">town going you know what we&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.230" end="00:11:07.970" style="s2">this and then those learnings would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.670" end="00:11:10.060" style="s2">at least you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.970" end="00:11:11.839" style="s2">evening for and in those early stages</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.060" end="00:11:14.300" style="s2">meaningfully more than zero as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.839" end="00:11:16.040" style="s2">significant differentiator yep that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.300" end="00:11:18.290" style="s2">where I see this complex system dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.040" end="00:11:20.089" style="s2">response unit they&#39;re the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.290" end="00:11:22.189" style="s2">gonna see it and they can basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.089" end="00:11:23.779" style="s2">bribe people into it go to a you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.189" end="00:11:24.769" style="s2">medium sized County and say hey guys</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.779" end="00:11:27.709" style="s2">we&#39;ll pay you a three million dollar</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.769" end="00:11:29.269" style="s2">bonus to participate in this we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.709" end="00:11:30.680" style="s2">spend another seven million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.269" end="00:11:33.290" style="s2">raining up a bunch of people from</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.680" end="00:11:35.269" style="s2">central castings that put ketchup all</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.290" end="00:11:37.250" style="s2">over themselves and coming out of their</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.269" end="00:11:38.899" style="s2">various orifices and we&#39;re gonna imagine</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.250" end="00:11:41.420" style="s2">that you guys have a zombie apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.899" end="00:11:43.579" style="s2">callate grade pandemic here in your</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.420" end="00:11:46.819" style="s2">County are you in right well sooner or</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.579" end="00:11:47.720" style="s2">later he&#39;s gonna say yes so it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.819" end="00:11:50.300" style="s2">interesting is you&#39;re saying that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.720" end="00:11:51.889" style="s2">it&#39;s it is somewhat well-known across</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.300" end="00:11:54.800" style="s2">the internet that there was in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.889" end="00:11:55.939" style="s2">corona virus simulation that was done at</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.800" end="00:11:57.139" style="s2">the level I think the World Health</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.939" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">Organization is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.139" end="00:12:03.290" style="s2">transnational organization not that long</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:07.009" style="s2">ago like November I believe it was yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.290" end="00:12:08.420" style="s2">so you know the key is not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.009" end="00:12:09.620" style="s2">so if there&#39;s something about that but</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.420" end="00:12:11.029" style="s2">the notion of doing that kind of an idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.620" end="00:12:12.589" style="s2">exists and the challenge I think is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.029" end="00:12:14.600" style="s2">figure out how to how to take the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.589" end="00:12:16.699" style="s2">learnings that have already been been</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.600" end="00:12:20.779" style="s2">done by organizations like the military</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.699" end="00:12:22.670" style="s2">I try to just to learn how to scale</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.779" end="00:12:23.990" style="s2">those kinds of ideas into it into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.670" end="00:12:26.569" style="s2">broader environment and what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.990" end="00:12:28.910" style="s2">there&#39;s that around about the Vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.569" end="00:12:30.920" style="s2">War we began to realize that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.910" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">fighting the Nazis anymore and that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.920" end="00:12:35.870" style="s2">nature of the field of combat had a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:37.879" style="s2">more pace of change and flexibility and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.870" end="00:12:38.959" style="s2">and by the way variants of different</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.879" end="00:12:41.389" style="s2">kinds of enemies you know getting into</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.959" end="00:12:43.399" style="s2">fourth-generation warfare and asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.389" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">warfare and so the the military just had</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.399" end="00:12:46.910" style="s2">to learn to build a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:49.970" style="s2">capacity to deal with something which in</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.910" end="00:12:51.350" style="s2">the military domain is quite similar to</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.970" end="00:12:53.059" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.350" end="00:12:55.399" style="s2">just complex systems dynamics in general</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.059" end="00:12:57.139" style="s2">because okay great</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.399" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">and then the next point is just to</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.139" end="00:13:01.939" style="s2">recognize that I mean I guess in some</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.600" end="00:13:04.100" style="s2">sense obviously now this is not esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.939" end="00:13:05.629" style="s2">and we&#39;re spending I don&#39;t know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.100" end="00:13:07.939" style="s2">what the bill on this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.629" end="00:13:10.819" style="s2">gonna be but I know it&#39;s gonna be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.939" end="00:13:13.189" style="s2">big and Julian&#39;s with the T right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.819" end="00:13:16.069" style="s2">talking yeah several T&#39;s so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.189" end="00:13:18.589" style="s2">I&#39;m saying you can afford to have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.069" end="00:13:20.480" style="s2">slush fund of some considerable size</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.589" end="00:13:21.860" style="s2">that as long as you can design it</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">fluidly and as you say was</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.860" end="00:13:26.750" style="s2">in the game and feedback dynamics it</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.079" end="00:13:29.930" style="s2">makes us shitload a sense to have a you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.750" end="00:13:33.589" style="s2">know system dynamics response team</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.930" end="00:13:35.899" style="s2">spending serious money every year doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.589" end="00:13:38.540" style="s2">war games developing capability making</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.899" end="00:13:41.240" style="s2">bets sending signals etc to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.540" end="00:13:44.630" style="s2">getting whacked for big T&#39;s right right</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.240" end="00:13:46.610" style="s2">now we shouldn&#39;t know you know under how</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.630" end="00:13:48.140" style="s2">I said this underestimated the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.610" end="00:13:49.670" style="s2">challenge of actually building something</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.140" end="00:13:50.930" style="s2">like this because of course you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.670" end="00:13:52.930" style="s2">to deal with the fact that it focuses</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.930" end="00:13:57.050" style="s2">for example in the current circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.930" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">as I think you&#39;ve tweeted there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.050" end="00:14:01.550" style="s2">series of decision points where a set of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:05.209" style="s2">interventions on the part of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.550" end="00:14:07.880" style="s2">country radically reduced the impact but</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.209" end="00:14:10.940" style="s2">the interventions have a cost and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.880" end="00:14:12.769" style="s2">information environment is is subtle and</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.940" end="00:14:15.260" style="s2">complex and so the ability to make a</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.769" end="00:14:18.079" style="s2">choice to say ok I&#39;m gonna make us a</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.260" end="00:14:19.550" style="s2">bold intervention at X costs which</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.079" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">guarantees that I&#39;ve actually made an</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.550" end="00:14:26.180" style="s2">investment at this cost and and then do</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:28.750" style="s2">not know for sure that you actually made</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.180" end="00:14:32.120" style="s2">a wise investment runs into all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.750" end="00:14:33.019" style="s2">you know political complications so as</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.120" end="00:14:36.019" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing right now how like</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.019" end="00:14:37.990" style="s2">literally we&#39;ve got a on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.019" end="00:14:39.680" style="s2">some cohort of people are saying look</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.990" end="00:14:42.649" style="s2">shut everything down</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.680" end="00:14:45.140" style="s2">quarantine everything do it for four</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.649" end="00:14:46.790" style="s2">weeks and then was it called the hammer</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.140" end="00:14:48.769" style="s2">of the dance I think that mayhem got out</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.790" end="00:14:50.360" style="s2">that was really good the hammer and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.769" end="00:14:52.070" style="s2">dance if you guys haven&#39;t read it look</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.360" end="00:14:53.180" style="s2">it up typing hammer and the dance into</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.070" end="00:14:56.690" style="s2">the Google and you&#39;ll see a damn</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.180" end="00:14:59.089" style="s2">excellent essay and and so the dance</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.690" end="00:15:00.500" style="s2">part is then okay let things open up and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.089" end="00:15:01.940" style="s2">then keep an eye on things with testing</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.500" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">and tracing all kinds of other protocols</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.940" end="00:15:06.199" style="s2">and boom you can migrate this is like an</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:07.279" style="s2">efficient frontier but of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.199" end="00:15:09.050" style="s2">gonna cost something right that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.279" end="00:15:12.310" style="s2">have real impact on the economy and on</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.050" end="00:15:14.630" style="s2">human beings it&#39;s not the you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.310" end="00:15:15.829" style="s2">unaware of that so then you get the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.630" end="00:15:18.230" style="s2">other side and by the way the other side</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.829" end="00:15:20.779" style="s2">is not batshit insane you know this this</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.230" end="00:15:22.550" style="s2">Levitt guys his models are not even</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.779" end="00:15:24.529" style="s2">vaguely unreasonable in his model say</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.550" end="00:15:26.810" style="s2">it&#39;s actually not that big a deal we</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.529" end="00:15:28.310" style="s2">just sort of sat around we you would</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.810" end="00:15:30.170" style="s2">actually see that we would be a pop and</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.310" end="00:15:31.529" style="s2">a fizzle and kind of be over and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.170" end="00:15:33.480" style="s2">you would save all that energy</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.529" end="00:15:34.620" style="s2">otherwise I put it in the economy and of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.480" end="00:15:35.879" style="s2">course there&#39;s a whole bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.620" end="00:15:37.560" style="s2">who don&#39;t want to have negative economic</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.879" end="00:15:39.749" style="s2">consequences so you&#39;ve got actually a</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.560" end="00:15:42.839" style="s2">real significant challenge that in many</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.749" end="00:15:45.480" style="s2">cases even as you can definitely do</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.839" end="00:15:47.579" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s rising up from from sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.480" end="00:15:49.819" style="s2">distributed network there are points at</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.579" end="00:15:52.110" style="s2">which choice making reaches levels we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.819" end="00:15:54.449" style="s2">having a mechanism that can resolve that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.110" end="00:15:56.490" style="s2">level of tension is how do I say</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.449" end="00:15:57.629" style="s2">decidedly non-trivial like exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.490" end="00:15:59.430" style="s2">you that is tricky now of course the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.629" end="00:16:01.170" style="s2">answer to that is an answer that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.430" end="00:16:03.149" style="s2">be tricky for us to deal with which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.170" end="00:16:04.649" style="s2">compartmentalization you know if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.149" end="00:16:06.629" style="s2">got the entire United States isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.649" end="00:16:08.579" style="s2">trained as a single object and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.629" end="00:16:10.980" style="s2">thing has to make a single choices as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.579" end="00:16:13.160" style="s2">chunk obviously what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.980" end="00:16:15.059" style="s2">we&#39;re putting more chips on that bet</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.160" end="00:16:18.029" style="s2">whereas for example in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.059" end="00:16:19.829" style="s2">Europe Italy makes one choice and Spain</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.029" end="00:16:22.319" style="s2">makes another choice and and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.829" end="00:16:24.149" style="s2">Netherlands makes another choice and two</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.319" end="00:16:26.220" style="s2">to be sure particularly the case of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.149" end="00:16:27.420" style="s2">pandemic there&#39;s contagion cross border</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.220" end="00:16:28.709" style="s2">we should be aware of it but there at</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.420" end="00:16:30.680" style="s2">least there&#39;s a decoupling so in</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.709" end="00:16:33.480" style="s2">principle that should allow there to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.680" end="00:16:35.660" style="s2">sort of heterogeneous choices and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.480" end="00:16:38.040" style="s2">an ability to basically have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.660" end="00:16:39.660" style="s2">resilience right you know you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.040" end="00:16:42.089" style="s2">mono crops instead of I mean you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.660" end="00:16:43.439" style="s2">Polly cropper sort of mono crop there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.089" end="00:16:45.660" style="s2">something to be we have to really think</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.439" end="00:16:48.990" style="s2">about how we actually construct the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.660" end="00:16:51.329" style="s2">actual network or the geometry of our</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.990" end="00:16:54.360" style="s2">choice making infrastructure so that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.329" end="00:16:56.550" style="s2">can have the capacity make these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.360" end="00:16:59.009" style="s2">of choices in a way that are don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.550" end="00:17:00.449" style="s2">create very very heavy like all at once</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.009" end="00:17:03.000" style="s2">big things that have to be made at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.449" end="00:17:04.409" style="s2">top but can actually allow larger or</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.000" end="00:17:07.049" style="s2">smaller pieces to actually make</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.409" end="00:17:08.610" style="s2">effective choices that are in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.049" end="00:17:11.100" style="s2">it may be weight weight differently that</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.610" end="00:17:13.079" style="s2">make sense yeah and this is one things</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.100" end="00:17:15.089" style="s2">is also coming clear to me is that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.079" end="00:17:18.299" style="s2">should be as a society really thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.089" end="00:17:20.520" style="s2">carefully how to build our society in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.299" end="00:17:22.589" style="s2">much more modular fashion right so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.520" end="00:17:24.539" style="s2">you go down to the county level and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.589" end="00:17:26.699" style="s2">county level has a level of resilience</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.539" end="00:17:30.149" style="s2">to be able to stand in place for 60 days</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.699" end="00:17:31.380" style="s2">right some extra warehouses etc if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.149" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">know in which case westchester county</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.380" end="00:17:34.770" style="s2">when the new rochelle thing started just</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.840" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">said all right</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.770" end="00:17:38.669" style="s2">boom westchester county is now on</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:40.440" style="s2">lockdown westchester county by the way</p>

<p begin="00:17:40.440" end="00:17:45.160" style="s2">one&#39;s going to suffer and we would have</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.570" end="00:17:47.050" style="s2">probably nipped the New York</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.160" end="00:17:48.940" style="s2">break in its bud but because the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.050" end="00:17:51.010" style="s2">Westchester County is kind of in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.940" end="00:17:52.690" style="s2">confusing fashion interwoven with New</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.010" end="00:17:54.340" style="s2">York City and everything else and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.690" end="00:17:56.710" style="s2">there&#39;s no simple way to break the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.340" end="00:17:59.140" style="s2">circuits there was no simple decision to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.710" end="00:18:01.210" style="s2">be made right so no decision was made</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.140" end="00:18:03.850" style="s2">till it was too late yeah and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.210" end="00:18:05.260" style="s2">a I think we kind of pop up above and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.850" end="00:18:07.620" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you mentioned this in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.260" end="00:18:10.270" style="s2">call right we were chatting about before</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.620" end="00:18:11.530" style="s2">if the message that certainly I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.270" end="00:18:13.750" style="s2">been sending and I think you and I both</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.530" end="00:18:16.630" style="s2">have been very much into the world and</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.750" end="00:18:19.420" style="s2">large is this is this particular crisis</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.630" end="00:18:21.190" style="s2">the the Cova 19 crisis and then the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.420" end="00:18:25.150" style="s2">financial crisis that is connected to it</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.190" end="00:18:27.430" style="s2">is a example of just the normal this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.150" end="00:18:28.660" style="s2">the world we&#39;re living in and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.430" end="00:18:30.810" style="s2">world world war you were going to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.660" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">experiencing a very large number of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.810" end="00:18:35.290" style="s2">systemic perturbations that will have</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.520" end="00:18:37.420" style="s2">characteristics of exponential</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.290" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">consequences and they&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.420" end="00:18:41.310" style="s2">characteristics of complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:43.270" style="s2">consequences where for example a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.310" end="00:18:44.620" style="s2">response of the medical level actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.270" end="00:18:49.150" style="s2">has implications in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.620" end="00:18:50.290" style="s2">unemployment lines and so we just have</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.150" end="00:18:53.110" style="s2">to we actually have just have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.290" end="00:18:55.720" style="s2">re-engineer the way that we do things as</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.110" end="00:18:56.950" style="s2">a civilization to just be adaptive to</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.720" end="00:18:59.080" style="s2">the environment that we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.950" end="00:19:00.370" style="s2">in I mean that phrase should just be</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.080" end="00:19:01.240" style="s2">obvious and then we just just look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.370" end="00:19:02.560" style="s2">the realities okay what are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.240" end="00:19:05.770" style="s2">environment we find ourselves in and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.560" end="00:19:07.200" style="s2">then you start making the moves so we</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.770" end="00:19:09.340" style="s2">want to talk about like what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:11.260" style="s2">wherever possible end States like how</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.340" end="00:19:13.360" style="s2">might this thing play out I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.260" end="00:19:15.190" style="s2">when one thing was extremely high level</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.360" end="00:19:18.700" style="s2">of confidence like damn near certitude</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.190" end="00:19:20.290" style="s2">is that it&#39;s not really a matter of if</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.700" end="00:19:21.610" style="s2">we kind of we make these sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.290" end="00:19:24.610" style="s2">changes it&#39;s a matter of when and how</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.610" end="00:19:26.770" style="s2">painful so if you kind of take the exact</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.610" end="00:19:28.270" style="s2">scenario that we&#39;re in which is if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.770" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">had just been paying attention better</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.270" end="00:19:32.080" style="s2">and we just had built the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:33.760" style="s2">respond to the signals we were getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.080" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">and made choices better choices earlier</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.760" end="00:19:36.940" style="s2">we could have saved ourselves an</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:39.220" style="s2">enormous amount of pain and enormous</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.940" end="00:19:42.670" style="s2">amount of money alright take that lesson</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.220" end="00:19:46.180" style="s2">and apply that lesson broadly where this</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.670" end="00:19:48.100" style="s2">event is the equivalent of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.180" end="00:19:50.110" style="s2">first guys who are getting sick in in</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.100" end="00:19:52.570" style="s2">China you can I can look at this event</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.110" end="00:19:54.070" style="s2">and say oh wow this kind of thing is</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.570" end="00:19:56.680" style="s2">going to begin to happen more and more</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.070" end="00:19:59.020" style="s2">and more and the longer I wait and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.680" end="00:20:00.220" style="s2">longer I stalled changing stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.020" end="00:20:02.350" style="s2">need to change to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.220" end="00:20:03.850" style="s2">responsive to reality all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.350" end="00:20:05.680" style="s2">happening is that I&#39;m delaying the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.850" end="00:20:07.780" style="s2">implications I&#39;m going and raising the</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.680" end="00:20:10.120" style="s2">stakes and eventually I will for sure</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.780" end="00:20:13.720" style="s2">change because reality has a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.120" end="00:20:15.070" style="s2">capacity to make me do what it wants so</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.720" end="00:20:16.570" style="s2">the best choice is just to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.070" end="00:20:19.710" style="s2">how to adapt to it now so you minimize</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.570" end="00:20:22.420" style="s2">the negative consequences but you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.710" end="00:20:24.190" style="s2">things are tough to sell on that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.420" end="00:20:26.980" style="s2">but of course that requires people</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.190" end="00:20:28.630" style="s2">moving from a linear essentially</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.980" end="00:20:31.600" style="s2">Newtonian approach to the world to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.630" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">true complex systems approach which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.600" end="00:20:36.760" style="s2">slowly propagating but it is by far not</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:39.700" style="s2">the norm of how even very well educated</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.760" end="00:20:41.350" style="s2">and experienced people operate yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.700" end="00:20:43.090" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure I mean it is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.350" end="00:20:45.010" style="s2">problem of course is that it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.090" end="00:20:47.530" style="s2">these things even if you hold those</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.010" end="00:20:49.480" style="s2">kinds of ideas call it cognitively you</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.530" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">have them ideas if you haven&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.480" end="00:20:55.090" style="s2">experienced them in your life then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:56.200" style="s2">hard to do but I mean fortunately in</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.090" end="00:20:57.400" style="s2">some sense everybody right now is</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.200" end="00:20:59.140" style="s2">getting some sensitive like we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.400" end="00:21:00.610" style="s2">exponential curves everybody&#39;s producing</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.140" end="00:21:02.260" style="s2">exponential curve you get into it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.610" end="00:21:03.580" style="s2">gonna watch the dots every day the dot</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.260" end="00:21:04.660" style="s2">stays on the curve and like Wow look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.580" end="00:21:07.780" style="s2">that that&#39;s what makes Mitchell curve</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.660" end="00:21:10.450" style="s2">looks like and there it is and of course</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.780" end="00:21:12.280" style="s2">by the way Ellen Musk&#39;s critique is sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.450" end="00:21:13.600" style="s2">of beautifully accurate and completely</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.280" end="00:21:14.860" style="s2">irrelevant which is that there are no</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.600" end="00:21:17.080" style="s2">exponential curves in nature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.860" end="00:21:18.700" style="s2">definitely a sigmoid well by the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.080" end="00:21:20.590" style="s2">there are things that are exponential</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.700" end="00:21:23.020" style="s2">and then collapse those are also things</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.590" end="00:21:24.790" style="s2">exist in nature but the first part of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.020" end="00:21:26.020" style="s2">the sigmoid treated as an exponential</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.790" end="00:21:27.070" style="s2">because in terms of making choices</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.020" end="00:21:29.230" style="s2">that&#39;s the way that you have to deal</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.070" end="00:21:30.940" style="s2">with it Absalom and we do not want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.230" end="00:21:33.160" style="s2">get into the top of the sigmoid here</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.940" end="00:21:35.980" style="s2">fans let&#39;s be clear about that right</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.160" end="00:21:37.570" style="s2">right so I think that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.980" end="00:21:41.410" style="s2">moral lesson is to the extent possible</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.570" end="00:21:43.840" style="s2">just recognize that the same--the of</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.410" end="00:21:45.910" style="s2">1950s and there&#39;s lots of good reasons</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.840" end="00:21:48.400" style="s2">to understand that the environment that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.910" end="00:21:49.750" style="s2">we are in many largely because of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.400" end="00:21:51.940" style="s2">world that we built right this fact that</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.750" end="00:21:53.410" style="s2">we have billions of people millions of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.940" end="00:21:55.870" style="s2">people moving every day through giant</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.410" end="00:21:57.220" style="s2">global transportation networks it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.870" end="00:21:58.990" style="s2">big reason why this thing was able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.220" end="00:22:01.930" style="s2">hit so hard and so fast and surprise to</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.990" end="00:22:05.850" style="s2">many people you know the the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.930" end="00:22:08.740" style="s2">we have increasingly networked our</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.850" end="00:22:11.710" style="s2">electronics or the power systems into</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.740" end="00:22:12.820" style="s2">cybernetic systems means that there will</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.710" end="00:22:15.029" style="s2">be a cyber event</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.820" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">of this sort at some point in the future</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.029" end="00:22:19.149" style="s2">you&#39;ll fill in the blank there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:20.950" style="s2">very large number of phenomena that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.149" end="00:22:22.809" style="s2">part of the world that we live in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.950" end="00:22:25.899" style="s2">have these kinds of characteristics and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.809" end="00:22:29.590" style="s2">so hopefully what will happen is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.899" end="00:22:31.149" style="s2">the you know the pain and the learnings</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.590" end="00:22:33.669" style="s2">the forced programs the unpleasant</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.149" end="00:22:38.230" style="s2">learnings of this particular event will</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.669" end="00:22:40.120" style="s2">lead to a choice to actually respond</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.230" end="00:22:41.860" style="s2">with long term effectiveness to actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.120" end="00:22:43.779" style="s2">say okay let&#39;s let&#39;s really do the hard</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.860" end="00:22:45.669" style="s2">work of re-engineering systems that can</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.779" end="00:22:48.000" style="s2">actually be adapted to this environment</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.669" end="00:22:50.110" style="s2">that would be a really great thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.000" end="00:22:52.529" style="s2">absolutely agree and that would be a big</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.110" end="00:22:55.690" style="s2">positive learning to take help our</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.529" end="00:22:57.610" style="s2">civilization headed a meaningfully more</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.690" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">intelligent way towards what comes next</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.610" end="00:23:01.029" style="s2">because we are going to have a whole</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.029" end="00:23:05.620" style="s2">the end of this of the century whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.159" end="00:23:08.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the backlash from climate or</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.730" end="00:23:16.840" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got to be ready to</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.340" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">something we talked about a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.450" end="00:23:28.750" style="s2">before this call which is how to start</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:32.110" style="s2">to take action and prototype in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.750" end="00:23:34.450" style="s2">area between sense makes making in</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.110" end="00:23:37.299" style="s2">small-scale action taking and large</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.450" end="00:23:39.820" style="s2">bureaucratic movements I think we talked</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.299" end="00:23:43.870" style="s2">about you know the agile philosophy as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.820" end="00:23:47.289" style="s2">way to start action prior to big</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.870" end="00:23:48.549" style="s2">bureaucratic buy-in yeah so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.289" end="00:23:50.049" style="s2">the military went through this</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.549" end="00:23:52.090" style="s2">development and built up Special</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.049" end="00:23:53.409" style="s2">Operations and then the software</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.090" end="00:23:54.490" style="s2">industry went through the same basic</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.409" end="00:23:57.580" style="s2">kind of learning curve and built up</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.490" end="00:23:59.500" style="s2">agile I mean you know this there was the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.580" end="00:24:00.759" style="s2">the waterfall technique which works</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.500" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">really good when you&#39;re building moon</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.759" end="00:24:05.159" style="s2">rockets but as the software industry</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:07.990" style="s2">began to deal with the reality that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.159" end="00:24:09.820" style="s2">landscape was changing rapidly and there</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.990" end="00:24:11.980" style="s2">was great difficult to actually know</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.820" end="00:24:13.720" style="s2">what what the end state was going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.980" end="00:24:15.070" style="s2">look like they had to change the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.720" end="00:24:17.230" style="s2">development methodologies to use this</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.070" end="00:24:19.570" style="s2">thing called agile which basically meant</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.230" end="00:24:20.799" style="s2">that you you built something and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.570" end="00:24:22.090" style="s2">you saw what happened then you build</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.799" end="00:24:23.169" style="s2">more and then you saw what happens you</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.090" end="00:24:24.820" style="s2">build more you kind of built an</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.169" end="00:24:26.300" style="s2">iterative feedback but that included you</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.820" end="00:24:31.430" style="s2">basically built a tighter</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.300" end="00:24:33.320" style="s2">Suda Luke we know that language and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.430" end="00:24:34.700" style="s2">can talk I mean I say I tend to go more</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.320" end="00:24:36.740" style="s2">theoretical but you&#39;re talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.700" end="00:24:40.010" style="s2">in terms of practicality and if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.740" end="00:24:43.700" style="s2">think about the same basic mechanism of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.010" end="00:24:45.680" style="s2">the powering people to respond quickly</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.700" end="00:24:48.260" style="s2">you can also think about your response</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.680" end="00:24:51.050" style="s2">capacity could be using a lot of agile</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.260" end="00:24:52.040" style="s2">methodology it&#39;s actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.050" end="00:24:52.910" style="s2">interesting to contemplate what that</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.040" end="00:24:54.770" style="s2">would look like and how that would</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.910" end="00:24:55.700" style="s2">empower people particularly now that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.770" end="00:24:57.860" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about things like ubi</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.700" end="00:25:00.290" style="s2">going from insane and management that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.860" end="00:25:03.710" style="s2">crazy like you and I were like in like</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.290" end="00:25:05.150" style="s2">10 years ago we&#39;re saying this needed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.710" end="00:25:07.370" style="s2">happen universal basic income needed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.150" end="00:25:09.440" style="s2">happen and I think we were pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.370" end="00:25:11.300" style="s2">left out of the room and then Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.440" end="00:25:13.700" style="s2">yang he&#39;s kind of left out of the room</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.300" end="00:25:15.620" style="s2">three months ago and I think everybody</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.700" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">right now is only only dickering on how</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.620" end="00:25:20.330" style="s2">much and how long and how to implement</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:21.530" style="s2">it&#39;s quite remarkable yeah by the way</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.330" end="00:25:22.580" style="s2">just just what I&#39;m saying is that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.530" end="00:25:24.580" style="s2">could actually imagine that imagine</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.580" end="00:25:28.610" style="s2">universal basic income is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.580" end="00:25:31.370" style="s2">conceptualized as a standing reserve of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.610" end="00:25:35.030" style="s2">people&#39;s time focused on this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.370" end="00:25:36.380" style="s2">like general purpose decentralized sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.030" end="00:25:38.630" style="s2">making and choice making where you</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.380" end="00:25:41.000" style="s2">actually could have makers people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.630" end="00:25:42.530" style="s2">are making mechanical capacity could be</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.000" end="00:25:44.420" style="s2">looking what&#39;s going on and say oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.530" end="00:25:47.420" style="s2">actually gonna spin up a project group</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.420" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">focus on being able to fabricate and 100</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.420" end="00:25:51.260" style="s2">masks because as I&#39;m seeing the data its</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:54.560" style="s2">timing the n95 masks aren&#39;t actually a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.260" end="00:25:56.660" style="s2">very good idea and you know and you get</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.560" end="00:25:58.370" style="s2">a tiny little micro fabrication facility</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.660" end="00:26:01.220" style="s2">it&#39;s able to prototype something small</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.370" end="00:26:03.110" style="s2">and but if it works then again you the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.220" end="00:26:03.530" style="s2">ability to scale ideas is actually very</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.110" end="00:26:05.630" style="s2">easy</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.530" end="00:26:07.970" style="s2">yep and having that communications link</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.630" end="00:26:10.100" style="s2">to share I&#39;ll give an example our local</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.970" end="00:26:13.580" style="s2">Staunton makerspace is already working</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.100" end="00:26:16.820" style="s2">on prototypes for shields to go over</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.580" end="00:26:19.130" style="s2">masks that they&#39;ll last longer it can be</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.820" end="00:26:21.350" style="s2">3d printed somebody up in the DC area</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.130" end="00:26:23.060" style="s2">designed it unfortunately they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.350" end="00:26:25.400" style="s2">post the design publicly they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.060" end="00:26:27.590" style="s2">require you to go and ask permission but</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.400" end="00:26:30.110" style="s2">our people have and gotten the got in</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.590" end="00:26:31.610" style="s2">the file hopefully this file will once</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.110" end="00:26:33.800" style="s2">it&#39;s vetted will get out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.610" end="00:26:35.330" style="s2">and maker spaces all over the world can</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.800" end="00:26:37.340" style="s2">start building these things giving them</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.330" end="00:26:39.770" style="s2">the hospitals that will triple or</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.340" end="00:26:40.010" style="s2">quadruple the use for life of their of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.770" end="00:26:43.850" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.010" end="00:26:48.350" style="s2">masks mm-hmm yeah and you know it ends</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.850" end="00:26:50.150" style="s2">up with a it&#39;s a very different topology</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.350" end="00:26:51.890" style="s2">but you said something that thing&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.150" end="00:26:55.070" style="s2">important is the communication channels</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.890" end="00:26:56.900" style="s2">the the ability to have open comms so</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.070" end="00:27:00.710" style="s2">that good ideas actually can be</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.900" end="00:27:04.130" style="s2">perceived and flow not closed Tom&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.710" end="00:27:07.280" style="s2">then give this ability for people to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.130" end="00:27:08.630" style="s2">identify good ideas and upregulate those</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.280" end="00:27:09.980" style="s2">ideas and this is very much like Dave</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.630" end="00:27:13.310" style="s2">snowden&#39;s point that&#39;s how you operate</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.980" end="00:27:15.140" style="s2">in complexity is there&#39;s never an</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.310" end="00:27:16.430" style="s2">endpoint you&#39;re always moving away</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.140" end="00:27:19.610" style="s2">because the system is always changing</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.430" end="00:27:21.410" style="s2">and your basic choice is you know more</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.610" end="00:27:23.330" style="s2">of this and less of this your cost of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.410" end="00:27:24.890" style="s2">moving through an environment of up</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.330" end="00:27:27.470" style="s2">regulating certain things and down</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.890" end="00:27:30.740" style="s2">regulating certain things and you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.470" end="00:27:33.410" style="s2">building an overall system at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.740" end="00:27:35.300" style="s2">economic and at the sensing level that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.410" end="00:27:37.970" style="s2">has that kind of a characteristic to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.300" end="00:27:40.400" style="s2">is is the story right that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.970" end="00:27:41.630" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to figure out and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.400" end="00:27:43.400" style="s2">look like this is the thing if it</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.630" end="00:27:46.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t we have to work like punctuated</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.400" end="00:27:47.570" style="s2">equilibrium almost everything we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.130" end="00:27:50.420" style="s2">building right now is a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.570" end="00:27:53.270" style="s2">1950s and sort of 70s</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.420" end="00:27:54.980" style="s2">Eirik Lujan&#39;s and then like this little</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.270" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">eruption that happened in software this</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.980" end="00:27:59.540" style="s2">tried to figure out how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:28:01.610" style="s2">operate in a non 1970s way but</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.540" end="00:28:02.750" style="s2">nonetheless still doesn&#39;t fully operate</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.610" end="00:28:04.550" style="s2">the way that it naturally knows how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.750" end="00:28:06.830" style="s2">be yep had a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.550" end="00:28:09.770" style="s2">conversation on the podcast with Dan</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.830" end="00:28:12.530" style="s2">mezack who&#39;s trying his damndest to put</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.770" end="00:28:14.690" style="s2">agile into big corporations and here it</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.530" end="00:28:16.520" style="s2">is 2020 and I was horrified how little</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.690" end="00:28:18.440" style="s2">progress they&#39;re making right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.520" end="00:28:20.270" style="s2">happening but very very slowly as you</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.440" end="00:28:22.730" style="s2">say most of the world it might as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.270" end="00:28:24.500" style="s2">still be 1975 I imagine you&#39;ve looked in</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.730" end="00:28:26.570" style="s2">the government to be even worse yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.500" end="00:28:28.940" style="s2">well I happen to know the IRS is still</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.570" end="00:28:30.770" style="s2">using what is it COBOL for running their</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.940" end="00:28:33.430" style="s2">entire software system some sort of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.770" end="00:28:35.900" style="s2">I think it is COBOL 1950s vintage</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.430" end="00:28:37.940" style="s2">language absolutely well let&#39;s go to one</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.900" end="00:28:40.100" style="s2">last topic before we wrap up here I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.940" end="00:28:42.530" style="s2">these extra podcasts are aimed to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.100" end="00:28:44.210" style="s2">short and that is one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.530" end="00:28:46.250" style="s2">seems to be lacking in our national</p>

<p begin="00:29:14.629" end="00:29:18.649" style="s2">so that we could have a truly</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.899" end="00:29:54.649" style="s2">systemic risks yeah I think the answer</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.249" end="00:29:56.239" style="s2">is yes I don&#39;t think it&#39;s trivial but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.649" end="00:29:58.519" style="s2">think it&#39;s yes so let&#39;s just you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.239" end="00:30:01.219" style="s2">try to make it somewhat concrete all</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.519" end="00:30:03.320" style="s2">right so imagine this imagine and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.219" end="00:30:05.109" style="s2">isn&#39;t by the way none of this is in some</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.320" end="00:30:09.559" style="s2">sense hard so imagine if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.109" end="00:30:11.779" style="s2">database that had everybody in it and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.559" end="00:30:14.049" style="s2">had a mapping of kind of all of their</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.779" end="00:30:16.609" style="s2">skills and maybe a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.049" end="00:30:19.609" style="s2">psychological profiles like the way the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.609" end="00:30:23.119" style="s2">way they think and then you also had</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.609" end="00:30:24.259" style="s2">some you know your the affirmations sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.119" end="00:30:25.849" style="s2">of sense that that group is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.259" end="00:30:28.179" style="s2">sensing things right so looking around</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.849" end="00:30:31.669" style="s2">seeing stuff and there was a way to</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.179" end="00:30:35.079" style="s2">escalate the sensing to the point you</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.669" end="00:30:37.399" style="s2">could activate a much more intense</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.079" end="00:30:38.929" style="s2">investigation it&#39;s kind of like you</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.399" end="00:30:40.489" style="s2">think if you do a model like the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.929" end="00:30:41.539" style="s2">that you actually know this is you build</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.489" end="00:30:43.609" style="s2">this off for a model of but the way the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.539" end="00:30:46.279" style="s2">the human brain actually runs attention</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.609" end="00:30:48.049" style="s2">right there&#39;s there&#39;s peripheral</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.279" end="00:30:49.940" style="s2">attention we&#39;re for the paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.049" end="00:30:51.829" style="s2">broadly and diffusely to lots and lots</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.940" end="00:30:53.119" style="s2">of things and then there&#39;s a way for</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.829" end="00:30:54.619" style="s2">there to be a phase transition we</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.119" end="00:30:55.820" style="s2">actually get very focused attention what</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.619" end="00:30:57.889" style="s2">was that right you hear a crack over</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.820" end="00:30:59.779" style="s2">there and also the entire system</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.889" end="00:31:01.969" style="s2">allocates resources to pay very focused</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.779" end="00:31:02.959" style="s2">attention to that problem so imagine if</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.969" end="00:31:04.639" style="s2">you had that right we could actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.959" end="00:31:06.630" style="s2">have something with diffused attention</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.639" end="00:31:08.130" style="s2">of our decentralized environment is or</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.630" end="00:31:09.270" style="s2">into orienting orienting and then it</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.130" end="00:31:12.180" style="s2">would a certain amount of energy is</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.270" end="00:31:15.270" style="s2">pointed to something it pops and you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.180" end="00:31:16.920" style="s2">then do you push a button and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.270" end="00:31:18.740" style="s2">the right expert the right people of</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.920" end="00:31:21.090" style="s2">competence around the problem domain</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.740" end="00:31:22.920" style="s2">swarm to the problem to maybe get like</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.090" end="00:31:24.690" style="s2">thirty distinct working groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.920" end="00:31:26.310" style="s2">all looking at it and all of their</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.690" end="00:31:28.500" style="s2">outputs are kind of put into a general</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.310" end="00:31:30.360" style="s2">location so you actually get this as a</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.500" end="00:31:31.440" style="s2">Bayesian distribution of distinct</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.360" end="00:31:34.740" style="s2">respect for these different working</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.440" end="00:31:35.820" style="s2">groups and by the way I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.740" end="00:31:37.380" style="s2">actually problem probably want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.820" end="00:31:39.240" style="s2">iterate that two or three times just to</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.380" end="00:31:41.430" style="s2">say that you take the output of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.240" end="00:31:43.230" style="s2">first process take all of that make that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.430" end="00:31:44.640" style="s2">the input of an iterative of the process</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.230" end="00:31:45.690" style="s2">you have to do it&#39;s entirely new groups</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.640" end="00:31:46.920" style="s2">where you scramble the groups you</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.690" end="00:31:49.140" style="s2">actually have a really powerful model</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.920" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">for actually shifting cognitive bias and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.140" end="00:31:52.500" style="s2">groupthink and stuff like that but my</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:54.780" style="s2">guess is that you could probably build</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.500" end="00:31:56.430" style="s2">something like that that could do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.780" end="00:31:58.110" style="s2">know two or three iterations and not</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.430" end="00:32:01.650" style="s2">that long like a period of like a week</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.110" end="00:32:03.570" style="s2">with 40 or 50 people and you could get</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.650" end="00:32:04.860" style="s2">to like an 80th percentile of what our</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.570" end="00:32:07.260" style="s2">collective and intelligence where our</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.860" end="00:32:10.950" style="s2">capacities a population has to be able</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.260" end="00:32:12.360" style="s2">to make sense of that event and at a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.950" end="00:32:13.790" style="s2">very high level like a radically higher</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.360" end="00:32:15.660" style="s2">level than we&#39;re capable of right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.790" end="00:32:16.860" style="s2">you know through all the important</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.660" end="00:32:18.210" style="s2">questions that we don&#39;t know the answers</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.860" end="00:32:19.830" style="s2">to if we want to ask if we have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.210" end="00:32:21.510" style="s2">of expand this thing and so it&#39;d be like</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.830" end="00:32:22.680" style="s2">a phase transition from the diffuse</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.510" end="00:32:24.390" style="s2">environment to a very concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.680" end="00:32:26.010" style="s2">environment which could then have</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.390" end="00:32:27.240" style="s2">another phase transition or or</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.010" end="00:32:30.030" style="s2">de-escalation and the de-escalation</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.240" end="00:32:31.200" style="s2">would be as far as we can tell rental</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.030" end="00:32:32.970" style="s2">and now the red alert you heard the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.200" end="00:32:36.210" style="s2">crack you look over it&#39;s not a tiger</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.970" end="00:32:38.340" style="s2">keep going or okay actually need to pay</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.210" end="00:32:39.660" style="s2">more attention it uh or is it the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.340" end="00:32:40.860" style="s2">parasympathetic prepares to pathetic</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.660" end="00:32:42.300" style="s2">nervous system which is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.860" end="00:32:44.520" style="s2">I can always forget cuz the naming</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.300" end="00:32:45.930" style="s2">always trigger yeah yeah get your knee</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.520" end="00:32:48.120" style="s2">and their leg twitches that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.930" end="00:32:49.920" style="s2">parasympathetic nervous system with one</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.120" end="00:32:52.410" style="s2">that triggers arousal this is why I keep</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.920" end="00:32:55.380" style="s2">Daniel around well arousal would be deep</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.410" end="00:32:57.480" style="s2">in the limbic brain now it&#39;s just one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.380" end="00:32:59.490" style="s2">those two systems and I look over I</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.480" end="00:33:01.470" style="s2">focused my attention and then I actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.490" end="00:33:04.070" style="s2">get more pattern recognition at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.470" end="00:33:06.300" style="s2">event that I&#39;m looking at is a real</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.070" end="00:33:07.710" style="s2">situation and then when I get is of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.300" end="00:33:09.750" style="s2">course at the biological level I get a</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.710" end="00:33:11.010" style="s2">much higher level rasa link which</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.750" end="00:33:12.540" style="s2">includes the activation of the limbic</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.010" end="00:33:15.060" style="s2">system when I start seeing adrenaline I</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.540" end="00:33:16.470" style="s2">have a higher respiratory rate and a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.060" end="00:33:17.910" style="s2">substantially large amount of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.470" end="00:33:19.680" style="s2">neurological resources are focused on</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.910" end="00:33:20.179" style="s2">what the is that right so now that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.680" end="00:33:21.889" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.179" end="00:33:23.539" style="s2">rgeous system is now poised to really</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.889" end="00:33:25.850" style="s2">orient its attention and now</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.539" end="00:33:28.129" style="s2">increasingly as you say at that point if</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.850" end="00:33:29.570" style="s2">my focused attention working group</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.129" end="00:33:31.580" style="s2">started throwing out signals that this</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.570" end="00:33:33.889" style="s2">is important then my distributed</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.580" end="00:33:35.240" style="s2">actuation potential guys are going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.889" end="00:33:36.740" style="s2">take a look at that and say oh better</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.240" end="00:33:38.659" style="s2">pay attention now I&#39;ve got my makers</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.740" end="00:33:40.220" style="s2">working on building masks I&#39;ve got you</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.659" end="00:33:41.570" style="s2">know hospitals are starting to gear up</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.220" end="00:33:43.909" style="s2">like that&#39;s a mechanism that can</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.570" end="00:33:46.279" style="s2">actually have a nice feedback loop so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.909" end="00:33:47.990" style="s2">think the answer is yes I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.279" end="00:33:49.909" style="s2">looks like Apollo but I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.990" end="00:33:52.009" style="s2">can take a lot of the learnings of what</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.909" end="00:33:53.690" style="s2">they did at an abstract level and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.009" end="00:33:54.980" style="s2">say okay topologically how can we</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.690" end="00:33:56.749" style="s2">actually replicate that using</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.980" end="00:33:59.450" style="s2">contemporary tools to do something that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.749" end="00:34:01.669" style="s2">is well functionally equivalent to what</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.450" end="00:34:03.980" style="s2">they did but is simultaneously able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.669" end="00:34:06.200" style="s2">use the whole of the population is able</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.980" end="00:34:07.999" style="s2">to operate as Lightspeed and is able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.200" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">do so in the context of an arbitrarily</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.999" end="00:34:12.470" style="s2">large number of possible threat domains</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:14.450" style="s2">and at an arbitrary scale and of course</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.470" end="00:34:15.619" style="s2">arbitrary scale doesn&#39;t mean always the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.450" end="00:34:18.290" style="s2">largest because these things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.619" end="00:34:20.690" style="s2">always going to be this big but there</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.290" end="00:34:22.669" style="s2">will be other ugly things right if for</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.690" end="00:34:24.319" style="s2">instance SARS was handled right that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.669" end="00:34:26.450" style="s2">did bottle that up but there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.319" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">something between SARS and this so this</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.450" end="00:34:31.220" style="s2">thing needs to be agile with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.879" end="00:34:33.649" style="s2">its allocation of resources to be a bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.220" end="00:34:36.490" style="s2">ahead of the curve never behind it but</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.649" end="00:34:38.869" style="s2">no when did to absolutely deescalate</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.490" end="00:34:40.940" style="s2">exactly I think we got a great design</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.869" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">very very high level functional</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.940" end="00:34:47.720" style="s2">specification there get some whiteboards</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:49.040" style="s2">it gets got damp down to it yeah well my</p>

<p begin="00:35:27.200" end="00:35:30.859" style="s2">our vision much wider and taking a look</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.420" end="00:35:32.930" style="s2">at the whole set of choices that are</p>
