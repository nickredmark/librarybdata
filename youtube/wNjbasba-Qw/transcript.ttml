<p begin="00:00:15.093" end="00:00:16.713" style="s2"> Let&#39;s go directly to the topic</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.713" end="00:00:18.825" style="s2"> I also like this story</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.164" end="00:00:23.616" style="s2"> Stories about Noah&#39;s Flood and the Tower of Babel</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.977" end="00:00:27.005" style="s2"> It is as interesting as other stories in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.181" end="00:00:29.233" style="s2"> The Tower of Babel is one of these stories</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.384" end="00:00:30.323" style="s2"> Like the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.323" end="00:00:32.104" style="s2"> Only a few sentences</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.317" end="00:00:33.725" style="s2"> In a way, the story of the Tower of Babel is just a fragment</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.768" end="00:00:37.442" style="s2"> Although Noah’s story is very complete</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.622" end="00:00:41.188" style="s2"> But like the stories we told before</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.536" end="00:00:46.324" style="s2"> We can analyze this story from multiple levels at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.077" end="00:00:49.972" style="s2"> So what I will do next</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.064" end="00:00:54.112" style="s2"> Start with some background knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.452" end="00:00:56.692" style="s2"> Some background knowledge of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.692" end="00:00:58.932" style="s2"> Only those knowledge stories are meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.686" end="00:01:03.604" style="s2"> The first thing I want to talk about is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.334" end="00:01:10.589" style="s2"> You are born with a priori perception structure</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.440" end="00:01:13.549" style="s2"> This is actually a realized structure</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.549" end="00:01:16.989" style="s2"> Is human beings 3.5 billion years</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.989" end="00:01:19.421" style="s2"> The result of always trying to integrate my body</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.421" end="00:01:23.069" style="s2"> Such a long time not only changed your body</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.069" end="00:01:24.405" style="s2"> Also changed your mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.405" end="00:01:26.659" style="s2"> Mind is part of body</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.659" end="00:01:28.451" style="s2"> And closely attached to it</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:31.660" style="s2"> You tend to think that the brain is in your head</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.773" end="00:01:34.397" style="s2"> And it seems to be independent of the rest of the body</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.397" end="00:01:36.317" style="s2"> this is not right</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.317" end="00:01:39.906" style="s2"> You have a large and complex</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.002" end="00:01:43.204" style="s2"> The neuron system operates throughout your body</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.204" end="00:01:43.229" style="s2"> The neuron system operates throughout your body</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.229" end="00:01:46.764" style="s2"> Neurons in the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.764" end="00:01:48.691" style="s2"> More neurons than in the central nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.691" end="00:01:49.610" style="s2"> There are a lot of neurons</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.417" end="00:01:52.646" style="s2"> Your central nervous system allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.027" end="00:01:55.803" style="s2"> Exercise your ability to spontaneously control your own muscle tissue</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.242" end="00:01:58.342" style="s2"> Can also receive feedback from muscle tissue</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.342" end="00:02:00.198" style="s2"> The role of the brain is actually all over your body</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.949" end="00:02:03.006" style="s2"> What you may not know is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.006" end="00:02:04.968" style="s2"> If you put the paraplegic patient on the treadmill to stabilize</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.968" end="00:02:07.366" style="s2"> They can actually walk</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.494" end="00:02:10.735" style="s2"> Their legs can move involuntarily controlled</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.085" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2"> Your spine can do such complex actions</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:15.407" style="s2"> Actually when you walk</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.803" end="00:02:16.582" style="s2"> It controls your feet up and down</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.646" end="00:02:18.580" style="s2"> In most cases</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.448" end="00:02:23.601" style="s2"> So what I mean by this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.676" end="00:02:27.139" style="s2"> Bluntly</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.745" end="00:02:29.248" style="s2"> You don’t have a sense of leaving a blank space</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.248" end="00:02:32.134" style="s2"> Understand the world as something independent of its own manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.714" end="00:02:34.886" style="s2"> This kind of consciousness does not exist</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.886" end="00:02:37.776" style="s2"> You have a built-in interpretation system</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.776" end="00:02:41.606" style="s2"> This is an unusually deep-rooted and imperceptible system</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.606" end="00:02:43.206" style="s2"> Because you will treat this system as</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.206" end="00:02:45.501" style="s2"> Hidden part of one&#39;s own subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.606" end="00:02:48.924" style="s2"> This system leads to your conscious experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.728" end="00:02:51.334" style="s2"> It determines what kind of person you are in the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.334" end="00:02:53.062" style="s2"> This is one of the ways to look at this system</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.062" end="00:02:54.342" style="s2"> This is a very good way to understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.342" end="00:02:56.454" style="s2"> Psychoanalysis is understood like this</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.805" end="00:03:00.271" style="s2"> This is also understood in neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.271" end="00:03:03.238" style="s2"> Something very interesting about modern neuroscientists</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.238" end="00:03:04.646" style="s2"> Especially among the top neuroscientists and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.646" end="00:03:06.694" style="s2"> Among the neuroscientists involved in emotion research</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.694" end="00:03:08.110" style="s2"> as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.820" end="00:03:13.298" style="s2"> They are often obsessed with psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.298" end="00:03:15.449" style="s2"> Jacques Panksepp is a good example</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.346" end="00:03:20.292" style="s2"> They agree with the claims of psychoanalysts</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.482" end="00:03:24.230" style="s2"> Think the lower subconscious and anthropomorphic motivation</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.230" end="00:03:27.110" style="s2"> Actually accurately reflects how the brain is active</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.620" end="00:03:29.989" style="s2"> So you can think of yourself as a loose collection</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.845" end="00:03:31.524" style="s2"> This collection is made up of autonomous souls</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.743" end="00:03:35.521" style="s2"> They are controlled by some primary personality</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.521" end="00:03:37.094" style="s2"> This is a reasonable way to understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.413" end="00:03:42.484" style="s2"> Then the problem is coming</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.849" end="00:03:49.791" style="s2"> What is the nature of the transcendental structure you used to explain the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.208" end="00:03:53.695" style="s2"> I think the clearest answer is &quot;it is a story&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.460" end="00:03:56.033" style="s2"> Because you live in the story</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.576" end="00:03:58.350" style="s2"> I think this view is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.350" end="00:04:01.127" style="s2"> Because i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.419" end="00:04:04.715" style="s2"> Actually I have some videos that also illustrate this point</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.715" end="00:04:09.258" style="s2"> I think Darwin’s hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.847" end="00:04:13.935" style="s2"> At least as basic as Newton’s hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.039" end="00:04:15.970" style="s2"> Actually I think Darwin’s hypothesis is more basic</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.776" end="00:04:21.002" style="s2"> We have evolved a story structure</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.210" end="00:04:22.776" style="s2"> And use it to explain the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.455" end="00:04:24.311" style="s2"> For me</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.311" end="00:04:27.954" style="s2"> Story-based cognitive structure contains deeper truth</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.517" end="00:04:29.060" style="s2"> They are all true</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.060" end="00:04:32.547" style="s2"> At least since we developed these structures</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.766" end="00:04:34.707" style="s2"> This means we are still alive here</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.051" end="00:04:38.059" style="s2"> It took us 350 million years to develop these story structures</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.194" end="00:04:39.467" style="s2"> They are highly functional</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.294" end="00:04:44.405" style="s2"> There is no better definition of truth than highly functional</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.770" end="00:04:46.699" style="s2"> That&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.699" end="00:04:49.067" style="s2"> Partly because we are limitless creatures</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.540" end="00:04:51.346" style="s2"> We can&#39;t know everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.972" end="00:04:54.154" style="s2"> Generally speaking, the limit we can do with knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.154" end="00:04:57.771" style="s2"> Is the function of recording things</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.771" end="00:04:59.819" style="s2"> Then improve it when it works abnormally</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.819" end="00:05:02.619" style="s2"> I think the scientific method is doing this</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.619" end="00:05:06.283" style="s2"> We gradually developed such a story structure</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.347" end="00:05:07.755" style="s2"> And use it to explain the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.162" end="00:05:09.258" style="s2"> This thing is so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.258" end="00:05:11.064" style="s2"> What it describes is the basic essence of the story</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:14.071" style="s2"> However, it is also strange that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.728" end="00:05:17.163" style="s2"> We have knowledge of the known and the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.163" end="00:05:18.309" style="s2"> Clear division of labor in the left and right hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.705" end="00:05:19.895" style="s2"> Or the cognition of chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.459" end="00:05:22.661" style="s2"> Sorry to say that order and chaos will be treated separately</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.954" end="00:05:25.803" style="s2"> This also reveals some basic nature of the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.803" end="00:05:27.891" style="s2"> If you assume that we have evolved to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.891" end="00:05:30.475" style="s2"> Can reflect the structure of the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.475" end="00:05:31.618" style="s2"> Generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.618" end="00:05:34.822" style="s2"> Obviously this is not just a physical structure</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.822" end="00:05:36.427" style="s2"> Matter particles like atoms and molecules</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.701" end="00:05:40.651" style="s2"> It’s formed by matter particles over time</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.651" end="00:05:44.227" style="s2"> The increasingly complex structure and all its performance modes</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.572" end="00:05:46.221" style="s2"> This includes human interaction</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.014" end="00:05:47.807" style="s2"> Political interaction</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.943" end="00:05:49.279" style="s2"> Economic interaction</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.419" end="00:05:50.891" style="s2"> Interactions in the family</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.891" end="00:05:55.115" style="s2"> These are important parts of our reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.115" end="00:05:55.970" style="s2"> But maybe in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.970" end="00:05:59.300" style="s2"> They are not what physicists are concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.425" end="00:06:00.939" style="s2"> Something as basic as physical properties</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.492" end="00:06:02.547" style="s2"> We live in the story</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.073" end="00:06:08.643" style="s2"> I want to say more about the story and its structure</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.352" end="00:06:12.536" style="s2"> When you understand a little bit of the structure of the story</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.006" end="00:06:15.800" style="s2"> Then this whole set of myths</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.800" end="00:06:18.424" style="s2"> Suddenly everything makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.424" end="00:06:19.666" style="s2"> This is very useful</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.219" end="00:06:23.225" style="s2"> What you can see is</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.225" end="00:06:27.776" style="s2"> Many daily events in everyone’s life</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.820" end="00:06:32.888" style="s2"> Are generally described in mythology</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.549" end="00:06:34.616" style="s2"> This helped us a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.822" end="00:06:37.390" style="s2"> First of all it makes you no longer isolated from the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.828" end="00:06:40.772" style="s2"> I realized one thing while studying clinical psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.357" end="00:06:44.472" style="s2"> This is contrary to the view of antipsychiatrists</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.812" end="00:06:48.376" style="s2"> That is, diagnosis is often a relief for the visitor</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.248" end="00:06:50.680" style="s2"> There was a problem when the patient was diagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.808" end="00:06:52.024" style="s2"> Because you might be labeled</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.024" end="00:06:54.029" style="s2"> And this label may follow you for life</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.561" end="00:06:56.760" style="s2"> Once you have been tagged</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.760" end="00:06:58.914" style="s2"> A lot of strange things happen around you</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.352" end="00:07:01.054" style="s2"> These things usually reinforce that label</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.367" end="00:07:03.016" style="s2"> Maybe you will show it more through action</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.016" end="00:07:04.238" style="s2"> Or you will internalize it as your own identity</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.718" end="00:07:05.782" style="s2"> There is another situation</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.782" end="00:07:08.856" style="s2"> This is what you said in the mouth of a doctor or a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.856" end="00:07:12.098" style="s2"> The last words to hear</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.494" end="00:07:15.605" style="s2"> It’s &quot;I’ve never seen a situation like you.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.795" end="00:07:17.129" style="s2"> Yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.129" end="00:07:18.674" style="s2"> This is not a relief</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.164" end="00:07:21.064" style="s2"> If the doctor gave you the information</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.064" end="00:07:24.843" style="s2"> &quot;I have never heard of anything similar to what you are talking about.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.146" end="00:07:27.505" style="s2"> The result of saying this may be of little benefit to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.736" end="00:07:29.415" style="s2"> Or you don’t want to listen anymore</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.739" end="00:07:34.530" style="s2"> Because in their eyes you are a disturbing vision</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.654" end="00:07:37.272" style="s2"> In the eyes of these people with professional medical knowledge, you are a monster</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.272" end="00:07:39.384" style="s2"> But you are still trying to ask them for advice</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.718" end="00:07:41.242" style="s2"> It is true</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.576" end="00:07:44.312" style="s2"> As long as you can be classified into one category</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.312" end="00:07:48.152" style="s2"> The doctor will know how to treat you</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.152" end="00:07:49.843" style="s2"> This is actually a relief for the doctor</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.264" end="00:07:51.878" style="s2"> It&#39;s the same for you, right</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.068" end="00:07:54.029" style="s2"> Think about it when you go to the doctor and say</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.029" end="00:07:56.482" style="s2"> &quot;Oh, I can&#39;t get out of the house anymore&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.847" end="00:07:58.058" style="s2"> &quot;I&#39;m afraid of taking the elevator.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.684" end="00:08:00.568" style="s2"> &quot;I get heart palpitations when I take the elevator.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.568" end="00:08:02.567" style="s2"> &quot;Sometimes I was sent to the emergency room.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.901" end="00:08:06.972" style="s2"> &quot;My range of activities in life is constantly restricted&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.972" end="00:08:08.632" style="s2"> &quot;I can only stay at home&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.830" end="00:08:10.302" style="s2"> &quot;I am afraid that I will die of a heart attack.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.668" end="00:08:12.244" style="s2"> The psychologist will say</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.536" end="00:08:13.799" style="s2"> &quot;You have a fear of heights&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.264" end="00:08:15.928" style="s2"> &quot;Many people have a fear of heights.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.524" end="00:08:17.848" style="s2"> &quot;This is how it usually comes out&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.848" end="00:08:19.258" style="s2"> &quot;These are treatment options.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.592" end="00:08:21.816" style="s2"> &quot;We have some ways to treat it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.006" end="00:08:25.845" style="s2"> &quot;You should not die from a heart attack for the time being&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.976" end="00:08:26.972" style="s2"> Then this is a relief</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.286" end="00:08:30.062" style="s2"> &quot;You are not crazy like no other in the world.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.456" end="00:08:33.987" style="s2"> &quot;You still have medicine to save&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.321" end="00:08:35.407" style="s2"> This is a huge relief</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.595" end="00:08:39.739" style="s2"> People take a brood of worried snakes to the doctor</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.739" end="00:08:42.014" style="s2"> And when they left there was only one snake left to handle</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.014" end="00:08:43.037" style="s2"> Although it is still a snake</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.037" end="00:08:47.077" style="s2"> But the handleable snake is much better than the Hydra</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.179" end="00:08:52.171" style="s2"> Back to the story itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.559" end="00:09:07.808" style="s2"> The stories we tell and the stories we live in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.695" end="00:09:12.995" style="s2"> Is our basic way of dealing with the complexity of the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.799" end="00:09:16.033" style="s2"> in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.348" end="00:09:18.319" style="s2"> Basic problems of the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.444" end="00:09:21.964" style="s2"> It&#39;s not only that it&#39;s too complicated to understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.286" end="00:09:24.927" style="s2"> And this complexity will become unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.578" end="00:09:29.436" style="s2"> This is actually a Darwinian dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.229" end="00:09:31.691" style="s2"> This is why Darwinism looks</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.691" end="00:09:36.002" style="s2"> There is a practical necessity on the issue of continuing life</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.077" end="00:09:40.020" style="s2"> Complexity is always changing in unpredictable ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.502" end="00:09:42.306" style="s2"> And you may not be able to figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.306" end="00:09:43.423" style="s2"> What will work in the future</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.666" end="00:09:46.326" style="s2"> According to the Darwinian solution process is this</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.326" end="00:09:50.094" style="s2"> First produce almost random variants</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.094" end="00:09:53.430" style="s2"> And then make any one of them can accidentally</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.430" end="00:09:55.699" style="s2"> Happens to survive in the environment</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.137" end="00:09:58.914" style="s2"> To be precise it is not random</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.914" end="00:10:02.755" style="s2"> Because the hidden structure has always been conserved</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.755" end="00:10:05.720" style="s2"> The child is born with an extra arm or something similar</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.720" end="00:10:06.597" style="s2"> Are rare</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.035" end="00:10:09.300" style="s2"> The bone structure of your body in the history of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:14.289" style="s2"> Can be traced back to animals long ago</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.289" end="00:10:17.995" style="s2"> There are many things that have been conserved during evolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.423" end="00:10:21.357" style="s2"> There are some changes within the conservative, just like music</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.600" end="00:10:23.528" style="s2"> Music is a good example of understanding this change</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.405" end="00:10:32.378" style="s2"> The stories we tell have exactly the same structure</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.152" end="00:10:37.714" style="s2"> They have their own core elements and their own changes</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.142" end="00:10:39.890" style="s2"> Okay let&#39;s go back to those stories</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.315" end="00:10:43.298" style="s2"> I just mentioned the first question</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.632" end="00:10:44.947" style="s2"> It&#39;s about complexity</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.409" end="00:10:48.872" style="s2"> Things are often too complicated to handle</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.384" end="00:10:51.597" style="s2"> This often leads to serious consequences</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.244" end="00:10:53.590" style="s2"> Everyone ends up like this</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.590" end="00:10:55.506" style="s2"> Their lives have become too complicated</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.506" end="00:10:56.346" style="s2"> To the point of death</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.478" end="00:11:02.004" style="s2"> A lot will happen as you go to death</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.004" end="00:11:05.386" style="s2"> Terrible things related to complexity</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.584" end="00:11:08.329" style="s2"> You may get serious illness that you can&#39;t handle</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.632" end="00:11:14.425" style="s2"> Or walk in in an intimate relationship</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.598" end="00:11:16.148" style="s2"> A dead end with no way out</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.370" end="00:11:17.970" style="s2"> This happens too often to people</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.225" end="00:11:19.826" style="s2"> For example, those who want to commit suicide</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.954" end="00:11:22.369" style="s2"> I often feel that they are driven to desperation</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.860" end="00:11:25.887" style="s2"> There is no correct option</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.887" end="00:11:28.831" style="s2"> Face terrible things no matter where you turn</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.123" end="00:11:30.595" style="s2"> And they don’t see any way out</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:34.546" style="s2"> Sometimes this is more real than you think</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.605" end="00:11:37.578" style="s2"> We tend to think</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.578" end="00:11:39.730" style="s2"> The problems of these people are mainly psychological problems</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.730" end="00:11:40.946" style="s2"> But actually not</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.946" end="00:11:44.039" style="s2"> As a clinician, you will soon realize one thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.645" end="00:11:46.258" style="s2"> I.e. people come to you</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.258" end="00:11:47.307" style="s2"> Because they have mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.307" end="00:11:49.958" style="s2"> It’s because of problems in dealing with complexity</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.365" end="00:11:52.891" style="s2"> Their lives are out of their control</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.277" end="00:11:55.490" style="s2"> They don’t know how to regain control of their lives</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.004" end="00:11:58.277" style="s2"> Many things will make you fall into this trouble</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.277" end="00:12:00.274" style="s2"> Then of course it will make you anxious or depressed</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.402" end="00:12:01.941" style="s2"> This is the fuse of almost all mental illnesses</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.941" end="00:12:03.904" style="s2"> But the basic question is still</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.342" end="00:12:06.294" style="s2"> Things are beyond your ability</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.254" end="00:12:09.490" style="s2"> This is actually a physiological and psychological problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.490" end="00:12:11.137" style="s2"> Not a purely psychological problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.419" end="00:12:14.008" style="s2"> Your abilities have an upper limit</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.791" end="00:12:16.899" style="s2"> From a resource point of view</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.202" end="00:12:19.008" style="s2"> Your ability is not enough to solve the urgent complexity</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.707" end="00:12:21.336" style="s2"> Your ability is not enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.578" end="00:12:26.503" style="s2"> If you get into an overly complicated situation</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.503" end="00:12:29.138" style="s2"> You will exhaust your physical and psychological resources</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.728" end="00:12:34.130" style="s2"> This is what the concept of chaos represents</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.238" end="00:12:36.252" style="s2"> It represents the complexity below the surface</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.252" end="00:12:37.906" style="s2"> Can surface all the time</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.298" end="00:12:40.198" style="s2"> It will surface in this case as an example</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.286" end="00:12:45.480" style="s2"> When you wake up and feel a little pain in some parts of your body</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.762" end="00:12:47.890" style="s2"> &quot;It should be okay&quot; you ignore it</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.890" end="00:12:50.386" style="s2"> But it got worse and you ended up in the hospital</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.386" end="00:12:52.943" style="s2"> Maybe you will find an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.943" end="00:12:54.802" style="s2"> You have pancreatic cancer</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.802" end="00:12:56.274" style="s2"> You can only live for another six months</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.274" end="00:12:57.338" style="s2"> It&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.073" end="00:13:04.071" style="s2"> At this time you finally stepped through the thin ice that everyone walked on</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.290" end="00:13:05.542" style="s2"> You now know what&#39;s under the surface</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.682" end="00:13:09.196" style="s2"> Beneath the surface is the deep-rooted complexity of life</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.927" end="00:13:11.186" style="s2"> This is chaos</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.434" end="00:13:17.891" style="s2"> People have spent a long time</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.361" end="00:13:22.641" style="s2"> To understand this conceptual &quot;schema&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.709" end="00:13:28.434" style="s2"> Before human beings have a clear understanding of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.434" end="00:13:31.081" style="s2"> Basically rely on imagination and story to complete this understanding</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.630" end="00:13:36.054" style="s2"> There are some images that represent the hidden chaos</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.659" end="00:13:38.528" style="s2"> One of them is the Chaos Dragon</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.269" end="00:13:40.083" style="s2"> It&#39;s exactly like the picture just now</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.647" end="00:13:42.954" style="s2"> The dragons that heroes have to face</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.267" end="00:13:44.580" style="s2"> Is a symbol of the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.580" end="00:13:46.244" style="s2"> Is something lurking under the surface</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.244" end="00:13:48.100" style="s2"> Dragons often guard the treasure</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.100" end="00:13:50.251" style="s2"> Because the unknown contains possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.699" end="00:13:54.060" style="s2"> We mentioned before</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.060" end="00:13:56.263" style="s2"> In the creation myth of Mesopotamia</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.676" end="00:13:58.392" style="s2"> Water exists at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.593" end="00:14:01.555" style="s2"> Including salt water and clear water</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.555" end="00:14:04.352" style="s2"> Are all symbols of chaos before the universe formed</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.355" end="00:14:07.236" style="s2"> For example, people often dream</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.236" end="00:14:08.998" style="s2"> I guess many of you have had this dream</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.998" end="00:14:11.805" style="s2"> Dreaming that I am in a house I am familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.338" end="00:14:14.916" style="s2"> But suddenly found one or several new rooms</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.916" end="00:14:16.983" style="s2"> Maybe some new rooms were found in the basement</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.983" end="00:14:19.844" style="s2"> These rooms are often messy</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.844" end="00:14:21.012" style="s2"> There is water everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.430" end="00:14:22.557" style="s2"> These are very common things</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.557" end="00:14:25.720" style="s2"> It means you broke</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.720" end="00:14:29.874" style="s2"> The limits of your conscious self-understanding</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.340" end="00:14:34.154" style="s2"> Go to a new field full of possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.509" end="00:14:37.060" style="s2"> But this new field has an amazing amount of work to be done</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.060" end="00:14:38.465" style="s2"> Think this is a whole new part of you</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.465" end="00:14:40.152" style="s2"> But it has not been well developed</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.545" end="00:14:44.100" style="s2"> Essentially it is filled with chaos</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.509" end="00:14:45.678" style="s2"> I think the reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.678" end="00:14:49.325" style="s2"> Partly because chaos is not only when you didn’t expect it</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.325" end="00:14:51.210" style="s2"> Where the fall</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.210" end="00:14:54.340" style="s2"> And you are directly facing</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.340" end="00:14:55.812" style="s2"> And the unknown from which new things are born</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.812" end="00:14:58.329" style="s2"> Water is a symbol of life especially in the desert</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.643" end="00:15:00.804" style="s2"> Because life cannot do without water</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.795" end="00:15:06.308" style="s2"> When you want to talk about something that can both give life</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.372" end="00:15:07.780" style="s2"> And potentially fatal things</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.780" end="00:15:10.052" style="s2"> Water naturally becomes their symbol</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.584" end="00:15:12.452" style="s2"> A little water can quench thirst</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.452" end="00:15:14.018" style="s2"> But a lot of water can cause a shipwreck</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.657" end="00:15:17.828" style="s2"> These are the two extremes of water</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.927" end="00:15:24.356" style="s2"> There are many such subtexts in &quot;Genesis&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.612" end="00:15:26.404" style="s2"> There are also other places in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.087" end="00:15:31.993" style="s2"> About God conquered a powerful monster</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.100" end="00:15:34.980" style="s2"> Leviathan or Behemoth</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.980" end="00:15:38.756" style="s2"> It has a snake-like appearance</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.185" end="00:15:42.588" style="s2"> The result of this conflict is that the world was created</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.058" end="00:15:46.325" style="s2"> This is a concept about the power of creation</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.325" end="00:15:48.058" style="s2"> Which is the logos we talked about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.548" end="00:15:51.430" style="s2"> It is constantly facing chaos</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.993" end="00:15:54.884" style="s2"> Another way to look at chaos is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.884" end="00:15:56.962" style="s2"> Think of it as an aggressive creeping monster</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.338" end="00:16:00.175" style="s2"> They often live in the abyss or underwater</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.981" end="00:16:01.649" style="s2"> I think this may be due to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.649" end="00:16:04.405" style="s2"> We are using our own predator detection circuit</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.405" end="00:16:06.596" style="s2"> To complete this pre-cognitive process</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.077" end="00:16:09.039" style="s2"> Its basic point is</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.436" end="00:16:11.732" style="s2"> Your predator detection circuit is used</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.181" end="00:16:14.868" style="s2"> Deal with instant threats</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.620" end="00:16:19.029" style="s2"> It is fast but the resolution is low</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.384" end="00:16:20.835" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t contain much thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.572" end="00:16:23.037" style="s2"> But it&#39;s really fast</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.556" end="00:16:26.948" style="s2"> This also illustrates our ability and tendency</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.948" end="00:16:29.188" style="s2"> That quickly move those</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.188" end="00:16:33.412" style="s2"> The people who subvert our conceptual structure</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.412" end="00:16:36.753" style="s2"> Seen as an enemy of a predator variant</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.380" end="00:16:40.068" style="s2"> We will react this way without thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.438" end="00:16:41.973" style="s2"> This is the prototype</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.787" end="00:16:45.459" style="s2"> If something rushes over and scares you</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.064" end="00:16:46.858" style="s2"> For example, a shark</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.858" end="00:16:48.388" style="s2"> Is something lurking underwater</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.388" end="00:16:49.540" style="s2"> It will pull you to the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.540" end="00:16:50.114" style="s2"> Then it&#39;s your enemy</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.709" end="00:16:53.393" style="s2"> Then you should be prepared</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.664" end="00:16:55.469" style="s2"> This is a very reasonable defense strategy</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.469" end="00:16:57.860" style="s2"> Although it is also risky</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.350" end="00:16:59.460" style="s2"> And sometimes errors</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.524" end="00:17:07.202" style="s2"> The picture we use to build the story</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.164" end="00:17:11.638" style="s2"> Basically an all-encompassing chaos</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.638" end="00:17:13.986" style="s2"> This chaos is beyond our ability to understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.686" end="00:17:15.646" style="s2"> On all levels</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.117" end="00:17:18.653" style="s2"> Individual level, family level, social level, economic level</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.060" end="00:17:21.117" style="s2"> We are all constantly being</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.117" end="00:17:24.029" style="s2"> The threat posed by the collapse of the environment where one lives</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.574" end="00:17:26.628" style="s2"> For example, you have a house</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.327" end="00:17:29.499" style="s2"> How much time did you spend maintaining it</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.365" end="00:17:32.292" style="s2"> Of course it took a lot of work, why did you do this?</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.292" end="00:17:35.364" style="s2"> Because the house will collapse on its own because of your stupidity</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.730" end="00:17:38.372" style="s2"> You didn&#39;t maintain it properly causing it to fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.372" end="00:17:39.593" style="s2"> Or you overlooked something, right</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.083" end="00:17:42.453" style="s2"> I say these for some professional reasons</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.664" end="00:17:44.772" style="s2"> The house collapsed because of your incompetence</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.344" end="00:17:47.213" style="s2"> But even if you have the ability it will still collapse</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.412" end="00:17:48.705" style="s2"> This is the principle of entropy</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.705" end="00:17:51.273" style="s2"> Things have a tendency to fall apart on their own</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.273" end="00:17:54.372" style="s2"> So you have to do your best</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.372" end="00:17:55.877" style="s2"> To keep things as they are</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.367" end="00:17:56.858" style="s2"> Of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.858" end="00:17:59.748" style="s2"> It will turn a blind eye to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.748" end="00:18:01.492" style="s2"> Bad repair skills</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.492" end="00:18:03.844" style="s2"> And your unwillingness to become complicated</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.780" end="00:18:07.620" style="s2"> We will return to a very classic point of view</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.277" end="00:18:10.334" style="s2"> A point made by Mircea Iliad</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.317" end="00:18:14.029" style="s2"> He is a famous religious historian</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.947" end="00:18:19.269" style="s2"> He extracted this point of view from the massive flood legends</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.036" end="00:18:24.132" style="s2"> There are two reasons why the earth will periodically have disasters</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.426" end="00:18:26.560" style="s2"> One is because things decompose themselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.948" end="00:18:28.544" style="s2"> Is the principle of entropy increase</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.029" end="00:18:31.231" style="s2"> I don’t remember which law of thermodynamics is</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.231" end="00:18:33.799" style="s2"> But a very important law in thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.603" end="00:18:36.158" style="s2"> Is one of the three laws of thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.158" end="00:18:38.016" style="s2"> Things fall apart spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.468" end="00:18:40.964" style="s2"> This is one of the things we have to fight against</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.973" end="00:18:46.340" style="s2"> 2. The speed of things collapse will be accelerated by human sin</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.952" end="00:18:50.375" style="s2"> Everyone knows this truth</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.375" end="00:18:51.844" style="s2"> You know very well in your heart</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.844" end="00:18:54.276" style="s2"> For example, your car broke down on the highway</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.276" end="00:18:55.684" style="s2"> You will think it is really inconvenient</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.684" end="00:18:57.476" style="s2"> You punched the sky</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.476" end="00:18:58.361" style="s2"> But at the same time another part of you</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.820" end="00:19:00.428" style="s2"> Will mutter deep in your heart</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.973" end="00:19:04.520" style="s2"> &quot;I know the car keeps clicking but I ignore it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.644" end="00:19:06.524" style="s2"> &quot;And it actually foreshadows something.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.943" end="00:19:09.892" style="s2"> &quot;I know I should pay more attention to this.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.542" end="00:19:13.267" style="s2"> &quot;But I didn&#39;t, so I got into where I am now&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.916" end="00:19:17.474" style="s2"> I bet these things happen two or three times a week</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.996" end="00:19:20.355" style="s2"> People do something they know they shouldn’t do</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.355" end="00:19:23.747" style="s2"> And told myself not to do stupid things a few seconds ago</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.227" end="00:19:25.908" style="s2"> A voice in their hearts said</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.127" end="00:19:27.254" style="s2"> &quot;Don&#39;t do that&quot; &quot;I know, I know&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.620" end="00:19:28.309" style="s2"> But you knowingly committed</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.538" end="00:19:30.334" style="s2"> Seek benevolence</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.334" end="00:19:32.053" style="s2"> Self-inflicted</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.053" end="00:19:33.872" style="s2"> Then you suffered a double injury</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.872" end="00:19:35.876" style="s2"> Because not only did things fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.876" end="00:19:38.244" style="s2"> And you&#39;re the fool who let it fall</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.244" end="00:19:41.054" style="s2"> I knew it would collapse but I ignored it</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.649" end="00:19:43.601" style="s2"> This is the concept behind this view</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.601" end="00:19:46.628" style="s2"> Things fall apart for two reasons</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.484" end="00:19:49.165" style="s2"> Thermodynamic entropy increase and</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.373" end="00:19:52.307" style="s2"> People have such a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.307" end="00:19:53.768" style="s2"> Ignore some things I know I should do</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.520" end="00:19:55.721" style="s2"> We did this partly because</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.336" end="00:19:58.020" style="s2"> When problems arise</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.020" end="00:19:59.269" style="s2"> I will always announce my arrival</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.499" end="00:20:03.893" style="s2"> Unless it&#39;s so small that you can automatically solve it</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.893" end="00:20:06.532" style="s2"> Its appearance is always accompanied by negative emotions</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.327" end="00:20:09.348" style="s2"> This is part of the predator detection circuit</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.645" end="00:20:14.446" style="s2"> It will fail, disappointment, grief</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.660" end="00:20:17.150" style="s2"> Or to announce its arrival in the worst form of anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.829" end="00:20:20.250" style="s2"> Not surprising because it is a problem, right</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.284" end="00:20:22.557" style="s2"> One of the logical responses is</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.557" end="00:20:24.572" style="s2"> Be dazed by the problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.045" end="00:20:28.117" style="s2"> But as long as it is a problem, it can be classified and solved</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.356" end="00:20:31.172" style="s2"> Staying and running away is not a good solution</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.213" end="00:20:34.692" style="s2"> Because things tend to fall apart autonomously</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.501" end="00:20:38.340" style="s2"> If you just throw it aside</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.695" end="00:20:40.115" style="s2"> It will only get worse, not better</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.115" end="00:20:42.425" style="s2"> This is a very disturbing thing in life</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.012" end="00:20:43.747" style="s2"> for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.186" end="00:20:47.359" style="s2"> If you have received a warning from the tax bureau</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.027" end="00:20:50.308" style="s2"> You ignored it</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.897" end="00:20:53.632" style="s2"> The probability of it disappearing is almost zero, right?</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.632" end="00:20:54.728" style="s2"> What will actually happen</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.728" end="00:20:57.284" style="s2"> The more you ignore the problem, the more serious it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.284" end="00:20:58.350" style="s2"> If you ignore it long enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.695" end="00:21:01.316" style="s2"> It becomes powerful enough to swallow you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.732" end="00:21:03.044" style="s2"> Then you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.428" end="00:21:06.127" style="s2"> I was reading &quot;Harpers Magazine&quot; once</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.743" end="00:21:08.820" style="s2"> It says people would rather be robbed than be charged</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.052" end="00:21:10.845" style="s2"> I believe this is true</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.845" end="00:21:12.662" style="s2"> Because the robbery is over</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.914" end="00:21:15.524" style="s2"> Only a few minutes of pure horror</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.137" end="00:21:18.020" style="s2"> Lost your wallet and life as usual</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.008" end="00:21:23.076" style="s2"> And auditing is like a semi-fatal disease</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.841" end="00:21:27.108" style="s2"> This is chaos</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.163" end="00:21:30.818" style="s2"> Here is a point about chaos</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.087" end="00:21:33.674" style="s2"> The psychological point of view</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.674" end="00:21:34.885" style="s2"> Chaos is actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.198" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2"> The spirit of God depicted in Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.831" end="00:21:41.316" style="s2"> Something orderly extracted at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.700" end="00:21:44.979" style="s2"> This is what we are constantly fighting against</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.229" end="00:21:48.164" style="s2"> We also fight to construct in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.164" end="00:21:49.624" style="s2"> And maintain the world we live in</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.398" end="00:21:52.881" style="s2"> This is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.246" end="00:21:56.548" style="s2"> In an environment called &quot;pre-cosmic chaos&quot; by Eliad</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.676" end="00:21:59.428" style="s2"> Our ancestors were surrounded by predators</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.031" end="00:22:03.538" style="s2"> And the way our neural structure is built</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.998" end="00:22:06.440" style="s2"> Was born to deal with this environment</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.596" end="00:22:08.173" style="s2"> When I first connected the two</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.321" end="00:22:11.588" style="s2"> Really initiating</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.411" end="00:22:13.684" style="s2"> It speaks for itself</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.353" end="00:22:16.513" style="s2"> The world is too complicated for us to handle</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.513" end="00:22:19.645" style="s2"> This is one of the problems we have to continue to face</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.645" end="00:22:22.453" style="s2"> Then the question is how do you deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.027" end="00:22:24.516" style="s2"> Things will get worse if you ignore it</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.644" end="00:22:25.939" style="s2"> So ignoring it is no use at all</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.939" end="00:22:27.716" style="s2"> We know this</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.912" end="00:22:29.154" style="s2"> So if you ignore it, it&#39;s useless</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.154" end="00:22:31.430" style="s2"> Then do something it might be useful</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.004" end="00:22:34.227" style="s2"> For example, I found in Egyptian mythology</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.227" end="00:22:36.749" style="s2"> Horus is the god of attention</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.749" end="00:22:39.050" style="s2"> There is such a god in Mesopotamian mythology</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.050" end="00:22:41.002" style="s2"> Marduk has a ring of eyes above his head</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.837" end="00:22:46.795" style="s2"> How can we turn the tide before the building will fall</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.795" end="00:22:50.621" style="s2"> The answer to this is to take the initiative to deal with them</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.751" end="00:22:52.996" style="s2"> This fits well with those hero myths</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.758" end="00:22:55.108" style="s2"> These myths all preach a point of view</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.511" end="00:23:02.404" style="s2"> If there is a dragon hiding around you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.778" end="00:23:06.180" style="s2"> Hiding it in the basement will only make it stronger</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.564" end="00:23:09.316" style="s2"> It&#39;s time to go out and face those problems</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.760" end="00:23:11.236" style="s2"> The usual story is</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.367" end="00:23:12.580" style="s2"> You might be killed by a dragon</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.580" end="00:23:13.860" style="s2"> After all, it&#39;s a dragon</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.240" end="00:23:16.046" style="s2"> But this is only a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.046" end="00:23:18.444" style="s2"> The opposite is undoubtedly</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.444" end="00:23:21.639" style="s2"> If you happen to be attacked at home in the middle of the night</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.639" end="00:23:22.390" style="s2"> You still have a hangover</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.390" end="00:23:23.674" style="s2"> It just ended a bad day</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.008" end="00:23:27.876" style="s2"> At this time you are not ready for your sword and shield</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.089" end="00:23:30.208" style="s2"> Usually this is what happens in those</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.208" end="00:23:31.357" style="s2"> The situation in the person who is running away</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.223" end="00:23:34.071" style="s2"> This is not something we should promote</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.363" end="00:23:35.698" style="s2"> How you choose is a dead end</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.897" end="00:23:40.135" style="s2"> It&#39;s good to be extremely pessimistic at a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.292" end="00:23:41.106" style="s2"> That’s it’s so liberating</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.747" end="00:23:46.026" style="s2"> It&#39;s a relief to happen often</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.436" end="00:23:49.188" style="s2"> This is really a habit worth developing</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.864" end="00:23:52.895" style="s2"> Sometimes you get stuck no matter what you do</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.392" end="00:23:54.154" style="s2"> Being an extremely pessimist is a relief</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.154" end="00:23:56.962" style="s2"> So you won&#39;t struggle everywhere to find a way out</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.962" end="00:23:58.134" style="s2"> Because there is no way out</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.154" end="00:24:02.714" style="s2"> You can choose the tragic way of death A</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.714" end="00:24:06.075" style="s2"> You can choose the tragic way of death A</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.440" end="00:24:09.729" style="s2"> I know it sucks to look at things this way</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.989" end="00:24:12.839" style="s2"> But it is very helpful for understanding the following question</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.183" end="00:24:18.500" style="s2"> That is, many times you always have the least of two evils</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.321" end="00:24:20.740" style="s2"> If this is all you can do</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.740" end="00:24:23.246" style="s2"> If life is like this for you</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.246" end="00:24:24.688" style="s2"> Okay, come on</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.688" end="00:24:25.584" style="s2"> Make the worst choice</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.584" end="00:24:26.973" style="s2"> Also the best thing you can do</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.622" end="00:24:29.165" style="s2"> Good enough</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.478" end="00:24:30.927" style="s2"> Especially with another option</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.927" end="00:24:32.526" style="s2"> The worst option is even more so</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.205" end="00:24:35.881" style="s2"> anyway</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.224" end="00:24:42.261" style="s2"> The basic reality of things is complex beyond understanding</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.461" end="00:24:46.107" style="s2"> The question is how do you face it</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.961" end="00:24:51.337" style="s2"> Here is the part of the patriarchal order</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.510" end="00:24:53.052" style="s2"> I have to declare in advance</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.635" end="00:24:54.469" style="s2"> The &quot;patriarchy&quot; here is analyzed from a positive perspective</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.847" end="00:24:57.247" style="s2"> After the patriarchal structure is missing</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.684" end="00:24:59.652" style="s2"> Can&#39;t think of a better word right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.700" end="00:25:00.708" style="s2"> The rest can only be chaos</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.756" end="00:25:02.964" style="s2"> Chaos is not a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.964" end="00:25:06.084" style="s2"> If it&#39;s too messy</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.264" end="00:25:07.779" style="s2"> The less self you can keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.246" end="00:25:10.809" style="s2"> If you think you can have no prior structure</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.115" end="00:25:13.161" style="s2"> And the context of the social structure</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.545" end="00:25:15.945" style="s2"> Then you really know too little about humans</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.473" end="00:25:18.825" style="s2"> Because for one thing I observed, for example</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.548" end="00:25:23.176" style="s2"> Our ability to maintain our sanity depends largely on</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.263" end="00:25:26.815" style="s2"> A well-ordered social structure</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.487" end="00:25:28.255" style="s2"> The reason is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.071" end="00:25:32.671" style="s2"> First of all you have to know what you do almost every day</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.671" end="00:25:33.391" style="s2"> You have to have a fixed daily routine</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.701" end="00:25:34.613" style="s2"> Because humans are also animals</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.169" end="00:25:36.566" style="s2"> If you have a dog or cat, you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.077" end="00:25:38.661" style="s2"> Dog is a good example</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.661" end="00:25:39.909" style="s2"> Dogs like a fixed daily routine</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.909" end="00:25:41.900" style="s2"> They like a fixed number of times per day</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.900" end="00:25:43.207" style="s2"> Go for a walk at a fixed time</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.399" end="00:25:45.175" style="s2"> If you don’t regulate their daily routine</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.175" end="00:25:49.207" style="s2"> They will get sick soon</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.515" end="00:25:51.003" style="s2"> The same for children</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.435" end="00:25:52.587" style="s2"> It can be exaggerated but in general</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.355" end="00:25:56.379" style="s2"> You still have to know the approximate time to wake up</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.619" end="00:25:58.587" style="s2"> About the same time every day</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.875" end="00:26:01.419" style="s2"> You have to know your approximate food</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.419" end="00:26:02.849" style="s2"> Need to know what to eat</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.849" end="00:26:04.587" style="s2"> With whom</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.587" end="00:26:06.459" style="s2"> You have to know where to buy ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.555" end="00:26:09.747" style="s2"> 70% to 80% of your life</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.747" end="00:26:10.491" style="s2"> It&#39;s almost this ratio</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.959" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2"> Are made up of the procedures you repeat every day</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.792" end="00:26:18.351" style="s2"> But these repeated parts are often considered by many people to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.591" end="00:26:19.757" style="s2"> The least important part of their lives</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.757" end="00:26:22.665" style="s2"> But one thing I must point out is</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.665" end="00:26:24.207" style="s2"> You will know</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.023" end="00:26:27.711" style="s2"> I have analyzed this to a client of mine</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.114" end="00:26:29.775" style="s2"> He suffered a lot of crimes for coaxing his children to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.971" end="00:26:31.478" style="s2"> It&#39;s a battle every night</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.907" end="00:26:34.742" style="s2"> Research at that time has shown</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.929" end="00:26:37.787" style="s2"> Most parents spend only 20 minutes a day on average</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.787" end="00:26:39.686" style="s2"> Be alone with your children</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.143" end="00:26:42.967" style="s2"> Because everyone is too busy</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.126" end="00:26:44.231" style="s2"> Set aside 20 minutes of one-on-one time every day</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.231" end="00:26:46.855" style="s2"> It&#39;s actually not that easy</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.855" end="00:26:48.858" style="s2"> These 20 minutes are much longer than you think</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.764" end="00:26:51.636" style="s2"> But it’s only 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.179" end="00:26:54.067" style="s2"> My client spends about 40 minutes a day</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.102" end="00:26:56.838" style="s2"> Bother trying to put the child to bed</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.366" end="00:26:59.833" style="s2"> It&#39;s not fun at all</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.833" end="00:27:00.553" style="s2"> You might think okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.553" end="00:27:02.982" style="s2"> It&#39;s just a little trouble making the kids sleep</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.126" end="00:27:04.175" style="s2"> Things are not as simple as you think</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.655" end="00:27:06.006" style="s2"> If this kind of petty fight is performed every day</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.006" end="00:27:07.158" style="s2"> It was a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.350" end="00:27:08.310" style="s2"> So do the math for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.982" end="00:27:11.574" style="s2"> Just roughly assume 5 hours a week</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.574" end="00:27:12.774" style="s2"> Don&#39;t need to be too precise</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.774" end="00:27:14.449" style="s2"> That is 20 hours a month</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.449" end="00:27:17.250" style="s2"> 240 hours per year</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.250" end="00:27:19.398" style="s2"> Count it down to six 40-hour work weeks</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.830" end="00:27:22.885" style="s2"> In other words, he wasted a month and a half of the work week</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.885" end="00:27:27.968" style="s2"> I can&#39;t do anything, I can only fight against my son</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.968" end="00:27:29.360" style="s2"> Just to put my son to bed</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.888" end="00:27:30.896" style="s2"> Sounds terrible right</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.896" end="00:27:34.530" style="s2"> If you want to have a positive relationship with others</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.073" end="00:27:37.742" style="s2"> It’s best not to spend too much time on this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.742" end="00:27:40.528" style="s2"> This is too bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.480" end="00:27:43.792" style="s2"> Therefore you need a structure</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.053" end="00:27:45.109" style="s2"> Need for predictability</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.109" end="00:27:46.837" style="s2"> You need them more than you think</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.217" end="00:27:48.469" style="s2"> To help you stay sane</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.712" end="00:27:50.725" style="s2"> If you are lucky</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.725" end="00:27:52.165" style="s2"> May sound weird</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.261" end="00:27:55.525" style="s2"> You can deviate from normal behavior patterns by 5%</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.525" end="00:27:57.771" style="s2"> Or 10% more</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.092" end="00:27:59.820" style="s2"> But also with caution and caution</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.108" end="00:28:03.180" style="s2"> As long as you haven’t deviated from the usual</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.516" end="00:28:05.052" style="s2"> Then it&#39;s OK to be a little abnormal</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.052" end="00:28:06.858" style="s2"> Maybe it can be maintained for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.077" end="00:28:09.564" style="s2"> The people around you can also tolerate your aberrations</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.564" end="00:28:11.052" style="s2"> Or maybe you are really lucky</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.100" end="00:28:13.836" style="s2"> You are very creative, decent and organized</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.918" end="00:28:15.502" style="s2"> People will be more than happy to contact you</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.646" end="00:28:18.526" style="s2"> Because you are so unique</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.006" end="00:28:20.590" style="s2"> But even in this case</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.590" end="00:28:23.614" style="s2"> In general, what you need most is a fixed schedule</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.758" end="00:28:25.870" style="s2"> An orderly and predictable schedule</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.870" end="00:28:27.358" style="s2"> Then be able to strictly enforce it</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.358" end="00:28:31.582" style="s2"> In this way you will be healthier, happier and more rational</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.582" end="00:28:32.974" style="s2"> There is one more thing you need</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.406" end="00:28:37.390" style="s2"> I think the psychoanalyst here is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.527" end="00:28:39.344" style="s2"> They overestimate the internal rational construction</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.344" end="00:28:45.639" style="s2"> Importance to sound mind</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.176" end="00:28:48.288" style="s2"> Because from a psychological point of view</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.288" end="00:28:49.152" style="s2"> You are &quot;self&quot; in a way</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.152" end="00:28:50.544" style="s2"> It&#39;s inside you</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.832" end="00:28:52.800" style="s2"> Of course it lives on the unconscious structure</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.944" end="00:28:57.552" style="s2"> The purpose of psychoanalysis is to clarify this unconscious structure</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.744" end="00:28:59.088" style="s2"> And the self attached to it</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.088" end="00:29:02.411" style="s2"> To help you become a completely independent individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.880" end="00:29:04.217" style="s2"> But this perception has a problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.557" end="00:29:11.309" style="s2"> Because you as a rational and autonomous human</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.309" end="00:29:13.901" style="s2"> Not all because your mind is organized</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.901" end="00:29:15.053" style="s2"> Although it is important</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.389" end="00:29:17.021" style="s2"> If your subconscious and self-organized</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.213" end="00:29:21.053" style="s2"> Why you can stay sane</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.053" end="00:29:23.693" style="s2"> Because the people around you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.981" end="00:29:26.573" style="s2"> Tolerate your various behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.717" end="00:29:28.829" style="s2"> And whenever you act too stupidly</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.829" end="00:29:30.557" style="s2"> They will alert you in time</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.557" end="00:29:33.725" style="s2"> If you don’t realize it, you will get people’s permanent disgust</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.349" end="00:29:37.517" style="s2"> People do it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.517" end="00:29:38.765" style="s2"> I can&#39;t get tired of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.861" end="00:29:42.221" style="s2"> Send this kind of spiritual message back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.605" end="00:29:47.501" style="s2"> For example, if people behave reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.501" end="00:29:51.005" style="s2"> And you are happy to see it happen, you will smile at them</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.245" end="00:29:52.781" style="s2"> Otherwise you will frown</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.781" end="00:29:53.933" style="s2"> Or ignore them</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.933" end="00:29:56.477" style="s2"> Avoid them and roll their eyes at them</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.573" end="00:29:58.925" style="s2"> You make an expression of disgust and don&#39;t listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.925" end="00:30:01.277" style="s2"> You interrupt them not to cooperate with them</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.277" end="00:30:02.477" style="s2"> Disdain to compete</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.010" end="00:30:04.852" style="s2"> You frequently send this kind of signal to others</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.852" end="00:30:08.740" style="s2"> To regulate their behavior</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.788" end="00:30:10.996" style="s2"> All your social interactions are doing things like this</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.332" end="00:30:12.868" style="s2"> This is why we communicate face to face</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.868" end="00:30:14.980" style="s2"> And why our faces express emotions</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.124" end="00:30:16.516" style="s2"> We look at each other</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.516" end="00:30:20.980" style="s2"> Can know each other&#39;s current status</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.126" end="00:30:24.620" style="s2"> Because we can’t directly understand what each other is thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.349" end="00:30:27.701" style="s2"> In part, you do a fixed schedule</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.701" end="00:30:32.261" style="s2"> To mold yourself into such a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.261" end="00:30:34.277" style="s2"> A trustworthy and perhaps funny person</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.517" end="00:30:37.253" style="s2"> At the same time, he won’t do anything too out of line</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.493" end="00:30:39.029" style="s2"> Everyone around you</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.125" end="00:30:40.325" style="s2"> Are shaping you in this way</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.325" end="00:30:42.341" style="s2"> Make sure you look the way you should</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.829" end="00:30:44.404" style="s2"> This is why you stay sane</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.404" end="00:30:46.997" style="s2"> If people don’t have a fixed schedule</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.237" end="00:30:49.541" style="s2"> They will start to become isolated and erratic</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.069" end="00:30:51.269" style="s2"> Deviated further and further</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.269" end="00:30:54.165" style="s2"> Because the world is too complicated</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.165" end="00:30:56.597" style="s2"> It is impossible to keep its organization organized by oneself</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.794" end="00:30:58.426" style="s2"> You really can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.618" end="00:31:02.362" style="s2"> So we use other means to stay sane</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.130" end="00:31:06.492" style="s2"> This is very wise</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.745" end="00:31:10.234" style="s2"> Because the spiritual and mental issues are too complicated</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.954" end="00:31:14.383" style="s2"> The way we deal with this complexity is</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.383" end="00:31:17.211" style="s2"> We have developed an extremely large brain capacity</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.211" end="00:31:20.187" style="s2"> We use it to handle many problems in parallel</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.445" end="00:31:22.539" style="s2"> It can be said to be like a &quot;mental stock market&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.845" end="00:31:27.700" style="s2"> I use this term deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.700" end="00:31:30.969" style="s2"> Because the stock market is also doing the impossible</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.132" end="00:31:32.441" style="s2"> It tries to price things</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.766" end="00:31:33.785" style="s2"> But it can&#39;t be done</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.593" end="00:31:37.049" style="s2"> There are countless items in the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.241" end="00:31:39.609" style="s2"> How can you price each item?</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.788" end="00:31:41.657" style="s2"> Can&#39;t do it at all</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.657" end="00:31:43.093" style="s2"> That’s why the stock market came into being</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.897" end="00:31:44.921" style="s2"> From the consumer point of view that is the free market</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.921" end="00:31:46.457" style="s2"> So in the free market</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.457" end="00:31:49.209" style="s2"> Everyone is voting all the time to determine the price of everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.337" end="00:31:50.681" style="s2"> We price items in this way</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.681" end="00:31:53.131" style="s2"> Because it’s impossible to price each item individually</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.433" end="00:31:55.801" style="s2"> This is part of the reason why the stock market soars from time to time</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.865" end="00:31:57.529" style="s2"> And things like stock market bubbles</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.721" end="00:31:59.383" style="s2"> Having said that, what I mean by this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.728" end="00:32:03.050" style="s2"> Everything is chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.543" end="00:32:05.017" style="s2"> In &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.206" end="00:32:06.806" style="s2"> Alice fell into the rabbit hole</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.638" end="00:32:09.046" style="s2"> The underground world</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.814" end="00:32:12.822" style="s2"> Since then she has been exposed to the underlying structure of being</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.689" end="00:32:15.126" style="s2"> She met the red queen</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.574" end="00:32:17.238" style="s2"> Mother Nature</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.878" end="00:32:19.798" style="s2"> Mother Nature is running around</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.182" end="00:32:22.358" style="s2"> Clamoring to cut off someone&#39;s head</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.116" end="00:32:25.238" style="s2"> This is exactly what Mother Nature is doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.558" end="00:32:26.902" style="s2"> She told Alice</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.414" end="00:32:29.974" style="s2"> &quot;In my kingdom you have to run as hard as you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.038" end="00:32:31.510" style="s2"> &quot;Can stay in place&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.214" end="00:32:33.622" style="s2"> The fact is</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.881" end="00:32:39.510" style="s2"> Evolutionary biologists and psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.510" end="00:32:41.238" style="s2"> Put forward the so-called &quot;red queen hypothesis&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.238" end="00:32:42.966" style="s2"> The content of this hypothesis is</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.438" end="00:32:45.804" style="s2"> You are facing all kinds of situations all the time</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.804" end="00:32:48.865" style="s2"> And your intelligence is not enough to face or face everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.526" end="00:32:51.470" style="s2"> This is an eternal problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.780" end="00:32:52.932" style="s2"> So how do you face it</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.932" end="00:32:54.532" style="s2"> You rely on your own biological structure</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.261" end="00:32:58.308" style="s2"> Your physical avatar can partially solve this problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.564" end="00:33:00.036" style="s2"> Besides, you can be shaped by the environment</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.740" end="00:33:02.404" style="s2"> Therefore</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.980" end="00:33:05.092" style="s2"> You learned a lot of things you need to know</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.092" end="00:33:07.268" style="s2"> But the most important thing is that you learned</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.268" end="00:33:09.124" style="s2"> How to communicate effectively with others in a good manner</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.323" end="00:33:13.540" style="s2"> Once you have the ability to do so</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.540" end="00:33:15.588" style="s2"> You can always use external forces to solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.652" end="00:33:16.932" style="s2"> This is also what you do everyday</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.124" end="00:33:21.220" style="s2"> Our daily interaction is to continuously communicate solutions</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.476" end="00:33:22.776" style="s2"> If you are a social person</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.776" end="00:33:24.164" style="s2"> This is what you need to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.356" end="00:33:25.300" style="s2"> If you plan to have children</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.300" end="00:33:26.512" style="s2"> There is something to understand</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.512" end="00:33:28.324" style="s2"> I seem to have mentioned in a previous lecture</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.162" end="00:33:32.839" style="s2"> As a parent of extremely young children</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.839" end="00:33:37.098" style="s2"> Your goal is before the child is four years old</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.098" end="00:33:39.082" style="s2"> Nurture them to be extremely popular with the environment</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.466" end="00:33:40.682" style="s2"> If you can achieve this goal</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.682" end="00:33:41.898" style="s2"> They have successfully finalized</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.346" end="00:33:44.650" style="s2"> Because everyone is happy to have their company</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.034" end="00:33:46.698" style="s2"> Once people want to interact with them</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.698" end="00:33:47.594" style="s2"> I want to play with them</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.594" end="00:33:48.298" style="s2"> Want to cooperate with</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.298" end="00:33:49.578" style="s2"> Have the desire to compete</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.578" end="00:33:51.712" style="s2"> It&#39;s as if all the doors are open for them</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.712" end="00:33:53.802" style="s2"> The reason why they can stay sane</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.802" end="00:33:56.147" style="s2"> Because everyone loves and is willing to help them</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.147" end="00:34:01.387" style="s2"> So your goal is to do as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.387" end="00:34:03.530" style="s2"> Make them acceptable and welcome in the social environment</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.805" end="00:34:08.633" style="s2"> It’s not that we should turn them into soulless walking dead</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.154" end="00:34:13.625" style="s2"> That is a tyrant-style compulsory socialization</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.625" end="00:34:15.673" style="s2"> For example, the common reprimand &quot;Don&#39;t do anything wrong&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.939" end="00:34:17.714" style="s2"> This is not a good way</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.818" end="00:34:19.623" style="s2"> Although this is a good suggestion in itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.586" end="00:34:22.887" style="s2"> But this advice is not complete</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.949" end="00:34:24.613" style="s2"> You have to do a lot of things right</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.613" end="00:34:28.837" style="s2"> So that people like to have your company</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.837" end="00:34:30.117" style="s2"> Encourage what you do</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.117" end="00:34:31.781" style="s2"> This is you as a parent</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.973" end="00:34:34.021" style="s2"> Things to do besides instilling normative awareness</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.872" end="00:34:37.605" style="s2"> This schematic is like this</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.862" end="00:34:40.136" style="s2"> The Father is followed by a round of sun</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.136" end="00:34:42.342" style="s2"> He rules this walled city</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.470" end="00:34:45.222" style="s2"> He can be said to be the soul of this city</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.734" end="00:34:49.894" style="s2"> This picture is really wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.461" end="00:34:53.483" style="s2"> The same can be said</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.483" end="00:34:54.955" style="s2"> He is the collective spirit of this city</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.955" end="00:34:57.259" style="s2"> In other words, the collective spirit of the city has accumulated over time</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.259" end="00:34:59.883" style="s2"> Or the collective spirit of strength</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.883" end="00:35:02.699" style="s2"> This force has built and maintained the city over time</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.891" end="00:35:03.979" style="s2"> This statement is better</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.979" end="00:35:05.771" style="s2"> Here is connected with the sun again</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.899" end="00:35:10.459" style="s2"> Because the sun symbolizes enlightenment and light</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.793" end="00:35:13.835" style="s2"> And everything related to higher consciousness and revelation</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.970" end="00:35:15.442" style="s2"> This is a very subtle picture</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.634" end="00:35:18.163" style="s2"> Then on this basis, I give this explanation</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.163" end="00:35:24.338" style="s2"> Of course patriarchy may develop into autocracy</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.978" end="00:35:26.386" style="s2"> This does happen often</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.386" end="00:35:29.948" style="s2"> This is a persistent danger in human civilization</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.532" end="00:35:33.042" style="s2"> Civilization is the antidote to chaos</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.455" end="00:35:36.562" style="s2"> But it will develop out of control from time to time</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.562" end="00:35:38.162" style="s2"> I became a problem of myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.162" end="00:35:40.626" style="s2"> Roughly speaking, it looks like a super problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.626" end="00:35:42.962" style="s2"> It will create chaotic problems</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.674" end="00:35:47.378" style="s2"> Each solution creates certain problems</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.881" end="00:35:49.362" style="s2"> No one solution is perfect</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.490" end="00:35:51.218" style="s2"> You have to find balance</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.513" end="00:35:53.010" style="s2"> For postmodernists</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.736" end="00:35:57.857" style="s2"> One thing can be said that annoys me</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.931" end="00:36:00.939" style="s2"> They keep complaining about patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.387" end="00:36:03.435" style="s2"> It&#39;s really annoying</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.906" end="00:36:08.619" style="s2"> The social structure is autocratic, which speaks for itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.003" end="00:36:10.987" style="s2"> What&#39;s the fuss about this, friends</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.371" end="00:36:12.459" style="s2"> This couldn&#39;t be more obvious</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.035" end="00:36:14.955" style="s2"> But the social structure is not exactly like this</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.275" end="00:36:22.380" style="s2"> Patriarchy can be said to be a one-dimensional problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.635" end="00:36:24.555" style="s2"> Extremely simplified solution</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.811" end="00:36:25.963" style="s2"> Some people think this is dictatorship</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.963" end="00:36:28.603" style="s2"> Actually not at all</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.060" end="00:36:31.988" style="s2"> If you stay in a place where only dictatorship remains in the first half of the year</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.294" end="00:36:34.259" style="s2"> You will soon find the difference</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.259" end="00:36:35.501" style="s2"> But this does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.825" end="00:36:40.851" style="s2"> Even if you live in a free and enlightened Western society</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.461" end="00:36:45.907" style="s2"> People don’t need to make any sacrifices to participate in social construction</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.099" end="00:36:50.515" style="s2"> We are all shaped by the autocratic side of social customs</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.357" end="00:36:53.139" style="s2"> But basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.507" end="00:36:55.699" style="s2"> This is more pros than cons</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.083" end="00:36:59.027" style="s2"> Furthermore, do you have to sacrifice too much for the group?</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.027" end="00:37:01.459" style="s2"> The choice is yours</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.952" end="00:37:04.659" style="s2"> If you make too much sacrifice for the group</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.659" end="00:37:05.538" style="s2"> You will be aware</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.538" end="00:37:07.714" style="s2"> Because you will start to be angry and irritable to others</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.098" end="00:37:11.874" style="s2"> Your mental mechanism is telling you this in this way</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.130" end="00:37:13.474" style="s2"> It depends on whether you want to fight</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.008" end="00:37:17.762" style="s2"> The huge pressure of complying with social regulations</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.762" end="00:37:21.090" style="s2"> To keep your individual logos</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.346" end="00:37:23.266" style="s2"> This is the problem you have to face</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.522" end="00:37:25.890" style="s2"> The collective wants you to behave</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.594" end="00:37:30.114" style="s2"> If you can follow the norms and be creative</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.114" end="00:37:30.852" style="s2"> That would be better</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.852" end="00:37:32.255" style="s2"> But this situation is very rare</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.818" end="00:37:36.166" style="s2"> Generally speaking, the group just wants you to behave well</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.422" end="00:37:38.278" style="s2"> This is the authoritarian part</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.342" end="00:37:40.134" style="s2"> Is there any other alternative</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.618" end="00:37:43.973" style="s2"> Our society is built on consensus</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.143" end="00:37:49.327" style="s2"> Consensus is based on a certain degree of individual sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.391" end="00:37:51.785" style="s2"> Although the individual is a social revival</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.140" end="00:37:54.383" style="s2"> An absolutely necessary revitalizing force</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.737" end="00:37:57.398" style="s2"> It is difficult to grasp this problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.529" end="00:38:02.649" style="s2"> Anyway your physical structure</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.649" end="00:38:05.593" style="s2"> Is your first line of defense against chaos</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.315" end="00:38:09.497" style="s2"> Your body presents you to the world in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.817" end="00:38:11.993" style="s2"> The second line of defense can be said to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.993" end="00:38:14.041" style="s2"> The social structure you live in</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.041" end="00:38:17.049" style="s2"> You can also call it the ability hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.589" end="00:38:18.649" style="s2"> Thank goodness</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.021" end="00:38:23.001" style="s2"> Maybe you can master one or two things in your life</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.001" end="00:38:25.753" style="s2"> But you have to know a little bit more about it</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.137" end="00:38:27.481" style="s2"> If you face all possible situations alone</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.481" end="00:38:29.728" style="s2"> You are solving difficult math problems</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.728" end="00:38:33.868" style="s2"> Watching the bathtub leak all over the place but feel helpless</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.868" end="00:38:35.072" style="s2"> This is not so good</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.072" end="00:38:36.100" style="s2"> You can call a plumber at this time</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.100" end="00:38:36.941" style="s2"> Everything is fine</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.912" end="00:38:40.900" style="s2"> We tend to cooperate with each other to control the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.476" end="00:38:43.908" style="s2"> At the same time, it also controls the orderly development</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.164" end="00:38:47.364" style="s2"> Political dialogue is like this, right</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.246" end="00:38:50.820" style="s2"> We maintain culture to control chaos</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.534" end="00:38:56.580" style="s2"> At the same time find a balance in it to control the rational development of culture</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.092" end="00:39:00.292" style="s2"> Only in this way can we</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.484" end="00:39:02.020" style="s2"> In a peaceful and productive way</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.276" end="00:39:03.856" style="s2"> Life for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.856" end="00:39:05.348" style="s2"> The best we can do</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.793" end="00:39:08.608" style="s2"> We should be grateful when things work effectively</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.608" end="00:39:13.664" style="s2"> Because everything is in the natural state</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.112" end="00:39:16.352" style="s2"> Not only do they not work well on their own</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.352" end="00:39:19.488" style="s2"> Will gradually get worse over time</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.616" end="00:39:23.278" style="s2"> You should be amazed whenever anything is working properly</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.142" end="00:39:27.039" style="s2"> So what does this framework look like?</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.039" end="00:39:28.767" style="s2"> I think it should be like this</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.290" end="00:39:33.457" style="s2"> In my opinion, it is the basic structure of many things</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.457" end="00:39:34.737" style="s2"> It is a basic structured story</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.737" end="00:39:37.105" style="s2"> Is the basic conceptual framework</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.105" end="00:39:41.265" style="s2"> In Heidegger&#39;s words, the basic Dasein</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.265" end="00:39:43.761" style="s2"> It is the frame of the world in which you live</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.761" end="00:39:45.617" style="s2"> You must exist in one</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.617" end="00:39:47.089" style="s2"> No exception</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.537" end="00:39:49.393" style="s2"> You can convert between different frames</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.393" end="00:39:50.801" style="s2"> But the essence remains the same, you are still in the frame</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.801" end="00:39:52.303" style="s2"> This is the world you live in</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.358" end="00:39:54.382" style="s2"> You exist somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.150" end="00:39:56.524" style="s2"> It is inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.524" end="00:39:58.350" style="s2"> Although you may not know where you live</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.734" end="00:40:01.614" style="s2"> It means you are in chaos</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.140" end="00:40:05.511" style="s2"> In this case, you have to look back carefully</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.731" end="00:40:07.246" style="s2"> Figure out where you are now</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.246" end="00:40:09.624" style="s2"> It&#39;s like you&#39;re lost</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.624" end="00:40:11.133" style="s2"> The problem with it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.133" end="00:40:12.897" style="s2"> You don&#39;t know where to go</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.345" end="00:40:14.843" style="s2"> Because you have countless places to go</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.843" end="00:40:17.313" style="s2"> The problem is that there are too many options</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.377" end="00:40:20.705" style="s2"> There are too many places where you can stay safe and sound</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.089" end="00:40:22.817" style="s2"> It&#39;s not a good thing to be lost</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.073" end="00:40:24.609" style="s2"> You have to know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.303" end="00:40:28.518" style="s2"> I built an online project with my partner</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.720" end="00:40:28.731" style="s2"> Called &quot;Past Writing Project&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.731" end="00:40:30.971" style="s2"> Called &quot;Past Writing Project&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.971" end="00:40:35.417" style="s2"> This project helps people clarify their past</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.143" end="00:40:39.316" style="s2"> It breaks down life into six stages</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.316" end="00:40:40.565" style="s2"> We call each stage a period</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.591" end="00:40:45.711" style="s2"> Then find out the deepest moments in each period</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.711" end="00:40:47.823" style="s2"> Record what happened</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.823" end="00:40:48.779" style="s2"> Good or bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.123" end="00:40:50.639" style="s2"> What is the corresponding result at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.762" end="00:40:51.868" style="s2"> What did you get from it</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.994" end="00:40:53.622" style="s2"> Maybe you could have chosen another way of doing things</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.622" end="00:40:55.459" style="s2"> Maybe you can learn something from it</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.459" end="00:40:58.434" style="s2"> In this way you can clear the fog</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.873" end="00:41:02.927" style="s2"> Find a direction for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.465" end="00:41:04.651" style="s2"> But many people don’t like to do this</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.651" end="00:41:06.187" style="s2"> Because they actually don’t want to know</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.187" end="00:41:07.996" style="s2"> They would rather be muddled</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.612" end="00:41:13.163" style="s2"> Open one eye to everything, close one eye</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.612" end="00:41:16.939" style="s2"> Fancy that the surrounding environment is much better than the actual situation</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.307" end="00:41:19.819" style="s2"> Trying to deceive myself in an ambiguous state</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.219" end="00:41:23.595" style="s2"> They would rather do this than face actual problems</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.915" end="00:41:26.411" style="s2"> But you better go face them up</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.731" end="00:41:29.099" style="s2"> Because once you have a clear problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.478" end="00:41:32.299" style="s2"> You clarify the problems and understand their essence</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.555" end="00:41:34.443" style="s2"> You can start to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.443" end="00:41:39.259" style="s2"> Step by step</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.259" end="00:41:41.534" style="s2"> But if you don’t know where you live</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.534" end="00:41:42.603" style="s2"> There is no way to talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.603" end="00:41:45.163" style="s2"> You will be aware of this state</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.547" end="00:41:46.910" style="s2"> It&#39;s easy to feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.851" end="00:41:51.179" style="s2"> If you have been entangled in the past by things in your dreams</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.453" end="00:41:55.480" style="s2"> It may have been more than a year</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.480" end="00:41:58.032" style="s2"> But you are still troubled by it every now and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.032" end="00:41:59.528" style="s2"> They appear repeatedly in your dreams</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.593" end="00:42:05.585" style="s2"> Means you have not extracted that world from past experience</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.713" end="00:42:08.273" style="s2"> Your potential is still trapped in the past</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.721" end="00:42:12.305" style="s2"> To face it is to face the dragon of the past</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.703" end="00:42:14.289" style="s2"> Of course it is scary</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.353" end="00:42:16.017" style="s2"> Sometimes things can be really scary</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.017" end="00:42:20.155" style="s2"> For example, you may be at a loss and confused</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.155" end="00:42:22.161" style="s2"> The reason is that you suffered severe abuse in your childhood</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.186" end="00:42:23.394" style="s2"> For example, when I was four years old</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.762" end="00:42:25.318" style="s2"> The abuser may be a family member</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.420" end="00:42:27.712" style="s2"> Because family members are often the abuser</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.244" end="00:42:29.636" style="s2"> And this will only make things worse</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.657" end="00:42:31.274" style="s2"> this means</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.622" end="00:42:37.475" style="s2"> You have encountered a deliberate evil</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.478" end="00:42:41.285" style="s2"> If you say it wrong, you have directly encountered deliberate evil</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.323" end="00:42:44.618" style="s2"> But tortured you for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.618" end="00:42:45.655" style="s2"> Is the hypothesis implicit in this malice</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.949" end="00:42:48.548" style="s2"> It&#39;s stuck in your memory lingering</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.835" end="00:42:51.373" style="s2"> Imprisoned in the representational structure</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.536" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2"> As an adult you have to fully express it</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.221" end="00:42:58.106" style="s2"> Then it is possible to get relief from it</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.311" end="00:42:59.335" style="s2"> This is not a joke</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.355" end="00:43:01.177" style="s2"> In many cases people need to go back to the past</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.177" end="00:43:02.630" style="s2"> This is the job of a psychoanalyst</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.896" end="00:43:05.332" style="s2"> People have to look back in the past to discover old things</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.352" end="00:43:07.910" style="s2"> Aware of the serious blow they bring to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.215" end="00:43:10.019" style="s2"> It’s not that people deliberately suppressed these memories</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.943" end="00:43:13.682" style="s2"> We will not discuss some of Freud&#39;s fallacies for now</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.866" end="00:43:16.241" style="s2"> He&#39;s a genius, so let&#39;s not talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.691" end="00:43:18.349" style="s2"> Sometimes it’s not suppressed</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.349" end="00:43:21.596" style="s2"> It’s because people were young when these bad things happened</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.596" end="00:43:23.772" style="s2"> They simply cannot have this ability</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.836" end="00:43:26.652" style="s2"> To figure out what happened and how to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.780" end="00:43:27.740" style="s2"> Or what is the meaning of these things</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.184" end="00:43:29.852" style="s2"> Then you can coexist with it</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.916" end="00:43:31.004" style="s2"> When you do</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.004" end="00:43:36.124" style="s2"> It’s as if your body is in contact with the world in stages</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.188" end="00:43:37.340" style="s2"> And it develops very fast</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.532" end="00:43:39.132" style="s2"> It may take years of development</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.196" end="00:43:41.052" style="s2"> But the initial stage of development is very rapid</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.180" end="00:43:43.503" style="s2"> Like you are walking on the street</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.503" end="00:43:46.364" style="s2"> Suddenly there was a loud noise behind me</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.366" end="00:43:47.454" style="s2"> You will make this defensive action</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.454" end="00:43:49.886" style="s2"> By the way, this is the predator defense response</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.886" end="00:43:50.782" style="s2"> You will squat like this</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.846" end="00:43:53.470" style="s2"> This posture is to prevent the other person from jumping on your back</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.534" end="00:43:55.006" style="s2"> So as to easily attack your neck</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.198" end="00:43:57.694" style="s2"> About a few hundred milliseconds of response time</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.694" end="00:43:59.550" style="s2"> The process is very fast and may be shorter than this</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.550" end="00:44:02.686" style="s2"> It&#39;s best to do so, otherwise it might be a snake</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.686" end="00:44:04.030" style="s2"> Can easily kill you</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.094" end="00:44:05.118" style="s2"> So you better respond quickly</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.310" end="00:44:06.462" style="s2"> But even this kind of efficiency is not high</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.718" end="00:44:09.214" style="s2"> It can deal with dangerous snakes at best</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.342" end="00:44:10.878" style="s2"> Or the swiftness of predatory cats</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.878" end="00:44:11.966" style="s2"> It will be the fastest</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.443" end="00:44:18.750" style="s2"> Then you can analyze and classify these experiences, which takes time</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.942" end="00:44:20.350" style="s2"> You are at the emotional level first</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.350" end="00:44:21.374" style="s2"> Then deal with them on a cognitive level</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.374" end="00:44:23.102" style="s2"> You can think about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.102" end="00:44:25.240" style="s2"> Maybe you meet at work</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.240" end="00:44:27.326" style="s2"> Especially maliciously aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.800" end="00:44:29.080" style="s2"> People often meet this kind of person</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.374" end="00:44:32.317" style="s2"> Like a bully</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.317" end="00:44:35.470" style="s2"> It&#39;s useless to do bad things all day long</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.412" end="00:44:37.976" style="s2"> And only spend the rest of my life in this state</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.286" end="00:44:40.078" style="s2"> Faced with this situation you are at a loss</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.812" end="00:44:42.881" style="s2"> You will be in &quot;prey&quot; mode</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.232" end="00:44:44.448" style="s2"> I’m not referring to the “prayer” pattern</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.448" end="00:44:45.536" style="s2"> Although it&#39;s kind of useful</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.367" end="00:44:48.096" style="s2"> I mean you will act like a predator</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.096" end="00:44:51.138" style="s2"> You have the following extremely complex issues to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.138" end="00:44:53.024" style="s2"> &quot;What&#39;s wrong with this person?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.747" end="00:44:55.328" style="s2"> &quot;Why make my life so bad&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.678" end="00:44:58.848" style="s2"> &quot;Is this treatment caused by me?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.175" end="00:45:01.088" style="s2"> It is not so easy to solve these mysteries</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.420" end="00:45:04.864" style="s2"> You are easily trapped inside and can&#39;t get out</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.052" end="00:45:05.952" style="s2"> Maybe you just can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.952" end="00:45:09.856" style="s2"> It may be for you to develop a clear view of good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.856" end="00:45:13.056" style="s2"> To face all the malice around me</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.120" end="00:45:16.320" style="s2"> And this kind of ability happens to be something you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.931" end="00:45:18.048" style="s2"> It&#39;s that simple</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.112" end="00:45:19.645" style="s2"> This is especially true for children</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.031" end="00:45:21.760" style="s2"> Even many adults can’t do it</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.760" end="00:45:23.872" style="s2"> To solve these problems is not so simple</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.128" end="00:45:25.845" style="s2"> Generally these are suffering from</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.033" end="00:45:28.507" style="s2"> What soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder have to face</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.507" end="00:45:30.475" style="s2"> Because of some terrible things they have experienced</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.475" end="00:45:32.432" style="s2"> Or something that you made or witnessed</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.808" end="00:45:35.211" style="s2"> They need to update their moral model of the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.211" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2"> Otherwise they will end up in a hell-like situation</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.798" end="00:45:44.645" style="s2"> So you have to know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.532" end="00:45:46.894" style="s2"> Is what this picture shows</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.894" end="00:45:47.944" style="s2"> Where do you live</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.238" end="00:45:49.326" style="s2"> You are always adjusting your course of action</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.326" end="00:45:51.246" style="s2"> Like a sailor on the boundless ocean</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.374" end="00:45:53.678" style="s2"> That&#39;s why you are a mobile creature</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.742" end="00:45:56.238" style="s2"> You are always on the way to a certain destination</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.691" end="00:45:58.542" style="s2"> Not like some kind of brainless marine life</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.542" end="00:46:01.422" style="s2"> Fix yourself on the rock motionless</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.536" end="00:46:01.550" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:46:01.550" end="00:46:03.406" style="s2"> There is a small animal called Hydra which is quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.406" end="00:46:03.440" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:46:04.186" end="00:46:05.326" style="s2"> Simple structure and compact size</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.916" end="00:46:08.924" style="s2"> The juvenile hydra has a brain because it needs to swim around</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.038" end="00:46:11.214" style="s2"> Until the Hydra reaches adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.214" end="00:46:15.054" style="s2"> It will attach to the rock and start digesting its own brain</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.324" end="00:46:17.614" style="s2"> If you just sit still on the rock</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.614" end="00:46:18.510" style="s2"> Of course you don’t need a brain</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.510" end="00:46:19.726" style="s2"> But we are not like this</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.790" end="00:46:21.582" style="s2"> We explore this world everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.646" end="00:46:22.926" style="s2"> We are navigators</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.926" end="00:46:26.574" style="s2"> There are two things you need to know to navigate for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.284" end="00:46:29.314" style="s2"> First, know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.314" end="00:46:32.893" style="s2"> You must know this precisely and clearly</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.220" end="00:46:35.265" style="s2"> You have to know your strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.265" end="00:46:37.338" style="s2"> From your personal point of view</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.236" end="00:46:39.404" style="s2"> You can refer to others’ opinions</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.404" end="00:46:41.132" style="s2"> But this is a problem you have to solve on your own</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.196" end="00:46:44.460" style="s2"> For example, when I assess the status quo, I say &quot;as far as I am concerned&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.812" end="00:46:46.941" style="s2"> &quot;What advantages do I have and which areas need improvement&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.465" end="00:46:50.955" style="s2"> At this time, you should also be careful not to criticize yourself too much</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.955" end="00:46:52.526" style="s2"> Because this behavior is actually a disadvantage</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.860" end="00:46:54.923" style="s2"> The next question is where are you going</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.553" end="00:46:56.715" style="s2"> What is your goal</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.121" end="00:46:59.217" style="s2"> This is the so-called frame</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.313" end="00:47:02.155" style="s2"> You can think deeply about this before you tackle it</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.475" end="00:47:05.035" style="s2"> You need to think clearly about the following questions</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.035" end="00:47:07.275" style="s2"> What kind of person are you</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.610" end="00:47:09.120" style="s2"> What is your goal and the reason for it</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.120" end="00:47:10.221" style="s2"> How do you achieve your goal</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.221" end="00:47:11.693" style="s2"> Few people think about these issues</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.693" end="00:47:16.109" style="s2"> As an educator, this really surprised me</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.207" end="00:47:21.741" style="s2"> I applied another project to my class</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.424" end="00:47:24.736" style="s2"> This is one of my project package series</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.736" end="00:47:26.415" style="s2"> Called &quot;Future Writing Project&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.858" end="00:47:29.212" style="s2"> This was developed when I opened the &quot;Map of Meaning&quot; series of courses</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.217" end="00:47:31.009" style="s2"> Some materials in my lectures are also derived from this</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.211" end="00:47:33.057" style="s2"> In class I asked students to write down their past</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.057" end="00:47:35.681" style="s2"> Are we talking about stories?</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.745" end="00:47:37.345" style="s2"> Why not tell your story</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.345" end="00:47:39.841" style="s2"> Who are you how did you get here what is your state now</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.357" end="00:47:43.216" style="s2"> This will help people calm down some of the problems in their lives</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.216" end="00:47:46.049" style="s2"> Although you will face a lot of pressure when implementing this method</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.480" end="00:47:48.976" style="s2"> The pressure goes up straight when you do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.976" end="00:47:51.002" style="s2"> You may be malaise for weeks</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.002" end="00:47:53.048" style="s2"> Then the pressure gradually eased and remained at a low level</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.309" end="00:47:55.595" style="s2"> This is why people usually don’t do this</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.595" end="00:47:57.360" style="s2"> After all, no one likes to put pressure on themselves</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.038" end="00:47:59.856" style="s2"> But if the pressure is only temporary, it&#39;s just a sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.772" end="00:48:02.928" style="s2"> I just said the next question is where will you go</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.928" end="00:48:06.256" style="s2"> There is something I can’t understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.921" end="00:48:11.834" style="s2"> Students who have received almost 14 years of education</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.056" end="00:48:13.596" style="s2"> Most of them are top students</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.904" end="00:48:16.145" style="s2"> They live so old</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.493" end="00:48:19.753" style="s2"> No one has ever asked them to sit down seriously for a day to answer a question</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.753" end="00:48:22.905" style="s2"> &quot;Okay, please come to prove the meaning of your existence.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.050" end="00:48:26.701" style="s2"> Tell the truth, you are in college</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.701" end="00:48:27.344" style="s2"> Taking a lot of classes</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.344" end="00:48:30.585" style="s2"> Made a vague business plan</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.825" end="00:48:33.246" style="s2"> Can you defend your meaning in life?</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.246" end="00:48:35.939" style="s2"> After all, this is what you want to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.048" end="00:48:37.964" style="s2"> Success or failure in one fell swoop</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.288" end="00:48:39.824" style="s2"> Ask yourself what your plan is</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.115" end="00:48:41.776" style="s2"> How can you be sure of your so-called life plan</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.840" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2"> It was not brainwashed by a boastful arrogant</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.919" end="00:48:47.088" style="s2"> If you haven’t considered this issue seriously</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.088" end="00:48:48.048" style="s2"> That&#39;s probably brainwashed</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.176" end="00:48:50.352" style="s2"> It’s best to think about whether you want to realize your so-called dream</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.814" end="00:48:53.232" style="s2"> Jung said such a sentence</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.695" end="00:48:55.984" style="s2"> &quot;You live in a story whether you know it or not.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.806" end="00:48:59.676" style="s2"> He made the following two great comments on this</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.106" end="00:49:02.080" style="s2"> &quot;If you live in other people’s stories,</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.080" end="00:49:03.963" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s very likely that you&#39;re just a perpetrator</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.468" end="00:49:06.106" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s not necessarily the role you want.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.837" end="00:49:08.188" style="s2"> &quot;Or maybe you are unaware of the story you are acting in</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.188" end="00:49:10.678" style="s2"> &quot;Then it is very likely that this story has a very negative ending&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.678" end="00:49:13.372" style="s2"> &quot;Or it&#39;s a totally bad story&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.810" end="00:49:15.804" style="s2"> If you don’t know what the story you are acting in is like</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.232" end="00:49:17.745" style="s2"> That’s probably what I just described</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.455" end="00:49:19.772" style="s2"> Maybe you live in a story led by your mother</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.772" end="00:49:21.948" style="s2"> Or your grandmother’s female elder</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.076" end="00:49:24.520" style="s2"> God knows where you learned it from</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.520" end="00:49:26.117" style="s2"> You are always affected by the surrounding environment and personnel</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.117" end="00:49:27.568" style="s2"> Humans are like this</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.985" end="00:49:31.434" style="s2"> Maybe you are unconsciously acting in a malicious tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.223" end="00:49:34.397" style="s2"> There is something you better ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.666" end="00:49:36.618" style="s2"> How miserable is your life?</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.810" end="00:49:38.154" style="s2"> Better to add the word futile</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.351" end="00:49:40.970" style="s2"> Ask yourself how miserable and useless your life is</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.482" end="00:49:45.002" style="s2"> You might say, uh, about 70% each</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.157" end="00:49:49.418" style="s2"> Then you are probably acting in a tragedy accidentally</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.365" end="00:49:52.119" style="s2"> Maybe this is not the best explanation</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.874" end="00:49:54.986" style="s2"> Otherwise, the whole world hates you</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.501" end="00:49:57.290" style="s2"> At least seven adults hate you</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.207" end="00:50:01.450" style="s2"> Anyway in this project</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.559" end="00:50:05.108" style="s2"> We asked the students to write down some details</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.492" end="00:50:06.660" style="s2"> Not about what they are after</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.092" end="00:50:08.756" style="s2"> This is not a business plan or something</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.290" end="00:50:11.232" style="s2"> This is the closest thing most people come up with</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.232" end="00:50:12.310" style="s2"> They have their own business plan</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.310" end="00:50:14.166" style="s2"> No, this is not just a matter of career planning</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.230" end="00:50:16.930" style="s2"> Career planning is important, yes but only secondary</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.930" end="00:50:19.919" style="s2"> For example, you have three years now</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.919" end="00:50:21.257" style="s2"> You have to live it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.777" end="00:50:25.355" style="s2"> Use these three years to create the environment around you</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.355" end="00:50:29.001" style="s2"> So that you can live as comfortable as possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.558" end="00:50:33.270" style="s2"> It&#39;s as if you are really taking care of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.353" end="00:50:35.318" style="s2"> What would everything be like if you did this</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.616" end="00:50:37.296" style="s2"> For convenience, let’s assume that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.641" end="00:50:39.094" style="s2"> If you know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.094" end="00:50:41.398" style="s2"> Then you can find what is most beneficial to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.495" end="00:50:43.638" style="s2"> What would it be</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.022" end="00:50:47.411" style="s2"> I guess you never asked yourself this question</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.528" end="00:50:49.654" style="s2"> Because people ignore this problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.083" end="00:50:51.510" style="s2"> All kinds of problems in life are like sneaking snakes</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.086" end="00:50:53.622" style="s2"> Waiting to give them a head-on blow</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.716" end="00:50:55.401" style="s2"> And many people just avoid the problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.689" end="00:50:56.858" style="s2"> As the years go by</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.182" end="00:50:59.927" style="s2"> People find that things are not developing as they thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.376" end="00:51:01.430" style="s2"> A large part of the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.070" end="00:51:03.350" style="s2"> People don&#39;t know where they are</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.670" end="00:51:04.572" style="s2"> Because they don&#39;t care about this</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.854" end="00:51:06.166" style="s2"> Or I don’t know that this is a problem that needs attention</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.482" end="00:51:08.150" style="s2"> That is ignorance and turning a blind eye, right</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.150" end="00:51:09.558" style="s2"> Two catastrophic causes</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.741" end="00:51:13.270" style="s2"> People never figure out their destination and why they want to go</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.186" end="00:51:16.470" style="s2"> There is a problem in finding a destination</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.150" end="00:51:20.950" style="s2"> It means that you must be clear in your heart what definition of failure is</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.816" end="00:51:22.806" style="s2"> People usually don&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.497" end="00:51:25.302" style="s2"> But if you&#39;ve been so confused</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.762" end="00:51:27.670" style="s2"> You will be unaware that you have failed</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.054" end="00:51:30.647" style="s2"> This is not so good because you just keep frustrating like this</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.898" end="00:51:33.549" style="s2"> But I&#39;m blinded to it</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.716" end="00:51:37.206" style="s2"> Although this way you can avoid a lot of suffering in the short term</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.881" end="00:51:40.532" style="s2"> But if you are clear about your definition of success</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.532" end="00:51:42.454" style="s2"> You will be soberly aware of your failures every time</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.454" end="00:51:44.797" style="s2"> This is a good thing so you have the opportunity to fix it</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.830" end="00:51:50.718" style="s2"> You can correct your defects in your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.782" end="00:51:54.823" style="s2"> Or some of your cognitive deficiencies in the situation</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.042" end="00:51:56.931" style="s2"> Or adjust your plan in time</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.140" end="00:51:58.601" style="s2"> It&#39;s not too late anyway</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.002" end="00:52:03.914" style="s2"> Good you are in this frame</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.054" end="00:52:07.589" style="s2"> In my opinion you have to make it become</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.589" end="00:52:08.998" style="s2"> A best life plan</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.998" end="00:52:11.106" style="s2"> Because you have no choice</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.211" end="00:52:13.038" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:52:13.038" end="00:52:14.290" style="s2"> If you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.290" end="00:52:14.562" style="s2"> Or not consciously</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.562" end="00:52:15.595" style="s2"> Or not consciously</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.637" end="00:52:17.777" style="s2"> As psychoanalysts pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.299" end="00:52:24.603" style="s2"> You are composed of countless quasi-autonomous subsystems</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.094" end="00:52:27.954" style="s2"> They can write stories improvised</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.121" end="00:52:29.301" style="s2"> And you are just practicing these stories</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.666" end="00:52:30.553" style="s2"> You know it well</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.553" end="00:52:32.516" style="s2"> Because if you observe yourself for more than two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.610" end="00:52:33.330" style="s2"> You will miss my goodness</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.330" end="00:52:35.230" style="s2"> How many stupid things I did in these two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.856" end="00:52:37.035" style="s2"> Then you will think why</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.349" end="00:52:40.626" style="s2"> That&#39;s because you are a random</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.626" end="00:52:43.309" style="s2"> Quasi-autonomous personality unit</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.956" end="00:52:45.470" style="s2"> Not one dominant</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.741" end="00:52:47.777" style="s2"> They activate whenever they want</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.194" end="00:52:49.468" style="s2"> At first you were hungry and then you were thirsty again</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.541" end="00:52:51.044" style="s2"> Then you want to sleep with your wife</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.701" end="00:52:52.808" style="s2"> Then you want to sleep in</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.808" end="00:52:54.144" style="s2"> You want to scold your boss</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.154" end="00:52:56.608" style="s2"> You still want to curse the guy who drove you on the road</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.453" end="00:52:59.092" style="s2"> You are like a two year old</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.209" end="00:53:03.747" style="s2"> Emotional patterns emerge one after another</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.747" end="00:53:04.937" style="s2"> They compete with each other for dominance</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.021" end="00:53:07.035" style="s2"> There is no top-down hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.317" end="00:53:08.987" style="s2"> There is no king at the top</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.449" end="00:53:11.106" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:53:11.106" end="00:53:13.392" style="s2"> We have discussed the capability pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.392" end="00:53:14.645" style="s2"> The most advanced ability is</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.645" end="00:53:15.209" style="s2"> The most advanced ability is</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.209" end="00:53:17.150" style="s2"> An ability to integrate all of these together</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.745" end="00:53:19.457" style="s2"> This is explained in the field of neurology</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.468" end="00:53:20.992" style="s2"> I will explain to you later</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.992" end="00:53:22.432" style="s2"> This is explained in the field of neurology</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.443" end="00:53:25.658" style="s2"> In a sense how are these</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.658" end="00:53:28.299" style="s2"> Mapped to the neural structure of your being</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.175" end="00:53:30.804" style="s2"> You want to control something</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.349" end="00:53:33.987" style="s2"> You want to control</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.987" end="00:53:37.035" style="s2"> It should be the ability to pay attention and learn, right</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.422" end="00:53:40.825" style="s2"> Everything else in the hierarchy must give way</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.825" end="00:53:43.570" style="s2"> Your attention and learning ability</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.248" end="00:53:44.823" style="s2"> You can think</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.875" end="00:53:47.620" style="s2"> This is the meaning of logos</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.808" end="00:53:48.466" style="s2"> There is no doubt about this</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.466" end="00:53:49.363" style="s2"> Because in the logos</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.384" end="00:53:51.503" style="s2"> Part is attention and part is communication</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.910" end="00:53:53.768" style="s2"> You can learn a lot from communicating with other people</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.217" end="00:53:56.628" style="s2"> You need to know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.495" end="00:53:58.716" style="s2"> It’s like your own GPS</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.862" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2"> It is the closest we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.553" end="00:54:02.756" style="s2"> Smart control system stuff</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.756" end="00:54:04.123" style="s2"> Such as your car GPS device</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.123" end="00:54:05.501" style="s2"> These things are very smart</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.025" end="00:54:08.612" style="s2"> They know where you are and where to go</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.612" end="00:54:09.656" style="s2"> Of course if you deviate from the route</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.656" end="00:54:11.159" style="s2"> They will recalculate your route</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.618" end="00:54:13.069" style="s2"> These things are almost alive</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.111" end="00:54:15.052" style="s2"> They are too close to smart</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.305" end="00:54:17.881" style="s2"> You can see this because they are acting in a smart way</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.891" end="00:54:19.593" style="s2"> They constantly solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.305" end="00:54:23.225" style="s2"> By the way, this is a cybernetic model</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.246" end="00:54:26.545" style="s2"> Cybernetic model is the basic model of GPS system</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.545" end="00:54:27.526" style="s2"> This is not accidental</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.194" end="00:54:29.311" style="s2"> You need to know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.311" end="00:54:30.772" style="s2"> You need to know where you are going</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.898" end="00:54:32.296" style="s2"> The next thing you need to know is</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.547" end="00:54:36.329" style="s2"> How will you act how to move your body</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.329" end="00:54:39.530" style="s2"> Drive yourself in time and space</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.010" end="00:54:41.754" style="s2"> From one end to the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.351" end="00:54:45.887" style="s2"> Next we can come to something more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.981" end="00:54:47.213" style="s2"> Because this is too simple</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.568" end="00:54:48.267" style="s2"> We do</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.259" end="00:54:51.388" style="s2"> So to be precise you don’t live in such a</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.795" end="00:54:54.509" style="s2"> But you live in these levels of nesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.927" end="00:54:58.079" style="s2"> You can think of this as your own internal patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.090" end="00:54:59.582" style="s2"> This is a good way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.843" end="00:55:01.294" style="s2"> It might be a tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.294" end="00:55:03.038" style="s2"> It may also be something that can give you</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.038" end="00:55:06.023" style="s2"> Security and autonomous functions</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.023" end="00:55:07.610" style="s2"> Maybe this is what you are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.965" end="00:55:09.217" style="s2"> But this is a battle, know it</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.365" end="00:55:13.914" style="s2"> There is something authoritarian in everyone&#39;s heart</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.804" end="00:55:18.706" style="s2"> So in the highest level of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.332" end="00:55:21.733" style="s2"> This will be the most important story</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.973" end="00:55:23.737" style="s2"> Maybe you think &quot;I want to be a good person&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.810" end="00:55:26.503" style="s2"> &quot;Or I want to become famous&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.649" end="00:55:28.601" style="s2"> I think &quot;good&quot; may be preferable</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.779" end="00:55:31.273" style="s2"> Because you can define &quot;good&quot; whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.284" end="00:55:33.361" style="s2"> As long as it is not too disgusting</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.511" end="00:55:36.827" style="s2"> Otherwise they will only hinder you</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.537" end="00:55:38.685" style="s2"> It&#39;s no good</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.810" end="00:55:40.010" style="s2"> So you have to negotiate with people</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.720" end="00:55:42.192" style="s2"> Suppose you are a good person</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.236" end="00:55:45.908" style="s2"> This is a story at the highest level</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.908" end="00:55:48.152" style="s2"> Then you can break it down into</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.152" end="00:55:49.562" style="s2"> Your main roles</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.697" end="00:55:50.710" style="s2"> Maybe you are a good parent</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.710" end="00:55:52.547" style="s2"> Maybe you are a good employer</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.547" end="00:55:53.768" style="s2"> Maybe you are a good employee</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.217" end="00:55:55.501" style="s2"> Maybe you are a good brother</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.501" end="00:55:56.503" style="s2"> Maybe you are a good boy</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.681" end="00:55:58.674" style="s2"> These are the main roles you play in life</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.737" end="00:56:01.795" style="s2"> So you would say a good person</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.795" end="00:56:05.292" style="s2"> Is the common trait of the strengths of all your roles</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.386" end="00:56:09.395" style="s2"> Is a high-level abstraction extracted from more similar things</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.395" end="00:56:15.094" style="s2"> Take the role of &quot;good parents&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.365" end="00:56:17.756" style="s2"> &quot;What are the elements that make up a good parent?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.756" end="00:56:19.269" style="s2"> You might say &quot;a good parent&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.468" end="00:56:21.054" style="s2"> Obviously this is not meant to be deadly</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.357" end="00:56:26.106" style="s2"> &quot;Good parents need to have a good job and be able to take care of their families&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.106" end="00:56:26.785" style="s2"> Then you might say</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.858" end="00:56:29.708" style="s2"> &quot;What does it mean to take good care of my family?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.708" end="00:56:30.616" style="s2"> Then you will say</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.616" end="00:56:33.445" style="s2"> &quot;That means you can cook something unusual.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.539" end="00:56:34.760" style="s2"> I hope it&#39;s not too unusual</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.230" end="00:56:36.326" style="s2"> &quot;You can cook something unusual.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.514" end="00:56:38.758" style="s2"> &quot;It also means you can play with your baby.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.123" end="00:56:39.917" style="s2"> Then you will say</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.917" end="00:56:41.221" style="s2"> &quot;Then how to play with the baby?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.221" end="00:56:42.307" style="s2"> Then you will say</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.307" end="00:56:45.802" style="s2"> &quot;Play peekaboo or tickling with your baby&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.286" end="00:56:48.351" style="s2"> Here is a cool conversion</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.372" end="00:56:52.046" style="s2"> Because these can be clarified and conceptualized, right</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.443" end="00:56:53.497" style="s2"> Up to this level</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.497" end="00:56:54.958" style="s2"> Then suddenly came to your body</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.324" end="00:56:56.775" style="s2"> Because how would you play peekaboo with your baby</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.140" end="00:57:00.480" style="s2"> You won’t discuss with him how you play peekaboo, do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:02.996" style="s2"> You will be like this it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.996" end="00:57:04.426" style="s2"> You can even play this game with seniors</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.426" end="00:57:05.929" style="s2"> They will even be amused, right</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.015" end="00:57:10.418" style="s2"> &quot;Dad is gone&quot; The baby is terrified</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.418" end="00:57:12.244" style="s2"> &quot;Where did he go? Look at him again.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.288" end="00:57:16.274" style="s2"> The baby is playing with the reliability of this world</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.493" end="00:57:18.758" style="s2"> So this is really an intense game for babies</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.167" end="00:57:22.067" style="s2"> Like this, &quot;oh no dad is gone&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.088" end="00:57:23.455" style="s2"> &quot;Oh look, he shows up again&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.455" end="00:57:24.582" style="s2"> &quot;Oh no, he disappeared again&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.969" end="00:57:28.549" style="s2"> And Dad’s smile shows those brief disappearances</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.549" end="00:57:33.497" style="s2"> It&#39;s not that there is fear beyond the processing power</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.708" end="00:57:37.088" style="s2"> The key is if you play peekaboo with a baby</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.088" end="00:57:38.601" style="s2"> You won&#39;t think about anything anymore</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.622" end="00:57:40.929" style="s2"> This is not in the realm of expression or abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.929" end="00:57:43.225" style="s2"> But what you actually do with your body</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.716" end="00:57:44.802" style="s2"> So for me it is a good</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.459" end="00:57:48.205" style="s2"> Multi-stage methods to solve mental and physical problems</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.205" end="00:57:49.551" style="s2"> Because the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.582" end="00:57:54.040" style="s2"> Higher levels of abstraction are clear and conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.415" end="00:57:56.681" style="s2"> But if you fully decompose it</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.962" end="00:57:58.591" style="s2"> Will become actual behavior</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.601" end="00:58:02.119" style="s2"> These behaviors involve movement of the muscular system</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.411" end="00:58:03.873" style="s2"> This is not a conceptual thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.197" end="00:58:07.171" style="s2"> The great thing about this hierarchical order is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.194" end="00:58:10.230" style="s2"> It contains educational significance</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.480" end="00:58:11.910" style="s2"> If you want to teach others or even teach yourself something</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.973" end="00:58:14.353" style="s2"> One thing you need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.937" end="00:58:17.693" style="s2"> You have to give the highest resolution possible</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.714" end="00:58:21.897" style="s2"> A detailed description of this need to be performed</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.401" end="00:58:23.925" style="s2"> I will give you a concise example</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.042" end="00:58:27.651" style="s2"> I may repeat this but it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.090" end="00:58:29.656" style="s2"> For example, you have a three-year-old child</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.656" end="00:58:31.367" style="s2"> Their house is a mess</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.910" end="00:58:34.676" style="s2"> Monsters will come out from under their bed at any time</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.676" end="00:58:37.390" style="s2"> Unless there is some order in the room</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.445" end="00:58:40.898" style="s2"> You tell your child &quot;clean up the messy house&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.200" end="00:58:42.234" style="s2"> You left and come back</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.234" end="00:58:44.238" style="s2"> The children still look like throwing Lego bricks everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.823" end="00:58:45.689" style="s2"> They didn&#39;t clean up at all</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.689" end="00:58:47.902" style="s2"> You think that is a bad boy</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.121" end="00:58:49.269" style="s2"> Then this is a bad inference</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.447" end="00:58:52.610" style="s2"> Because you point directly from the highest point to the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.100" end="00:58:55.605" style="s2"> If you want to fight with the people and destroy them</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.605" end="00:58:56.514" style="s2"> Then you have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.514" end="00:58:59.071" style="s2"> You don’t even think about the details</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.123" end="00:59:03.309" style="s2"> Just stabbed to the point and said &quot;You are a bad boy, stupid boy&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.476" end="00:59:05.605" style="s2"> &quot;And you&#39;ve always been so rotten wood that cannot be carved&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.710" end="00:59:07.526" style="s2"> &quot;I can&#39;t teach you anything&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.946" end="00:59:10.846" style="s2"> This way you can lock in with the same humiliation</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.846" end="00:59:12.578" style="s2"> His past, present and future</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.808" end="00:59:15.063" style="s2"> &quot;You have always been such a bad person&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.365" end="00:59:16.660" style="s2"> &quot;There is nothing to teach you.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.660" end="00:59:18.580" style="s2"> &quot;And your future will always be like this.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.914" end="00:59:22.338" style="s2"> If you treat them like this, they will only be left to beat you</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.766" end="00:59:26.503" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s like this, you won&#39;t be able to recover</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.503" end="00:59:27.965" style="s2"> You have completely restricted them</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.965" end="00:59:30.104" style="s2"> So if you want a quarrel that is meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.355" end="00:59:33.591" style="s2"> You just say &quot;past now and future&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.601" end="00:59:34.864" style="s2"> &quot;You are not a good person&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.864" end="00:59:37.036" style="s2"> Destroy their conceptual structure</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.464" end="00:59:40.292" style="s2"> Let them be completely exposed to the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.365" end="00:59:42.474" style="s2"> Very good you won a big quarrel</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.933" end="00:59:46.138" style="s2"> But this is not a good thing for your long-term partner</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.138" end="00:59:49.687" style="s2"> Unless you want them to be scared to death</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.286" end="00:59:54.301" style="s2"> The attitude towards you has also been shaped into</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.384" end="00:59:56.628" style="s2"> Extreme and endless resentment</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.213" end="00:59:58.737" style="s2"> In this example, it will not affect your emotional life</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.747" end="01:00:00.940" style="s2"> How much benefit</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.253" end="01:00:03.142" style="s2"> So for a three-year-old child, what you might want to do is</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.155" end="01:00:07.985" style="s2"> Choose the level of analysis they can actually operate</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.518" end="01:00:09.593" style="s2"> If you pay attention to a child</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.937" end="01:00:11.274" style="s2"> This is all you can do</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.274" end="01:00:13.194" style="s2"> Many adults will not pay attention to children</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.194" end="01:00:14.175" style="s2"> Because they are afraid of children</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.635" end="01:00:16.795" style="s2"> They are afraid that they will make mistakes with their children</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.338" end="01:00:19.228" style="s2"> Or afraid that children don’t like them</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.228" end="01:00:20.334" style="s2"> Or something else</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.274" end="01:00:22.902" style="s2"> What you need to do to make your child like you</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.933" end="01:00:25.376" style="s2"> Spend two seconds following him</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.376" end="01:00:27.223" style="s2"> He will like you immediately</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.933" end="01:00:34.096" style="s2"> Attention is the ultimate wealth of children</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.342" end="01:00:36.148" style="s2"> They need adult attention</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.148" end="01:00:37.923" style="s2"> Because adults know so much more than them</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.027" end="01:00:38.821" style="s2"> They like to be followed</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.134" end="01:00:40.501" style="s2"> All you have to do is follow them</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.522" end="01:00:41.973" style="s2"> They will like you immediately</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.537" end="01:00:44.374" style="s2"> So you have to tell the child</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.010" end="01:00:45.981" style="s2"> &quot;Have you seen a teddy bear?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.837" end="01:00:47.557" style="s2"> The children said &quot;I saw it&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.027" end="01:00:49.718" style="s2"> Then you are sure that the child has</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.739" end="01:00:53.278" style="s2"> Mastered the art of perceiving teddy bears</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.988" end="01:00:54.791" style="s2"> They will say &quot;yes&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.823" end="01:00:56.378" style="s2"> This is a complicated thing, friends</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.317" end="01:00:58.758" style="s2"> A six-month-old child can’t do it</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.102" end="01:01:00.971" style="s2"> A three-year-old child has already put the whole teddy bear</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.263" end="01:01:03.706" style="s2"> The recognition subroutine is automated</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.645" end="01:01:05.574" style="s2"> &quot;Teddy Bear&quot; &quot;Yes&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.846" end="01:01:07.422" style="s2"> &quot;Can you pick it up&quot; &quot;Yes&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.155" end="01:01:10.866" style="s2"> Touch your head &quot;good job&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.877" end="01:01:12.965" style="s2"> &quot;Did you see the hole in the shelf?&quot; &quot;I saw it?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.643" end="01:01:16.827" style="s2"> &quot;Can you put the teddy bear on the shelf?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.349" end="01:01:20.397" style="s2"> &quot;Let it go&quot; Touch your head &quot;It&#39;s great&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.428" end="01:01:23.977" style="s2"> OK &quot;Now we do the second thing and the third thing&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.196" end="01:01:26.326" style="s2"> You are building a whole set from the bottom up</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.409" end="01:01:28.142" style="s2"> Micro routine procedures for cleaning the room</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.486" end="01:01:30.626" style="s2"> You construct these into their bodies</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.668" end="01:01:33.132" style="s2"> Because you start with what they have automated</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.466" end="01:01:35.825" style="s2"> Constructed to the level of abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.877" end="01:01:38.278" style="s2"> So once the child has all the micro routine procedures</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.499" end="01:01:42.944" style="s2"> How many microprograms are there to clean the room 200?</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.841" end="01:01:45.898" style="s2"> Many but not unlimited</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.190" end="01:01:47.798" style="s2"> So you teach them all the microprograms</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.798" end="01:01:51.639" style="s2"> Then you can say &quot;Run a set of microprograms&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.649" end="01:01:53.382" style="s2"> This means cleaning your room</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.382" end="01:01:54.322" style="s2"> Then they can do</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.322" end="01:01:55.251" style="s2"> They know what it means</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.274" end="01:01:57.871" style="s2"> But you have to build from the bottom up</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.912" end="01:02:00.835" style="s2"> Many times when you are arguing with someone</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.835" end="01:02:01.503" style="s2"> This person lives with you</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.503" end="01:02:02.704" style="s2"> Suppose you love this person too</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.704" end="01:02:04.280" style="s2"> Although these two situations are difficult</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.280" end="01:02:06.399" style="s2"> Simultaneously in the same relationship</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.829" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2"> What you want to do is before assuming that this person is not at ease</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.200" end="01:02:14.645" style="s2"> Let&#39;s assume that this person is ignorant</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.781" end="01:02:17.829" style="s2"> This is a good rule of thumb for peacemaking</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.132" end="01:02:21.044" style="s2"> So maybe if your partner doesn’t do something</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.180" end="01:02:23.654" style="s2"> Maybe something happened here on the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.977" end="01:02:25.720" style="s2"> But you might want to assume that at first</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.741" end="01:02:27.297" style="s2"> They actually don&#39;t know how to do it</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.735" end="01:02:29.019" style="s2"> Then you need to break it down</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.102" end="01:02:30.731" style="s2"> Maybe you want when you go home</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.731" end="01:02:31.858" style="s2"> Get a certain form of greeting</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.255" end="01:02:34.081" style="s2"> Because you might go home from outside every day</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.416" end="01:02:37.276" style="s2"> This may be a five-minute or ten-minute interaction</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.338" end="01:02:38.476" style="s2"> So one hour a week</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.486" end="01:02:40.658" style="s2"> There are 4 hours a month and 50 hours a year</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.940" end="01:02:42.631" style="s2"> Or a whole weekday</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.704" end="01:02:44.833" style="s2"> Have time for interaction when going home</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.773" end="01:02:49.301" style="s2"> As long as you make this type of interaction 50 times correct</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.843" end="01:02:51.545" style="s2"> Your relationship can be straightened out</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.234" end="01:02:54.071" style="s2"> This is really worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.123" end="01:02:56.712" style="s2"> Because that&#39;s it you don&#39;t have so much time, right</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.317" end="01:02:58.476" style="s2"> Plan three meals well</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.497" end="01:03:00.031" style="s2"> Five hours a day are spent on this</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.386" end="01:03:03.173" style="s2"> Plan your sleep time properly</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.476" end="01:03:06.754" style="s2"> Achieve between you and your partner on a voluntary and negotiated basis</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.370" end="01:03:09.927" style="s2"> Effective operation of repeated basic interactions</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.188" end="01:03:12.328" style="s2"> You will spend 80% of your life like this</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.328" end="01:03:13.904" style="s2"> Then it becomes a daily routine</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.436" end="01:03:15.585" style="s2"> This would be really helpful</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.585" end="01:03:17.578" style="s2"> If you don&#39;t do it consciously</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.578" end="01:03:19.509" style="s2"> Especially because our characters are fragmented</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.509" end="01:03:21.576" style="s2"> And most of the traditional characters have disappeared</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.576" end="01:03:23.507" style="s2"> No one knows who exactly should do what</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.779" end="01:03:25.313" style="s2"> For example, when cooking</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.814" end="01:03:26.900" style="s2"> No one is doing business</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.900" end="01:03:29.175" style="s2"> In addition to scolding and fighting and doing dark dishes</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.666" end="01:03:33.486" style="s2"> Or buy fast food, etc.</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.551" end="01:03:38.351" style="s2"> Instead of causing such a catastrophic failure</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.351" end="01:03:40.637" style="s2"> Or continue to hate the fight</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.023" end="01:03:42.432" style="s2"> It’s better to use consensus and negotiation</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.432" end="01:03:45.178" style="s2"> Rebuild the entire structure from the bottom up</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.825" end="01:03:46.545" style="s2"> you can do it</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.618" end="01:03:49.833" style="s2"> You can think of this as a patriarchal structure</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.397" end="01:03:51.127" style="s2"> This inference is good</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.127" end="01:03:52.787" style="s2"> I mean it has psychological meaning</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.787" end="01:03:55.136" style="s2"> Because these are what you do as a person</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.136" end="01:03:58.800" style="s2"> But it also has political, economic and sociological significance</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.509" end="01:04:01.336" style="s2"> When you are doing these things</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.576" end="01:04:04.781" style="s2"> You also hope that it is not only acceptable to society</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.781" end="01:04:08.027" style="s2"> It is done in a way that society expects</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.833" end="01:04:11.722" style="s2"> This is the decomposition</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.900" end="01:04:14.802" style="s2"> Reasons for preventing the spread of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.637" end="01:04:18.434" style="s2"> It’s not your belief system group that stopped the spread of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.155" end="01:04:20.167" style="s2"> Not so abstract</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.198" end="01:04:22.683" style="s2"> But if you do the right thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.745" end="01:04:25.324" style="s2"> The chances of terrible things happening to you are reduced</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.213" end="01:04:28.413" style="s2"> It is psychologically meaningful to a certain extent</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.413" end="01:04:29.666" style="s2"> Maybe you will struggle less</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.666" end="01:04:32.056" style="s2"> Maybe you become less anxious and less depressed</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.056" end="01:04:33.862" style="s2"> But it has practical meaning to a large extent</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.240" end="01:04:39.457" style="s2"> Know if your child doesn’t leave the skateboard on the stairs</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.457" end="01:04:41.555" style="s2"> You won’t break your neck so often</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.848" end="01:04:43.267" style="s2"> This is not just a psychological matter</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.267" end="01:04:46.138" style="s2"> It’s a good thing to not hurt your neck often</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.138" end="01:04:49.238" style="s2"> So this structure is not only psychologically</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.238" end="01:04:51.806" style="s2"> Stop chaos from spreading</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.685" end="01:05:01.472" style="s2"> Here is another perspective to examine the hierarchical order of narrative</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.380" end="01:05:04.269" style="s2"> That is, the structure prevents the chaos from spreading</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.603" end="01:05:08.382" style="s2"> Maybe this is the structure I use in writing</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.737" end="01:05:10.376" style="s2"> I do all these things at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.397" end="01:05:11.712" style="s2"> This is pretty cool</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.244" end="01:05:13.121" style="s2"> When i asked a student</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.695" end="01:05:15.324" style="s2"> &quot;What are you doing when you write the paper&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.524" end="01:05:18.372" style="s2"> This question is difficult to answer, right</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.138" end="01:05:22.537" style="s2"> This is a broad and important question</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.006" end="01:05:25.011" style="s2"> If you want to write a thesis you have to ask yourself this question first</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.251" end="01:05:28.267" style="s2"> Pay attention to all words, phrases and sentences</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.990" end="01:05:32.328" style="s2"> And the relationship between sentences in paragraphs</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.610" end="01:05:35.251" style="s2"> Relationship between paragraphs in the article</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.491" end="01:05:38.100" style="s2"> The relationship between the article and the class</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.142" end="01:05:40.334" style="s2"> And how this class relates to your life</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.493" end="01:05:44.666" style="s2"> This paper permeates your entire life</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.031" end="01:05:47.286" style="s2"> So if i am writing</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.672" end="01:05:52.672" style="s2"> So obviously in the analysis of the highest level of resolution</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.672" end="01:05:54.781" style="s2"> My fingers move on the keyboard</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.073" end="01:05:57.411" style="s2"> My eyes move back and forth on the screen</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.735" end="01:05:59.624" style="s2"> This is where the mind and the body meet</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.157" end="01:06:02.255" style="s2"> Then I tried to conceive a sentence</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.808" end="01:06:04.259" style="s2"> Try to come up with a good sentence</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.384" end="01:06:07.725" style="s2"> A sentence that can express what I want to conceive</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.735" end="01:06:08.967" style="s2"> And then try to take it apart</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.468" end="01:06:10.720" style="s2"> I tried this in many ways</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.065" end="01:06:13.048" style="s2"> I wrote this sentence and moved it to another page</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.059" end="01:06:15.459" style="s2"> Then I wrote ten different variations of this sentence</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.522" end="01:06:17.046" style="s2"> See if you can find a better variant</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.401" end="01:06:19.791" style="s2"> Then I tried to think about how stupid this sentence can be</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.906" end="01:06:24.249" style="s2"> See if I can find a crowbar to pry it open and let it fall apart</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.656" end="01:06:28.737" style="s2"> If I can&#39;t do this, I will keep the existing sentence</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.737" end="01:06:31.493" style="s2"> Then I followed the ten sentences in a paragraph</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.493" end="01:06:34.384" style="s2"> Then make sure that every sentence in this paragraph is organized properly</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.395" end="01:06:37.641" style="s2"> So by rewriting different variants</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.996" end="01:06:40.731" style="s2"> Try to use words, phrases and sentences as accurate as possible</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.731" end="01:06:43.674" style="s2"> Also make the order of sentences correct and the order of paragraphs correct</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.885" end="01:06:46.639" style="s2"> At this time I can say it is good enough</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.806" end="01:06:48.246" style="s2"> Because i have tried my best</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.528" end="01:06:49.603" style="s2"> This does not mean that it is completely correct</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.927" end="01:06:51.733" style="s2"> It just means i can&#39;t make it better</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.775" end="01:06:54.092" style="s2"> So I came to the conclusion that if I write a paragraph</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.708" end="01:06:55.793" style="s2"> Then I wrote a variant</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.992" end="01:06:57.787" style="s2"> And I can’t tell if its variant is better</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.787" end="01:06:59.374" style="s2"> It may even be worse then I&#39;ll finish it</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.384" end="01:07:01.983" style="s2"> I have reached the limit of my knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.317" end="01:07:03.445" style="s2"> It&#39;s time to continue writing</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.831" end="01:07:08.361" style="s2"> But this does not represent the paper I wrote</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.570" end="01:07:11.796" style="s2"> It has a very tight boundary</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.796" end="01:07:13.695" style="s2"> Because I wrote this paper for a reason</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.695" end="01:07:17.443" style="s2"> That’s I’m trying to write a complete manuscript</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.558" end="01:07:19.666" style="s2"> I hope to try to deal with an important problem like this</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.666" end="01:07:21.430" style="s2"> Otherwise why should I do this</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.056" end="01:07:23.507" style="s2"> I mean it becomes a bit pointless</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.831" end="01:07:26.232" style="s2"> Maybe this is part of my role as a scientist</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.378" end="01:07:29.165" style="s2"> Is part of my role as a professor</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.186" end="01:07:32.411" style="s2"> Is also part of my role as a viable citizen</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.411" end="01:07:36.253" style="s2"> It’s me as a person who dares to face the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.253" end="01:07:37.672" style="s2"> Part of such a role</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.059" end="01:07:42.443" style="s2"> You see this is why Logos is in</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.443" end="01:07:43.580" style="s2"> At the top of this hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.113" end="01:07:47.088" style="s2"> The hierarchical order in everything else should be constructed like this</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.831" end="01:07:50.178" style="s2"> Because you have a structure and you want</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.209" end="01:07:51.973" style="s2"> What should this structure belong to</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.349" end="01:07:54.280" style="s2"> The answer should be like this</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.791" end="01:07:56.159" style="s2"> This structure should belong to</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.159" end="01:07:58.487" style="s2"> The process that generated it</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.019" end="01:08:00.741" style="s2"> Or this structure should be subordinate to</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.741" end="01:08:03.309" style="s2"> The process of generating it and maintaining it</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.810" end="01:08:06.378" style="s2"> Obviously, what else could it be?</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.430" end="01:08:07.965" style="s2"> Unless the structure is absolutely perfect</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.654" end="01:08:10.626" style="s2"> If you do</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.647" end="01:08:12.088" style="s2"> Things that can generate it and improve it</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.453" end="01:08:13.810" style="s2"> But then you become a totalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.821" end="01:08:15.292" style="s2"> Like this &quot;Hey we have the answer&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.480" end="01:08:16.618" style="s2"> &quot;No you don&#39;t&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.067" end="01:08:19.551" style="s2"> People are still suffering they are still dying</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.885" end="01:08:21.232" style="s2"> You don’t have the so-called &quot;answer&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.432" end="01:08:24.259" style="s2"> Maybe the answer you currently have is to show</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.259" end="01:08:27.161" style="s2"> There would be more suffering and death in the world now</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.558" end="01:08:30.386" style="s2"> But there are still many roads to explore</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.127" end="01:08:38.236" style="s2"> So it makes sense that everything can be included</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.113" end="01:08:42.411" style="s2"> I regard it as the highest criterion of moral pursuit</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.017" end="01:08:44.802" style="s2"> Then this also gives you a moral hierarchy order</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.021" end="01:08:47.307" style="s2"> This is the most important</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.631" end="01:08:51.263" style="s2"> Be cautious and honest</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.326" end="01:08:52.223" style="s2"> You should act like this</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.654" end="01:08:57.889" style="s2"> Don&#39;t sacrifice any of it because if you sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.175" end="01:09:00.355" style="s2"> It will erode your soul</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.866" end="01:09:02.871" style="s2"> There is such a view in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.320" end="01:09:06.284" style="s2"> The sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is the only sin that cannot be forgiven</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.294" end="01:09:07.704" style="s2"> No one understands what this means</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.006" end="01:09:09.050" style="s2"> Maybe it doesn&#39;t mean anything</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.395" end="01:09:11.086" style="s2"> But I think the following is its meaning</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.931" end="01:09:15.814" style="s2"> Because this process generates all these</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.148" end="01:09:19.687" style="s2"> If you violate this process</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.708" end="01:09:20.470" style="s2"> Then you are incurable because through it</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.470" end="01:09:23.059" style="s2"> Then you are incurable because through it</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.059" end="01:09:24.833" style="s2"> You can improve yourself</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.833" end="01:09:26.837" style="s2"> And improve others and everything</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.150" end="01:09:29.165" style="s2"> So if you decide you don’t participate</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.165" end="01:09:31.336" style="s2"> Then it&#39;s hopeless</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.336" end="01:09:31.441" style="s2"> Because you deviated</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.441" end="01:09:32.902" style="s2"> Because you deviated</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.933" end="01:09:34.290" style="s2"> Things that get things fixed and resolved</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.290" end="01:09:35.908" style="s2"> Things that get things fixed and resolved</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.908" end="01:09:36.691" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:09:39.322" end="01:09:41.670" style="s2"> So this is the way to stop chaos from spreading</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.952" end="01:09:42.985" style="s2"> Part of it is structural</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.466" end="01:09:46.587" style="s2"> You know more or less how to do these things</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.608" end="01:09:47.954" style="s2"> This part is your whole set of skills</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.954" end="01:09:49.342" style="s2"> If you happen to be a writer</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.353" end="01:09:50.981" style="s2"> You can also construct a set for plumbers</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.981" end="01:09:52.693" style="s2"> In fact, they all work the same</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.881" end="01:09:56.096" style="s2"> But the external things are the same</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.096" end="01:09:59.948" style="s2"> I think this is why in the Judeo-Christian tradition</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.334" end="01:10:04.781" style="s2"> There is an assumption that people and people are essentially equal before God</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.282" end="01:10:10.950" style="s2"> That means everyone should be nested in it</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.201" end="01:10:14.917" style="s2"> Regardless of their particularity as individuals</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.355" end="01:10:17.714" style="s2"> Their highest level function is this</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.215" end="01:10:20.063" style="s2"> They do what they can to achieve this</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.355" end="01:10:22.641" style="s2"> This is extremely valuable</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.641" end="01:10:24.802" style="s2"> Perhaps the most valuable</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.188" end="01:10:27.558" style="s2"> Socio-political and economic functions</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.756" end="01:10:28.758" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:10:28.758" end="01:10:30.125" style="s2"> This is why people are valuable</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.125" end="01:10:30.251" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:10:30.658" end="01:10:34.384" style="s2"> We have this function to continuously produce improvements</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.614" end="01:10:37.944" style="s2"> To optimize the structure in which we live together</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.967" end="01:10:39.447" style="s2"> awesome</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.689" end="01:10:41.702" style="s2"> This is great</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.764" end="01:10:46.827" style="s2"> Because this gives the fundamental unity in the analysis of the highest order</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.213" end="01:10:51.242" style="s2"> At the same time, it also has the largest controllable limit of diversity space</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.545" end="01:10:56.211" style="s2"> The facts show that the more different substructures, the better</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.211" end="01:10:58.769" style="s2"> Because you can do something different from what I do</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.873" end="01:11:00.992" style="s2"> It’s good because if we all do the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.992" end="01:11:02.432" style="s2"> Becomes repetitive work</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.432" end="01:11:05.397" style="s2"> If we agree on the highest principle</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.397" end="01:11:07.526" style="s2"> Then specialize in refinement at a lower level</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.526" end="01:11:10.752" style="s2"> It’s like you have bear paws and fish to eat</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.263" end="01:11:12.913" style="s2"> This is a rare situation</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.587" end="01:11:18.528" style="s2"> Another rule of thumb is</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.560" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2"> If you are trying to solve a problem</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.760" end="01:11:23.320" style="s2"> As far as possible before you dare to climb to a higher level</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.476" end="01:11:26.869" style="s2"> Solve it from the highest possible resolution level</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.727" end="01:11:30.136" style="s2"> As you move up into a more abstract hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.136" end="01:11:30.595" style="s2"> As you move up into a more abstract hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.595" end="01:11:33.027" style="s2"> When trying to solve this problem</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.027" end="01:11:33.225" style="s2"> When trying to solve this problem</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.225" end="01:11:36.211" style="s2"> The probability of causing catastrophic errors will increase dramatically</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.399" end="01:11:38.748" style="s2"> Because the power of abstraction is extremely powerful</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.165" end="01:11:40.491" style="s2"> So you have to be very cautious</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.491" end="01:11:45.449" style="s2"> We saw it when the housing loan market collapsed</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.449" end="01:11:45.460" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:11:45.460" end="01:11:48.570" style="s2"> The reason for its collapse was the improper use of financial derivatives</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.570" end="01:11:52.140" style="s2"> They are like high-level abstractions of the financial world</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.464" end="01:11:56.378" style="s2"> Financial derivatives provide you with a huge amount of capital leverage</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.378" end="01:11:58.267" style="s2"> And power are accompanied by huge risks</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.343" end="01:12:01.545" style="s2"> The benefits are huge, no doubt</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.566" end="01:12:03.090" style="s2"> Because you can double your profit</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.518" end="01:12:06.660" style="s2"> But the disadvantage is the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.672" end="01:12:12.516" style="s2"> I have to say that a more wise and conservative spirit is</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.059" end="01:12:18.685" style="s2"> Solve this problem from the most specific level with the highest resolution</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.956" end="01:12:22.850" style="s2"> This is safer and more likely to produce practical solutions</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.077" end="01:12:27.620" style="s2"> Now you plan</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.620" end="01:12:28.277" style="s2"> Now you plan</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.277" end="01:12:28.508" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:12:28.508" end="01:12:28.539" style="s2"> Let’s simplify it again and it’s this small map</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.539" end="01:12:30.732" style="s2"> Let’s simplify it again and it’s this small map</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.732" end="01:12:31.055" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:12:31.055" end="01:12:32.725" style="s2"> But everything else is nested inside</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.725" end="01:12:33.424" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:12:33.424" end="01:12:34.551" style="s2"> So when you walk happily on the road of your life</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.551" end="01:12:35.480" style="s2"> So when you walk happily on the road of your life</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.480" end="01:12:37.338" style="s2"> So when you walk happily on the road of your life</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.338" end="01:12:38.299" style="s2"> So when you walk happily on the road of your life</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.487" end="01:12:41.837" style="s2"> What happened is in the process of moving from A to B</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.224" end="01:12:43.403" style="s2"> You encountered something</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.301" end="01:12:46.910" style="s2"> People think they encounter objective objects</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.088" end="01:12:48.236" style="s2"> But it’s not the case</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.570" end="01:12:50.533" style="s2"> First of all the vast majority of you</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.564" end="01:12:53.351" style="s2"> Actually everyone else is not an objective object</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.455" end="01:12:54.593" style="s2"> They are terribly complicated</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.063" end="01:12:58.048" style="s2"> Even outside the social world</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.080" end="01:13:00.324" style="s2"> What you encounter is not an objective object</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.449" end="01:13:03.226" style="s2"> They look more like tools or obstacles</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.654" end="01:13:05.282" style="s2"> I&#39;m not saying that we see objects</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.282" end="01:13:06.817" style="s2"> And then directly turn them into tools or obstacles</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.848" end="01:13:08.936" style="s2"> I mean we will see tools or obstacles</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.113" end="01:13:14.113" style="s2"> Because when you are all geared towards your goal</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.042" end="01:13:20.178" style="s2"> At this time the world transforms into three types of things for you</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.345" end="01:13:21.660" style="s2"> A stumbling block that hinders the goal</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.224" end="01:13:23.549" style="s2"> These are what you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.967" end="01:13:26.743" style="s2"> Two boosters that make it easier for you to achieve your goals</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.994" end="01:13:28.100" style="s2"> Those are what you like</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.455" end="01:13:29.593" style="s2"> Three other unrelated things</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.990" end="01:13:32.505" style="s2"> In most cases what you want is irrelevant</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.505" end="01:13:33.675" style="s2"> Because there are so many things</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.290" end="01:13:36.869" style="s2"> The unimportant things you really like</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.798" end="01:13:39.938" style="s2"> Most things are irrelevant</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.938" end="01:13:40.856" style="s2"> If you have a good plan</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.201" end="01:13:42.182" style="s2"> Some things are good</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.338" end="01:13:43.487" style="s2"> Because they will push you forward</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.497" end="01:13:44.865" style="s2"> Some things are not so good</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.261" end="01:13:47.130" style="s2"> You want to take a detour for things that are not so good</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.171" end="01:13:47.735" style="s2"> If you can do it</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.735" end="01:13:50.658" style="s2"> Unless you like to hit the south wall with one head</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.658" end="01:13:53.466" style="s2"> It&#39;s not very wise but it is also a learning experience</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.539" end="01:13:55.073" style="s2"> But I won’t let it repeat too many times</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.898" end="01:14:01.190" style="s2"> You want the world to be displayed in the form of a set of tools</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.942" end="01:14:04.541" style="s2"> And what works here is your perception system</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.656" end="01:14:05.981" style="s2"> It is conducted by dopamine</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.981" end="01:14:05.991" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:14:05.991" end="01:14:09.478" style="s2"> This sensory system can also be cocaine methamphetamine</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.478" end="01:14:11.190" style="s2"> Or activated by other drugs that people like</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.119" end="01:14:15.741" style="s2"> The dopaminergic system will affect what you encounter</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.773" end="01:14:17.881" style="s2"> Things that help promote you toward your goals</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.881" end="01:14:19.812" style="s2"> Give positive emotions as a response</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.731" end="01:14:22.526" style="s2"> It&#39;s important to know this</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.038" end="01:14:24.885" style="s2"> Because people tend to think they are happy</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.885" end="01:14:26.305" style="s2"> Because they achieved their goals</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.305" end="01:14:28.539" style="s2"> It’s not so true</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.539" end="01:14:29.917" style="s2"> Because once you achieve a goal</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.917" end="01:14:30.814" style="s2"> A question came right away</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.898" end="01:14:31.942" style="s2"> That&#39;s what the next goal is</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.234" end="01:14:33.528" style="s2"> This is actually a big problem</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.591" end="01:14:35.940" style="s2"> You will meet it as soon as you graduate from university</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.940" end="01:14:36.514" style="s2"> This is an example</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.307" end="01:14:38.299" style="s2"> I used to make this joke</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.959" end="01:14:44.144" style="s2"> You are like the king among undergraduates on graduation day</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.844" end="01:14:46.503" style="s2"> You lost your job the next day</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.503" end="01:14:48.048" style="s2"> May work at Starbucks</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.240" end="01:14:54.186" style="s2"> So the obvious accomplishment itself</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.186" end="01:14:56.754" style="s2"> The source of rewards is problematic</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.766" end="01:15:01.086" style="s2"> When you are finished, the whole framework is over</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.096" end="01:15:03.194" style="s2"> Then you need a new framework</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.633" end="01:15:04.457" style="s2"> This is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.677" end="01:15:07.245" style="s2"> But if you can meet</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.245" end="01:15:10.418" style="s2"> The things that push you forward are great</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.418" end="01:15:12.516" style="s2"> This is where you can get positive motivation</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.048" end="01:15:15.783" style="s2"> This is very worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.128" end="01:15:17.579" style="s2"> You think it can last a year</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.579" end="01:15:19.280" style="s2"> It even takes longer</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.280" end="01:15:20.240" style="s2"> Because it means</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.825" end="01:15:21.973" style="s2"> It means to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.045" end="01:15:26.002" style="s2"> The Buddhists are right about Maya</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.002" end="01:15:27.558" style="s2"> Maya means people live in illusions</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.693" end="01:15:30.480" style="s2"> They mean if you have a goal</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.940" end="01:15:31.973" style="s2"> No matter what your goal is</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.662" end="01:15:35.334" style="s2"> Will connect you to the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.919" end="01:15:38.090" style="s2"> You can change your connection to the world in an instant</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.455" end="01:15:41.514" style="s2"> You can do this just by changing your goals</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.576" end="01:15:43.633" style="s2"> Then you think about it, this is an illusion</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.654" end="01:15:45.199" style="s2"> Because you can change it</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.543" end="01:15:47.944" style="s2"> You don’t want to push this argument too far</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.944" end="01:15:53.361" style="s2"> Because even specific points can be changed</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.612" end="01:15:56.806" style="s2"> The fact that you are in a certain frame cannot be changed</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.276" end="01:15:58.539" style="s2"> So you have to be in a frame</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.549" end="01:15:59.812" style="s2"> Although you can choose a framework</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.812" end="01:16:01.357" style="s2"> But there is always an absolute principle</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.357" end="01:16:02.662" style="s2"> That is you must be in a frame</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.860" end="01:16:04.666" style="s2"> This is not an absolute principle that does not matter</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.666" end="01:16:06.743" style="s2"> But a very important absolute principle</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.151" end="01:16:09.781" style="s2"> Then you think about all your positive emotions</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.792" end="01:16:12.892" style="s2"> It&#39;s all from the relationship between you and the target</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.581" end="01:16:16.107" style="s2"> Then we think we need some positive emotions</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.483" end="01:16:17.579" style="s2"> This is a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.829" end="01:16:24.844" style="s2"> Positive emotions suppress anxiety, disappointment, depression and pain</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.115" end="01:16:27.725" style="s2"> It can do it technically like this</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.725" end="01:16:29.708" style="s2"> This is why a rugby player has injured his thumb</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.906" end="01:16:33.894" style="s2"> Still desperate when trying to score a touchdown</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.238" end="01:16:36.483" style="s2"> Although this kind of goal has great uncertainty</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.817" end="01:16:40.668" style="s2"> Really? You have to risk your hand injury</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.668" end="01:16:44.771" style="s2"> Have you thrown a piece of pig skin over several posts?</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.587" end="01:16:48.977" style="s2"> Well you can also be so cynic</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.977" end="01:16:50.867" style="s2"> Most of the things people do</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.222" end="01:16:53.299" style="s2"> But you can&#39;t mock a fact</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.309" end="01:16:54.457" style="s2"> That people have to do something</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.948" end="01:16:57.495" style="s2"> So you have your intention</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.495" end="01:16:59.713" style="s2"> You have your goals, you have your ambitions</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.460" end="01:17:03.403" style="s2"> This can turn the world into a potentially positive place</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.716" end="01:17:06.242" style="s2"> This is really surprising, this is cool</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.140" end="01:17:09.645" style="s2"> The higher the goal, the more positive emotions</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.161" end="01:17:13.633" style="s2"> You think &quot;Why should I&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.186" end="01:17:17.245" style="s2"> &quot;Why do I bother to do noble and difficult things?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.925" end="01:17:19.583" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s worth doing</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.351" end="01:17:27.245" style="s2"> Otherwise the remaining option is to suffer stupidly really</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.245" end="01:17:33.194" style="s2"> Because you don’t need to build a framework to suffer</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.228" end="01:17:39.249" style="s2"> You just lie there and suffer day after day, right?</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.499" end="01:17:41.963" style="s2"> It&#39;s easy this is the default situation</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.286" end="01:17:44.520" style="s2"> If you don&#39;t have lofty ambitions</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.948" end="01:17:46.775" style="s2"> Then you will suffer misfortune</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.078" end="01:17:51.055" style="s2"> Because life is really complicated, short and limited</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.566" end="01:17:53.591" style="s2"> Full of suffering and beyond your control</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.873" end="01:17:56.597" style="s2"> You can just lie there thinking it&#39;s scary</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.025" end="01:17:59.687" style="s2"> It&#39;s useless and useless</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.073" end="01:18:02.558" style="s2"> People often say that life is meaningless</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.798" end="01:18:05.032" style="s2"> But it&#39;s not so wrong</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.094" end="01:18:06.837" style="s2"> If life is meaningless, it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.837" end="01:18:08.716" style="s2"> You can sit here and do nothing, it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.967" end="01:18:12.370" style="s2"> It’s like you become a sheep with the brain lobes removed</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.798" end="01:18:14.009" style="s2"> Everything becomes irrelevant</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.343" end="01:18:15.397" style="s2"> But it is not the case</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.804" end="01:18:18.174" style="s2"> When people say that life is meaningless</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.257" end="01:18:19.290" style="s2"> They didn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.677" end="01:18:20.501" style="s2"> What they want to express is</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.616" end="01:18:23.435" style="s2"> &quot;My pain is so stupid and strong</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.435" end="01:18:24.969" style="s2"> &quot;And I don&#39;t know what to do with it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.969" end="01:18:25.470" style="s2"> &quot;And I don&#39;t know what to do with it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.470" end="01:18:25.627" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:18:25.627" end="01:18:27.046" style="s2"> Put it this way, suffering is full of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.046" end="01:18:27.359" style="s2"> Put it this way, suffering is full of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.579" end="01:18:29.249" style="s2"> It’s just that its meaning is not what you want</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.656" end="01:18:30.741" style="s2"> So how do you get out of this situation</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.042" end="01:18:39.979" style="s2"> You have drawn a painful baseline and this line is very high</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.700" end="01:18:41.963" style="s2"> Then you say to yourself</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.963" end="01:18:43.936" style="s2"> Okay, I need to do something to live up to the suffering</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.105" end="01:18:46.660" style="s2"> It&#39;s not easy to pain the baseline is high</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.660" end="01:18:48.654" style="s2"> It&#39;s not easy to pain the baseline is high</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.654" end="01:18:49.019" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:18:49.019" end="01:18:50.668" style="s2"> If you are going to achieve something</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.668" end="01:18:51.305" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:18:51.723" end="01:18:55.052" style="s2"> So that I didn&#39;t live in vain</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.564" end="01:19:00.313" style="s2"> Then you have to pursue things that are perfectly constructed</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.647" end="01:19:01.566" style="s2"> So that you can tell</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.733" end="01:19:05.940" style="s2"> &quot;Despite the death of my family from the earthquake and cancer</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.961" end="01:19:08.998" style="s2"> &quot;The disillusionment of what I ask for, the ultimate futility of life</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.082" end="01:19:10.877" style="s2"> &quot;Even the heat death of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.211" end="01:19:13.581" style="s2"> &quot;But it doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s worth it&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.416" end="01:19:23.382" style="s2"> There is another factor that complicates the situation</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.977" end="01:19:26.639" style="s2"> So I said when you pursue your goals</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.670" end="01:19:30.105" style="s2"> There are three things you will encounter</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.984" end="01:19:34.009" style="s2"> I would say if you want to set a goal</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.270" end="01:19:35.272" style="s2"> Or you have to make a plan</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.721" end="01:19:37.673" style="s2"> Look at the next three to five years</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.602" end="01:19:40.877" style="s2"> You can only get one situation for the further future</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.568" end="01:19:43.998" style="s2"> Combinatorial explosion</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.823" end="01:19:47.412" style="s2"> That is, there are so many variables that you cannot predict</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.495" end="01:19:49.572" style="s2"> So looking forward to 20 years does not make much sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.666" end="01:19:52.714" style="s2"> Because how could you know what will happen in 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.080" end="01:19:55.856" style="s2"> I don’t know you can know it for three years at most</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.232" end="01:19:58.486" style="s2"> Maybe you can make a three-year itinerary</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.622" end="01:19:59.792" style="s2"> Or about five years</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.792" end="01:20:04.165" style="s2"> It&#39;s not bad considering this for a while</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.750" end="01:20:07.975" style="s2"> Then think about what your life must be like</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.975" end="01:20:10.063" style="s2"> To make it worth visiting for you</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.407" end="01:20:12.808" style="s2"> You also need to know if life is not worth living</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.808" end="01:20:14.134" style="s2"> What would you look like</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.677" end="01:20:15.846" style="s2"> If you think it&#39;s not worth living</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.846" end="01:20:17.975" style="s2"> You will become Cain</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.666" end="01:20:20.501" style="s2"> He is like you</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.501" end="01:20:21.900" style="s2"> This is what this story tells</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.078" end="01:20:25.846" style="s2"> Abel is a man of purpose and he made appropriate sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.222" end="01:20:29.447" style="s2"> Cain is one because of his own fault</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.458" end="01:20:30.470" style="s2"> At least to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.919" end="01:20:32.286" style="s2"> And people who are not going well</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.746" end="01:20:36.597" style="s2"> Sacrificing improper default results</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.650" end="01:20:38.153" style="s2"> Is bitter and bitter</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.487" end="01:20:40.825" style="s2"> What to say with the potential</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.587" end="01:20:44.291" style="s2"> Murderous hatred</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.489" end="01:20:46.963" style="s2"> You will put it into practice</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.984" end="01:20:48.977" style="s2"> People in the world have been performing this kind of drama</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.280" end="01:20:50.032" style="s2"> This is not surprising</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.032" end="01:20:56.086" style="s2"> Because if there is nothing noble to lead you forward</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.420" end="01:20:58.664" style="s2"> Then the baseline is stupid pain</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.894" end="01:21:02.015" style="s2"> If you have a dog, you will tie it to the backyard</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.599" end="01:21:05.762" style="s2"> Put a collar on it because the collar is too tight and it keeps grinding its skin</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.762" end="01:21:09.082" style="s2"> It doesn’t even make it all around</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.249" end="01:21:10.940" style="s2"> It&#39;s terribly hot in the sun</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.940" end="01:21:12.558" style="s2"> Maybe you didn&#39;t give it enough water</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.215" end="01:21:14.802" style="s2"> It would not be a happy dog</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.585" end="01:21:17.787" style="s2"> Its basic situation is suffering</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.996" end="01:21:20.376" style="s2"> People do the same</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.537" end="01:21:25.982" style="s2"> Okay, we don’t know if you remember</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.556" end="01:21:29.635" style="s2"> You may have all seen or heard of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.635" end="01:21:29.645" style="s2"> You may have all seen or heard of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.729" end="01:21:32.255" style="s2"> There is a very cool plot in &quot;Pinocchio&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.892" end="01:21:35.501" style="s2"> In order to make his puppet</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.399" end="01:21:39.739" style="s2"> Become a wise autonomous life</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.971" end="01:21:42.286" style="s2"> He made a wish to the stars</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.652" end="01:21:44.781" style="s2"> It’s very strange but everyone accepted this setting</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.792" end="01:21:46.566" style="s2"> Because when we accept something completely ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.566" end="01:21:49.677" style="s2"> Can&#39;t notice the absurdity of things</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.754" end="01:21:54.959" style="s2"> A puppeteer in an animation made a wish to the stars</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.959" end="01:21:56.712" style="s2"> Then his puppet will move</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.712" end="01:21:59.123" style="s2"> However, everyone nodded and said, &quot;This is fine.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.458" end="01:22:00.376" style="s2"> There is nothing</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.794" end="01:22:03.048" style="s2"> This is simply unreasonable but the point is not here</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.268" end="01:22:06.295" style="s2"> This is different from what we usually understand</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.389" end="01:22:08.946" style="s2"> This is a meta-consensus, everyone can understand</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.270" end="01:22:10.668" style="s2"> And what Geppetto did is</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.180" end="01:22:14.040" style="s2"> Raise his eyes above the horizon</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.384" end="01:22:16.670" style="s2"> Beyond the boundaries of the world</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.827" end="01:22:18.706" style="s2"> Or pass-through</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.092" end="01:22:21.639" style="s2"> So as to achieve a certain strong purpose through transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.639" end="01:22:23.247" style="s2"> You can see the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.696" end="01:22:27.568" style="s2"> It surpasses you straight into heaven and overlooks all beings</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.142" end="01:22:30.355" style="s2"> It is very close to our goal</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.846" end="01:22:32.036" style="s2"> And there is a star there</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.130" end="01:22:35.063" style="s2"> That is an eternal star shining in the dark</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.543" end="01:22:37.777" style="s2"> Geppetto reached an agreement with Transcendent there</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.986" end="01:22:39.656" style="s2"> He said to make my creation come alive</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.084" end="01:22:42.067" style="s2"> I am willing to pay any price</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.121" end="01:22:46.086" style="s2"> This is exactly what you want to set up for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.566" end="01:22:51.044" style="s2"> You have to figure out which star you want to be your guide</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.545" end="01:22:53.915" style="s2"> You must ask yourself</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.491" end="01:22:58.716" style="s2"> &quot;If you have a chance to make your life meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.708" end="01:23:00.794" style="s2"> &quot;What is the price you have to pay&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.545" end="01:23:02.453" style="s2"> &quot;what do you need&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.685" end="01:23:05.783" style="s2"> The first thing to do is to find the question first</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.940" end="01:23:06.837" style="s2"> You have to hint yourself like this first</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.890" end="01:23:07.923" style="s2"> You will feel scared</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.975" end="01:23:09.426" style="s2"> Because you think &quot;I will never reach it&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.520" end="01:23:11.410" style="s2"> Then lower your eyes first</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.441" end="01:23:15.428" style="s2"> Don&#39;t expect to get a 24m super yacht in half a year</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.783" end="01:23:17.025" style="s2"> It just makes you look stupid</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.572" end="01:23:21.524" style="s2"> First of all, it won&#39;t make you happy</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.597" end="01:23:25.032" style="s2"> So it is unwise</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.334" end="01:23:27.850" style="s2"> You should be like asking someone you care about</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.871" end="01:23:29.249" style="s2"> Ask yourself this question</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.865" end="01:23:32.328" style="s2"> For example, suppose you are talking to some</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.328" end="01:23:33.194" style="s2"> Talk to your favorite 12-year-old kid</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.549" end="01:23:34.771" style="s2"> You think, &quot;Thank God, if this kid is going well</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.781" end="01:23:36.827" style="s2"> &quot;That&#39;s also a good thing.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.579" end="01:23:39.865" style="s2"> Hope you do the same</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.042" end="01:23:42.109" style="s2"> The universe doesn’t care if you are doing well</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.109" end="01:23:44.144" style="s2"> Don&#39;t care if your pain can be reduced a bit</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.531" end="01:23:47.735" style="s2"> Especially when you are not imposing pain on others</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.017" end="01:23:49.823" style="s2"> If you can suffer a little bit less sin</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.823" end="01:23:52.203" style="s2"> Make slight improvements wherever you go</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.641" end="01:23:54.677" style="s2"> Then the universe may have no objection to this</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.460" end="01:23:56.723" style="s2"> I think if you keep silent about it</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.723" end="01:23:57.986" style="s2"> You could have escaped guilt</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.643" end="01:24:00.773" style="s2"> So ask yourself that question first</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.190" end="01:24:04.771" style="s2"> When you have established your goals</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.771" end="01:24:05.554" style="s2"> You have found your position</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.554" end="01:24:07.109" style="s2"> What you know is good for you</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.683" end="01:24:09.071" style="s2"> Because it helps your future development</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.155" end="01:24:10.929" style="s2"> The next thing will happen at the perceptual level</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.929" end="01:24:12.213" style="s2"> You don&#39;t need to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.620" end="01:24:15.334" style="s2"> The experimental articles on this aspect have made it very clear</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.334" end="01:24:19.040" style="s2"> For example, suppose I put the podium</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.040" end="01:24:21.597" style="s2"> As the end of my next move</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.775" end="01:24:23.800" style="s2"> Then I will be very happy when I walk over</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.800" end="01:24:24.499" style="s2"> Because the podium is there</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.499" end="01:24:26.201" style="s2"> Things are going as I wish</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.764" end="01:24:30.167" style="s2"> And suppose I want to go to that exit sign</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.188" end="01:24:31.211" style="s2"> You may not see the exit sign</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.211" end="01:24:35.105" style="s2"> But there is an obstacle</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.105" end="01:24:36.848" style="s2"> Then when I set this goal</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.848" end="01:24:38.936" style="s2"> That&#39;s an annoying obstacle</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.374" end="01:24:40.627" style="s2"> This is foreseeable</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.128" end="01:24:43.664" style="s2"> It can be predicted the moment I set my goal</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.249" end="01:24:51.368" style="s2"> In fact, your being is displayed in these frames</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.712" end="01:24:54.238" style="s2"> But the good thing is that these frameworks can be changed for you</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.478" end="01:24:55.157" style="s2"> This does not mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.157" end="01:24:57.537" style="s2"> You can do things like juggling with planets</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.840" end="01:25:00.428" style="s2"> But it does provide you with a range</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.700" end="01:25:04.917" style="s2"> A world in which it is unconstrained</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.959" end="01:25:06.274" style="s2"> If this framework doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.274" end="01:25:07.078" style="s2"> You can also adjust it</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.098" end="01:25:09.280" style="s2"> Sometimes you even have to make major adjustments</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.291" end="01:25:09.739" style="s2"> Anyway that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.969" end="01:25:11.566" style="s2"> You don’t have to fix yourself in a certain frame</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.566" end="01:25:14.374" style="s2"> As if it is the ideology you want to dedicate to</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.531" end="01:25:15.752" style="s2"> This is just a tentative plan</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.752" end="01:25:16.869" style="s2"> Develops with progress</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.080" end="01:25:19.447" style="s2"> In the &quot;Future Writing Plan&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.447" end="01:25:21.180" style="s2"> One of my suggestions is</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.410" end="01:25:22.725" style="s2"> Everyone should scrawl the plan</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.362" end="01:25:25.084" style="s2"> Because you can&#39;t make a correct plan</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.230" end="01:25:29.875" style="s2"> But a reasonable plan is much better than no plan</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.948" end="01:25:32.902" style="s2"> Then there is a reasonable plan with an in-depth process embedded in it</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.549" end="01:25:37.600" style="s2"> After this process is activated, the plan will be continuously optimized</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.819" end="01:25:39.792" style="s2"> So it’s important to start with a reasonable plan</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.199" end="01:25:42.349" style="s2"> You don’t need to worry about whether it’s correct</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.756" end="01:25:45.011" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t matter if it is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.188" end="01:25:46.817" style="s2"> The point is that something is better than nothing</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.911" end="01:25:49.311" style="s2"> Now you have parsed the world into two parts</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.439" end="01:25:53.330" style="s2"> Part of it will make you happy as long as you see it</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.468" end="01:25:57.151" style="s2"> The other part is the stumbling block that causes negative emotions</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.391" end="01:25:59.301" style="s2"> And a whole bunch of other insignificant things</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.405" end="01:26:01.483" style="s2"> Because most things are unrelated</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.276" end="01:26:03.842" style="s2"> And all the chaos hides in it</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.531" end="01:26:06.681" style="s2"> That is, chaos hides in unrelated things</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.748" end="01:26:10.230" style="s2"> This is a very interesting phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.230" end="01:26:12.652" style="s2"> Since chaos is actually infinite</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.652" end="01:26:14.625" style="s2"> The question is where did you put them</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.063" end="01:26:16.650" style="s2"> The answer is of course placed in a place that you overlooked</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.234" end="01:26:17.965" style="s2"> As long as it does not actively affect your process</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.975" end="01:26:21.055" style="s2"> You can ignore it</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.076" end="01:26:24.343" style="s2"> You can assume it doesn’t matter</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.833" end="01:26:28.195" style="s2"> Assuming it means nothing</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.261" end="01:26:31.660" style="s2"> Anyway, the next thing to say is the key</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.660" end="01:26:36.201" style="s2"> There is another kind of things you may encounter in this process</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.858" end="01:26:38.508" style="s2"> This is the outburst of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.374" end="01:26:40.032" style="s2"> Now suppose</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.222" end="01:26:47.808" style="s2"> You are moving from point A to point B</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.061" end="01:26:51.973" style="s2"> Something unexpected happened on the road</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.278" end="01:26:54.207" style="s2"> Some obstacles appeared</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.295" end="01:26:58.414" style="s2"> Suppose you are living with someone</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.414" end="01:26:59.614" style="s2"> Maybe you have a good impression of this person</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.865" end="01:27:00.574" style="s2"> You are not married yet</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.950" end="01:27:02.036" style="s2"> It can be seen that I haven&#39;t liked it to that level</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.161" end="01:27:03.716" style="s2"> Otherwise, you will definitely propose to the other party</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.328" end="01:27:10.011" style="s2"> A quarter of you are expecting better things</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.032" end="01:27:12.923" style="s2"> And three-quarters of you say you are getting better</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.637" end="01:27:17.631" style="s2"> This is because we are conflicted about this type of thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.631" end="01:27:19.468" style="s2"> Then you find someone</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.468" end="01:27:21.963" style="s2"> Or that person admits that he has always had an affair</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.518" end="01:27:26.305" style="s2"> So how should you respond emotionally?</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.900" end="01:27:29.384" style="s2"> Part of you is not very loyal to this relationship</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.395" end="01:27:30.888" style="s2"> So this part of you is a little bit excited about it</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.888" end="01:27:34.176" style="s2"> And three-quarters of you are still indulged in it so you are sad</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.270" end="01:27:36.848" style="s2"> In the argument after you</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.848" end="01:27:37.934" style="s2"> You will definitely use the latter part</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.132" end="01:27:39.186" style="s2"> Without saying</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.364" end="01:27:42.182" style="s2"> &quot;Oh, you betrayed me. I think I&#39;m still a little excited.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.501" end="01:27:48.362" style="s2"> But the point is that this is a loophole</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.961" end="01:27:53.518" style="s2"> This seems to be a structure you can walk on</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.518" end="01:27:55.773" style="s2"> Such as thin ice that can slide</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.044" end="01:27:57.130" style="s2"> Now there is a hole in this structure</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.061" end="01:28:00.595" style="s2"> We don&#39;t even know how deep this hole is</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.606" end="01:28:01.691" style="s2"> But you know there is a hole there</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.025" end="01:28:03.330" style="s2"> Now you feel anxious about it</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.403" end="01:28:05.094" style="s2"> Maybe also a little excited</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.094" end="01:28:06.691" style="s2"> Because god knows what&#39;s down there</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.090" end="01:28:10.481" style="s2"> But you are at a loss for this hole</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.491" end="01:28:13.121" style="s2"> Because it may have a bad effect on you</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.121" end="01:28:16.848" style="s2"> Maybe this whole relationship is a cover</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.725" end="01:28:20.564" style="s2"> And all your romances are just a cover</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.877" end="01:28:23.393" style="s2"> Because you are so shallow</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.393" end="01:28:26.973" style="s2"> So that you can&#39;t establish a substantial relationship</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.172" end="01:28:29.865" style="s2"> Part of the reason may be that you don’t pay attention to others</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.865" end="01:28:32.067" style="s2"> It may be because you are vicious and selfish</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.652" end="01:28:34.228" style="s2"> Realize that these are quite uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.499" end="01:28:37.485" style="s2"> Or maybe this is the kind of person you attract</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.485" end="01:28:38.842" style="s2"> In fact, this makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.842" end="01:28:40.501" style="s2"> If you are this kind of person</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.877" end="01:28:43.716" style="s2"> So certain things you might encounter</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.727" end="01:28:45.971" style="s2"> It will pierce your heart</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.420" end="01:28:49.698" style="s2"> And in those heartbreaking moments</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.708" end="01:28:52.433" style="s2"> Will follow the entire predictive hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.938" end="01:28:56.545" style="s2"> A logical conclusion is</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.545" end="01:28:58.069" style="s2"> You got cheated in a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.069" end="01:29:00.574" style="s2"> It shows that you are really a bad guy</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.002" end="01:29:05.835" style="s2"> Another logical conclusion is</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.835" end="01:29:07.892" style="s2"> The person with you is a bad person</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.892" end="01:29:09.781" style="s2"> Another logical conclusion is</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.053" end="01:29:12.151" style="s2"> Everyone is really bad</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.750" end="01:29:17.224" style="s2"> At the macro and micro level</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.224" end="01:29:18.257" style="s2"> You can&#39;t trust anyone</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.257" end="01:29:19.896" style="s2"> You can&#39;t trust women or men</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.896" end="01:29:21.973" style="s2"> You cannot believe in humans you cannot believe in yourself</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.276" end="01:29:25.303" style="s2"> Everything is a disaster nightmare</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.919" end="01:29:28.737" style="s2"> Then you will fall into chaos</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.883" end="01:29:30.742" style="s2"> Otherwise your body will react</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.138" end="01:29:34.071" style="s2"> Let’s say you think you should be promoted</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.071" end="01:29:36.764" style="s2"> This is great and you are all discussing promotion</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.307" end="01:29:41.211" style="s2"> You were summoned by your boss and walked into the office</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.524" end="01:29:43.790" style="s2"> The boss says</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.790" end="01:29:47.088" style="s2"> &quot;We observed your performance in recent years&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.247" end="01:29:53.894" style="s2"> &quot;Your performance is only slightly super mediocre&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.894" end="01:29:55.428" style="s2"> &quot;And we are just about to scale down.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.149" end="01:29:56.702" style="s2"> &quot;So goodbye to you&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.176" end="01:30:01.566" style="s2"> This is definitely not talking about promotion or salary increase</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.422" end="01:30:04.092" style="s2"> This is a pothole you fell into</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.520" end="01:30:07.589" style="s2"> The question is how do you think about it, right</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.153" end="01:30:09.405" style="s2"> How would you define it</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.405" end="01:30:11.566" style="s2"> How would you accept the chaos that just emerged</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.879" end="01:30:13.215" style="s2"> And establish an order that can be accommodated</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.299" end="01:30:13.967" style="s2"> You do not know</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.186" end="01:30:17.182" style="s2"> &quot;Is the entire capitalist system rotten from beginning to end&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.547" end="01:30:19.238" style="s2"> I mean in this case</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.238" end="01:30:21.211" style="s2"> This must be a convenient explanation</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.545" end="01:30:23.957" style="s2"> Is your boss a perverted bastard</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.405" end="01:30:26.838" style="s2"> Did you choose the wrong major when you entered the university?</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.848" end="01:30:28.372" style="s2"> Is it your father&#39;s fault</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.372" end="01:30:29.833" style="s2"> Because he never allowed you to do what you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.833" end="01:30:31.911" style="s2"> Or is it because you resigned yourself to the consequences?</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.401" end="01:30:34.082" style="s2"> Or because this is a sunset industry</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.082" end="01:30:36.764" style="s2"> Or is it reminding you to join another business</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.764" end="01:30:38.455" style="s2"> Do something you always wanted to do</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.518" end="01:30:40.668" style="s2"> Things you can fight for your whole life</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.668" end="01:30:44.238" style="s2"> This is why you are so painful in your current career</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.238" end="01:30:45.762" style="s2"> Because you can’t do what you really want to do</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.762" end="01:30:47.391" style="s2"> And feel pain and resentment</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.038" end="01:30:48.863" style="s2"> God knows why</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.863" end="01:30:50.387" style="s2"> These thoughts emerged together in an instant</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.940" end="01:30:52.234" style="s2"> This is annoying</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.234" end="01:30:54.833" style="s2"> Because these ideas are too many</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.366" end="01:30:58.998" style="s2"> This is the reemergence of chaos, this is the flood</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.000" end="01:31:02.641" style="s2"> It’s like returning to the beginning of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.641" end="01:31:04.875" style="s2"> This is another manifestation of mythology</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.564" end="01:31:08.153" style="s2"> You sailed all the way and finally returned to the beginning of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.153" end="01:31:11.263" style="s2"> There is only undifferentiated chaos</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.545" end="01:31:13.195" style="s2"> This is what you are facing</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.549" end="01:31:15.950" style="s2"> Maybe it makes you unbearable</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.420" end="01:31:19.708" style="s2"> Unbearable leaving you with psychological trauma</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.220" end="01:31:21.618" style="s2"> This may hurt your brain</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.858" end="01:31:23.633" style="s2"> So fast you can&#39;t bear it</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.103" end="01:31:25.481" style="s2"> But it doesn&#39;t matter you have no way to escape</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.982" end="01:31:27.495" style="s2"> How should you respond to this situation</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.495" end="01:31:30.554" style="s2"> There are some catastrophic negative emotions</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.117" end="01:31:32.892" style="s2"> You froze and this is protective</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.902" end="01:31:34.092" style="s2"> Maybe it’s because you don’t want to move at all</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.092" end="01:31:36.566" style="s2"> You want to stay in bed for a whole week</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.650" end="01:31:38.424" style="s2"> This is because of your body&#39;s reaction</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.424" end="01:31:41.044" style="s2"> It&#39;s like there are snakes all over the bedroom floor</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.159" end="01:31:43.174" style="s2"> You better stay in bed motionless</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.529" end="01:31:44.270" style="s2"> Just freeze</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.593" end="01:31:46.305" style="s2"> This situation is not very good</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.305" end="01:31:48.299" style="s2"> Because your nerves are tight at this time, your brain is highly excited</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.009" end="01:31:50.919" style="s2"> This is very exhausting</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.169" end="01:31:53.268" style="s2"> And there is no benefit</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.330" end="01:31:54.917" style="s2"> Unless those snakes can&#39;t see you</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.167" end="01:31:57.735" style="s2"> But the snake has seen you so it&#39;s useless to be still</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.017" end="01:32:00.658" style="s2"> Now you have been affected by these indiscriminate negative emotions</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.825" end="01:32:04.917" style="s2"> Anxiety fear hurt anger guilt shame sad</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.220" end="01:32:06.931" style="s2"> Disasters are overwhelming</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.307" end="01:32:09.134" style="s2"> And maybe from the other side</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.165" end="01:32:10.575" style="s2"> Hidden in this situation is</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.055" end="01:32:12.641" style="s2"> &quot;Thank God I finally don&#39;t have to do this job anymore.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.641" end="01:32:13.977" style="s2"> &quot;I have had enough&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.977" end="01:32:16.702" style="s2"> &quot;I struggle to go to work every day&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.088" end="01:32:18.560" style="s2"> &quot;A part of my heart feels&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.560" end="01:32:20.658" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s a good thing for me to be fired.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.658" end="01:32:22.412" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s so fun.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.777" end="01:32:24.959" style="s2"> And you may not want to admit it</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.959" end="01:32:26.253" style="s2"> Because it means</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.253" end="01:32:28.915" style="s2"> The time you spend on this job is wasted</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.915" end="01:32:30.888" style="s2"> You have been deceiving yourself</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.629" end="01:32:33.977" style="s2"> But there is something interesting to think of</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.977" end="01:32:38.560" style="s2"> Sometimes it is unpleasant to have to fire someone</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.228" end="01:32:40.752" style="s2"> Sometimes fire them</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.762" end="01:32:42.474" style="s2"> It is a good way out for them</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.474" end="01:32:45.815" style="s2"> But this does not mean to enjoy the dismissal process</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.326" end="01:32:49.270" style="s2"> But I have met some very unkind people</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.270" end="01:32:51.096" style="s2"> They really like firing people</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.399" end="01:32:53.466" style="s2"> I&#39;ll tell this story if I find a chance</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.466" end="01:32:54.886" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s quite interesting</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.345" end="01:32:56.190" style="s2"> And sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.190" end="01:32:58.476" style="s2"> If some people just can’t do their job</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.863" end="01:33:03.195" style="s2"> How miserable it is to work</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.195" end="01:33:06.232" style="s2"> The best thing you can do for them is to tell them</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.339" end="01:33:08.549" style="s2"> &quot;You did a terrible job&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.291" end="01:33:11.712" style="s2"> &quot;And that doesn&#39;t mean&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.712" end="01:33:15.314" style="s2"> &quot;You will do nothing in this world.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.460" end="01:33:17.913" style="s2"> &quot;Maybe you should just accept reality.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.268" end="01:33:19.802" style="s2"> &quot;Give up and try something else&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.188" end="01:33:21.921" style="s2"> This is terrible for people</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.921" end="01:33:23.623" style="s2"> I know people hate this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.764" end="01:33:28.643" style="s2"> But it’s better than doing nothing</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.654" end="01:33:30.752" style="s2"> It’s just a tortured chronic death</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.314" end="01:33:36.963" style="s2"> So look at it from the good side</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.704" end="01:33:42.474" style="s2"> Now suppose you have fallen into a hole in the thin ice of life</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.725" end="01:33:44.886" style="s2"> You encountered an anomaly that you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.886" end="01:33:48.111" style="s2"> You want to know how this vision formed</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.121" end="01:33:50.000" style="s2"> I know it’s weird to think about it this way</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.752" end="01:33:54.906" style="s2"> Because it’s not or let’s go down</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.011" end="01:33:55.658" style="s2"> This is a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.919" end="01:33:57.443" style="s2"> &quot;How did this vision form?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.443" end="01:33:58.685" style="s2"> One way to understand it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.696" end="01:34:00.178" style="s2"> It is formed by mental matter</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.982" end="01:34:01.796" style="s2"> The reason for this is as follows</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.725" end="01:34:04.677" style="s2"> This is what I learned from Piaget</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.587" end="01:34:08.111" style="s2"> It is made of matter</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.111" end="01:34:10.126" style="s2"> Because the world is made of matter</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.157" end="01:34:12.015" style="s2"> And the world is also very important</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.151" end="01:34:14.635" style="s2"> This forms a kind of duality</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.272" end="01:34:16.430" style="s2"> But it also consists of spirit</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.430" end="01:34:19.291" style="s2"> Because when you encounter a vision</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.385" end="01:34:20.324" style="s2"> And walking down the rabbit hole</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.324" end="01:34:21.639" style="s2"> You enter such an underground world</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.639" end="01:34:23.664" style="s2"> It&#39;s under everything you depend on</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.583" end="01:34:25.950" style="s2"> You will also learn something</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.034" end="01:34:27.516" style="s2"> There is information there</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.685" end="01:34:33.863" style="s2"> There may be more information than you need, but it is information</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.322" end="01:34:36.597" style="s2"> What use is this information for you</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.817" end="01:34:40.115" style="s2"> You can understand this information, right</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.470" end="01:34:44.593" style="s2"> You can use this information to cheer up</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.854" end="01:34:45.877" style="s2"> This is also beneficial</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.587" end="01:34:49.552" style="s2"> So you will think you are a mind</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.625" end="01:34:50.658" style="s2"> Maybe you think you are not a spiritual body</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.856" end="01:34:53.132" style="s2"> It depends on whether you are a materialist</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.132" end="01:34:55.032" style="s2"> But at least we can say that you are a mind</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.032" end="01:34:57.015" style="s2"> The question is what is your mind made of</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.339" end="01:34:59.364" style="s2"> It obviously has a material basis</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.792" end="01:35:03.936" style="s2"> And the matter happens to be arranged in a certain order</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.957" end="01:35:05.971" style="s2"> In order of information</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.410" end="01:35:09.447" style="s2"> So when you fall into the underground world under everything</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.447" end="01:35:11.326" style="s2"> You are exposed to the hidden information</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.618" end="01:35:13.957" style="s2"> What you can do is strengthen your mind</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.957" end="01:35:15.032" style="s2"> You can make your spirit stronger</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.032" end="01:35:15.971" style="s2"> Because all you can do is</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.971" end="01:35:19.698" style="s2"> Absorb and accept new information</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.063" end="01:35:22.704" style="s2"> It’s like eating the forbidden fruit that Adam and Eve stole.</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.704" end="01:35:24.906" style="s2"> You accept it and you are more complete</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.303" end="01:35:27.913" style="s2"> This is not a metaphorical or metaphysical proposition</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.570" end="01:35:29.948" style="s2"> Nothing else</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.261" end="01:35:31.848" style="s2"> It&#39;s like the situation when children are studying</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.848" end="01:35:32.954" style="s2"> Imagine this picture</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.330" end="01:35:37.923" style="s2"> A three-year-old child only knows the low-resolution world</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.810" end="01:35:41.608" style="s2"> And the child is still a low-resolution person</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.963" end="01:35:43.226" style="s2"> They have all the necessary elements</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.309" end="01:35:46.368" style="s2"> There is no huge difference between these elements</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.368" end="01:35:48.048" style="s2"> They will only change in the future</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.497" end="01:35:50.700" style="s2"> So what will this kid do to explore</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.971" end="01:35:53.894" style="s2"> What to explore, explore the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.894" end="01:35:55.178" style="s2"> Explore the information contained in the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.220" end="01:35:57.767" style="s2"> Because you already know what you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.767" end="01:35:58.863" style="s2"> There is no new information</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.061" end="01:36:01.190" style="s2"> You go to understand what you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.190" end="01:36:02.339" style="s2"> There is new information</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.683" end="01:36:03.727" style="s2"> From the information</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.727" end="01:36:06.023" style="s2"> Your understanding of the world will be clearer</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.096" end="01:36:08.424" style="s2"> Your knowledge of yourself will become clearer</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.831" end="01:36:12.934" style="s2"> So in the battle with the Chaos Dragon</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.017" end="01:36:14.844" style="s2"> You have created mind and matter</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.209" end="01:36:17.318" style="s2"> This is what you did when you entered the underground world</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.226" end="01:36:19.405" style="s2"> If chaos didn&#39;t kill you</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.616" end="01:36:22.224" style="s2"> Or make you want to die</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.224" end="01:36:23.236" style="s2"> Because you do die</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.727" end="01:36:26.128" style="s2"> But anyway, part of you has to be buried underground</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.138" end="01:36:27.631" style="s2"> But this may not be a bad thing</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.631" end="01:36:30.815" style="s2"> Because if your relationship ends because of betrayal</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.044" end="01:36:33.957" style="s2"> That means something is wrong, right?</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.280" end="01:36:35.209" style="s2"> some things</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.230" end="01:36:36.504" style="s2"> Let me explain why</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.681" end="01:36:38.476" style="s2"> You might think &quot;Hey, I&#39;m preaching again&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.852" end="01:36:41.587" style="s2"> I don’t know if you noticed that I don’t mind preaching</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.057" end="01:36:45.408" style="s2"> But this judgment is not fair</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.408" end="01:36:47.151" style="s2"> Because you are playing this stupid game</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.495" end="01:36:50.940" style="s2"> It&#39;s like you&#39;re loyal to someone</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.253" end="01:36:52.620" style="s2"> This is a game right</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.808" end="01:36:53.988" style="s2"> You have decided the rules of the game</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.238" end="01:36:55.877" style="s2"> Morality comes with the game</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.138" end="01:36:58.111" style="s2"> Then morality is the rule of the game</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.414" end="01:37:01.232" style="s2"> Then things collapsed into infidelity</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.608" end="01:37:04.792" style="s2"> Either you play the game wrong or the game itself is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.792" end="01:37:07.266" style="s2"> Can only be one of the two</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.453" end="01:37:09.520" style="s2"> You chose this game</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.917" end="01:37:12.015" style="s2"> And after the election, you can’t say</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.015" end="01:37:13.456" style="s2"> These rules are not what I want</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.633" end="01:37:14.802" style="s2"> &quot;I want to be pretty&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.021" end="01:37:17.182" style="s2"> If you choose the game, you will default to the rules behind</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.464" end="01:37:21.389" style="s2"> If you fail to follow these rules you will lose the game</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.389" end="01:37:23.445" style="s2"> You can also say that I can choose another game</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.445" end="01:37:25.251" style="s2"> I don&#39;t care how you solve the problem</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.491" end="01:37:27.224" style="s2"> You are still trapped by it</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.485" end="01:37:29.468" style="s2"> Fundamentally speaking, this is a moral issue</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.744" end="01:37:35.543" style="s2"> And may need some earth-shaking changes to correct</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.946" end="01:37:41.911" style="s2"> You are at location A and want to go to location B</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.109" end="01:37:44.781" style="s2"> And this is not feasible, you have encountered an abnormal situation</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.700" end="01:37:48.007" style="s2"> You must not be at location B now</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.489" end="01:37:51.316" style="s2"> For example, you are a medical student</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.629" end="01:37:55.021" style="s2"> You took the MCAT, an entrance test you must pass</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.021" end="01:37:55.042" style="s2"> You took the MCAT, an entrance test you must pass</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.314" end="01:37:56.858" style="s2"> The bottom quarter of your ranking</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.443" end="01:37:58.372" style="s2"> I do not know who you are</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.372" end="01:37:59.739" style="s2"> But you are not a pre-medical student now</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.199" end="01:38:02.109" style="s2"> Maybe you&#39;ve never been right</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.286" end="01:38:03.445" style="s2"> And this is a problem friends</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.748" end="01:38:06.420" style="s2"> You don&#39;t know who you are</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.660" end="01:38:10.230" style="s2"> There is a crash here, and a conflict of motivation</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.533" end="01:38:13.069" style="s2"> Motivation and emotions start to fluctuate here</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.372" end="01:38:15.105" style="s2"> The huge amount of information also began to surge</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.293" end="01:38:18.685" style="s2"> This is where the phoenix has changed</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.717" end="01:38:21.023" style="s2"> The burning part of the Phoenix</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.023" end="01:38:23.059" style="s2"> This is a journey to the underground world</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.111" end="01:38:24.405" style="s2"> Road to hell</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.416" end="01:38:25.762" style="s2"> This may really be a journey to hell</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.762" end="01:38:30.042" style="s2"> Because you may find out why your partner betrayed you</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.042" end="01:38:31.952" style="s2"> Or why you didn’t get a promotion</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.952" end="01:38:34.395" style="s2"> It&#39;s all because you have serious problems</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.698" end="01:38:35.376" style="s2"> And you know it well</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.376" end="01:38:37.318" style="s2"> I&#39;m not saying you don&#39;t know what you are doing</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.558" end="01:38:39.405" style="s2"> I mean a quarter of you</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.708" end="01:38:42.819" style="s2"> Focusing on bad things</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.153" end="01:38:45.606" style="s2"> This makes you fall into the underground world and you discover next</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.929" end="01:38:50.178" style="s2"> &quot;Oh my God, I finally made it myself.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.512" end="01:38:54.061" style="s2"> Or &quot;I finally got retribution from the worst part of me&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.374" end="01:38:56.556" style="s2"> &quot;And the worst part of me needs to be cleared.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.556" end="01:38:57.819" style="s2"> And this is not easy</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.840" end="01:39:03.393" style="s2"> Because &quot;I have been captured by him and cannot get out.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.769" end="01:39:06.295" style="s2"> &quot;I have been with it for a long time.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.504" end="01:39:09.228" style="s2"> &quot;Maybe I can&#39;t get rid of it all my life.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.917" end="01:39:11.170" style="s2"> It&#39;s not fun at all</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.170" end="01:39:13.936" style="s2"> You will often see this kind of people in psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.936" end="01:39:16.671" style="s2"> Maybe you can see them hanging out on the street</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.671" end="01:39:21.253" style="s2"> Living completely in the past disasters like walking dead</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.869" end="01:39:23.518" style="s2"> Because they have penetrated into the underground world</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.518" end="01:39:25.950" style="s2"> Finally trapped in hell, there is no way to escape</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.211" end="01:39:28.925" style="s2"> When you meet this kind of person on the street</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.925" end="01:39:30.136" style="s2"> You will avoid it</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.522" end="01:39:32.140" style="s2"> Alright you are in the underground world now</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.934" end="01:39:36.149" style="s2"> With the potential information</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.368" end="01:39:37.558" style="s2"> Too much information</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.904" end="01:39:40.762" style="s2"> It&#39;s the same as this picture shows</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.712" end="01:39:45.825" style="s2"> This is why the story of Adam and Eve is a prototype, right?</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.982" end="01:39:50.501" style="s2"> Because we are always digesting new things</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.522" end="01:39:53.320" style="s2"> Those new things plunge us into a new state of self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.758" end="01:40:00.011" style="s2"> Our previous paradise will be destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.074" end="01:40:02.078" style="s2"> I don’t have everything as before</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.589" end="01:40:04.124" style="s2"> Something that followed with the new destroyed it</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.343" end="01:40:06.159" style="s2"> And beat our current life to pieces</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.535" end="01:40:08.101" style="s2"> This is the journey to the underground world</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.483" end="01:40:13.351" style="s2"> Leaving the garden and heading to Chaos</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.111" end="01:40:19.322" style="s2"> So what does all this mean</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.059" end="01:40:25.136" style="s2"> Well there are many ways to explain it</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.723" end="01:40:28.184" style="s2"> This is a frame conversion</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.510" end="01:40:30.554" style="s2"> This is a walled city</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.554" end="01:40:31.337" style="s2"> There is a gap</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.441" end="01:40:33.456" style="s2"> Every siege has gaps, isn’t it</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.456" end="01:40:34.666" style="s2"> Because nothing is perfect</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.666" end="01:40:36.284" style="s2"> Defects are the source of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.057" end="01:40:40.063" style="s2"> Maybe you go out of town and fight chaos like a hero</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.543" end="01:40:42.046" style="s2"> To re-establish the framework</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.046" end="01:40:43.028" style="s2"> And this is what you should do</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.028" end="01:40:46.420" style="s2"> Maybe you released some information when you did this</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.176" end="01:40:50.710" style="s2"> Or established a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.140" end="01:40:53.320" style="s2"> This is a journey</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.437" end="01:40:56.410" style="s2"> Frame destruction chaos</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.537" end="01:41:01.096" style="s2"> Voluntarily confront the reshaping of the world</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.806" end="01:41:04.186" style="s2"> That is the state of being</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.416" end="01:41:09.886" style="s2"> I hope it is not only linear but stepwise</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.902" end="01:41:16.650" style="s2"> &quot;You&quot; that emerged from the recent disaster</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.650" end="01:41:20.115" style="s2"> Just add some other things to your past self</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.888" end="01:41:22.276" style="s2"> And this actually constitutes</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.464" end="01:41:25.752" style="s2"> So-called quantifiable progress, right</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.752" end="01:41:27.955" style="s2"> There is also another view against moral relativism</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.017" end="01:41:31.952" style="s2"> If you do everything before</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.952" end="01:41:33.570" style="s2"> You can have more output on this basis</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.790" end="01:41:35.512" style="s2"> We think you are getting better</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.961" end="01:41:37.349" style="s2"> This is not a bad definition</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.360" end="01:41:38.174" style="s2"> Then we have an improvement</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.309" end="01:41:42.464" style="s2"> It&#39;s like all you have to do is analyze the world</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.061" end="01:41:45.491" style="s2"> Then make yourself different</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.013" end="01:41:48.414" style="s2"> Whenever you experience one of these revolutions</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.612" end="01:41:50.115" style="s2"> Then these two things are expected to be achieved</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.355" end="01:41:52.662" style="s2"> Then that story has moral elements</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.777" end="01:41:55.063" style="s2"> That is to do it actively</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.261" end="01:42:00.929" style="s2"> Maybe don&#39;t wait for it to happen like a disaster</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.140" end="01:42:03.132" style="s2"> Brighten your eyes</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.852" end="01:42:08.059" style="s2"> It&#39;s not too late to make up for it</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.623" end="01:42:10.575" style="s2"> Don&#39;t think it matters</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.650" end="01:42:13.894" style="s2"> Maybe this is very important</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.977" end="01:42:16.660" style="s2"> This may be the key to what you should be</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.963" end="01:42:19.322" style="s2"> This may be the key to what the world should be</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.687" end="01:42:22.610" style="s2"> If part of you tells you this is important</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.685" end="01:42:26.149" style="s2"> That means that part of you is telling you</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.149" end="01:42:30.136" style="s2"> You must solve this problem right away</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.491" end="01:42:32.328" style="s2"> This is the so-called important thing</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.547" end="01:42:35.032" style="s2"> I really like to use the word &quot;substance&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.032" end="01:42:37.119" style="s2"> Because it has these two weird meanings right</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.213" end="01:42:39.238" style="s2"> Material from a materialist perspective</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.781" end="01:42:43.456" style="s2"> It is the material of all things that is inanimate</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.706" end="01:42:45.742" style="s2"> In another sense, matter is the material of life</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.742" end="01:42:47.568" style="s2"> And this is important</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.923" end="01:42:50.856" style="s2"> Sometimes you are going through life and important things</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.982" end="01:42:51.911" style="s2"> It is calling you</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.266" end="01:42:55.627" style="s2"> This is the hidden world trying to show itself to you</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.909" end="01:42:59.479" style="s2"> And what you should do is allow it to show itself to you</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.792" end="01:43:01.232" style="s2"> What might happen next is</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.681" end="01:43:05.783" style="s2"> Some small changes will happen to you</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.783" end="01:43:08.518" style="s2"> You don’t have to burn a phoenix egg</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.852" end="01:43:11.232" style="s2"> Then reborn from the ashes</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.587" end="01:43:14.374" style="s2"> Maybe you just need to fix some</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.374" end="01:43:15.345" style="s2"> The wrong place on you</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.345" end="01:43:18.737" style="s2"> So you only need to experience a series of continuous and small sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.821" end="01:43:21.222" style="s2"> Instead of waiting for a bloody disaster</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.222" end="01:43:23.758" style="s2"> A disaster you can&#39;t get out of</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.312" end="01:43:26.514" style="s2"> All you have to do is focus on the important things</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.879" end="01:43:29.593" style="s2"> Your entire nervous system is born for this</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.844" end="01:43:30.689" style="s2"> You have a goal</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.211" end="01:43:32.015" style="s2"> In the meantime, something happened</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.161" end="01:43:32.996" style="s2"> And it matters</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.289" end="01:43:34.531" style="s2"> So what should you do</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.677" end="01:43:36.556" style="s2"> You should fix it</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.660" end="01:43:38.007" style="s2"> You should face it</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.268" end="01:43:40.940" style="s2"> That&#39;s why it seems to be shouting to you it is important</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.316" end="01:43:44.416" style="s2"> It&#39;s saying that there is an unclear part of the world</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.416" end="01:43:48.122" style="s2"> This part wants to appear as a completely clear existence</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.591" end="01:43:50.627" style="s2"> And it&#39;s calling you to do it all</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.170" end="01:43:53.226" style="s2"> If you ignore it, this part will pile up</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.633" end="01:43:56.514" style="s2"> As it accumulates it will become the dragon of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.545" end="01:43:59.708" style="s2"> He will be when you are not prepared</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.792" end="01:44:01.170" style="s2"> Swallow you</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.389" end="01:44:02.788" style="s2"> And this is another result</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.216" end="01:44:04.740" style="s2"> This is not a good solution</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.230" end="01:44:06.817" style="s2"> Unless you want to be its lunch</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.529" end="01:44:15.324" style="s2"> The above is a longer introduction to Noah</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.241" end="01:44:26.023" style="s2"> But it is still necessary</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.065" end="01:44:28.299" style="s2"> Otherwise we can&#39;t understand the story</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.909" end="01:44:32.213" style="s2"> This is the meaning of this story</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.257" end="01:44:35.575" style="s2"> After that we can finish this story very quickly</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.575" end="01:44:37.735" style="s2"> Although it is unlikely to be finished within today</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.301" end="01:44:41.973" style="s2"> Let&#39;s start to tell the next story in &quot;Genesis&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.652" end="01:44:44.479" style="s2"> It followed the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.479" end="01:44:47.318" style="s2"> What starts with a short story is just a fragment</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.955" end="01:44:49.552" style="s2"> I call this story &quot;the great man on earth&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.316" end="01:44:54.479" style="s2"> &quot;When there are more people in the world&quot; (Genesis 6:1)</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.593" end="01:44:55.982" style="s2"> So this happened after the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.963" end="01:44:58.727" style="s2"> &quot;When the daughter was born again&quot; (Genesis 6:1)</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.230" end="01:45:03.852" style="s2"> &quot;The sons of God see the beauty of human women</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.852" end="01:45:06.483" style="s2"> &quot;Just choose and marry as your wife&quot; (Genesis 6:2)</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.207" end="01:45:12.673" style="s2"> &quot;Jehovah says, &quot;Man is natural</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.049" end="01:45:14.343" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;My spirit won&#39;t live in him forever</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.771" end="01:45:17.464" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;But his life can reach one hundred and twenty years&#39;&quot; (Gen 6:3)</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.374" end="01:45:21.274" style="s2"> &quot;At that time there were great men on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.274" end="01:45:23.122" style="s2"> &quot;Later the sons of God</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.122" end="01:45:26.149" style="s2"> &quot;Women who have sex with men have children</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.472" end="01:45:29.792" style="s2"> &quot;That is the famous person of ancient heroism&quot; (Genesis 6:4)</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.919" end="01:45:32.234" style="s2"> People tried many times</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.234" end="01:45:35.074" style="s2"> To explain these messy sentences</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.545" end="01:45:41.692" style="s2"> But I think it reflects the classic development of hero mythology</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.641" end="01:45:44.604" style="s2"> Seems to show nostalgia for the past</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.948" end="01:45:48.424" style="s2"> What Mircea Iliad pointed out is</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.303" end="01:45:54.082" style="s2"> What is human memory like in the pre-literal age</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.082" end="01:45:55.564" style="s2"> Because there is no written record</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.410" end="01:45:59.218" style="s2"> Those retained memories will merge with each other</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.656" end="01:46:02.287" style="s2"> Imagine a culture based on fisheries</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.069" end="01:46:04.238" style="s2"> Everyone must be a good fisherman</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.276" end="01:46:09.103" style="s2"> Those who use simple tools to fish</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.103" end="01:46:10.669" style="s2"> Are very good fishermen</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.669" end="01:46:13.643" style="s2"> They know every little detail about the fish</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.082" end="01:46:14.948" style="s2"> Because if they don’t, they won’t survive</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.053" end="01:46:17.391" style="s2"> So proficient in fishing is very important for them</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.777" end="01:46:21.253" style="s2"> They may have been fishing for about 13,000 years</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.284" end="01:46:22.934" style="s2"> Have a lot of accumulated knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.393" end="01:46:27.913" style="s2"> So the question is who taught humans to fish</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.236" end="01:46:32.151" style="s2"> The answer is a fragment of individual stories in history</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.495" end="01:46:34.980" style="s2"> But people can’t remember these story fragments</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.053" end="01:46:39.134" style="s2"> So people merge them all into a hero fisherman</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.270" end="01:46:42.495" style="s2"> He showed people the example of fishing</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.735" end="01:46:44.176" style="s2"> No matter what the paradigm is</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.479" end="01:46:46.932" style="s2"> One of the examples might be to try to catch fish</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.057" end="01:46:48.873" style="s2"> Otherwise there will be nothing in the coming year</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.873" end="01:46:49.604" style="s2"> Something like this</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.635" end="01:46:51.744" style="s2"> Just like these stories of discoveries</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.744" end="01:46:54.865" style="s2"> Was merged into the heroes of the past</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.335" end="01:46:57.318" style="s2"> What you should do as a fisherman</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.339" end="01:46:59.729" style="s2"> Is an example of practicing this hero</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.750" end="01:47:02.297" style="s2"> The concept of &quot;ancient heroic and famous person&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.297" end="01:47:03.612" style="s2"> Or the heroes of the past</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.019" end="01:47:11.003" style="s2"> Is a fragment of this series of thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.545" end="01:47:14.990" style="s2"> There were some great men in the past</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.990" end="01:47:18.289" style="s2"> They created the mode of existence that humans should have</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.602" end="01:47:19.927" style="s2"> They are sons of god</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.927" end="01:47:23.654" style="s2"> They picked a human woman to marry as their wife</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.978" end="01:47:26.399" style="s2"> It&#39;s funny because we know</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.819" end="01:47:33.612" style="s2"> The more capable men are, the more overwhelming they are to breed offspring</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.282" end="01:47:38.675" style="s2"> So this perfectly explains the status quo</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.159" end="01:47:42.130" style="s2"> Let&#39;s talk back to the flood</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.725" end="01:47:44.437" style="s2"> This is from Mircea Iliad</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.437" end="01:47:46.963" style="s2"> He wrote the book &quot;History of Religious Thought&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.963" end="01:47:48.330" style="s2"> I strongly recommend everyone to read</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.330" end="01:47:49.875" style="s2"> There are three volumes in this set</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.875" end="01:47:50.971" style="s2"> Very worth reading</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.971" end="01:47:52.401" style="s2"> Excellent</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.767" end="01:47:53.383" style="s2"> I personally like this book</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.896" end="01:47:59.197" style="s2"> The following is his description of the flood myth</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.781" end="01:48:02.213" style="s2"> &quot;Thanks to Richard Andre Hermann Uzena</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.213" end="01:48:06.378" style="s2"> &quot;And the work of the author of James Fraser&#39;s The Golden Branch</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.702" end="01:48:10.230" style="s2"> &quot;The flood myth has been widely known&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.512" end="01:48:12.579" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s on every continent</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.986" end="01:48:14.541" style="s2"> &quot;Although it’s rare in Africa</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.708" end="01:48:17.788" style="s2"> &quot;Of course there are more deserts in Africa</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.927" end="01:48:21.451" style="s2"> &quot;It is recorded by different levels of culture&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.545" end="01:48:24.823" style="s2"> Some of these record variants were formed by spreading</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.084" end="01:48:27.673" style="s2"> Not caused by spontaneous innovation</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.007" end="01:48:29.875" style="s2"> &quot;It first originated in the Mesopotamia and developed in India&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.564" end="01:48:34.312" style="s2"> &quot;Another possibility is due to one or more floods</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.312" end="01:48:36.149" style="s2"> &quot;Lead to the birth of these myths and legends&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.577" end="01:48:39.969" style="s2"> &quot;But if there is no trace of geography left</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.969" end="01:48:42.913" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s hard to explain why a myth spread so widely.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.184" end="01:48:44.865" style="s2"> Iliad wrote this long ago</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.886" end="01:48:47.871" style="s2"> I remember it was in the 80s or 70s</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.163" end="01:48:48.696" style="s2"> But after that</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.696" end="01:48:53.122" style="s2"> Indeed, a lot of evidence has been found in different fields to prove</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.299" end="01:48:56.347" style="s2"> In the memory of related human civilization</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.702" end="01:49:02.046" style="s2"> There have been catastrophic floods</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.046" end="01:49:02.057" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:49:02.057" end="01:49:03.831" style="s2"> For example, the Indians on the west coast of North America</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.374" end="01:49:05.637" style="s2"> I may use the wrong word here</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.621" end="01:49:08.915" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know what to say</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.781" end="01:49:13.351" style="s2"> I know a sculptor of the Kwakwajakwa tribe</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.351" end="01:49:15.115" style="s2"> He once told me a flood story</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.126" end="01:49:18.748" style="s2"> This story is basically the same as that of Noah</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.863" end="01:49:20.950" style="s2"> Except that the ark has become a lot of giant canoes</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.003" end="01:49:22.829" style="s2"> But basically the same story</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.038" end="01:49:26.253" style="s2"> If I remember correctly, they released a raven</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.733" end="01:49:28.435" style="s2"> Noah released a raven first</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.435" end="01:49:30.992" style="s2"> Then a pigeon was released when the flood subsided</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.358" end="01:49:33.654" style="s2"> So is the story of the Tower of Babel</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.001" end="01:49:36.285" style="s2"> The canoes are all gathered together</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.285" end="01:49:38.456" style="s2"> Not a huge boat but many canoes</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.706" end="01:49:39.687" style="s2"> Drove out of the flood together</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.335" end="01:49:43.289" style="s2"> Then the boats went all over the world</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.289" end="01:49:45.021" style="s2"> This is the reason why humans are all over the world</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.533" end="01:49:47.913" style="s2"> Anyway, the story was widely spread</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.518" end="01:49:51.347" style="s2"> There have indeed been floods in North America</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.347" end="01:49:52.537" style="s2"> And not very long ago</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.925" end="01:49:55.773" style="s2"> You can check the Missoula flood</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.128" end="01:49:58.393" style="s2"> Happened about 13,000 to 15,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.696" end="01:50:00.909" style="s2"> Kwa Kwa Kwa tribe on the west coast</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.992" end="01:50:03.257" style="s2"> Has lived for about 13,000 to 14,000 years</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.729" end="01:50:07.798" style="s2"> Oral tradition can last a very long time</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.059" end="01:50:08.925" style="s2"> You might think it won&#39;t be like this</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.583" end="01:50:11.671" style="s2"> But the traditional society will not change</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.859" end="01:50:12.777" style="s2"> This is why they have become traditional</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.861" end="01:50:15.147" style="s2"> The same story will be passed on from generation to generation</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.147" end="01:50:16.785" style="s2"> People will remember the same story</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.351" end="01:50:23.184" style="s2"> The Missoula flood was a product of glacial meltwater</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.750" end="01:50:27.600" style="s2"> This flood happened 55 times</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.600" end="01:50:29.813" style="s2"> Occurs between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.199" end="01:50:33.623" style="s2"> Released about 15 times the amount of water in the Amazon</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.706" end="01:50:35.126" style="s2"> This is a huge flood</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.193" end="01:50:40.032" style="s2"> The Society of Molecular Biology and Evolution published a paper in 2008</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.032" end="01:50:43.602" style="s2"> Titled &quot;Climate Change in Southeast Asia and Human Migration after the Ice Age&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.155" end="01:50:45.856" style="s2"> Which mentioned multiple floods</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.149" end="01:50:48.069" style="s2"> Especially for 15,000 to 7,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.069" end="01:50:51.034" style="s2"> Impact in Southeast Asia</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.170" end="01:50:54.479" style="s2"> So Iliad has no geographical evidence to prove</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.583" end="01:50:59.155" style="s2"> There may be a bit of a mistake on the point that there have been catastrophic floods.</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.259" end="01:51:00.491" style="s2"> But this is not very important</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.491" end="01:51:03.811" style="s2"> Because we still look at it from a psychological perspective</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.698" end="01:51:07.015" style="s2"> &quot;Most of the flood myths are to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.015" end="01:51:08.800" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s about the laws of the universe&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.165" end="01:51:15.063" style="s2"> &quot;In the old world, humanity was lost and submerged under water.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.794" end="01:51:18.988" style="s2"> &quot;After some time, a new world was born from this chaos.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.280" end="01:51:20.554" style="s2"> &quot;Although the variables are huge</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.554" end="01:51:24.740" style="s2"> &quot;But floods are often the result of human sin or the collapse of rituals and music.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.272" end="01:51:29.781" style="s2"> &quot;Sometimes the reason is just that the gods wish to end humanity&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.147" end="01:51:34.437" style="s2"> &quot;The biggest culprit is the sin of mankind and the aging of the world&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.990" end="01:51:36.650" style="s2"> This is a very good analysis</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.965" end="01:51:42.151" style="s2"> Because it describes a parallel relationship</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.612" end="01:51:44.896" style="s2"> We mentioned before</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.896" end="01:51:48.028" style="s2"> That is, things will collapse and not only that</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.612" end="01:51:51.671" style="s2"> If you don’t pay attention you will speed up the process</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.671" end="01:51:53.268" style="s2"> So if you are in an intimate relationship</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.696" end="01:51:55.825" style="s2"> A relationship requires a lot of work to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.410" end="01:51:58.435" style="s2"> And you know when it needs maintenance</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.435" end="01:52:00.418" style="s2"> Because of you and each other</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.543" end="01:52:02.506" style="s2"> Began to create a barrier</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.798" end="01:52:06.034" style="s2"> Then it will start to have some disgust</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.034" end="01:52:08.466" style="s2"> I hope it&#39;s not contempt but a little disgust</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.769" end="01:52:11.733" style="s2"> There may be some emotional alienation</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.224" end="01:52:13.372" style="s2"> You will feel it and then you will think</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.696" end="01:52:15.439" style="s2"> It&#39;s hard to say what you think</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.564" end="01:52:16.994" style="s2"> But no matter what you will feel</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.015" end="01:52:18.539" style="s2"> You know this feeling is sprouting</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.145" end="01:52:21.107" style="s2"> Then you have a chance</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.107" end="01:52:25.220" style="s2"> To make up for the fault no matter what</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.950" end="01:52:28.570" style="s2"> Both of you need to change</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.664" end="01:52:31.451" style="s2"> Maybe one of them needs to change more</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.493" end="01:52:33.445" style="s2"> This needs to be discussed seriously</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.445" end="01:52:36.420" style="s2"> I realize something is happening</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.859" end="01:52:39.218" style="s2"> Maybe it&#39;s my reasonMaybe it&#39;s your reason</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.218" end="01:52:40.564" style="s2"> Maybe we should figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.564" end="01:52:43.163" style="s2"> Because if it’s your problem, it’s more convenient for me</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.163" end="01:52:45.366" style="s2"> But if it is my problem, I hope I can correct it</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.366" end="01:52:46.932" style="s2"> Because this way things are resolved</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.942" end="01:52:48.988" style="s2"> This is why you should listen to your partner</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.988" end="01:52:49.948" style="s2"> Because they might tell you</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.948" end="01:52:51.994" style="s2"> Where are you stupid without knowing it</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.297" end="01:52:53.445" style="s2"> If you can correct</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.445" end="01:52:55.700" style="s2"> Then you don&#39;t have to be this stupid anymore</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.700" end="01:53:01.483" style="s2"> This is actually one of the practical functions of the companion</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.504" end="01:53:05.115" style="s2"> Otherwise you really want to stay stupid like this</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.418" end="01:53:07.088" style="s2"> Do you repeat mistakes for the rest of your life?</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.276" end="01:53:08.685" style="s2"> Compared to the argument</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.685" end="01:53:12.422" style="s2"> &quot;Why are you so stupid&quot; and &quot;how to solve it&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.422" end="01:53:15.794" style="s2"> Of course this is much more convenient for you</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.076" end="01:53:18.310" style="s2"> But it’s better to face the problem and start a dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.669" end="01:53:24.865" style="s2"> Then the biggest culprit lies in the sin of mankind and the aging of the world</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.865" end="01:53:26.295" style="s2"> Sin is generally like this</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.295" end="01:53:32.756" style="s2"> Either people did something they knew was wrong</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.059" end="01:53:35.637" style="s2"> Either he didn’t do what he knew was right</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.950" end="01:53:36.733" style="s2"> Both are similar</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.464" end="01:53:39.740" style="s2"> In the Judeo-Christian tradition</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.230" end="01:53:42.161" style="s2"> The evaluation of the crime of negligence is more severe</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.161" end="01:53:44.395" style="s2"> I think there may be some misunderstandings here</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.771" end="01:53:46.859" style="s2"> Because the crime of negligence can cause substantial disaster</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.234" end="01:53:49.030" style="s2"> So here is a concept of flood</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.072" end="01:53:50.752" style="s2"> Everyone please tell me what you think</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.044" end="01:53:55.063" style="s2"> So there is a critical being that will overwhelm you</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.094" end="01:53:57.433" style="s2"> If you continue to use it yourself</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.850" end="01:53:59.061" style="s2"> It seems a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.667" end="01:54:02.120" style="s2"> This is the Lord</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.120" end="01:54:04.614" style="s2"> An example of the tendency to be harsh in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.719" end="01:54:08.383" style="s2"> Modern people don’t really agree with this</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.403" end="01:54:11.545" style="s2"> We want God to be domesticated to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.967" end="01:54:15.877" style="s2"> Unfortunately this doesn&#39;t seem to work</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.128" end="01:54:17.276" style="s2"> I often think</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.216" end="01:54:26.765" style="s2"> North America&#39;s response to the hurricane in New Orleans</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.746" end="01:54:29.332" style="s2"> Because there are two ways of understanding</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.364" end="01:54:33.424" style="s2"> One is that nature is a bit convulsive</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.738" end="01:54:37.172" style="s2"> Just let New Orleans blew a hurricane and razed everything</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.172" end="01:54:38.769" style="s2"> Isn&#39;t this a disaster</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.019" end="01:54:48.988" style="s2"> Isn’t this an example of human beings vulnerable to nature?</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.510" end="01:54:50.794" style="s2"> But at the same time there can be another interpretation</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.794" end="01:54:51.619" style="s2"> Maybe this is not very fair</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.619" end="01:54:53.508" style="s2"> But it still needs to be mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.353" end="01:54:57.005" style="s2"> The Dutch built a dam to stop the sea</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.694" end="01:54:59.573" style="s2"> They are quite efficient</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.573" end="01:55:01.347" style="s2"> Because most of their cities are below sea level</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.702" end="01:55:04.740" style="s2"> But if you go to the Netherlands, you will find that the Netherlands is not a country</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.512" end="01:55:06.639" style="s2"> So the dam is quite useful</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.433" end="01:55:09.520" style="s2"> Dutch people are very organized</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.032" end="01:55:10.950" style="s2"> They&#39;d better be like this</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.950" end="01:55:13.038" style="s2"> Because their country should have been flooded</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.090" end="01:55:14.228" style="s2"> If your city should have been flooded</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.228" end="01:55:16.076" style="s2"> Then you better be organized</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.692" end="01:55:17.892" style="s2"> They are really organized</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.892" end="01:55:19.510" style="s2"> They set up principles for the dam</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.585" end="01:55:21.681" style="s2"> They tried to simulate</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.681" end="01:55:27.307" style="s2"> The strongest hurricane that may occur in the next 10,000 years</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.579" end="01:55:30.188" style="s2"> Then make sure their dam can withstand such disasters</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.919" end="01:55:33.831" style="s2"> From what I read</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.831" end="01:55:37.213" style="s2"> Dam built by military engineers in New Orleans</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.213" end="01:55:38.831" style="s2"> Can only cope with a storm once in a hundred years</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.729" end="01:55:44.301" style="s2"> This is not very good because we will probably live for 80 years</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.980" end="01:55:47.234" style="s2"> This means there will be one of the storms</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.234" end="01:55:51.097" style="s2"> Very likely to happen in our lifetime</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.472" end="01:55:55.533" style="s2"> So this may not be the smartest plan</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.533" end="01:55:58.936" style="s2"> Especially because part of New Orleans is below sea level</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.092" end="01:56:00.147" style="s2"> Worse</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.721" end="01:56:03.717" style="s2"> Mississippi is famous for corruption</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.145" end="01:56:05.460" style="s2"> So you can speculate</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.512" end="01:56:09.844" style="s2"> There is a lot of time, money and resources that could or should</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.844" end="01:56:15.074" style="s2"> The plan was used to deal with this problem but failed at the end</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.689" end="01:56:17.255" style="s2"> So when the hurricane hits</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.527" end="01:56:19.781" style="s2"> Some people will say this is really a natural disaster</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.930" end="01:56:25.095" style="s2"> But the question is why are you so convinced that this is a natural disaster</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.295" end="01:56:29.228" style="s2"> Because if the infrastructure should be well maintained</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.562" end="01:56:33.143" style="s2"> And it is technically feasible to rebuild to a certain specification</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.299" end="01:56:36.556" style="s2"> At the same time, the cost of reconstruction is actually lower in the long run</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.765" end="01:56:38.320" style="s2"> And everyone knows it well</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.082" end="01:56:41.003" style="s2"> So when the tornado comes and razes the town</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.003" end="01:56:42.955" style="s2"> Why do you think this is a natural disaster</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.299" end="01:56:47.485" style="s2"> For me this is a self-contained example</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.445" end="01:56:50.773" style="s2"> If you think of it as a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.159" end="01:56:52.986" style="s2"> This is a judgmental God</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.811" end="01:56:58.268" style="s2"> Using the flood to teach people morality</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.998" end="01:57:00.502" style="s2"> You may feel a little harsh</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.502" end="01:57:01.963" style="s2"> What about those flood survivors</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.994" end="01:57:05.001" style="s2"> This flood is indeed harsh</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.888" end="01:57:08.445" style="s2"> It points out what can be done beforehand</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.103" end="01:57:13.299" style="s2"> I doubt if I did these things after the robbery</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.341" end="01:57:17.349" style="s2"> Even now everyone knows what happened</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.136" end="01:57:21.639" style="s2"> You can think of this as a diagnosis</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.786" end="01:57:22.715" style="s2"> But this is not important anymore</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.715" end="01:57:24.875" style="s2"> Actually what I want to say is</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.032" end="01:57:27.537" style="s2"> How the fairy tales overlap with these things</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.746" end="01:57:28.978" style="s2"> We can tell a story</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.978" end="01:57:34.875" style="s2"> Talking that Mother Nature will bring disasters from heaven and hide tragedies</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.345" end="01:57:36.598" style="s2"> Or you can tell another story</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.598" end="01:57:40.481" style="s2"> Talking about the social structure of fallen human beings</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.378" end="01:57:45.272" style="s2"> And how humans failed on an individual level</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.648" end="01:57:48.581" style="s2"> Which leads to a problem that everyone knows to exist</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.479" end="01:57:53.654" style="s2"> This is a good example of when people do things wrong</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.664" end="01:57:55.241" style="s2"> How did the flood come</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.128" end="01:57:58.069" style="s2"> About the Old Testament and its authors</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.069" end="01:58:00.168" style="s2"> The interesting point is</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.898" end="01:58:02.871" style="s2"> They always imagine the flood will come</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.871" end="01:58:04.082" style="s2"> This shows that they are not ready yet</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.938" end="01:58:05.763" style="s2"> The rules are like this</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.763" end="01:58:08.362" style="s2"> A priori axiom</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.228" end="01:58:11.378" style="s2"> The flood rushes to you, it means you are not ready</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.681" end="01:58:14.218" style="s2"> How did you know because you were washed away by the flood</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.823" end="01:58:15.815" style="s2"> This fact itself is evidence</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.846" end="01:58:17.652" style="s2"> You might say it&#39;s unfair</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.466" end="01:58:19.562" style="s2"> But fairness is not the point</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.063" end="01:58:23.059" style="s2"> The point is whether you still want to be flooded again</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.967" end="01:58:26.806" style="s2"> Because fairness means that you better figure out why you got caught</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.182" end="01:58:28.758" style="s2"> And you better solve the problem so that this kind of thing does not happen again</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.957" end="01:58:30.825" style="s2"> Doing this is &quot;moral&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.044" end="01:58:33.069" style="s2"> When you think of morality as</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.748" end="01:58:37.182" style="s2"> The most correct path chosen to reach the goal</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.182" end="01:58:39.823" style="s2"> At the same time choose the best possible goal</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.548" end="01:58:44.708" style="s2"> &quot;The simple fact is that things exist</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.095" end="01:58:49.259" style="s2"> &quot;That is, it will survive and create when the universe gradually declines</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.259" end="01:58:51.065" style="s2"> &quot;Things will eventually fall into decline&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.973" end="01:58:54.166" style="s2"> &quot;This is why things need to be recreated&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.301" end="01:58:57.287" style="s2"> &quot;In other words, on a micro scale, the flood</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.600" end="01:59:00.512" style="s2"> &quot;Symbolizes what happened in the New Year&#39;s Day celebration.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.690" end="01:59:03.497" style="s2"> &quot;The world has ended sin and humanity has ended</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.842" end="01:59:05.783" style="s2"> &quot;In this way, new creations may appear.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.621" end="01:59:11.295" style="s2"> Iliad contains a lot of information in just a few words</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.333" end="01:59:17.318" style="s2"> In the Mesopotamian ceremony</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.750" end="01:59:21.890" style="s2"> They will perform at the New Year celebration</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.644" end="01:59:27.923" style="s2"> A scene where the kingdom fell into chaos</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.257" end="01:59:31.347" style="s2"> This is what you are doing when making a plan</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.360" end="01:59:33.383" style="s2"> It is actually a degradation</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.383" end="01:59:34.124" style="s2"> you can say</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.124" end="01:59:37.516" style="s2"> Our habit of making new year&#39;s plans is a degenerate ritual</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.756" end="01:59:38.915" style="s2"> I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.915" end="01:59:43.163" style="s2"> I mean something greater can germinate from it</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.585" end="01:59:46.598" style="s2"> Mesopotamians</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.598" end="01:59:50.888" style="s2"> Will take their king out of the city once</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.285" end="01:59:52.495" style="s2"> They will make the king kneel</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.819" end="01:59:54.593" style="s2"> Take off all his clothes that symbolize the king&#39;s status</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.948" end="01:59:57.506" style="s2"> Then use a glove to smoke him if I remember correctly</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.506" end="01:59:58.477" style="s2"> This is done by the priest</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.477" end="02:00:00.188" style="s2"> They will account for him this year</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.188" end="02:00:02.871" style="s2"> What did not qualify as the emperor</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.069" end="02:00:04.374" style="s2"> How he failed to become a qualified Marduk</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.479" end="02:00:06.452" style="s2"> That&#39;s how he should be in the world</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.452" end="02:00:08.581" style="s2"> His head is full of eyes</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.581" end="02:00:10.063" style="s2"> Spit a magical spell</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.439" end="02:00:11.984" style="s2"> He is the one who can transform chaos into order</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.391" end="02:00:13.758" style="s2"> This is what the ruler should do</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.270" end="02:00:15.355" style="s2"> So the question should be</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.355" end="02:00:18.915" style="s2"> You are the emperor should be humble</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.915" end="02:00:20.919" style="s2"> Because you are not the incarnation of god</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.919" end="02:00:22.151" style="s2"> You may have made some mistakes</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.433" end="02:00:24.468" style="s2"> Can you think of the past year</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.708" end="02:00:29.176" style="s2"> How did you fail to seize every opportunity possible</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.489" end="02:00:33.466" style="s2"> Turn chaos into order?</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.957" end="02:00:35.063" style="s2"> It&#39;s good to think about it</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.074" end="02:00:36.180" style="s2"> When you are making a new year plan</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.211" end="02:00:37.652" style="s2"> This is what I think</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.652" end="02:00:38.800" style="s2"> Although you may not realize</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.687" end="02:00:43.007" style="s2"> Can you be a better person in the next year</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.155" end="02:00:50.794" style="s2"> You can imagine the flood</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.840" end="02:00:57.579" style="s2"> Then you set your posture and get ready</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.579" end="02:01:00.032" style="s2"> This means you may delay it</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.303" end="02:01:03.049" style="s2"> This also means that even if you fail to delay it</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.518" end="02:01:04.562" style="s2"> You may also escape</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.251" end="02:01:07.015" style="s2"> This is actually Noah&#39;s story</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.537" end="02:01:12.840" style="s2"> Noah could predict the worsening of the situation</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.320" end="02:01:14.635" style="s2"> Can predict the flood</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.888" end="02:01:17.735" style="s2"> God is letting him know all this</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.111" end="02:01:20.627" style="s2"> In a story Noah was walking with God</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.627" end="02:01:22.161" style="s2"> Remember this is Adam before he had complete self-will</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.161" end="02:01:23.779" style="s2"> What God has been doing</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.779" end="02:01:24.854" style="s2"> He walks with God</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.063" end="02:01:26.452" style="s2"> We will go into details next time</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.786" end="02:01:28.163" style="s2"> But at the same time this may mean</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.163" end="02:01:32.245" style="s2"> Noah is upright, he cheered himself up</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.610" end="02:01:34.500" style="s2"> His family relationship is harmonious</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.500" end="02:01:37.454" style="s2"> This also shows that he is very sensitive</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.143" end="02:01:40.554" style="s2"> Compared to those who are completely obscured by the fog</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.554" end="02:01:45.011" style="s2"> He can see a little further into the future</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.449" end="02:01:49.907" style="s2"> He can feel something is wrong</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.449" end="02:01:52.454" style="s2"> So he prepared for it</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.694" end="02:01:54.291" style="s2"> Because he prepared for it</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.825" end="02:01:59.510" style="s2"> Even if the flood came, Noah would be calm</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.928" end="02:02:01.316" style="s2"> This is a very interesting thing</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.316" end="02:02:06.243" style="s2"> This is an uncertain event in human existence</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.130" end="02:02:09.479" style="s2"> If everyone is ready</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.479" end="02:02:10.752" style="s2"> How big a hurricane would it take to destroy New Orleans</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.786" end="02:02:14.103" style="s2"> Anyway, the Netherlands will not be easily destroyed</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.103" end="02:02:15.178" style="s2"> Unless the wind is particularly strong</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.178" end="02:02:16.392" style="s2"> You need to imagine</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.392" end="02:02:18.894" style="s2"> An unusually powerful hurricane can blow down their dam</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.460" end="02:02:24.322" style="s2"> If no one in the city or state government engages in corruption</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.573" end="02:02:28.925" style="s2"> How strong can New Orleans&#39; disaster relief projects be</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.533" end="02:02:32.537" style="s2"> Maybe this will solve the hurricane problem</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.537" end="02:02:34.197" style="s2"> Because we clearly understand how to deal with it</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.197" end="02:02:35.084" style="s2"> We know the countermeasures</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.418" end="02:02:37.297" style="s2"> The same principle applies to our lives</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.372" end="02:02:39.625" style="s2"> Flood is coming</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.625" end="02:02:40.971" style="s2"> No doubt about this</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.971" end="02:02:43.633" style="s2"> 100% will definitely happen</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.957" end="02:02:45.345" style="s2"> Some may be personal</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.376" end="02:02:46.838" style="s2"> Some may be family</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.151" end="02:02:49.604" style="s2"> Some may be about society, politics, and economy</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.253" end="02:02:53.132" style="s2"> Will these problems be disastrous for you</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.685" end="02:02:54.917" style="s2"> Or how would you control them</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.324" end="02:02:56.378" style="s2"> How do you need to prepare</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.765" end="02:02:57.809" style="s2"> The first problem encountered is</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.809" end="02:02:59.635" style="s2"> Your behavior is in order</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.635" end="02:03:02.913" style="s2"> Enough to make you feel the coming of the problem</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.913" end="02:03:04.312" style="s2"> And have you made corresponding countermeasures?</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.562" end="02:03:05.930" style="s2"> Maybe a detour</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.055" end="02:03:08.456" style="s2"> Maybe just don’t go to the place where the flood is going to happen.</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.456" end="02:03:09.500" style="s2"> In this case, the problem is simple</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.792" end="02:03:11.650" style="s2"> But you may not be so lucky</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.237" end="02:03:14.646" style="s2"> Disaster is coming</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.896" end="02:03:17.850" style="s2"> Maybe someone in your family will be seriously ill</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.051" end="02:03:23.195" style="s2"> The path through the storm is just a small path</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.644" end="02:03:25.241" style="s2"> Things won’t fall apart when walking on this trail</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.616" end="02:03:26.786" style="s2"> If that&#39;s the end, it won&#39;t be a divorce</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.015" end="02:03:28.090" style="s2"> The end will not be death</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.299" end="02:03:29.124" style="s2"> The ending will not be grief</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.124" end="02:03:30.429" style="s2"> The ending will not be a disaster</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.429" end="02:03:34.197" style="s2"> But this fault tolerance rate is so low that it is almost close to zero</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.230" end="02:03:39.051" style="s2"> Anything you do that is not perfect will increase</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.051" end="02:03:42.819" style="s2"> The possibility of making that tragedy no different from hell</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.404" end="02:03:44.458" style="s2"> And they are on the way</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.604" end="02:03:47.673" style="s2"> They will come without a doubt</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.330" end="02:03:50.700" style="s2"> Then you might think that since it is imminent</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.055" end="02:03:53.560" style="s2"> The best thing you can do is to integrate yourself</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.061" end="02:03:54.844" style="s2"> When the problem comes</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.896" end="02:03:57.683" style="s2"> Get the worst results</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.404" end="02:04:00.001" style="s2"> I will end with a story</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.658" end="02:04:03.602" style="s2"> This matter has a deep impact on me</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.635" end="02:04:09.280" style="s2"> My mother-in-law suffered from frontotemporal dementia</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.280" end="02:04:10.648" style="s2"> She started to have symptoms when she was younger</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.243" end="02:04:13.278" style="s2"> She was about 55 years old at the time</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.176" end="02:04:16.754" style="s2"> Her husband is a very outgoing person</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.130" end="02:04:18.623" style="s2"> It&#39;s delicious locally</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.623" end="02:04:20.773" style="s2"> I grew up in a small town everyone knows him</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.773" end="02:04:24.145" style="s2"> He is very attractive and has a problem with alcohol</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.708" end="02:04:25.606" style="s2"> very attractive</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.951" end="02:04:29.291" style="s2"> Is a very powerful businessman outstanding</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.291" end="02:04:30.126" style="s2"> And he is a man of true temperament</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.483" end="02:04:33.247" style="s2"> But he is not the kind of man who cares about his family</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.247" end="02:04:37.151" style="s2"> Although he paid a lot to support his family</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.809" end="02:04:38.978" style="s2"> When his wife got sick</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.395" end="02:04:40.731" style="s2"> He is really taking care of her wholeheartedly</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.086" end="02:04:42.078" style="s2"> That&#39;s a really stopping scene</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.558" end="02:04:46.389" style="s2"> Caring for people with Alzheimer&#39;s disease</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.389" end="02:04:47.756" style="s2"> No matter what intent or purpose it is, it is not a trifle</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.153" end="02:04:52.464" style="s2"> The patient is gradually being swallowed by the disease and it is unbearable</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.464" end="02:04:53.967" style="s2"> And it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.771" end="02:04:57.099" style="s2"> It is not only catastrophic but also difficult</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.401" end="02:05:00.971" style="s2"> Oh my god but he handled it perfectly</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.942" end="02:05:05.606" style="s2"> This thing could have been worse</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.130" end="02:05:10.011" style="s2"> This is a tragedy but it did not deteriorate into hell</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.765" end="02:05:13.477" style="s2"> I was there when she died</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.990" end="02:05:20.136" style="s2"> I later found out that my wife’s family is really good at dealing with death</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.502" end="02:05:23.268" style="s2"> A sister of my wife is a hospice nurse</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.790" end="02:05:26.097" style="s2"> You need to be very strong to be a hospice nurse</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.138" end="02:05:27.903" style="s2"> But it can still be done, which is interesting</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.903" end="02:05:31.192" style="s2"> This career means that you can be in the last stage of people’s lives</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.587" end="02:05:34.447" style="s2"> Build a sincere relationship with them</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.802" end="02:05:37.120" style="s2"> Then they died in front of you one after another</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.568" end="02:05:46.775" style="s2"> But she is so competent, lively, smart and interesting</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.017" end="02:05:49.489" style="s2"> This is really amazing</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.489" end="02:05:51.493" style="s2"> She is someone who can be relied upon in a tragedy</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.838" end="02:05:55.074" style="s2"> My wife’s other sister is a pharmacist</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.585" end="02:05:58.717" style="s2"> My wife has also been a volunteer in the hospice ward</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.717" end="02:06:00.690" style="s2"> She is also good at taking care of</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.690" end="02:06:03.414" style="s2"> People with serious health problems</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.800" end="02:06:07.756" style="s2"> So we were all present when my mother-in-law died</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.554" end="02:06:11.368" style="s2"> You can imagine</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.806" end="02:06:14.468" style="s2"> You can imagine a scene before a sickbed</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.282" end="02:06:18.508" style="s2"> Your mother-in-law is dying, everyone is at a loss</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.884" end="02:06:21.399" style="s2"> If you think it’s not common, then you’re unworldly</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.399" end="02:06:23.143" style="s2"> This is simply too common</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.560" end="02:06:25.690" style="s2"> That situation is not tragedy but hell</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.525" end="02:06:28.351" style="s2"> You may be able to tolerate tragedy</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.351" end="02:06:29.907" style="s2"> But you can&#39;t tolerate hell</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.596" end="02:06:32.798" style="s2"> But it was not like that at the moment my mother-in-law died</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.798" end="02:06:34.260" style="s2"> Everyone is pulled closer</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.635" end="02:06:37.422" style="s2"> She passed away</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.070" end="02:06:39.353" style="s2"> But the result is very interesting</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.353" end="02:06:43.372" style="s2"> This family is closer</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.372" end="02:06:46.305" style="s2"> On the one hand, although something has been taken away</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.744" end="02:06:48.372" style="s2"> But on the other hand, what did you get</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.372" end="02:06:49.155" style="s2"> This is no small thing</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.155" end="02:06:51.681" style="s2"> I&#39;m not trying to be optimistic</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.702" end="02:06:54.813" style="s2"> Not the kind of &quot;the world is so beautiful&quot; chicken soup</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.648" end="02:06:59.124" style="s2"> It’s very difficult for someone to die well</p>
<p begin="02:06:59.614" end="02:07:02.349" style="s2"> But my God, but things could have gotten worse</p>
<p begin="02:07:02.349" end="02:07:03.758" style="s2"> Maybe this is good enough</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.842" end="02:07:04.291" style="s2"> That&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.491" end="02:07:07.401" style="s2"> I am often curious</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.153" end="02:07:13.216" style="s2"> If people do their best to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.216" end="02:07:14.291" style="s2"> Keep an eye on your surroundings</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.251" end="02:07:18.310" style="s2"> So the tragedy of life</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.717" end="02:07:22.485" style="s2"> There is no need to deteriorate into intolerable hell</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.725" end="02:07:24.458" style="s2"> Hell does not have to be part of life</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.875" end="02:07:26.994" style="s2"> Then maybe we can tolerate tragedy</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.994" end="02:07:28.633" style="s2"> Maybe even overcome it</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.644" end="02:07:31.410" style="s2"> Or even alleviate it because we can do it</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.410" end="02:07:33.028" style="s2"> We have been doing similar things</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.508" end="02:07:35.115" style="s2"> This is an open question</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.097" end="02:07:37.610" style="s2"> Iliad described this very well</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.541" end="02:07:43.007" style="s2"> Is the flood really the result of things collapsing?</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.571" end="02:07:49.531" style="s2"> Or the flood is actually the result of people making mistakes</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.573" end="02:07:52.464" style="s2"> And these mistakes were made knowingly</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.923" end="02:07:53.936" style="s2"> Are they guilty?</p>
<p begin="02:07:53.936" end="02:07:55.126" style="s2"> This means not hitting the bullseye</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.126" end="02:07:57.015" style="s2"> Missing the bull&#39;s eye this is an archery term</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.132" end="02:07:59.980" style="s2"> Say people don&#39;t have a clear goal</p>
<p begin="02:07:59.980" end="02:08:03.414" style="s2"> You can&#39;t hit the target without aiming</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.414" end="02:08:06.598" style="s2"> Or after aiming and saying</p>
<p begin="02:08:07.266" end="02:08:09.990" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s not that unimportant anyway.&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.773" end="02:08:12.642" style="s2"> Be careful when you are saying this</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.892" end="02:08:14.948" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s not that unimportant anyway.&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.095" end="02:08:17.120" style="s2"> If you say that</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.360" end="02:08:20.209" style="s2"> One thing that might happen to you is</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.470" end="02:08:24.896" style="s2"> You may end up in hell for a long time</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.189" end="02:08:29.051" style="s2"> May even be left in hell</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.677" end="02:08:31.932" style="s2"> Some people are indeed in this situation</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.266" end="02:08:33.811" style="s2"> I have seen someone there</p>
<p begin="02:08:34.051" end="02:08:37.923" style="s2"> How to come out once you get there is no small problem</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.498" end="02:08:42.443" style="s2"> So the important thing is that important things will be handled</p>
<p begin="02:08:43.038" end="02:08:46.337" style="s2"> It’s important to walk with God as best you can</p>
<p begin="02:08:46.744" end="02:08:48.936" style="s2"> We&#39;ll talk more about it next time</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.520" end="02:08:52.944" style="s2"> This may be how you build the ark</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.986" end="02:08:56.890" style="s2"> To withstand the flood, even if the flood comes, you can retreat</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.903" end="02:08:59.030" style="s2"> The problem is that the flood will come eventually</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.844" end="02:09:02.067" style="s2"> The funny thing is that I noticed</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.777" end="02:09:05.836" style="s2"> Our education system how we teach students</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.608" end="02:09:09.938" style="s2"> For example, &quot;trigger warning&quot; is garbage</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.690" end="02:09:12.120" style="s2"> If it&#39;s in my class</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.120" end="02:09:14.520" style="s2"> I guess I will be warned every 15 seconds</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.141" end="02:09:18.967" style="s2"> I will tell my students when they are young</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.967" end="02:09:24.823" style="s2"> Don&#39;t fool yourself or you will get seriously ill</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.356" end="02:09:27.558" style="s2"> At least one or two or three</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.913" end="02:09:29.531" style="s2"> One is likely to be chronic</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.980" end="02:09:31.953" style="s2"> If it is not you who is sick, it will be the one you love</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.994" end="02:09:33.195" style="s2"> Will be your husband</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.195" end="02:09:34.197" style="s2"> Will be your parents</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.197" end="02:09:35.136" style="s2"> Will be your child</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.356" end="02:09:39.792" style="s2"> It will come with death and pain</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.337" end="02:09:43.560" style="s2"> When this happens</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.560" end="02:09:44.416" style="s2"> What do you want to be</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.147" end="02:09:46.305" style="s2"> This is the question that should be asked</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.733" end="02:09:49.562" style="s2"> The question should not be &quot;how to be happy&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.990" end="02:09:51.107" style="s2"> If so, then good luck</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.347" end="02:09:53.842" style="s2"> I think that is a stupid goal</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.842" end="02:09:54.792" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s too shallow</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.376" end="02:10:00.470" style="s2"> If you are lucky, happiness will come and walk like a cloud and see the sun</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.731" end="02:10:02.955" style="s2"> If you have achieved happiness, like you</p>
<p begin="02:10:03.205" end="02:10:04.708" style="s2"> Enjoy it</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.708" end="02:10:07.631" style="s2"> Happiness is a gift from the universe</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.080" end="02:10:10.306" style="s2"> But as a pursuit, forget it</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.306" end="02:10:13.195" style="s2"> The pursuit should be when the flood comes</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.218" end="02:10:15.919" style="s2"> You want to be the one who built the ark</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.047" end="02:10:18.706" style="s2"> This is the story of Noah</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.353" end="02:10:21.660" style="s2"> The flood will always come</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.911" end="02:10:25.669" style="s2"> This story is worth mentioning</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.201" end="02:10:29.907" style="s2"> There are apocalyptic elements in the Judeo-Christian tradition</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.120" end="02:10:36.900" style="s2"> The end of the world is always here</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.141" end="02:10:39.072" style="s2"> You should be prepared for trial</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.708" end="02:10:41.368" style="s2"> On this point, this is true</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.723" end="02:10:46.702" style="s2"> The reason is that the end of the world is imminent</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.318" end="02:10:51.754" style="s2"> Will come and you will be judged</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.736" end="02:10:55.293" style="s2"> Because when the world collapses</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.303" end="02:10:56.775" style="s2"> It&#39;s you who decide how to do it</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.287" end="02:11:01.045" style="s2"> This will be the ultimate moral issue</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.525" end="02:11:03.132" style="s2"> It will push you to the limit</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.602" end="02:11:07.558" style="s2"> You will clearly see where your unknown weakness is</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.195" end="02:11:10.481" style="s2"> Because this is what happened in a crisis</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.961" end="02:11:13.404" style="s2"> The reason why this is a realistic prototype</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.404" end="02:11:16.379" style="s2"> The coming end of the world</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.483" end="02:11:18.414" style="s2"> The reason is hidden in the entire Judeo-Christian structure</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.414" end="02:11:21.650" style="s2"> Because we have been living in the end</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.942" end="02:11:25.324" style="s2"> No matter the micro or macro in your world</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.097" end="02:11:26.848" style="s2"> Are coming to an end</p>
<p begin="02:11:27.067" end="02:11:29.520" style="s2"> What should you do to prepare</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.917" end="02:11:33.414" style="s2"> Prepare for the end of your world</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.113" end="02:11:35.418" style="s2"> When the world ends</p>
<p begin="02:11:35.418" end="02:11:36.410" style="s2"> You might get a new world</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.807" end="02:11:37.767" style="s2"> That would be a good result</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.422" end="02:11:44.082" style="s2"> Now we are finally ready for next week</p>
