 The Psychological Significance of "Bible" Story Sixth Lecture The Flood——Psychological Background Jordan B. Peterson
 Let's go directly to the topic
 I also like this story
 Stories about Noah's Flood and the Tower of Babel
 It is as interesting as other stories in the Bible
 The Tower of Babel is one of these stories
 Like the story of Cain and Abel
 Only a few sentences
 In a way, the story of the Tower of Babel is just a fragment
 Although Noah’s story is very complete
 But like the stories we told before
 We can analyze this story from multiple levels at the same time
 So what I will do next
 Start with some background knowledge
 Some background knowledge of psychology
 Only those knowledge stories are meaningful
 The first thing I want to talk about is
 You are born with a priori perception structure
 This is actually a realized structure
 Is human beings 3.5 billion years
 The result of always trying to integrate my body
 Such a long time not only changed your body
 Also changed your mind
 Mind is part of body
 And closely attached to it
 You tend to think that the brain is in your head
 And it seems to be independent of the rest of the body
 this is not right
 You have a large and complex
 The neuron system operates throughout your body
 The neuron system operates throughout your body
 Neurons in the autonomic nervous system
 More neurons than in the central nervous system
 There are a lot of neurons
 Your central nervous system allows you to
 Exercise your ability to spontaneously control your own muscle tissue
 Can also receive feedback from muscle tissue
 The role of the brain is actually all over your body
 What you may not know is
 If you put the paraplegic patient on the treadmill to stabilize
 They can actually walk
 Their legs can move involuntarily controlled
 Your spine can do such complex actions
 Actually when you walk
 It controls your feet up and down
 In most cases
 So what I mean by this is
 Bluntly
 You don’t have a sense of leaving a blank space
 Understand the world as something independent of its own manifestation
 This kind of consciousness does not exist
 You have a built-in interpretation system
 This is an unusually deep-rooted and imperceptible system
 Because you will treat this system as
 Hidden part of one's own subconscious
 This system leads to your conscious experience
 It determines what kind of person you are in the world
 This is one of the ways to look at this system
 This is a very good way to understand
 Psychoanalysis is understood like this
 This is also understood in neuroscience
 Something very interesting about modern neuroscientists
 Especially among the top neuroscientists and
 Among the neuroscientists involved in emotion research
 as far as I know
 They are often obsessed with psychoanalysis
 Jacques Panksepp is a good example
 They agree with the claims of psychoanalysts
 Think the lower subconscious and anthropomorphic motivation
 Actually accurately reflects how the brain is active
 So you can think of yourself as a loose collection
 This collection is made up of autonomous souls
 They are controlled by some primary personality
 This is a reasonable way to understand
 Then the problem is coming
 What is the nature of the transcendental structure you used to explain the world
 I think the clearest answer is "it is a story"
 Because you live in the story
 I think this view is very interesting
 Because i think
 Actually I have some videos that also illustrate this point
 I think Darwin’s hypothesis
 At least as basic as Newton’s hypothesis
 Actually I think Darwin’s hypothesis is more basic
 We have evolved a story structure
 And use it to explain the world
 For me
 Story-based cognitive structure contains deeper truth
 They are all true
 At least since we developed these structures
 This means we are still alive here
 It took us 350 million years to develop these story structures
 They are highly functional
 There is no better definition of truth than highly functional
 That's the best
 Partly because we are limitless creatures
 We can't know everything
 Generally speaking, the limit we can do with knowledge
 Is the function of recording things
 Then improve it when it works abnormally
 I think the scientific method is doing this
 We gradually developed such a story structure
 And use it to explain the world
 This thing is so interesting
 What it describes is the basic essence of the story
 However, it is also strange that
 We have knowledge of the known and the unknown
 Clear division of labor in the left and right hemispheres
 Or the cognition of chaos and order
 Sorry to say that order and chaos will be treated separately
 This also reveals some basic nature of the world
 If you assume that we have evolved to
 Can reflect the structure of the world
 Generally speaking
 Obviously this is not just a physical structure
 Matter particles like atoms and molecules
 It’s formed by matter particles over time
 The increasingly complex structure and all its performance modes
 This includes human interaction
 Political interaction
 Economic interaction
 Interactions in the family
 These are important parts of our reality
 But maybe in a sense
 They are not what physicists are concerned about
 Something as basic as physical properties
 We live in the story
 I want to say more about the story and its structure
 When you understand a little bit of the structure of the story
 Then this whole set of myths
 Suddenly everything makes sense
 This is very useful
 What you can see is
 Many daily events in everyone’s life
 Are generally described in mythology
 This helped us a lot
 First of all it makes you no longer isolated from the world
 I realized one thing while studying clinical psychology
 This is contrary to the view of antipsychiatrists
 That is, diagnosis is often a relief for the visitor
 There was a problem when the patient was diagnosed
 Because you might be labeled
 And this label may follow you for life
 Once you have been tagged
 A lot of strange things happen around you
 These things usually reinforce that label
 Maybe you will show it more through action
 Or you will internalize it as your own identity
 There is another situation
 This is what you said in the mouth of a doctor or a psychologist
 The last words to hear
 It’s "I’ve never seen a situation like you."
 Yes
 This is not a relief
 If the doctor gave you the information
 "I have never heard of anything similar to what you are talking about."
 The result of saying this may be of little benefit to you
 Or you don’t want to listen anymore
 Because in their eyes you are a disturbing vision
 In the eyes of these people with professional medical knowledge, you are a monster
 But you are still trying to ask them for advice
 It is true
 As long as you can be classified into one category
 The doctor will know how to treat you
 This is actually a relief for the doctor
 It's the same for you, right
 Think about it when you go to the doctor and say
 "Oh, I can't get out of the house anymore"
 "I'm afraid of taking the elevator."
 "I get heart palpitations when I take the elevator."
 "Sometimes I was sent to the emergency room."
 "My range of activities in life is constantly restricted"
 "I can only stay at home"
 "I am afraid that I will die of a heart attack."
 The psychologist will say
 "You have a fear of heights"
 "Many people have a fear of heights."
 "This is how it usually comes out"
 "These are treatment options."
 "We have some ways to treat it."
 "You should not die from a heart attack for the time being"
 Then this is a relief
 "You are not crazy like no other in the world."
 "You still have medicine to save"
 This is a huge relief
 People take a brood of worried snakes to the doctor
 And when they left there was only one snake left to handle
 Although it is still a snake
 But the handleable snake is much better than the Hydra
 Back to the story itself
 The stories we tell and the stories we live in
 Is our basic way of dealing with the complexity of the world
 in my opinion
 Basic problems of the world
 It's not only that it's too complicated to understand
 And this complexity will become unpredictable
 This is actually a Darwinian dilemma
 This is why Darwinism looks
 There is a practical necessity on the issue of continuing life
 Complexity is always changing in unpredictable ways
 And you may not be able to figure it out
 What will work in the future
 According to the Darwinian solution process is this
 First produce almost random variants
 And then make any one of them can accidentally
 Happens to survive in the environment
 To be precise it is not random
 Because the hidden structure has always been conserved
 The child is born with an extra arm or something similar
 Are rare
 The bone structure of your body in the history of evolution
 Can be traced back to animals long ago
 There are many things that have been conserved during evolution
 There are some changes within the conservative, just like music
 Music is a good example of understanding this change
 The stories we tell have exactly the same structure
 They have their own core elements and their own changes
 Okay let's go back to those stories
 I just mentioned the first question
 It's about complexity
 Things are often too complicated to handle
 This often leads to serious consequences
 Everyone ends up like this
 Their lives have become too complicated
 To the point of death
 A lot will happen as you go to death
 Terrible things related to complexity
 You may get serious illness that you can't handle
 Or walk in in an intimate relationship
 A dead end with no way out
 This happens too often to people
 For example, those who want to commit suicide
 I often feel that they are driven to desperation
 There is no correct option
 Face terrible things no matter where you turn
 And they don’t see any way out
 Sometimes this is more real than you think
 We tend to think
 The problems of these people are mainly psychological problems
 But actually not
 As a clinician, you will soon realize one thing
 I.e. people come to you
 Because they have mental illness
 It’s because of problems in dealing with complexity
 Their lives are out of their control
 They don’t know how to regain control of their lives
 Many things will make you fall into this trouble
 Then of course it will make you anxious or depressed
 This is the fuse of almost all mental illnesses
 But the basic question is still
 Things are beyond your ability
 This is actually a physiological and psychological problem
 Not a purely psychological problem
 Your abilities have an upper limit
 From a resource point of view
 Your ability is not enough to solve the urgent complexity
 Your ability is not enough
 If you get into an overly complicated situation
 You will exhaust your physical and psychological resources
 This is what the concept of chaos represents
 It represents the complexity below the surface
 Can surface all the time
 It will surface in this case as an example
 When you wake up and feel a little pain in some parts of your body
 "It should be okay" you ignore it
 But it got worse and you ended up in the hospital
 Maybe you will find an analogy
 You have pancreatic cancer
 You can only live for another six months
 It's over
 At this time you finally stepped through the thin ice that everyone walked on
 You now know what's under the surface
 Beneath the surface is the deep-rooted complexity of life
 This is chaos
 People have spent a long time
 To understand this conceptual "schema"
 Before human beings have a clear understanding of it
 Basically rely on imagination and story to complete this understanding
 There are some images that represent the hidden chaos
 One of them is the Chaos Dragon
 It's exactly like the picture just now
 The dragons that heroes have to face
 Is a symbol of the unknown
 Is something lurking under the surface
 Dragons often guard the treasure
 Because the unknown contains possibilities
 We mentioned before
 In the creation myth of Mesopotamia
 Water exists at the beginning of time
 Including salt water and clear water
 Are all symbols of chaos before the universe formed
 For example, people often dream
 I guess many of you have had this dream
 Dreaming that I am in a house I am familiar with
 But suddenly found one or several new rooms
 Maybe some new rooms were found in the basement
 These rooms are often messy
 There is water everywhere
 These are very common things
 It means you broke
 The limits of your conscious self-understanding
 Go to a new field full of possibilities
 But this new field has an amazing amount of work to be done
 Think this is a whole new part of you
 But it has not been well developed
 Essentially it is filled with chaos
 I think the reason
 Partly because chaos is not only when you didn’t expect it
 Where the fall
 And you are directly facing
 And the unknown from which new things are born
 Water is a symbol of life especially in the desert
 Because life cannot do without water
 When you want to talk about something that can both give life
 And potentially fatal things
 Water naturally becomes their symbol
 A little water can quench thirst
 But a lot of water can cause a shipwreck
 These are the two extremes of water
 There are many such subtexts in "Genesis"
 There are also other places in the Old Testament
 About God conquered a powerful monster
 Leviathan or Behemoth
 It has a snake-like appearance
 The result of this conflict is that the world was created
 This is a concept about the power of creation
 Which is the logos we talked about earlier
 It is constantly facing chaos
 Another way to look at chaos is
 Think of it as an aggressive creeping monster
 They often live in the abyss or underwater
 I think this may be due to
 We are using our own predator detection circuit
 To complete this pre-cognitive process
 Its basic point is
 Your predator detection circuit is used
 Deal with instant threats
 It is fast but the resolution is low
 It doesn't contain much thinking
 But it's really fast
 This also illustrates our ability and tendency
 That quickly move those
 The people who subvert our conceptual structure
 Seen as an enemy of a predator variant
 We will react this way without thinking
 This is the prototype
 If something rushes over and scares you
 For example, a shark
 Is something lurking underwater
 It will pull you to the bottom
 Then it's your enemy
 Then you should be prepared
 This is a very reasonable defense strategy
 Although it is also risky
 And sometimes errors
 The picture we use to build the story
 Basically an all-encompassing chaos
 This chaos is beyond our ability to understand
 On all levels
 Individual level, family level, social level, economic level
 We are all constantly being
 The threat posed by the collapse of the environment where one lives
 For example, you have a house
 How much time did you spend maintaining it
 Of course it took a lot of work, why did you do this?
 Because the house will collapse on its own because of your stupidity
 You didn't maintain it properly causing it to fall apart
 Or you overlooked something, right
 I say these for some professional reasons
 The house collapsed because of your incompetence
 But even if you have the ability it will still collapse
 This is the principle of entropy
 Things have a tendency to fall apart on their own
 So you have to do your best
 To keep things as they are
 Of course
 It will turn a blind eye to you
 Bad repair skills
 And your unwillingness to become complicated
 We will return to a very classic point of view
 A point made by Mircea Iliad
 He is a famous religious historian
 He extracted this point of view from the massive flood legends
 There are two reasons why the earth will periodically have disasters
 One is because things decompose themselves
 Is the principle of entropy increase
 I don’t remember which law of thermodynamics is
 But a very important law in thermodynamics
 Is one of the three laws of thermodynamics
 Things fall apart spontaneously
 This is one of the things we have to fight against
 2. The speed of things collapse will be accelerated by human sin
 Everyone knows this truth
 You know very well in your heart
 For example, your car broke down on the highway
 You will think it is really inconvenient
 You punched the sky
 But at the same time another part of you
 Will mutter deep in your heart
 "I know the car keeps clicking but I ignore it
 "And it actually foreshadows something."
 "I know I should pay more attention to this."
 "But I didn't, so I got into where I am now"
 I bet these things happen two or three times a week
 People do something they know they shouldn’t do
 And told myself not to do stupid things a few seconds ago
 A voice in their hearts said
 "Don't do that" "I know, I know"
 But you knowingly committed
 Seek benevolence
 Self-inflicted
 Then you suffered a double injury
 Because not only did things fall apart
 And you're the fool who let it fall
 I knew it would collapse but I ignored it
 This is the concept behind this view
 Things fall apart for two reasons
 Thermodynamic entropy increase and
 People have such a tendency
 Ignore some things I know I should do
 We did this partly because
 When problems arise
 I will always announce my arrival
 Unless it's so small that you can automatically solve it
 Its appearance is always accompanied by negative emotions
 This is part of the predator detection circuit
 It will fail, disappointment, grief
 Or to announce its arrival in the worst form of anxiety
 Not surprising because it is a problem, right
 One of the logical responses is
 Be dazed by the problem
 But as long as it is a problem, it can be classified and solved
 Staying and running away is not a good solution
 Because things tend to fall apart autonomously
 If you just throw it aside
 It will only get worse, not better
 This is a very disturbing thing in life
 for example
 If you have received a warning from the tax bureau
 You ignored it
 The probability of it disappearing is almost zero, right?
 What will actually happen
 The more you ignore the problem, the more serious it becomes
 If you ignore it long enough
 It becomes powerful enough to swallow you
 Then you're done
 I was reading "Harpers Magazine" once
 It says people would rather be robbed than be charged
 I believe this is true
 Because the robbery is over
 Only a few minutes of pure horror
 Lost your wallet and life as usual
 And auditing is like a semi-fatal disease
 This is chaos
 Here is a point about chaos
 The psychological point of view
 Chaos is actually
 The spirit of God depicted in Genesis
 Something orderly extracted at the beginning of time
 This is what we are constantly fighting against
 We also fight to construct in the same way
 And maintain the world we live in
 This is amazing
 In an environment called "pre-cosmic chaos" by Eliad
 Our ancestors were surrounded by predators
 And the way our neural structure is built
 Was born to deal with this environment
 When I first connected the two
 Really initiating
 It speaks for itself
 The world is too complicated for us to handle
 This is one of the problems we have to continue to face
 Then the question is how do you deal with it
 Things will get worse if you ignore it
 So ignoring it is no use at all
 We know this
 So if you ignore it, it's useless
 Then do something it might be useful
 For example, I found in Egyptian mythology
 Horus is the god of attention
 There is such a god in Mesopotamian mythology
 Marduk has a ring of eyes above his head
 How can we turn the tide before the building will fall
 The answer to this is to take the initiative to deal with them
 This fits well with those hero myths
 These myths all preach a point of view
 If there is a dragon hiding around you
 Hiding it in the basement will only make it stronger
 It's time to go out and face those problems
 The usual story is
 You might be killed by a dragon
 After all, it's a dragon
 But this is only a possibility
 The opposite is undoubtedly
 If you happen to be attacked at home in the middle of the night
 You still have a hangover
 It just ended a bad day
 At this time you are not ready for your sword and shield
 Usually this is what happens in those
 The situation in the person who is running away
 This is not something we should promote
 How you choose is a dead end
 It's good to be extremely pessimistic at a certain point
 That’s it’s so liberating
 It's a relief to happen often
 This is really a habit worth developing
 Sometimes you get stuck no matter what you do
 Being an extremely pessimist is a relief
 So you won't struggle everywhere to find a way out
 Because there is no way out
 You can choose the tragic way of death A
 You can choose the tragic way of death A
 I know it sucks to look at things this way
 But it is very helpful for understanding the following question
 That is, many times you always have the least of two evils
 If this is all you can do
 If life is like this for you
 Okay, come on
 Make the worst choice
 Also the best thing you can do
 Good enough
 Especially with another option
 The worst option is even more so
 anyway
 The basic reality of things is complex beyond understanding
 The question is how do you face it
 Here is the part of the patriarchal order
 I have to declare in advance
 The "patriarchy" here is analyzed from a positive perspective
 After the patriarchal structure is missing
 Can't think of a better word right now
 The rest can only be chaos
 Chaos is not a good thing
 If it's too messy
 The less self you can keep
 If you think you can have no prior structure
 And the context of the social structure
 Then you really know too little about humans
 Because for one thing I observed, for example
 Our ability to maintain our sanity depends largely on
 A well-ordered social structure
 The reason is this
 First of all you have to know what you do almost every day
 You have to have a fixed daily routine
 Because humans are also animals
 If you have a dog or cat, you know
 Dog is a good example
 Dogs like a fixed daily routine
 They like a fixed number of times per day
 Go for a walk at a fixed time
 If you don’t regulate their daily routine
 They will get sick soon
 The same for children
 It can be exaggerated but in general
 You still have to know the approximate time to wake up
 About the same time every day
 You have to know your approximate food
 Need to know what to eat
 With whom
 You have to know where to buy ingredients
 70% to 80% of your life
 It's almost this ratio
 Are made up of the procedures you repeat every day
 But these repeated parts are often considered by many people to be
 The least important part of their lives
 But one thing I must point out is
 You will know
 I have analyzed this to a client of mine
 He suffered a lot of crimes for coaxing his children to sleep
 It's a battle every night
 Research at that time has shown
 Most parents spend only 20 minutes a day on average
 Be alone with your children
 Because everyone is too busy
 Set aside 20 minutes of one-on-one time every day
 It's actually not that easy
 These 20 minutes are much longer than you think
 But it’s only 20 minutes
 My client spends about 40 minutes a day
 Bother trying to put the child to bed
 It's not fun at all
 You might think okay
 It's just a little trouble making the kids sleep
 Things are not as simple as you think
 If this kind of petty fight is performed every day
 It was a disaster
 So do the math for yourself
 Just roughly assume 5 hours a week
 Don't need to be too precise
 That is 20 hours a month
 240 hours per year
 Count it down to six 40-hour work weeks
 In other words, he wasted a month and a half of the work week
 I can't do anything, I can only fight against my son
 Just to put my son to bed
 Sounds terrible right
 If you want to have a positive relationship with others
 It’s best not to spend too much time on this kind of thing
 This is too bad
 Therefore you need a structure
 Need for predictability
 You need them more than you think
 To help you stay sane
 If you are lucky
 May sound weird
 You can deviate from normal behavior patterns by 5%
 Or 10% more
 But also with caution and caution
 As long as you haven’t deviated from the usual
 Then it's OK to be a little abnormal
 Maybe it can be maintained for a long time
 The people around you can also tolerate your aberrations
 Or maybe you are really lucky
 You are very creative, decent and organized
 People will be more than happy to contact you
 Because you are so unique
 But even in this case
 In general, what you need most is a fixed schedule
 An orderly and predictable schedule
 Then be able to strictly enforce it
 In this way you will be healthier, happier and more rational
 There is one more thing you need
 I think the psychoanalyst here is wrong
 They overestimate the internal rational construction
 Importance to sound mind
 Because from a psychological point of view
 You are "self" in a way
 It's inside you
 Of course it lives on the unconscious structure
 The purpose of psychoanalysis is to clarify this unconscious structure
 And the self attached to it
 To help you become a completely independent individual
 But this perception has a problem
 Because you as a rational and autonomous human
 Not all because your mind is organized
 Although it is important
 If your subconscious and self-organized
 Why you can stay sane
 Because the people around you can
 Tolerate your various behaviors
 And whenever you act too stupidly
 They will alert you in time
 If you don’t realize it, you will get people’s permanent disgust
 People do it all the time
 I can't get tired of it
 Send this kind of spiritual message back and forth
 For example, if people behave reasonably
 And you are happy to see it happen, you will smile at them
 Otherwise you will frown
 Or ignore them
 Avoid them and roll their eyes at them
 You make an expression of disgust and don't listen to them
 You interrupt them not to cooperate with them
 Disdain to compete
 You frequently send this kind of signal to others
 To regulate their behavior
 All your social interactions are doing things like this
 This is why we communicate face to face
 And why our faces express emotions
 We look at each other
 Can know each other's current status
 Because we can’t directly understand what each other is thinking
 In part, you do a fixed schedule
 To mold yourself into such a
 A trustworthy and perhaps funny person
 At the same time, he won’t do anything too out of line
 Everyone around you
 Are shaping you in this way
 Make sure you look the way you should
 This is why you stay sane
 If people don’t have a fixed schedule
 They will start to become isolated and erratic
 Deviated further and further
 Because the world is too complicated
 It is impossible to keep its organization organized by oneself
 You really can't do it
 So we use other means to stay sane
 This is very wise
 Because the spiritual and mental issues are too complicated
 The way we deal with this complexity is
 We have developed an extremely large brain capacity
 We use it to handle many problems in parallel
 It can be said to be like a "mental stock market"
 I use this term deliberately
 Because the stock market is also doing the impossible
 It tries to price things
 But it can't be done
 There are countless items in the world
 How can you price each item?
 Can't do it at all
 That’s why the stock market came into being
 From the consumer point of view that is the free market
 So in the free market
 Everyone is voting all the time to determine the price of everything
 We price items in this way
 Because it’s impossible to price each item individually
 This is part of the reason why the stock market soars from time to time
 And things like stock market bubbles
 Having said that, what I mean by this is
 Everything is chaotic
 In "Alice in Wonderland"
 Alice fell into the rabbit hole
 The underground world
 Since then she has been exposed to the underlying structure of being
 She met the red queen
 Mother Nature
 Mother Nature is running around
 Clamoring to cut off someone's head
 This is exactly what Mother Nature is doing
 She told Alice
 "In my kingdom you have to run as hard as you can
 "Can stay in place"
 The fact is
 Evolutionary biologists and psychologists
 Put forward the so-called "red queen hypothesis"
 The content of this hypothesis is
 You are facing all kinds of situations all the time
 And your intelligence is not enough to face or face everything
 This is an eternal problem
 So how do you face it
 You rely on your own biological structure
 Your physical avatar can partially solve this problem
 Besides, you can be shaped by the environment
 Therefore
 You learned a lot of things you need to know
 But the most important thing is that you learned
 How to communicate effectively with others in a good manner
 Once you have the ability to do so
 You can always use external forces to solve problems
 This is also what you do everyday
 Our daily interaction is to continuously communicate solutions
 If you are a social person
 This is what you need to do
 If you plan to have children
 There is something to understand
 I seem to have mentioned in a previous lecture
 As a parent of extremely young children
 Your goal is before the child is four years old
 Nurture them to be extremely popular with the environment
 If you can achieve this goal
 They have successfully finalized
 Because everyone is happy to have their company
 Once people want to interact with them
 I want to play with them
 Want to cooperate with
 Have the desire to compete
 It's as if all the doors are open for them
 The reason why they can stay sane
 Because everyone loves and is willing to help them
 So your goal is to do as much as possible
 Make them acceptable and welcome in the social environment
 It’s not that we should turn them into soulless walking dead
 That is a tyrant-style compulsory socialization
 For example, the common reprimand "Don't do anything wrong"
 This is not a good way
 Although this is a good suggestion in itself
 But this advice is not complete
 You have to do a lot of things right
 So that people like to have your company
 Encourage what you do
 This is you as a parent
 Things to do besides instilling normative awareness
 This schematic is like this
 The Father is followed by a round of sun
 He rules this walled city
 He can be said to be the soul of this city
 This picture is really wonderful
 The same can be said
 He is the collective spirit of this city
 In other words, the collective spirit of the city has accumulated over time
 Or the collective spirit of strength
 This force has built and maintained the city over time
 This statement is better
 Here is connected with the sun again
 Because the sun symbolizes enlightenment and light
 And everything related to higher consciousness and revelation
 This is a very subtle picture
 Then on this basis, I give this explanation
 Of course patriarchy may develop into autocracy
 This does happen often
 This is a persistent danger in human civilization
 Civilization is the antidote to chaos
 But it will develop out of control from time to time
 I became a problem of myself
 Roughly speaking, it looks like a super problem
 It will create chaotic problems
 Each solution creates certain problems
 No one solution is perfect
 You have to find balance
 For postmodernists
 One thing can be said that annoys me
 They keep complaining about patriarchy
 It's really annoying
 The social structure is autocratic, which speaks for itself
 What's the fuss about this, friends
 This couldn't be more obvious
 But the social structure is not exactly like this
 Patriarchy can be said to be a one-dimensional problem
 Extremely simplified solution
 Some people think this is dictatorship
 Actually not at all
 If you stay in a place where only dictatorship remains in the first half of the year
 You will soon find the difference
 But this does not mean
 Even if you live in a free and enlightened Western society
 People don’t need to make any sacrifices to participate in social construction
 We are all shaped by the autocratic side of social customs
 But basically
 This is more pros than cons
 Furthermore, do you have to sacrifice too much for the group?
 The choice is yours
 If you make too much sacrifice for the group
 You will be aware
 Because you will start to be angry and irritable to others
 Your mental mechanism is telling you this in this way
 It depends on whether you want to fight
 The huge pressure of complying with social regulations
 To keep your individual logos
 This is the problem you have to face
 The collective wants you to behave
 If you can follow the norms and be creative
 That would be better
 But this situation is very rare
 Generally speaking, the group just wants you to behave well
 This is the authoritarian part
 Is there any other alternative
 Our society is built on consensus
 Consensus is based on a certain degree of individual sacrifice
 Although the individual is a social revival
 An absolutely necessary revitalizing force
 It is difficult to grasp this problem
 Anyway your physical structure
 Is your first line of defense against chaos
 Your body presents you to the world in a certain way
 The second line of defense can be said to be
 The social structure you live in
 You can also call it the ability hierarchy
 Thank goodness
 Maybe you can master one or two things in your life
 But you have to know a little bit more about it
 If you face all possible situations alone
 You are solving difficult math problems
 Watching the bathtub leak all over the place but feel helpless
 This is not so good
 You can call a plumber at this time
 Everything is fine
 We tend to cooperate with each other to control the chaos
 At the same time, it also controls the orderly development
 Political dialogue is like this, right
 We maintain culture to control chaos
 At the same time find a balance in it to control the rational development of culture
 Only in this way can we
 In a peaceful and productive way
 Life for a long time
 The best we can do
 We should be grateful when things work effectively
 Because everything is in the natural state
 Not only do they not work well on their own
 Will gradually get worse over time
 You should be amazed whenever anything is working properly
 So what does this framework look like?
 I think it should be like this
 In my opinion, it is the basic structure of many things
 It is a basic structured story
 Is the basic conceptual framework
 In Heidegger's words, the basic Dasein
 It is the frame of the world in which you live
 You must exist in one
 No exception
 You can convert between different frames
 But the essence remains the same, you are still in the frame
 This is the world you live in
 You exist somewhere
 It is inevitable
 Although you may not know where you live
 It means you are in chaos
 In this case, you have to look back carefully
 Figure out where you are now
 It's like you're lost
 The problem with it is
 You don't know where to go
 Because you have countless places to go
 The problem is that there are too many options
 There are too many places where you can stay safe and sound
 It's not a good thing to be lost
 You have to know where you are
 I built an online project with my partner
 Called "Past Writing Project"
 Called "Past Writing Project"
 This project helps people clarify their past
 It breaks down life into six stages
 We call each stage a period
 Then find out the deepest moments in each period
 Record what happened
 Good or bad
 What is the corresponding result at the same time
 What did you get from it
 Maybe you could have chosen another way of doing things
 Maybe you can learn something from it
 In this way you can clear the fog
 Find a direction for yourself
 But many people don’t like to do this
 Because they actually don’t want to know
 They would rather be muddled
 Open one eye to everything, close one eye
 Fancy that the surrounding environment is much better than the actual situation
 Trying to deceive myself in an ambiguous state
 They would rather do this than face actual problems
 But you better go face them up
 Because once you have a clear problem
 You clarify the problems and understand their essence
 You can start to solve the problem
 Step by step
 But if you don’t know where you live
 There is no way to talk about it
 You will be aware of this state
 It's easy to feel
 If you have been entangled in the past by things in your dreams
 It may have been more than a year
 But you are still troubled by it every now and then
 They appear repeatedly in your dreams
 Means you have not extracted that world from past experience
 Your potential is still trapped in the past
 To face it is to face the dragon of the past
 Of course it is scary
 Sometimes things can be really scary
 For example, you may be at a loss and confused
 The reason is that you suffered severe abuse in your childhood
 For example, when I was four years old
 The abuser may be a family member
 Because family members are often the abuser
 And this will only make things worse
 this means
 You have encountered a deliberate evil
 If you say it wrong, you have directly encountered deliberate evil
 But tortured you for a long time
 Is the hypothesis implicit in this malice
 It's stuck in your memory lingering
 Imprisoned in the representational structure
 As an adult you have to fully express it
 Then it is possible to get relief from it
 This is not a joke
 In many cases people need to go back to the past
 This is the job of a psychoanalyst
 People have to look back in the past to discover old things
 Aware of the serious blow they bring to themselves
 It’s not that people deliberately suppressed these memories
 We will not discuss some of Freud's fallacies for now
 He's a genius, so let's not talk about it
 Sometimes it’s not suppressed
 It’s because people were young when these bad things happened
 They simply cannot have this ability
 To figure out what happened and how to deal with it
 Or what is the meaning of these things
 Then you can coexist with it
 When you do
 It’s as if your body is in contact with the world in stages
 And it develops very fast
 It may take years of development
 But the initial stage of development is very rapid
 Like you are walking on the street
 Suddenly there was a loud noise behind me
 You will make this defensive action
 By the way, this is the predator defense response
 You will squat like this
 This posture is to prevent the other person from jumping on your back
 So as to easily attack your neck
 About a few hundred milliseconds of response time
 The process is very fast and may be shorter than this
 It's best to do so, otherwise it might be a snake
 Can easily kill you
 So you better respond quickly
 But even this kind of efficiency is not high
 It can deal with dangerous snakes at best
 Or the swiftness of predatory cats
 It will be the fastest
 Then you can analyze and classify these experiences, which takes time
 You are at the emotional level first
 Then deal with them on a cognitive level
 You can think about it
 Maybe you meet at work
 Especially maliciously aggressive
 People often meet this kind of person
 Like a bully
 It's useless to do bad things all day long
 And only spend the rest of my life in this state
 Faced with this situation you are at a loss
 You will be in "prey" mode
 I’m not referring to the “prayer” pattern
 Although it's kind of useful
 I mean you will act like a predator
 You have the following extremely complex issues to analyze
 "What's wrong with this person?"
 "Why make my life so bad"
 "Is this treatment caused by me?"
 It is not so easy to solve these mysteries
 You are easily trapped inside and can't get out
 Maybe you just can't do it
 It may be for you to develop a clear view of good and evil
 To face all the malice around me
 And this kind of ability happens to be something you don't have
 It's that simple
 This is especially true for children
 Even many adults can’t do it
 To solve these problems is not so simple
 Generally these are suffering from
 What soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder have to face
 Because of some terrible things they have experienced
 Or something that you made or witnessed
 They need to update their moral model of the world
 Otherwise they will end up in a hell-like situation
 So you have to know where you are
 Is what this picture shows
 Where do you live
 You are always adjusting your course of action
 Like a sailor on the boundless ocean
 That's why you are a mobile creature
 You are always on the way to a certain destination
 Not like some kind of brainless marine life
 Fix yourself on the rock motionless

 There is a small animal called Hydra which is quite interesting

 Simple structure and compact size
 The juvenile hydra has a brain because it needs to swim around
 Until the Hydra reaches adulthood
 It will attach to the rock and start digesting its own brain
 If you just sit still on the rock
 Of course you don’t need a brain
 But we are not like this
 We explore this world everywhere
 We are navigators
 There are two things you need to know to navigate for yourself
 First, know where you are
 You must know this precisely and clearly
 You have to know your strengths and weaknesses
 From your personal point of view
 You can refer to others’ opinions
 But this is a problem you have to solve on your own
 For example, when I assess the status quo, I say "as far as I am concerned"
 "What advantages do I have and which areas need improvement"
 At this time, you should also be careful not to criticize yourself too much
 Because this behavior is actually a disadvantage
 The next question is where are you going
 What is your goal
 This is the so-called frame
 You can think deeply about this before you tackle it
 You need to think clearly about the following questions
 What kind of person are you
 What is your goal and the reason for it
 How do you achieve your goal
 Few people think about these issues
 As an educator, this really surprised me
 I applied another project to my class
 This is one of my project package series
 Called "Future Writing Project"
 This was developed when I opened the "Map of Meaning" series of courses
 Some materials in my lectures are also derived from this
 In class I asked students to write down their past
 Are we talking about stories?
 Why not tell your story
 Who are you how did you get here what is your state now
 This will help people calm down some of the problems in their lives
 Although you will face a lot of pressure when implementing this method
 The pressure goes up straight when you do it
 You may be malaise for weeks
 Then the pressure gradually eased and remained at a low level
 This is why people usually don’t do this
 After all, no one likes to put pressure on themselves
 But if the pressure is only temporary, it's just a sacrifice
 I just said the next question is where will you go
 There is something I can’t understand
 Students who have received almost 14 years of education
 Most of them are top students
 They live so old
 No one has ever asked them to sit down seriously for a day to answer a question
 "Okay, please come to prove the meaning of your existence."
 Tell the truth, you are in college
 Taking a lot of classes
 Made a vague business plan
 Can you defend your meaning in life?
 After all, this is what you want to achieve
 Success or failure in one fell swoop
 Ask yourself what your plan is
 How can you be sure of your so-called life plan
 It was not brainwashed by a boastful arrogant
 If you haven’t considered this issue seriously
 That's probably brainwashed
 It’s best to think about whether you want to realize your so-called dream
 Jung said such a sentence
 "You live in a story whether you know it or not."
 He made the following two great comments on this
 "If you live in other people’s stories,
 "It's very likely that you're just a perpetrator
 "It's not necessarily the role you want."
 "Or maybe you are unaware of the story you are acting in
 "Then it is very likely that this story has a very negative ending"
 "Or it's a totally bad story"
 If you don’t know what the story you are acting in is like
 That’s probably what I just described
 Maybe you live in a story led by your mother
 Or your grandmother’s female elder
 God knows where you learned it from
 You are always affected by the surrounding environment and personnel
 Humans are like this
 Maybe you are unconsciously acting in a malicious tragedy
 There is something you better ask yourself
 How miserable is your life?
 Better to add the word futile
 Ask yourself how miserable and useless your life is
 You might say, uh, about 70% each
 Then you are probably acting in a tragedy accidentally
 Maybe this is not the best explanation
 Otherwise, the whole world hates you
 At least seven adults hate you
 Anyway in this project
 We asked the students to write down some details
 Not about what they are after
 This is not a business plan or something
 This is the closest thing most people come up with
 They have their own business plan
 No, this is not just a matter of career planning
 Career planning is important, yes but only secondary
 For example, you have three years now
 You have to live it anyway
 Use these three years to create the environment around you
 So that you can live as comfortable as possible
 It's as if you are really taking care of yourself
 What would everything be like if you did this
 For convenience, let’s assume that
 If you know where you are
 Then you can find what is most beneficial to you
 What would it be
 I guess you never asked yourself this question
 Because people ignore this problem
 All kinds of problems in life are like sneaking snakes
 Waiting to give them a head-on blow
 And many people just avoid the problem
 As the years go by
 People find that things are not developing as they thought
 A large part of the reason is
 People don't know where they are
 Because they don't care about this
 Or I don’t know that this is a problem that needs attention
 That is ignorance and turning a blind eye, right
 Two catastrophic causes
 People never figure out their destination and why they want to go
 There is a problem in finding a destination
 It means that you must be clear in your heart what definition of failure is
 People usually don't like it
 But if you've been so confused
 You will be unaware that you have failed
 This is not so good because you just keep frustrating like this
 But I'm blinded to it
 Although this way you can avoid a lot of suffering in the short term
 But if you are clear about your definition of success
 You will be soberly aware of your failures every time
 This is a good thing so you have the opportunity to fix it
 You can correct your defects in your behavior
 Or some of your cognitive deficiencies in the situation
 Or adjust your plan in time
 It's not too late anyway
 Good you are in this frame
 In my opinion you have to make it become
 A best life plan
 Because you have no choice

 If you don't
 Or not consciously
 Or not consciously
 As psychoanalysts pointed out
 You are composed of countless quasi-autonomous subsystems
 They can write stories improvised
 And you are just practicing these stories
 You know it well
 Because if you observe yourself for more than two weeks
 You will miss my goodness
 How many stupid things I did in these two weeks
 Then you will think why
 That's because you are a random
 Quasi-autonomous personality unit
 Not one dominant
 They activate whenever they want
 At first you were hungry and then you were thirsty again
 Then you want to sleep with your wife
 Then you want to sleep in
 You want to scold your boss
 You still want to curse the guy who drove you on the road
 You are like a two year old
 Emotional patterns emerge one after another
 They compete with each other for dominance
 There is no top-down hierarchy
 There is no king at the top

 We have discussed the capability pyramid
 The most advanced ability is
 The most advanced ability is
 An ability to integrate all of these together
 This is explained in the field of neurology
 I will explain to you later
 This is explained in the field of neurology
 In a sense how are these
 Mapped to the neural structure of your being
 You want to control something
 You want to control
 It should be the ability to pay attention and learn, right
 Everything else in the hierarchy must give way
 Your attention and learning ability
 You can think
 This is the meaning of logos
 There is no doubt about this
 Because in the logos
 Part is attention and part is communication
 You can learn a lot from communicating with other people
 You need to know where you are
 It’s like your own GPS
 It is the closest we have
 Smart control system stuff
 Such as your car GPS device
 These things are very smart
 They know where you are and where to go
 Of course if you deviate from the route
 They will recalculate your route
 These things are almost alive
 They are too close to smart
 You can see this because they are acting in a smart way
 They constantly solve problems
 By the way, this is a cybernetic model
 Cybernetic model is the basic model of GPS system
 This is not accidental
 You need to know where you are
 You need to know where you are going
 The next thing you need to know is
 How will you act how to move your body
 Drive yourself in time and space
 From one end to the other
 Next we can come to something more complicated
 Because this is too simple
 We do
 So to be precise you don’t live in such a
 But you live in these levels of nesting
 You can think of this as your own internal patriarchy
 This is a good way of thinking
 It might be a tyrant
 It may also be something that can give you
 Security and autonomous functions
 Maybe this is what you are looking for
 But this is a battle, know it
 There is something authoritarian in everyone's heart
 So in the highest level of analysis
 This will be the most important story
 Maybe you think "I want to be a good person"
 "Or I want to become famous"
 I think "good" may be preferable
 Because you can define "good" whatever you want
 As long as it is not too disgusting
 Otherwise they will only hinder you
 It's no good
 So you have to negotiate with people
 Suppose you are a good person
 This is a story at the highest level
 Then you can break it down into
 Your main roles
 Maybe you are a good parent
 Maybe you are a good employer
 Maybe you are a good employee
 Maybe you are a good brother
 Maybe you are a good boy
 These are the main roles you play in life
 So you would say a good person
 Is the common trait of the strengths of all your roles
 Is a high-level abstraction extracted from more similar things
 Take the role of "good parents"
 "What are the elements that make up a good parent?"
 You might say "a good parent"
 Obviously this is not meant to be deadly
 "Good parents need to have a good job and be able to take care of their families"
 Then you might say
 "What does it mean to take good care of my family?"
 Then you will say
 "That means you can cook something unusual."
 I hope it's not too unusual
 "You can cook something unusual."
 "It also means you can play with your baby."
 Then you will say
 "Then how to play with the baby?"
 Then you will say
 "Play peekaboo or tickling with your baby"
 Here is a cool conversion
 Because these can be clarified and conceptualized, right
 Up to this level
 Then suddenly came to your body
 Because how would you play peekaboo with your baby
 You won’t discuss with him how you play peekaboo, do you
 You will be like this it's funny
 You can even play this game with seniors
 They will even be amused, right
 "Dad is gone" The baby is terrified
 "Where did he go? Look at him again."
 The baby is playing with the reliability of this world
 So this is really an intense game for babies
 Like this, "oh no dad is gone"
 "Oh look, he shows up again"
 "Oh no, he disappeared again"
 And Dad’s smile shows those brief disappearances
 It's not that there is fear beyond the processing power
 The key is if you play peekaboo with a baby
 You won't think about anything anymore
 This is not in the realm of expression or abstraction
 But what you actually do with your body
 So for me it is a good
 Multi-stage methods to solve mental and physical problems
 Because the fact is
 Higher levels of abstraction are clear and conceptual
 But if you fully decompose it
 Will become actual behavior
 These behaviors involve movement of the muscular system
 This is not a conceptual thing
 The great thing about this hierarchical order is that
 It contains educational significance
 If you want to teach others or even teach yourself something
 One thing you need to do is
 You have to give the highest resolution possible
 A detailed description of this need to be performed
 I will give you a concise example
 I may repeat this but it's okay
 For example, you have a three-year-old child
 Their house is a mess
 Monsters will come out from under their bed at any time
 Unless there is some order in the room
 You tell your child "clean up the messy house"
 You left and come back
 The children still look like throwing Lego bricks everywhere
 They didn't clean up at all
 You think that is a bad boy
 Then this is a bad inference
 Because you point directly from the highest point to the bottom
 If you want to fight with the people and destroy them
 Then you have to do this
 You don’t even think about the details
 Just stabbed to the point and said "You are a bad boy, stupid boy"
 "And you've always been so rotten wood that cannot be carved"
 "I can't teach you anything"
 This way you can lock in with the same humiliation
 His past, present and future
 "You have always been such a bad person"
 "There is nothing to teach you."
 "And your future will always be like this."
 If you treat them like this, they will only be left to beat you
 Because it's like this, you won't be able to recover
 You have completely restricted them
 So if you want a quarrel that is meaningless
 You just say "past now and future"
 "You are not a good person"
 Destroy their conceptual structure
 Let them be completely exposed to the chaos
 Very good you won a big quarrel
 But this is not a good thing for your long-term partner
 Unless you want them to be scared to death
 The attitude towards you has also been shaped into
 Extreme and endless resentment
 In this example, it will not affect your emotional life
 How much benefit
 So for a three-year-old child, what you might want to do is
 Choose the level of analysis they can actually operate
 If you pay attention to a child
 This is all you can do
 Many adults will not pay attention to children
 Because they are afraid of children
 They are afraid that they will make mistakes with their children
 Or afraid that children don’t like them
 Or something else
 What you need to do to make your child like you
 Spend two seconds following him
 He will like you immediately
 Attention is the ultimate wealth of children
 They need adult attention
 Because adults know so much more than them
 They like to be followed
 All you have to do is follow them
 They will like you immediately
 So you have to tell the child
 "Have you seen a teddy bear?"
 The children said "I saw it"
 Then you are sure that the child has
 Mastered the art of perceiving teddy bears
 They will say "yes"
 This is a complicated thing, friends
 A six-month-old child can’t do it
 A three-year-old child has already put the whole teddy bear
 The recognition subroutine is automated
 "Teddy Bear" "Yes"
 "Can you pick it up" "Yes"
 Touch your head "good job"
 "Did you see the hole in the shelf?" "I saw it?"
 "Can you put the teddy bear on the shelf?" "Yes."
 "Let it go" Touch your head "It's great"
 OK "Now we do the second thing and the third thing"
 You are building a whole set from the bottom up
 Micro routine procedures for cleaning the room
 You construct these into their bodies
 Because you start with what they have automated
 Constructed to the level of abstraction
 So once the child has all the micro routine procedures
 How many microprograms are there to clean the room 200?
 Many but not unlimited
 So you teach them all the microprograms
 Then you can say "Run a set of microprograms"
 This means cleaning your room
 Then they can do
 They know what it means
 But you have to build from the bottom up
 Many times when you are arguing with someone
 This person lives with you
 Suppose you love this person too
 Although these two situations are difficult
 Simultaneously in the same relationship
 What you want to do is before assuming that this person is not at ease
 Let's assume that this person is ignorant
 This is a good rule of thumb for peacemaking
 So maybe if your partner doesn’t do something
 Maybe something happened here on the bottom
 But you might want to assume that at first
 They actually don't know how to do it
 Then you need to break it down
 Maybe you want when you go home
 Get a certain form of greeting
 Because you might go home from outside every day
 This may be a five-minute or ten-minute interaction
 So one hour a week
 There are 4 hours a month and 50 hours a year
 Or a whole weekday
 Have time for interaction when going home
 As long as you make this type of interaction 50 times correct
 Your relationship can be straightened out
 This is really worth thinking about
 Because that's it you don't have so much time, right
 Plan three meals well
 Five hours a day are spent on this
 Plan your sleep time properly
 Achieve between you and your partner on a voluntary and negotiated basis
 Effective operation of repeated basic interactions
 You will spend 80% of your life like this
 Then it becomes a daily routine
 This would be really helpful
 If you don't do it consciously
 Especially because our characters are fragmented
 And most of the traditional characters have disappeared
 No one knows who exactly should do what
 For example, when cooking
 No one is doing business
 In addition to scolding and fighting and doing dark dishes
 Or buy fast food, etc.
 Instead of causing such a catastrophic failure
 Or continue to hate the fight
 It’s better to use consensus and negotiation
 Rebuild the entire structure from the bottom up
 you can do it
 You can think of this as a patriarchal structure
 This inference is good
 I mean it has psychological meaning
 Because these are what you do as a person
 But it also has political, economic and sociological significance
 When you are doing these things
 You also hope that it is not only acceptable to society
 It is done in a way that society expects
 This is the decomposition
 Reasons for preventing the spread of chaos
 It’s not your belief system group that stopped the spread of chaos
 Not so abstract
 But if you do the right thing
 The chances of terrible things happening to you are reduced
 It is psychologically meaningful to a certain extent
 Maybe you will struggle less
 Maybe you become less anxious and less depressed
 But it has practical meaning to a large extent
 Know if your child doesn’t leave the skateboard on the stairs
 You won’t break your neck so often
 This is not just a psychological matter
 It’s a good thing to not hurt your neck often
 So this structure is not only psychologically
 Stop chaos from spreading
 Here is another perspective to examine the hierarchical order of narrative
 That is, the structure prevents the chaos from spreading
 Maybe this is the structure I use in writing
 I do all these things at the same time
 This is pretty cool
 When i asked a student
 "What are you doing when you write the paper"
 This question is difficult to answer, right
 This is a broad and important question
 If you want to write a thesis you have to ask yourself this question first
 Pay attention to all words, phrases and sentences
 And the relationship between sentences in paragraphs
 Relationship between paragraphs in the article
 The relationship between the article and the class
 And how this class relates to your life
 This paper permeates your entire life
 So if i am writing
 So obviously in the analysis of the highest level of resolution
 My fingers move on the keyboard
 My eyes move back and forth on the screen
 This is where the mind and the body meet
 Then I tried to conceive a sentence
 Try to come up with a good sentence
 A sentence that can express what I want to conceive
 And then try to take it apart
 I tried this in many ways
 I wrote this sentence and moved it to another page
 Then I wrote ten different variations of this sentence
 See if you can find a better variant
 Then I tried to think about how stupid this sentence can be
 See if I can find a crowbar to pry it open and let it fall apart
 If I can't do this, I will keep the existing sentence
 Then I followed the ten sentences in a paragraph
 Then make sure that every sentence in this paragraph is organized properly
 So by rewriting different variants
 Try to use words, phrases and sentences as accurate as possible
 Also make the order of sentences correct and the order of paragraphs correct
 At this time I can say it is good enough
 Because i have tried my best
 This does not mean that it is completely correct
 It just means i can't make it better
 So I came to the conclusion that if I write a paragraph
 Then I wrote a variant
 And I can’t tell if its variant is better
 It may even be worse then I'll finish it
 I have reached the limit of my knowledge
 It's time to continue writing
 But this does not represent the paper I wrote
 It has a very tight boundary
 Because I wrote this paper for a reason
 That’s I’m trying to write a complete manuscript
 I hope to try to deal with an important problem like this
 Otherwise why should I do this
 I mean it becomes a bit pointless
 Maybe this is part of my role as a scientist
 Is part of my role as a professor
 Is also part of my role as a viable citizen
 It’s me as a person who dares to face the unknown
 Part of such a role
 You see this is why Logos is in
 At the top of this hierarchy
 The hierarchical order in everything else should be constructed like this
 Because you have a structure and you want
 What should this structure belong to
 The answer should be like this
 This structure should belong to
 The process that generated it
 Or this structure should be subordinate to
 The process of generating it and maintaining it
 Obviously, what else could it be?
 Unless the structure is absolutely perfect
 If you do
 Things that can generate it and improve it
 But then you become a totalitarian
 Like this "Hey we have the answer"
 "No you don't"
 People are still suffering they are still dying
 You don’t have the so-called "answer"
 Maybe the answer you currently have is to show
 There would be more suffering and death in the world now
 But there are still many roads to explore
 So it makes sense that everything can be included
 I regard it as the highest criterion of moral pursuit
 Then this also gives you a moral hierarchy order
 This is the most important
 Be cautious and honest
 You should act like this
 Don't sacrifice any of it because if you sacrifice
 It will erode your soul
 There is such a view in the New Testament
 The sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is the only sin that cannot be forgiven
 No one understands what this means
 Maybe it doesn't mean anything
 But I think the following is its meaning
 Because this process generates all these
 If you violate this process
 Then you are incurable because through it
 Then you are incurable because through it
 You can improve yourself
 And improve others and everything
 So if you decide you don’t participate
 Then it's hopeless
 Because you deviated
 Because you deviated
 Things that get things fixed and resolved
 Things that get things fixed and resolved

 So this is the way to stop chaos from spreading
 Part of it is structural
 You know more or less how to do these things
 This part is your whole set of skills
 If you happen to be a writer
 You can also construct a set for plumbers
 In fact, they all work the same
 But the external things are the same
 I think this is why in the Judeo-Christian tradition
 There is an assumption that people and people are essentially equal before God
 That means everyone should be nested in it
 Regardless of their particularity as individuals
 Their highest level function is this
 They do what they can to achieve this
 This is extremely valuable
 Perhaps the most valuable
 Socio-political and economic functions

 This is why people are valuable

 We have this function to continuously produce improvements
 To optimize the structure in which we live together
 awesome
 This is great
 Because this gives the fundamental unity in the analysis of the highest order
 At the same time, it also has the largest controllable limit of diversity space
 The facts show that the more different substructures, the better
 Because you can do something different from what I do
 It’s good because if we all do the same thing
 Becomes repetitive work
 If we agree on the highest principle
 Then specialize in refinement at a lower level
 It’s like you have bear paws and fish to eat
 This is a rare situation
 Another rule of thumb is
 If you are trying to solve a problem
 As far as possible before you dare to climb to a higher level
 Solve it from the highest possible resolution level
 As you move up into a more abstract hierarchy
 As you move up into a more abstract hierarchy
 When trying to solve this problem
 When trying to solve this problem
 The probability of causing catastrophic errors will increase dramatically
 Because the power of abstraction is extremely powerful
 So you have to be very cautious
 We saw it when the housing loan market collapsed

 The reason for its collapse was the improper use of financial derivatives
 They are like high-level abstractions of the financial world
 Financial derivatives provide you with a huge amount of capital leverage
 And power are accompanied by huge risks
 The benefits are huge, no doubt
 Because you can double your profit
 But the disadvantage is the catastrophe
 I have to say that a more wise and conservative spirit is
 Solve this problem from the most specific level with the highest resolution
 This is safer and more likely to produce practical solutions
 Now you plan
 Now you plan

 Let’s simplify it again and it’s this small map
 Let’s simplify it again and it’s this small map

 But everything else is nested inside

 So when you walk happily on the road of your life
 So when you walk happily on the road of your life
 So when you walk happily on the road of your life
 So when you walk happily on the road of your life
 What happened is in the process of moving from A to B
 You encountered something
 People think they encounter objective objects
 But it’s not the case
 First of all the vast majority of you
 Actually everyone else is not an objective object
 They are terribly complicated
 Even outside the social world
 What you encounter is not an objective object
 They look more like tools or obstacles
 I'm not saying that we see objects
 And then directly turn them into tools or obstacles
 I mean we will see tools or obstacles
 Because when you are all geared towards your goal
 At this time the world transforms into three types of things for you
 A stumbling block that hinders the goal
 These are what you don't like
 Two boosters that make it easier for you to achieve your goals
 Those are what you like
 Three other unrelated things
 In most cases what you want is irrelevant
 Because there are so many things
 The unimportant things you really like
 Most things are irrelevant
 If you have a good plan
 Some things are good
 Because they will push you forward
 Some things are not so good
 You want to take a detour for things that are not so good
 If you can do it
 Unless you like to hit the south wall with one head
 It's not very wise but it is also a learning experience
 But I won’t let it repeat too many times
 You want the world to be displayed in the form of a set of tools
 And what works here is your perception system
 It is conducted by dopamine

 This sensory system can also be cocaine methamphetamine
 Or activated by other drugs that people like
 The dopaminergic system will affect what you encounter
 Things that help promote you toward your goals
 Give positive emotions as a response
 It's important to know this
 Because people tend to think they are happy
 Because they achieved their goals
 It’s not so true
 Because once you achieve a goal
 A question came right away
 That's what the next goal is
 This is actually a big problem
 You will meet it as soon as you graduate from university
 This is an example
 I used to make this joke
 You are like the king among undergraduates on graduation day
 You lost your job the next day
 May work at Starbucks
 So the obvious accomplishment itself
 The source of rewards is problematic
 When you are finished, the whole framework is over
 Then you need a new framework
 This is a problem
 But if you can meet
 The things that push you forward are great
 This is where you can get positive motivation
 This is very worth thinking about
 You think it can last a year
 It even takes longer
 Because it means
 It means to some extent
 The Buddhists are right about Maya
 Maya means people live in illusions
 They mean if you have a goal
 No matter what your goal is
 Will connect you to the world
 You can change your connection to the world in an instant
 You can do this just by changing your goals
 Then you think about it, this is an illusion
 Because you can change it
 You don’t want to push this argument too far
 Because even specific points can be changed
 The fact that you are in a certain frame cannot be changed
 So you have to be in a frame
 Although you can choose a framework
 But there is always an absolute principle
 That is you must be in a frame
 This is not an absolute principle that does not matter
 But a very important absolute principle
 Then you think about all your positive emotions
 It's all from the relationship between you and the target
 Then we think we need some positive emotions
 This is a good thing
 Positive emotions suppress anxiety, disappointment, depression and pain
 It can do it technically like this
 This is why a rugby player has injured his thumb
 Still desperate when trying to score a touchdown
 Although this kind of goal has great uncertainty
 Really? You have to risk your hand injury
 Have you thrown a piece of pig skin over several posts?
 Well you can also be so cynic
 Most of the things people do
 But you can't mock a fact
 That people have to do something
 So you have your intention
 You have your goals, you have your ambitions
 This can turn the world into a potentially positive place
 This is really surprising, this is cool
 The higher the goal, the more positive emotions
 You think "Why should I"
 "Why do I bother to do noble and difficult things?"
 Because it's worth doing
 Otherwise the remaining option is to suffer stupidly really
 Because you don’t need to build a framework to suffer
 You just lie there and suffer day after day, right?
 It's easy this is the default situation
 If you don't have lofty ambitions
 Then you will suffer misfortune
 Because life is really complicated, short and limited
 Full of suffering and beyond your control
 You can just lie there thinking it's scary
 It's useless and useless
 People often say that life is meaningless
 But it's not so wrong
 If life is meaningless, it's easy
 You can sit here and do nothing, it doesn't matter
 It’s like you become a sheep with the brain lobes removed
 Everything becomes irrelevant
 But it is not the case
 When people say that life is meaningless
 They didn't mean that
 What they want to express is
 "My pain is so stupid and strong
 "And I don't know what to do with it."
 "And I don't know what to do with it."

 Put it this way, suffering is full of meaning
 Put it this way, suffering is full of meaning
 It’s just that its meaning is not what you want
 So how do you get out of this situation
 You have drawn a painful baseline and this line is very high
 Then you say to yourself
 Okay, I need to do something to live up to the suffering
 It's not easy to pain the baseline is high
 It's not easy to pain the baseline is high

 If you are going to achieve something

 So that I didn't live in vain
 Then you have to pursue things that are perfectly constructed
 So that you can tell
 "Despite the death of my family from the earthquake and cancer
 "The disillusionment of what I ask for, the ultimate futility of life
 "Even the heat death of the universe
 "But it doesn't matter, it's worth it"
 There is another factor that complicates the situation
 So I said when you pursue your goals
 There are three things you will encounter
 I would say if you want to set a goal
 Or you have to make a plan
 Look at the next three to five years
 You can only get one situation for the further future
 Combinatorial explosion
 That is, there are so many variables that you cannot predict
 So looking forward to 20 years does not make much sense
 Because how could you know what will happen in 20 years
 I don’t know you can know it for three years at most
 Maybe you can make a three-year itinerary
 Or about five years
 It's not bad considering this for a while
 Then think about what your life must be like
 To make it worth visiting for you
 You also need to know if life is not worth living
 What would you look like
 If you think it's not worth living
 You will become Cain
 He is like you
 This is what this story tells
 Abel is a man of purpose and he made appropriate sacrifices
 Cain is one because of his own fault
 At least to some extent
 And people who are not going well
 Sacrificing improper default results
 Is bitter and bitter
 What to say with the potential
 Murderous hatred
 You will put it into practice
 People in the world have been performing this kind of drama
 This is not surprising
 Because if there is nothing noble to lead you forward
 Then the baseline is stupid pain
 If you have a dog, you will tie it to the backyard
 Put a collar on it because the collar is too tight and it keeps grinding its skin
 It doesn’t even make it all around
 It's terribly hot in the sun
 Maybe you didn't give it enough water
 It would not be a happy dog
 Its basic situation is suffering
 People do the same
 Okay, we don’t know if you remember
 You may have all seen or heard of "Pinocchio"
 You may have all seen or heard of "Pinocchio"
 There is a very cool plot in "Pinocchio"
 In order to make his puppet
 Become a wise autonomous life
 He made a wish to the stars
 It’s very strange but everyone accepted this setting
 Because when we accept something completely ridiculous
 Can't notice the absurdity of things
 A puppeteer in an animation made a wish to the stars
 Then his puppet will move
 However, everyone nodded and said, "This is fine."
 There is nothing
 This is simply unreasonable but the point is not here
 This is different from what we usually understand
 This is a meta-consensus, everyone can understand
 And what Geppetto did is
 Raise his eyes above the horizon
 Beyond the boundaries of the world
 Or pass-through
 So as to achieve a certain strong purpose through transcendence
 You can see the transcendent
 It surpasses you straight into heaven and overlooks all beings
 It is very close to our goal
 And there is a star there
 That is an eternal star shining in the dark
 Geppetto reached an agreement with Transcendent there
 He said to make my creation come alive
 I am willing to pay any price
 This is exactly what you want to set up for yourself
 You have to figure out which star you want to be your guide
 You must ask yourself
 "If you have a chance to make your life meaningful
 "What is the price you have to pay"
 "what do you need"
 The first thing to do is to find the question first
 You have to hint yourself like this first
 You will feel scared
 Because you think "I will never reach it"
 Then lower your eyes first
 Don't expect to get a 24m super yacht in half a year
 It just makes you look stupid
 First of all, it won't make you happy
 So it is unwise
 You should be like asking someone you care about
 Ask yourself this question
 For example, suppose you are talking to some
 Talk to your favorite 12-year-old kid
 You think, "Thank God, if this kid is going well
 "That's also a good thing."
 Hope you do the same
 The universe doesn’t care if you are doing well
 Don't care if your pain can be reduced a bit
 Especially when you are not imposing pain on others
 If you can suffer a little bit less sin
 Make slight improvements wherever you go
 Then the universe may have no objection to this
 I think if you keep silent about it
 You could have escaped guilt
 So ask yourself that question first
 When you have established your goals
 You have found your position
 What you know is good for you
 Because it helps your future development
 The next thing will happen at the perceptual level
 You don't need to think about it
 The experimental articles on this aspect have made it very clear
 For example, suppose I put the podium
 As the end of my next move
 Then I will be very happy when I walk over
 Because the podium is there
 Things are going as I wish
 And suppose I want to go to that exit sign
 You may not see the exit sign
 But there is an obstacle
 Then when I set this goal
 That's an annoying obstacle
 This is foreseeable
 It can be predicted the moment I set my goal
 In fact, your being is displayed in these frames
 But the good thing is that these frameworks can be changed for you
 This does not mean
 You can do things like juggling with planets
 But it does provide you with a range
 A world in which it is unconstrained
 If this framework doesn't work
 You can also adjust it
 Sometimes you even have to make major adjustments
 Anyway that's it
 You don’t have to fix yourself in a certain frame
 As if it is the ideology you want to dedicate to
 This is just a tentative plan
 Develops with progress
 In the "Future Writing Plan"
 One of my suggestions is
 Everyone should scrawl the plan
 Because you can't make a correct plan
 But a reasonable plan is much better than no plan
 Then there is a reasonable plan with an in-depth process embedded in it
 After this process is activated, the plan will be continuously optimized
 So it’s important to start with a reasonable plan
 You don’t need to worry about whether it’s correct
 It doesn't matter if it is wrong
 The point is that something is better than nothing
 Now you have parsed the world into two parts
 Part of it will make you happy as long as you see it
 The other part is the stumbling block that causes negative emotions
 And a whole bunch of other insignificant things
 Because most things are unrelated
 And all the chaos hides in it
 That is, chaos hides in unrelated things
 This is a very interesting phenomenon
 Since chaos is actually infinite
 The question is where did you put them
 The answer is of course placed in a place that you overlooked
 As long as it does not actively affect your process
 You can ignore it
 You can assume it doesn’t matter
 Assuming it means nothing
 Anyway, the next thing to say is the key
 There is another kind of things you may encounter in this process
 This is the outburst of chaos
 Now suppose
 You are moving from point A to point B
 Something unexpected happened on the road
 Some obstacles appeared
 Suppose you are living with someone
 Maybe you have a good impression of this person
 You are not married yet
 It can be seen that I haven't liked it to that level
 Otherwise, you will definitely propose to the other party
 A quarter of you are expecting better things
 And three-quarters of you say you are getting better
 This is because we are conflicted about this type of thing
 Then you find someone
 Or that person admits that he has always had an affair
 So how should you respond emotionally?
 Part of you is not very loyal to this relationship
 So this part of you is a little bit excited about it
 And three-quarters of you are still indulged in it so you are sad
 In the argument after you
 You will definitely use the latter part
 Without saying
 "Oh, you betrayed me. I think I'm still a little excited."
 But the point is that this is a loophole
 This seems to be a structure you can walk on
 Such as thin ice that can slide
 Now there is a hole in this structure
 We don't even know how deep this hole is
 But you know there is a hole there
 Now you feel anxious about it
 Maybe also a little excited
 Because god knows what's down there
 But you are at a loss for this hole
 Because it may have a bad effect on you
 Maybe this whole relationship is a cover
 And all your romances are just a cover
 Because you are so shallow
 So that you can't establish a substantial relationship
 Part of the reason may be that you don’t pay attention to others
 It may be because you are vicious and selfish
 Realize that these are quite uncomfortable
 Or maybe this is the kind of person you attract
 In fact, this makes sense
 If you are this kind of person
 So certain things you might encounter
 It will pierce your heart
 And in those heartbreaking moments
 Will follow the entire predictive hierarchy
 A logical conclusion is
 You got cheated in a relationship
 It shows that you are really a bad guy
 Another logical conclusion is
 The person with you is a bad person
 Another logical conclusion is
 Everyone is really bad
 At the macro and micro level
 You can't trust anyone
 You can't trust women or men
 You cannot believe in humans you cannot believe in yourself
 Everything is a disaster nightmare
 Then you will fall into chaos
 Otherwise your body will react
 Let’s say you think you should be promoted
 This is great and you are all discussing promotion
 You were summoned by your boss and walked into the office
 The boss says
 "We observed your performance in recent years"
 "Your performance is only slightly super mediocre"
 "And we are just about to scale down."
 "So goodbye to you"
 This is definitely not talking about promotion or salary increase
 This is a pothole you fell into
 The question is how do you think about it, right
 How would you define it
 How would you accept the chaos that just emerged
 And establish an order that can be accommodated
 You do not know
 "Is the entire capitalist system rotten from beginning to end"
 I mean in this case
 This must be a convenient explanation
 Is your boss a perverted bastard
 Did you choose the wrong major when you entered the university?
 Is it your father's fault
 Because he never allowed you to do what you want to do
 Or is it because you resigned yourself to the consequences?
 Or because this is a sunset industry
 Or is it reminding you to join another business
 Do something you always wanted to do
 Things you can fight for your whole life
 This is why you are so painful in your current career
 Because you can’t do what you really want to do
 And feel pain and resentment
 God knows why
 These thoughts emerged together in an instant
 This is annoying
 Because these ideas are too many
 This is the reemergence of chaos, this is the flood
 It’s like returning to the beginning of the universe
 This is another manifestation of mythology
 You sailed all the way and finally returned to the beginning of the universe
 There is only undifferentiated chaos
 This is what you are facing
 Maybe it makes you unbearable
 Unbearable leaving you with psychological trauma
 This may hurt your brain
 So fast you can't bear it
 But it doesn't matter you have no way to escape
 How should you respond to this situation
 There are some catastrophic negative emotions
 You froze and this is protective
 Maybe it’s because you don’t want to move at all
 You want to stay in bed for a whole week
 This is because of your body's reaction
 It's like there are snakes all over the bedroom floor
 You better stay in bed motionless
 Just freeze
 This situation is not very good
 Because your nerves are tight at this time, your brain is highly excited
 This is very exhausting
 And there is no benefit
 Unless those snakes can't see you
 But the snake has seen you so it's useless to be still
 Now you have been affected by these indiscriminate negative emotions
 Anxiety fear hurt anger guilt shame sad
 Disasters are overwhelming
 And maybe from the other side
 Hidden in this situation is
 "Thank God I finally don't have to do this job anymore."
 "I have had enough"
 "I struggle to go to work every day"
 "A part of my heart feels"
 "It's a good thing for me to be fired."
 "It's so fun."
 And you may not want to admit it
 Because it means
 The time you spend on this job is wasted
 You have been deceiving yourself
 But there is something interesting to think of
 Sometimes it is unpleasant to have to fire someone
 Sometimes fire them
 It is a good way out for them
 But this does not mean to enjoy the dismissal process
 But I have met some very unkind people
 They really like firing people
 I'll tell this story if I find a chance
 Because it's quite interesting
 And sometimes
 If some people just can’t do their job
 How miserable it is to work
 The best thing you can do for them is to tell them
 "You did a terrible job"
 "And that doesn't mean"
 "You will do nothing in this world."
 "Maybe you should just accept reality."
 "Give up and try something else"
 This is terrible for people
 I know people hate this kind of thing
 But it’s better than doing nothing
 It’s just a tortured chronic death
 So look at it from the good side
 Now suppose you have fallen into a hole in the thin ice of life
 You encountered an anomaly that you don't understand
 You want to know how this vision formed
 I know it’s weird to think about it this way
 Because it’s not or let’s go down
 This is a metaphor
 "How did this vision form?"
 One way to understand it is
 It is formed by mental matter
 The reason for this is as follows
 This is what I learned from Piaget
 It is made of matter
 Because the world is made of matter
 And the world is also very important
 This forms a kind of duality
 But it also consists of spirit
 Because when you encounter a vision
 And walking down the rabbit hole
 You enter such an underground world
 It's under everything you depend on
 You will also learn something
 There is information there
 There may be more information than you need, but it is information
 What use is this information for you
 You can understand this information, right
 You can use this information to cheer up
 This is also beneficial
 So you will think you are a mind
 Maybe you think you are not a spiritual body
 It depends on whether you are a materialist
 But at least we can say that you are a mind
 The question is what is your mind made of
 It obviously has a material basis
 And the matter happens to be arranged in a certain order
 In order of information
 So when you fall into the underground world under everything
 You are exposed to the hidden information
 What you can do is strengthen your mind
 You can make your spirit stronger
 Because all you can do is
 Absorb and accept new information
 It’s like eating the forbidden fruit that Adam and Eve stole.
 You accept it and you are more complete
 This is not a metaphorical or metaphysical proposition
 Nothing else
 It's like the situation when children are studying
 Imagine this picture
 A three-year-old child only knows the low-resolution world
 And the child is still a low-resolution person
 They have all the necessary elements
 There is no huge difference between these elements
 They will only change in the future
 So what will this kid do to explore
 What to explore, explore the unknown
 Explore the information contained in the unknown
 Because you already know what you know
 There is no new information
 You go to understand what you don't know
 There is new information
 From the information
 Your understanding of the world will be clearer
 Your knowledge of yourself will become clearer
 So in the battle with the Chaos Dragon
 You have created mind and matter
 This is what you did when you entered the underground world
 If chaos didn't kill you
 Or make you want to die
 Because you do die
 But anyway, part of you has to be buried underground
 But this may not be a bad thing
 Because if your relationship ends because of betrayal
 That means something is wrong, right?
 some things
 Let me explain why
 You might think "Hey, I'm preaching again"
 I don’t know if you noticed that I don’t mind preaching
 But this judgment is not fair
 Because you are playing this stupid game
 It's like you're loyal to someone
 This is a game right
 You have decided the rules of the game
 Morality comes with the game
 Then morality is the rule of the game
 Then things collapsed into infidelity
 Either you play the game wrong or the game itself is wrong
 Can only be one of the two
 You chose this game
 And after the election, you can’t say
 These rules are not what I want
 "I want to be pretty"
 If you choose the game, you will default to the rules behind
 If you fail to follow these rules you will lose the game
 You can also say that I can choose another game
 I don't care how you solve the problem
 You are still trapped by it
 Fundamentally speaking, this is a moral issue
 And may need some earth-shaking changes to correct
 You are at location A and want to go to location B
 And this is not feasible, you have encountered an abnormal situation
 You must not be at location B now
 For example, you are a medical student
 You took the MCAT, an entrance test you must pass
 You took the MCAT, an entrance test you must pass
 The bottom quarter of your ranking
 I do not know who you are
 But you are not a pre-medical student now
 Maybe you've never been right
 And this is a problem friends
 You don't know who you are
 There is a crash here, and a conflict of motivation
 Motivation and emotions start to fluctuate here
 The huge amount of information also began to surge
 This is where the phoenix has changed
 The burning part of the Phoenix
 This is a journey to the underground world
 Road to hell
 This may really be a journey to hell
 Because you may find out why your partner betrayed you
 Or why you didn’t get a promotion
 It's all because you have serious problems
 And you know it well
 I'm not saying you don't know what you are doing
 I mean a quarter of you
 Focusing on bad things
 This makes you fall into the underground world and you discover next
 "Oh my God, I finally made it myself."
 Or "I finally got retribution from the worst part of me"
 "And the worst part of me needs to be cleared."
 And this is not easy
 Because "I have been captured by him and cannot get out."
 "I have been with it for a long time."
 "Maybe I can't get rid of it all my life."
 It's not fun at all
 You will often see this kind of people in psychotherapy
 Maybe you can see them hanging out on the street
 Living completely in the past disasters like walking dead
 Because they have penetrated into the underground world
 Finally trapped in hell, there is no way to escape
 When you meet this kind of person on the street
 You will avoid it
 Alright you are in the underground world now
 With the potential information
 Too much information
 It's the same as this picture shows
 This is why the story of Adam and Eve is a prototype, right?
 Because we are always digesting new things
 Those new things plunge us into a new state of self-consciousness
 Our previous paradise will be destroyed
 I don’t have everything as before
 Something that followed with the new destroyed it
 And beat our current life to pieces
 This is the journey to the underground world
 Leaving the garden and heading to Chaos
 So what does all this mean
 Well there are many ways to explain it
 This is a frame conversion
 This is a walled city
 There is a gap
 Every siege has gaps, isn’t it
 Because nothing is perfect
 Defects are the source of chaos
 Maybe you go out of town and fight chaos like a hero
 To re-establish the framework
 And this is what you should do
 Maybe you released some information when you did this
 Or established a relationship
 This is a journey
 Frame destruction chaos
 Voluntarily confront the reshaping of the world
 That is the state of being
 I hope it is not only linear but stepwise
 "You" that emerged from the recent disaster
 Just add some other things to your past self
 And this actually constitutes
 So-called quantifiable progress, right
 There is also another view against moral relativism
 If you do everything before
 You can have more output on this basis
 We think you are getting better
 This is not a bad definition
 Then we have an improvement
 It's like all you have to do is analyze the world
 Then make yourself different
 Whenever you experience one of these revolutions
 Then these two things are expected to be achieved
 Then that story has moral elements
 That is to do it actively
 Maybe don't wait for it to happen like a disaster
 Brighten your eyes
 It's not too late to make up for it
 Don't think it matters
 Maybe this is very important
 This may be the key to what you should be
 This may be the key to what the world should be
 If part of you tells you this is important
 That means that part of you is telling you
 You must solve this problem right away
 This is the so-called important thing
 I really like to use the word "substance"
 Because it has these two weird meanings right
 Material from a materialist perspective
 It is the material of all things that is inanimate
 In another sense, matter is the material of life
 And this is important
 Sometimes you are going through life and important things
 It is calling you
 This is the hidden world trying to show itself to you
 And what you should do is allow it to show itself to you
 What might happen next is
 Some small changes will happen to you
 You don’t have to burn a phoenix egg
 Then reborn from the ashes
 Maybe you just need to fix some
 The wrong place on you
 So you only need to experience a series of continuous and small sacrifices
 Instead of waiting for a bloody disaster
 A disaster you can't get out of
 All you have to do is focus on the important things
 Your entire nervous system is born for this
 You have a goal
 In the meantime, something happened
 And it matters
 So what should you do
 You should fix it
 You should face it
 That's why it seems to be shouting to you it is important
 It's saying that there is an unclear part of the world
 This part wants to appear as a completely clear existence
 And it's calling you to do it all
 If you ignore it, this part will pile up
 As it accumulates it will become the dragon of chaos
 He will be when you are not prepared
 Swallow you
 And this is another result
 This is not a good solution
 Unless you want to be its lunch
 The above is a longer introduction to Noah
 But it is still necessary
 Otherwise we can't understand the story
 This is the meaning of this story
 After that we can finish this story very quickly
 Although it is unlikely to be finished within today
 Let's start to tell the next story in "Genesis"
 It followed the story of Cain and Abel
 What starts with a short story is just a fragment
 I call this story "the great man on earth"
 "When there are more people in the world" (Genesis 6:1)
 So this happened after the story of Cain and Abel
 "When the daughter was born again" (Genesis 6:1)
 "The sons of God see the beauty of human women
 "Just choose and marry as your wife" (Genesis 6:2)
 "Jehovah says, "Man is natural
 "'My spirit won't live in him forever
 "'But his life can reach one hundred and twenty years'" (Gen 6:3)
 "At that time there were great men on the ground
 "Later the sons of God
 "Women who have sex with men have children
 "That is the famous person of ancient heroism" (Genesis 6:4)
 People tried many times
 To explain these messy sentences
 But I think it reflects the classic development of hero mythology
 Seems to show nostalgia for the past
 What Mircea Iliad pointed out is
 What is human memory like in the pre-literal age
 Because there is no written record
 Those retained memories will merge with each other
 Imagine a culture based on fisheries
 Everyone must be a good fisherman
 Those who use simple tools to fish
 Are very good fishermen
 They know every little detail about the fish
 Because if they don’t, they won’t survive
 So proficient in fishing is very important for them
 They may have been fishing for about 13,000 years
 Have a lot of accumulated knowledge
 So the question is who taught humans to fish
 The answer is a fragment of individual stories in history
 But people can’t remember these story fragments
 So people merge them all into a hero fisherman
 He showed people the example of fishing
 No matter what the paradigm is
 One of the examples might be to try to catch fish
 Otherwise there will be nothing in the coming year
 Something like this
 Just like these stories of discoveries
 Was merged into the heroes of the past
 What you should do as a fisherman
 Is an example of practicing this hero
 The concept of "ancient heroic and famous person"
 Or the heroes of the past
 Is a fragment of this series of thoughts
 There were some great men in the past
 They created the mode of existence that humans should have
 They are sons of god
 They picked a human woman to marry as their wife
 It's funny because we know
 The more capable men are, the more overwhelming they are to breed offspring
 So this perfectly explains the status quo
 Let's talk back to the flood
 This is from Mircea Iliad
 He wrote the book "History of Religious Thought"
 I strongly recommend everyone to read
 There are three volumes in this set
 Very worth reading
 Excellent
 I personally like this book
 The following is his description of the flood myth
 "Thanks to Richard Andre Hermann Uzena
 "And the work of the author of James Fraser's The Golden Branch
 "The flood myth has been widely known"
 "It's on every continent
 "Although it’s rare in Africa
 "Of course there are more deserts in Africa
 "It is recorded by different levels of culture"
 Some of these record variants were formed by spreading
 Not caused by spontaneous innovation
 "It first originated in the Mesopotamia and developed in India"
 "Another possibility is due to one or more floods
 "Lead to the birth of these myths and legends"
 "But if there is no trace of geography left
 "It's hard to explain why a myth spread so widely."
 Iliad wrote this long ago
 I remember it was in the 80s or 70s
 But after that
 Indeed, a lot of evidence has been found in different fields to prove
 In the memory of related human civilization
 There have been catastrophic floods

 For example, the Indians on the west coast of North America
 I may use the wrong word here
 I don't know what to say
 I know a sculptor of the Kwakwajakwa tribe
 He once told me a flood story
 This story is basically the same as that of Noah
 Except that the ark has become a lot of giant canoes
 But basically the same story
 If I remember correctly, they released a raven
 Noah released a raven first
 Then a pigeon was released when the flood subsided
 So is the story of the Tower of Babel
 The canoes are all gathered together
 Not a huge boat but many canoes
 Drove out of the flood together
 Then the boats went all over the world
 This is the reason why humans are all over the world
 Anyway, the story was widely spread
 There have indeed been floods in North America
 And not very long ago
 You can check the Missoula flood
 Happened about 13,000 to 15,000 years ago
 Kwa Kwa Kwa tribe on the west coast
 Has lived for about 13,000 to 14,000 years
 Oral tradition can last a very long time
 You might think it won't be like this
 But the traditional society will not change
 This is why they have become traditional
 The same story will be passed on from generation to generation
 People will remember the same story
 The Missoula flood was a product of glacial meltwater
 This flood happened 55 times
 Occurs between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago
 Released about 15 times the amount of water in the Amazon
 This is a huge flood
 The Society of Molecular Biology and Evolution published a paper in 2008
 Titled "Climate Change in Southeast Asia and Human Migration after the Ice Age"
 Which mentioned multiple floods
 Especially for 15,000 to 7,000 years ago
 Impact in Southeast Asia
 So Iliad has no geographical evidence to prove
 There may be a bit of a mistake on the point that there have been catastrophic floods.
 But this is not very important
 Because we still look at it from a psychological perspective
 "Most of the flood myths are to some extent
 "It's about the laws of the universe"
 "In the old world, humanity was lost and submerged under water."
 "After some time, a new world was born from this chaos."
 "Although the variables are huge
 "But floods are often the result of human sin or the collapse of rituals and music."
 "Sometimes the reason is just that the gods wish to end humanity"
 "The biggest culprit is the sin of mankind and the aging of the world"
 This is a very good analysis
 Because it describes a parallel relationship
 We mentioned before
 That is, things will collapse and not only that
 If you don’t pay attention you will speed up the process
 So if you are in an intimate relationship
 A relationship requires a lot of work to maintain
 And you know when it needs maintenance
 Because of you and each other
 Began to create a barrier
 Then it will start to have some disgust
 I hope it's not contempt but a little disgust
 There may be some emotional alienation
 You will feel it and then you will think
 It's hard to say what you think
 But no matter what you will feel
 You know this feeling is sprouting
 Then you have a chance
 To make up for the fault no matter what
 Both of you need to change
 Maybe one of them needs to change more
 This needs to be discussed seriously
 I realize something is happening
 Maybe it's my reasonMaybe it's your reason
 Maybe we should figure it out
 Because if it’s your problem, it’s more convenient for me
 But if it is my problem, I hope I can correct it
 Because this way things are resolved
 This is why you should listen to your partner
 Because they might tell you
 Where are you stupid without knowing it
 If you can correct
 Then you don't have to be this stupid anymore
 This is actually one of the practical functions of the companion
 Otherwise you really want to stay stupid like this
 Do you repeat mistakes for the rest of your life?
 Compared to the argument
 "Why are you so stupid" and "how to solve it"
 Of course this is much more convenient for you
 But it’s better to face the problem and start a dialogue
 Then the biggest culprit lies in the sin of mankind and the aging of the world
 Sin is generally like this
 Either people did something they knew was wrong
 Either he didn’t do what he knew was right
 Both are similar
 In the Judeo-Christian tradition
 The evaluation of the crime of negligence is more severe
 I think there may be some misunderstandings here
 Because the crime of negligence can cause substantial disaster
 So here is a concept of flood
 Everyone please tell me what you think
 So there is a critical being that will overwhelm you
 If you continue to use it yourself
 It seems a little bit
 This is the Lord
 An example of the tendency to be harsh in the Old Testament
 Modern people don’t really agree with this
 We want God to be domesticated to some extent
 Unfortunately this doesn't seem to work
 I often think
 North America's response to the hurricane in New Orleans
 Because there are two ways of understanding
 One is that nature is a bit convulsive
 Just let New Orleans blew a hurricane and razed everything
 Isn't this a disaster
 Isn’t this an example of human beings vulnerable to nature?
 But at the same time there can be another interpretation
 Maybe this is not very fair
 But it still needs to be mentioned
 The Dutch built a dam to stop the sea
 They are quite efficient
 Because most of their cities are below sea level
 But if you go to the Netherlands, you will find that the Netherlands is not a country
 So the dam is quite useful
 Dutch people are very organized
 They'd better be like this
 Because their country should have been flooded
 If your city should have been flooded
 Then you better be organized
 They are really organized
 They set up principles for the dam
 They tried to simulate
 The strongest hurricane that may occur in the next 10,000 years
 Then make sure their dam can withstand such disasters
 From what I read
 Dam built by military engineers in New Orleans
 Can only cope with a storm once in a hundred years
 This is not very good because we will probably live for 80 years
 This means there will be one of the storms
 Very likely to happen in our lifetime
 So this may not be the smartest plan
 Especially because part of New Orleans is below sea level
 Worse
 Mississippi is famous for corruption
 So you can speculate
 There is a lot of time, money and resources that could or should
 The plan was used to deal with this problem but failed at the end
 So when the hurricane hits
 Some people will say this is really a natural disaster
 But the question is why are you so convinced that this is a natural disaster
 Because if the infrastructure should be well maintained
 And it is technically feasible to rebuild to a certain specification
 At the same time, the cost of reconstruction is actually lower in the long run
 And everyone knows it well
 So when the tornado comes and razes the town
 Why do you think this is a natural disaster
 For me this is a self-contained example
 If you think of it as a metaphor
 This is a judgmental God
 Using the flood to teach people morality
 You may feel a little harsh
 What about those flood survivors
 This flood is indeed harsh
 It points out what can be done beforehand
 I doubt if I did these things after the robbery
 Even now everyone knows what happened
 You can think of this as a diagnosis
 But this is not important anymore
 Actually what I want to say is
 How the fairy tales overlap with these things
 We can tell a story
 Talking that Mother Nature will bring disasters from heaven and hide tragedies
 Or you can tell another story
 Talking about the social structure of fallen human beings
 And how humans failed on an individual level
 Which leads to a problem that everyone knows to exist
 This is a good example of when people do things wrong
 How did the flood come
 About the Old Testament and its authors
 The interesting point is
 They always imagine the flood will come
 This shows that they are not ready yet
 The rules are like this
 A priori axiom
 The flood rushes to you, it means you are not ready
 How did you know because you were washed away by the flood
 This fact itself is evidence
 You might say it's unfair
 But fairness is not the point
 The point is whether you still want to be flooded again
 Because fairness means that you better figure out why you got caught
 And you better solve the problem so that this kind of thing does not happen again
 Doing this is "moral"
 When you think of morality as
 The most correct path chosen to reach the goal
 At the same time choose the best possible goal
 "The simple fact is that things exist
 "That is, it will survive and create when the universe gradually declines
 "Things will eventually fall into decline"
 "This is why things need to be recreated"
 "In other words, on a micro scale, the flood
 "Symbolizes what happened in the New Year's Day celebration."
 "The world has ended sin and humanity has ended
 "In this way, new creations may appear."
 Iliad contains a lot of information in just a few words
 In the Mesopotamian ceremony
 They will perform at the New Year celebration
 A scene where the kingdom fell into chaos
 This is what you are doing when making a plan
 It is actually a degradation
 you can say
 Our habit of making new year's plans is a degenerate ritual
 I'm not saying it's bad
 I mean something greater can germinate from it
 Mesopotamians
 Will take their king out of the city once
 They will make the king kneel
 Take off all his clothes that symbolize the king's status
 Then use a glove to smoke him if I remember correctly
 This is done by the priest
 They will account for him this year
 What did not qualify as the emperor
 How he failed to become a qualified Marduk
 That's how he should be in the world
 His head is full of eyes
 Spit a magical spell
 He is the one who can transform chaos into order
 This is what the ruler should do
 So the question should be
 You are the emperor should be humble
 Because you are not the incarnation of god
 You may have made some mistakes
 Can you think of the past year
 How did you fail to seize every opportunity possible
 Turn chaos into order?
 It's good to think about it
 When you are making a new year plan
 This is what I think
 Although you may not realize
 Can you be a better person in the next year
 You can imagine the flood
 Then you set your posture and get ready
 This means you may delay it
 This also means that even if you fail to delay it
 You may also escape
 This is actually Noah's story
 Noah could predict the worsening of the situation
 Can predict the flood
 God is letting him know all this
 In a story Noah was walking with God
 Remember this is Adam before he had complete self-will
 What God has been doing
 He walks with God
 We will go into details next time
 But at the same time this may mean
 Noah is upright, he cheered himself up
 His family relationship is harmonious
 This also shows that he is very sensitive
 Compared to those who are completely obscured by the fog
 He can see a little further into the future
 He can feel something is wrong
 So he prepared for it
 Because he prepared for it
 Even if the flood came, Noah would be calm
 This is a very interesting thing
 This is an uncertain event in human existence
 If everyone is ready
 How big a hurricane would it take to destroy New Orleans
 Anyway, the Netherlands will not be easily destroyed
 Unless the wind is particularly strong
 You need to imagine
 An unusually powerful hurricane can blow down their dam
 If no one in the city or state government engages in corruption
 How strong can New Orleans' disaster relief projects be
 Maybe this will solve the hurricane problem
 Because we clearly understand how to deal with it
 We know the countermeasures
 The same principle applies to our lives
 Flood is coming
 No doubt about this
 100% will definitely happen
 Some may be personal
 Some may be family
 Some may be about society, politics, and economy
 Will these problems be disastrous for you
 Or how would you control them
 How do you need to prepare
 The first problem encountered is
 Your behavior is in order
 Enough to make you feel the coming of the problem
 And have you made corresponding countermeasures?
 Maybe a detour
 Maybe just don’t go to the place where the flood is going to happen.
 In this case, the problem is simple
 But you may not be so lucky
 Disaster is coming
 Maybe someone in your family will be seriously ill
 The path through the storm is just a small path
 Things won’t fall apart when walking on this trail
 If that's the end, it won't be a divorce
 The end will not be death
 The ending will not be grief
 The ending will not be a disaster
 But this fault tolerance rate is so low that it is almost close to zero
 Anything you do that is not perfect will increase
 The possibility of making that tragedy no different from hell
 And they are on the way
 They will come without a doubt
 Then you might think that since it is imminent
 The best thing you can do is to integrate yourself
 When the problem comes
 Get the worst results
 I will end with a story
 This matter has a deep impact on me
 My mother-in-law suffered from frontotemporal dementia
 She started to have symptoms when she was younger
 She was about 55 years old at the time
 Her husband is a very outgoing person
 It's delicious locally
 I grew up in a small town everyone knows him
 He is very attractive and has a problem with alcohol
 very attractive
 Is a very powerful businessman outstanding
 And he is a man of true temperament
 But he is not the kind of man who cares about his family
 Although he paid a lot to support his family
 When his wife got sick
 He is really taking care of her wholeheartedly
 That's a really stopping scene
 Caring for people with Alzheimer's disease
 No matter what intent or purpose it is, it is not a trifle
 The patient is gradually being swallowed by the disease and it is unbearable
 And it's hard
 It is not only catastrophic but also difficult
 Oh my god but he handled it perfectly
 This thing could have been worse
 This is a tragedy but it did not deteriorate into hell
 I was there when she died
 I later found out that my wife’s family is really good at dealing with death
 A sister of my wife is a hospice nurse
 You need to be very strong to be a hospice nurse
 But it can still be done, which is interesting
 This career means that you can be in the last stage of people’s lives
 Build a sincere relationship with them
 Then they died in front of you one after another
 But she is so competent, lively, smart and interesting
 This is really amazing
 She is someone who can be relied upon in a tragedy
 My wife’s other sister is a pharmacist
 My wife has also been a volunteer in the hospice ward
 She is also good at taking care of
 People with serious health problems
 So we were all present when my mother-in-law died
 You can imagine
 You can imagine a scene before a sickbed
 Your mother-in-law is dying, everyone is at a loss
 If you think it’s not common, then you’re unworldly
 This is simply too common
 That situation is not tragedy but hell
 You may be able to tolerate tragedy
 But you can't tolerate hell
 But it was not like that at the moment my mother-in-law died
 Everyone is pulled closer
 She passed away
 But the result is very interesting
 This family is closer
 On the one hand, although something has been taken away
 But on the other hand, what did you get
 This is no small thing
 I'm not trying to be optimistic
 Not the kind of "the world is so beautiful" chicken soup
 It’s very difficult for someone to die well
 But my God, but things could have gotten worse
 Maybe this is good enough
 That's it
 I am often curious
 If people do their best to tell the truth
 Keep an eye on your surroundings
 So the tragedy of life
 There is no need to deteriorate into intolerable hell
 Hell does not have to be part of life
 Then maybe we can tolerate tragedy
 Maybe even overcome it
 Or even alleviate it because we can do it
 We have been doing similar things
 This is an open question
 Iliad described this very well
 Is the flood really the result of things collapsing?
 Or the flood is actually the result of people making mistakes
 And these mistakes were made knowingly
 Are they guilty?
 This means not hitting the bullseye
 Missing the bull's eye this is an archery term
 Say people don't have a clear goal
 You can't hit the target without aiming
 Or after aiming and saying
 "It's not that unimportant anyway."
 Be careful when you are saying this
 "It's not that unimportant anyway."
 If you say that
 One thing that might happen to you is
 You may end up in hell for a long time
 May even be left in hell
 Some people are indeed in this situation
 I have seen someone there
 How to come out once you get there is no small problem
 So the important thing is that important things will be handled
 It’s important to walk with God as best you can
 We'll talk more about it next time
 This may be how you build the ark
 To withstand the flood, even if the flood comes, you can retreat
 The problem is that the flood will come eventually
 The funny thing is that I noticed
 Our education system how we teach students
 For example, "trigger warning" is garbage
 If it's in my class
 I guess I will be warned every 15 seconds
 I will tell my students when they are young
 Don't fool yourself or you will get seriously ill
 At least one or two or three
 One is likely to be chronic
 If it is not you who is sick, it will be the one you love
 Will be your husband
 Will be your parents
 Will be your child
 It will come with death and pain
 When this happens
 What do you want to be
 This is the question that should be asked
 The question should not be "how to be happy"
 If so, then good luck
 I think that is a stupid goal
 Because it's too shallow
 If you are lucky, happiness will come and walk like a cloud and see the sun
 If you have achieved happiness, like you
 Enjoy it
 Happiness is a gift from the universe
 But as a pursuit, forget it
 The pursuit should be when the flood comes
 You want to be the one who built the ark
 This is the story of Noah
 The flood will always come
 This story is worth mentioning
 There are apocalyptic elements in the Judeo-Christian tradition
 The end of the world is always here
 You should be prepared for trial
 On this point, this is true
 The reason is that the end of the world is imminent
 Will come and you will be judged
 Because when the world collapses
 It's you who decide how to do it
 This will be the ultimate moral issue
 It will push you to the limit
 You will clearly see where your unknown weakness is
 Because this is what happened in a crisis
 The reason why this is a realistic prototype
 The coming end of the world
 The reason is hidden in the entire Judeo-Christian structure
 Because we have been living in the end
 No matter the micro or macro in your world
 Are coming to an end
 What should you do to prepare
 Prepare for the end of your world
 When the world ends
 You might get a new world
 That would be a good result
 Now we are finally ready for next week
