<p begin="00:23:03.660" end="00:23:07.140" style="s2">said okay and she went and knocked on</p>

<p begin="00:23:28.160" end="00:23:35.040" style="s2">and then she went back to the Buddha and</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.850" end="00:23:38.600" style="s2">she said thank you thank you for helping</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.040" end="00:23:41.040" style="s2">me see there&#39;s nothing that binds us</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.600" end="00:23:42.490" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that binds us what that</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.490" end="00:23:48.559" style="s2">so I&#39;m not trying to paint a silver</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.000" end="00:23:53.720" style="s2">lining for what&#39;s happening to you</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:55.880" style="s2">not at all instead I&#39;m trying to explain</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.720" end="00:23:59.630" style="s2">to you why I have reverence for what</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.880" end="00:24:03.890" style="s2">you&#39;re going through and that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.630" end="00:24:07.429" style="s2">expressing as much as I can you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.890" end="00:24:12.500" style="s2">connectedness we share in that we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.429" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">both experienced deep loss now on to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.500" end="00:24:15.860" style="s2">more practical question but I thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:18.380" style="s2">the existential is she needed to be at</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.860" end="00:24:20.660" style="s2">least recognized and addressed because</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.380" end="00:24:23.270" style="s2">very often what we need in these deepest</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.660" end="00:24:26.450" style="s2">times nobody can give us advice what we</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.270" end="00:24:32.270" style="s2">need is to room we need to experience</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.450" end="00:24:33.950" style="s2">that we&#39;re seen and heard I now if I a</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.270" end="00:24:35.150" style="s2">very painful or difficult to meditate on</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.950" end="00:24:36.500" style="s2">these things but still think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.150" end="00:24:38.630" style="s2">necessary in order to get rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.500" end="00:24:40.130" style="s2">gastric neurosis since it&#39;s caused by</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.630" end="00:24:42.350" style="s2">mental state rather than a physical</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.130" end="00:24:48.530" style="s2">problem could you suggest any mentor or</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.350" end="00:24:52.070" style="s2">specific lessons that could help so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.530" end="00:24:52.910" style="s2">the difficulty is the stress I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.070" end="00:24:56.990" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.910" end="00:24:58.340" style="s2">I think meditating on the gastric</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.990" end="00:25:02.090" style="s2">neurosis to try and make it go away is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.340" end="00:25:02.929" style="s2">little bit wrong way to frame it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.090" end="00:25:05.540" style="s2">where you&#39;re trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.929" end="00:25:07.910" style="s2">meditation to become a commendable cure</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.540" end="00:25:10.309" style="s2">for you I think instead if you really</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.910" end="00:25:12.530" style="s2">concentrate on the core for really</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.309" end="00:25:14.780" style="s2">getting into your body in a different</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.530" end="00:25:18.230" style="s2">way so what instead of trying to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.780" end="00:25:20.570" style="s2">know get rid of this try to get into a</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.230" end="00:25:23.480" style="s2">different way in your body in which it</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.570" end="00:25:25.669" style="s2">is not focally present really deeply</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.480" end="00:25:28.040" style="s2">don&#39;t do anything beyond just really</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.669" end="00:25:31.130" style="s2">deeply do the core for really really</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.040" end="00:25:33.410" style="s2">really deeply and don&#39;t again and just</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.130" end="00:25:35.299" style="s2">know and don&#39;t even maybe even do the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.410" end="00:25:38.419" style="s2">500 but part of mindfulness on it right</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.299" end="00:25:40.160" style="s2">now just note the the pain or note the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.419" end="00:25:43.370" style="s2">stress you just come back and really try</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.160" end="00:25:45.710" style="s2">to remember sati what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.370" end="00:25:47.990" style="s2">deeply inhabit your body in a place in</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.710" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">which these things are not focal so</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.990" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">instead of trying to make it go away I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:54.530" style="s2">trying to get you to do it really really</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.200" end="00:25:56.050" style="s2">fundamentally embodied reframing of how</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.530" end="00:26:00.350" style="s2">you&#39;re relating to</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.050" end="00:26:05.530" style="s2">about the the grief and the chances are</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.350" end="00:26:05.530" style="s2">these two things are being deeply</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.100" end="00:26:11.060" style="s2">integrated maybe not helpfully by your</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.050" end="00:26:12.620" style="s2">brain because they&#39;re both you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.060" end="00:26:15.350" style="s2">conditions of threat and lost they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.620" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">both triggering amygdala and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.350" end="00:26:18.250" style="s2">both sort of playing with your</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.640" end="00:26:20.510" style="s2">reconstructed memory in powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.250" end="00:26:24.170" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s good to talk to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.510" end="00:26:26.750" style="s2">regularly the advice that this person</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.170" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">gave me about grief is he said is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.750" end="00:26:30.440" style="s2">the only way through grief you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:35.360" style="s2">grow into a different person</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.440" end="00:26:37.660" style="s2">and so the thing to do about that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.360" end="00:26:40.160" style="s2">like I say you might consider some</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.660" end="00:26:43.010" style="s2">therapeutic interventions I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.160" end="00:26:46.340" style="s2">your particular situation it sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.010" end="00:26:51.650" style="s2">distressing yeah I would increase the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.340" end="00:26:56.090" style="s2">Dharma learning much more a 14 your</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.650" end="00:26:59.000" style="s2">aspiration to growth is the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.090" end="00:27:00.760" style="s2">try and slowly slowly slowly because</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.000" end="00:27:03.470" style="s2">that&#39;s all the only way it will happen</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.760" end="00:27:06.400" style="s2">start to move forward so in both ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.470" end="00:27:09.560" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying is trying to inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.400" end="00:27:11.630" style="s2">your body or inhabit your life</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.560" end="00:27:13.940" style="s2">differently than you are rather than</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.630" end="00:27:18.800" style="s2">trying to make these things go away and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.940" end="00:27:23.200" style="s2">try to continually remember that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.800" end="00:27:27.860" style="s2">have gone through this before loss</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.200" end="00:27:30.520" style="s2">stress and other people have and again</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.860" end="00:27:34.280" style="s2">not a Hallmark card of I can do it but</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.520" end="00:27:36.440" style="s2">remember knowledge and acknowledgement</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.280" end="00:27:38.870" style="s2">and reverence for the fact that you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.440" end="00:27:42.560" style="s2">resources within you that transcend your</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.870" end="00:27:48.250" style="s2">ego across so I hope that&#39;s helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.560" end="00:27:50.780" style="s2">you I really did I really did Rainer</p>

<p begin="00:27:54.470" end="00:27:58.130" style="s2">not sure if it&#39;s possible to not think</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.910" end="00:28:05.000" style="s2">it is possible that just takes a long</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.250" end="00:28:06.380" style="s2">time what about the other way in which</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.000" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">you might be able to get into it when</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.380" end="00:28:10.320" style="s2">you meditate</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:12.539" style="s2">you apply the five factors to inquire in</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.320" end="00:28:15.990" style="s2">mindfulness do you get the distraction</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.539" end="00:28:19.529" style="s2">going wait you get a moment of where</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.990" end="00:28:22.230" style="s2">you&#39;re not in thought and then try to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.529" end="00:28:24.539" style="s2">savor that and try to notice that more</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.230" end="00:28:27.210" style="s2">often as it as your way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.539" end="00:28:29.549" style="s2">become more aware of the space between</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.210" end="00:28:31.500" style="s2">your thoughts but secondly you need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.549" end="00:28:34.379" style="s2">do things that get you into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.500" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">state the flow state is a universal</p>

<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:42.750" style="s2">you will not have that thought you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.870" end="00:28:44.850" style="s2">so focused and and coupled to the task</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.750" end="00:28:46.740" style="s2">in the environment and absorbed into it</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.850" end="00:28:48.240" style="s2">that that will go away and it&#39;s and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.740" end="00:28:50.009" style="s2">a wonderful state to be in</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.240" end="00:28:51.990" style="s2">it&#39;s an optimal experience in optimal</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.700" end="00:29:11.000" style="s2">enhance flow because if you can get that</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.980" end="00:29:13.500" style="s2">then you can start to create a felt</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.000" end="00:29:16.529" style="s2">consciousness a felt memory of what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.500" end="00:29:18.720" style="s2">like to be absorbed and involved awake</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.529" end="00:29:21.379" style="s2">and alert but without thought running</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.720" end="00:29:21.379" style="s2">through your head</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.649" end="00:29:27.389" style="s2">harima is it possible to do this</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.169" end="00:29:29.279" style="s2">meditation in a busy noisy environment I</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.389" end="00:29:31.559" style="s2">cannot keep the focus inside my body but</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.279" end="00:29:33.899" style="s2">let go of the tension and all the sound</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.559" end="00:29:39.269" style="s2">takes me inside much like a singing bowl</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.899" end="00:29:41.700" style="s2">um yeah um it&#39;s good to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.269" end="00:29:44.370" style="s2">again on you yeah you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.700" end="00:29:47.669" style="s2">eventually when you get when you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.370" end="00:29:50.850" style="s2">practicing a long time it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.669" end="00:29:53.159" style="s2">like that all the sounds are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.850" end="00:29:56.129" style="s2">I had something very similar as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.159" end="00:29:58.259" style="s2">metaphor it&#39;s like my mind is like water</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.129" end="00:30:01.169" style="s2">and the sounds and all I do is just a</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.259" end="00:30:05.580" style="s2">rippling through or but I gets very slow</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.580" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">you&#39;ve been practicing for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.470" end="00:30:12.269" style="s2">and you are reliably getting deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.840" end="00:30:14.879" style="s2">this practice then what you describe I</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.269" end="00:30:18.860" style="s2">think is something that I myself have</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.879" end="00:30:21.559" style="s2">found to be possible within</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.860" end="00:30:24.110" style="s2">you know within this practice so it</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.559" end="00:30:27.559" style="s2">seems very plausible to me it seems very</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.110" end="00:30:29.420" style="s2">plausible to me Dimitar what do you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.559" end="00:30:31.460" style="s2">think about doing Metta on snippets or</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.420" end="00:30:32.929" style="s2">sequences of memories that come up is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.460" end="00:30:35.030" style="s2">like doing better on yourself since your</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.929" end="00:30:37.160" style="s2">experiences have shaped you into being</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.030" end="00:30:38.390" style="s2">in some way what world can memories and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.160" end="00:30:40.910" style="s2">generals serve within a mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.390" end="00:30:41.960" style="s2">practice yes yes in fact very often</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.910" end="00:30:44.000" style="s2">they&#39;re like what you&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.960" end="00:30:46.760" style="s2">meditator questing what will come up are</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.000" end="00:30:48.920" style="s2">snippets of memory and yes yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.760" end="00:30:50.210" style="s2">you treat them as a portal yes but what</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.920" end="00:30:52.850" style="s2">you know where did that come from what</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.210" end="00:30:54.140" style="s2">is behind that and if you take something</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.850" end="00:30:57.049" style="s2">like what you&#39;re doing in the meditative</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.140" end="00:30:59.570" style="s2">questioning into your meta with those</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.049" end="00:31:03.880" style="s2">memories I think you&#39;ll find that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.570" end="00:31:07.220" style="s2">gets you very equally into the practice</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.880" end="00:31:08.900" style="s2">Kyra Kroger since I asked the question</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.220" end="00:31:10.940" style="s2">about breathing and raising my shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.900" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">my attention seems hyper focused on my</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.940" end="00:31:14.840" style="s2">breath and bringing up the even more</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:18.860" style="s2">anxiety of not getting a full breath any</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.840" end="00:31:21.620" style="s2">suggestions yes so this is a spiral that</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.860" end="00:31:22.510" style="s2">some people get into so stop following</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.620" end="00:31:24.770" style="s2">your breath</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.510" end="00:31:25.970" style="s2">just stop following your breath so</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.770" end="00:31:27.770" style="s2">instead what I want you to do is I want</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.970" end="00:31:30.230" style="s2">you to do your rooting and I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.770" end="00:31:32.900" style="s2">pay attention to the sense of contact</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.230" end="00:31:34.370" style="s2">where you&#39;re touching the cushion and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.900" end="00:31:38.120" style="s2">what I want you to do when you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.370" end="00:31:41.150" style="s2">is I want you to just right just keep</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.120" end="00:31:43.669" style="s2">coming back to that sensation of contact</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.150" end="00:31:45.110" style="s2">and rootedness and stability just coming</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.669" end="00:31:47.390" style="s2">back forget your breath</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.110" end="00:31:50.600" style="s2">forget your breath for now come back and</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.390" end="00:31:52.490" style="s2">focus on the contact and the routing and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.600" end="00:31:54.470" style="s2">the stability and the routing and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.490" end="00:31:56.690" style="s2">distracted you come back refined the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.470" end="00:31:58.220" style="s2">routing refined that sense of contact of</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.690" end="00:32:00.500" style="s2">reaching into the earth of stabilizing</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.220" end="00:32:02.720" style="s2">yourself and doing that over and over</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.500" end="00:32:05.570" style="s2">and over and over and over again make</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.720" end="00:32:08.450" style="s2">that your meditative focus for now then</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.570" end="00:32:11.000" style="s2">once that stabilizes then we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.450" end="00:32:13.520" style="s2">probably shift back you may just go</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.000" end="00:32:15.919" style="s2">directly to deepen deep the pasta and</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.520" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">just leave your breathing where it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.919" end="00:32:20.150" style="s2">for now so we have to bring that up</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:21.950" style="s2">you&#39;re in this this is a parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.150" end="00:32:24.020" style="s2">processing it&#39;s spinning on itself and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.950" end="00:32:27.380" style="s2">so the thing to do is just let it go for</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.020" end="00:32:32.020" style="s2">now shift the focus as I suggested and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.380" end="00:32:33.940" style="s2">work with that for now so</p>
