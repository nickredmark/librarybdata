<p begin="00:00:12.789" end="00:00:18.010" style="s2">May so we wanted to take the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.559" end="00:00:20.440" style="s2">to explain what it is why we&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.010" end="00:00:22.180" style="s2">and also who&#39;s gonna be there so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.440" end="00:00:24.310" style="s2">got a really exciting lineup of speakers</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.180" end="00:00:25.750" style="s2">and all of them in some way are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.310" end="00:00:27.520" style="s2">talking about themes you&#39;ve covered on</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.750" end="00:00:31.120" style="s2">the channel so from the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.520" end="00:00:33.670" style="s2">to difficulty of sense making to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.120" end="00:00:35.650" style="s2">information ecology and new practices</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.670" end="00:00:37.780" style="s2">that help us see the world differently</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.650" end="00:00:40.270" style="s2">move forward in different ways and on</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.780" end="00:00:42.550" style="s2">that note as well we have really</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.270" end="00:00:43.989" style="s2">top-notch lineup of facilitators so as</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.550" end="00:00:45.850" style="s2">well as the talks which give us a kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.989" end="00:00:48.100" style="s2">of scaffolding and framing it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.850" end="00:00:50.770" style="s2">a lot of transformative experiences from</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.100" end="00:00:52.899" style="s2">breadth work and circling even improv</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.770" end="00:00:54.640" style="s2">jazz workshops so it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.899" end="00:00:56.500" style="s2">whole really a festival kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.640" end="00:00:58.210" style="s2">choose-your-own-adventure festival so in</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.500" end="00:00:59.890" style="s2">this film we&#39;re going to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.210" end="00:01:01.390" style="s2">whole outline of the festival introduce</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.890" end="00:01:04.960" style="s2">the speakers play some clips from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.390" end="00:01:06.760" style="s2">speakers and try and explain why we feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.960" end="00:01:09.430" style="s2">that this is a kind of culmination of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.760" end="00:01:12.250" style="s2">the last two years of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.430" end="00:01:13.930" style="s2">journey of the channel and really</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.250" end="00:01:16.090" style="s2">looking into kind of the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.930" end="00:01:17.979" style="s2">how difficult it is to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.090" end="00:01:19.510" style="s2">world in an environment where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.979" end="00:01:21.610" style="s2">our institutions are failing to make</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.510" end="00:01:25.090" style="s2">sense of it and then this very much</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.610" end="00:01:27.790" style="s2">sense and understanding that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.090" end="00:01:30.190" style="s2">really come back to our own sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.790" end="00:01:32.710" style="s2">our own discernment and how we the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.190" end="00:01:34.450" style="s2">practices to do that as well and in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.710" end="00:01:37.150" style="s2">way we started this process of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.450" end="00:01:38.890" style="s2">live last year or almost a year to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.150" end="00:01:41.380" style="s2">day when the festival will be last May</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.890" end="00:01:43.090" style="s2">at the rebel was in summit and so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.380" end="00:01:46.689" style="s2">summit we capped at the Dunbar number</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.090" end="00:01:49.200" style="s2">which was 150 people and had four</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.689" end="00:01:52.000" style="s2">speakers we had in McGilchrist Brett</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.200" end="00:01:54.280" style="s2">Weinstein Heather hiring and Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.000" end="00:01:56.320" style="s2">and we also broke out into groups to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.280" end="00:01:57.909" style="s2">have discussions about cultural topics</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.320" end="00:01:59.770" style="s2">we find it difficult to discuss there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.909" end="00:02:00.790" style="s2">kind of early exploration into how do we</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.770" end="00:02:02.680" style="s2">make sense together</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.790" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">and we learned a lot from the summit I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.680" end="00:02:05.920" style="s2">basically one of the things we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:07.119" style="s2">do is make it bigger and better so</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.920" end="00:02:09.489" style="s2">instead of having one day instead of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.119" end="00:02:12.370" style="s2">capping the numbers we put it over two</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.489" end="00:02:14.440" style="s2">days and making it this this format</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.370" end="00:02:15.610" style="s2">where we have a lot on offer that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.440" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">we&#39;re calling it a fest of all there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.610" end="00:02:19.600" style="s2">lots to do and you choose what you want</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:20.860" style="s2">to do so there&#39;ll be at you know you</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.600" end="00:02:21.850" style="s2">might want to go and see a lot of talks</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.860" end="00:02:23.020" style="s2">you might want to do a lot of discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.850" end="00:02:24.730" style="s2">groups you might want to do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.020" end="00:02:27.340" style="s2">embodied practices like breath work or</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.730" end="00:02:28.540" style="s2">circling whatever it might be and of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.340" end="00:02:30.610" style="s2">course you can combine all of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.540" end="00:02:32.350" style="s2">together so so the point is to really</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.610" end="00:02:33.640" style="s2">give in a way putting our money where</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.350" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">our mouth is we talk a lot about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.640" end="00:02:37.690" style="s2">importance of doing these practices into</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:40.660" style="s2">getting into different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.690" end="00:02:42.220" style="s2">perceiving and so it&#39;s a it&#39;s creating a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.660" end="00:02:43.959" style="s2">space where we can do that where we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.220" end="00:02:45.670" style="s2">actually have the option to do all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.959" end="00:02:48.250" style="s2">these different things and then connect</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.670" end="00:02:50.470" style="s2">with each other and hopefully make sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.250" end="00:02:51.940" style="s2">in in a new way yeah and I&#39;d say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.470" end="00:02:54.220" style="s2">was the main learning that we had from</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.940" end="00:02:55.720" style="s2">the summit last year was what we tried</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.220" end="00:02:58.120" style="s2">to do with the summit was curate one</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.720" end="00:02:59.830" style="s2">experience that all 150 people went</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.120" end="00:03:03.430" style="s2">through and I think how big learning</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.830" end="00:03:05.860" style="s2">from that was that paradoxically if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.430" end="00:03:08.050" style="s2">give more options then you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.860" end="00:03:10.360" style="s2">go deeper because some people really</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.050" end="00:03:11.860" style="s2">enjoyed the the sense making together</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.360" end="00:03:14.050" style="s2">others just wanted to kind of just see</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.860" end="00:03:15.940" style="s2">the people up on stage which is fine</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.050" end="00:03:18.130" style="s2">like if that&#39;s where if that&#39;s your kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.940" end="00:03:19.690" style="s2">of what you want from it from a live</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.130" end="00:03:22.030" style="s2">experience then you can do that you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.690" end="00:03:23.709" style="s2">just go to the talks but with this</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.030" end="00:03:25.390" style="s2">option because you choose your own</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.709" end="00:03:27.340" style="s2">adventure we can actually offer slightly</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.390" end="00:03:30.780" style="s2">deeper experiences like breadth work</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.340" end="00:03:33.959" style="s2">like sense-making workshop and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.780" end="00:03:36.040" style="s2">paradoxically we realize that by by not</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.959" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">curating one experience for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.040" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">where you then have to kind of go oh is</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:40.269" style="s2">that going to be a bit too much is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.560" end="00:03:42.010" style="s2">move it too much you can actually go</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.269" end="00:03:43.720" style="s2">deeper so I think this is this is our</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.010" end="00:03:46.989" style="s2">learning and this is why we&#39;ve decided</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.720" end="00:03:49.510" style="s2">to go deeper bigger and with more</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.989" end="00:03:51.100" style="s2">options for the festival this time</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.510" end="00:03:52.570" style="s2">we also have an amazing venue in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.100" end="00:03:54.070" style="s2">center of London it&#39;s much bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.570" end="00:03:56.140" style="s2">the venue we had for the summit and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.070" end="00:03:57.370" style="s2">got four stories to it so what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.140" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">allows us to have multiple things</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.370" end="00:04:01.480" style="s2">running at the same time there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:03.970" style="s2">three different sort of narrative tracks</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.480" end="00:04:06.459" style="s2">running through it and the three are</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.970" end="00:04:08.170" style="s2">meaning the meaning is a really big one</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.459" end="00:04:09.820" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a topic we&#39;ve been covering on</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.170" end="00:04:11.440" style="s2">the channel since the beginning we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.820" end="00:04:13.060" style="s2">been covering the meaning crisis this</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.440" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">kind of loss of connection we have in</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.060" end="00:04:17.109" style="s2">you know our own narrative our own</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:19.299" style="s2">historical trajectory how that plays out</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.109" end="00:04:20.829" style="s2">in culture and there&#39;s also practices</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.299" end="00:04:23.229" style="s2">that connect us to meaning so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.829" end="00:04:25.450" style="s2">gonna have both of those talks workshops</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.229" end="00:04:27.729" style="s2">the next track we have is imagine</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.450" end="00:04:29.550" style="s2">futures and imagined futures includes a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.729" end="00:04:31.950" style="s2">lot of the Systems Theory</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.550" end="00:04:33.210" style="s2">and I kind of wider big-picture systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.950" end="00:04:35.550" style="s2">thinking which we&#39;ve also had on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.210" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">channel a lot and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.550" end="00:04:39.060" style="s2">big-picture thinking but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:40.710" style="s2">exploring things like psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.060" end="00:04:43.590" style="s2">medicine which might start changing</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.710" end="00:04:46.110" style="s2">paradigms it&#39;s exploring anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.590" end="00:04:47.940" style="s2">really looking to the future and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.110" end="00:04:50.520" style="s2">third track is cultural shadows and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.940" end="00:04:52.980" style="s2">cultural shadows runs through both those</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.520" end="00:04:54.870" style="s2">previous tracks in some ways and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.980" end="00:04:56.610" style="s2">are we not looking at when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.870" end="00:05:00.210" style="s2">about these things what are the things</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.610" end="00:05:02.130" style="s2">we don&#39;t quite know how to discuss what</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.210" end="00:05:04.860" style="s2">are the things that are our blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.130" end="00:05:07.770" style="s2">and that&#39;s going to really run through</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.860" end="00:05:08.790" style="s2">the entire festival and yeah I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.770" end="00:05:10.710" style="s2">looking forward to that as well I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.790" end="00:05:12.690" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.710" end="00:05:14.070" style="s2">discussions but also surface what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.690" end="00:05:15.930" style="s2">not talking about it&#39;s quite rare that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.070" end="00:05:17.670" style="s2">we have the opportunity to do that an</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.930" end="00:05:19.800" style="s2">event so let&#39;s introduce the speakers</p>

<p begin="00:05:19.800" end="00:05:23.460" style="s2">we&#39;ve had on the channel a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.480" end="00:05:26.190" style="s2">times and it&#39;s kind of an elder</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.460" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">statesman of these bigger questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.190" end="00:05:30.150" style="s2">about paradigm shift like he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:32.310" style="s2">obviously very controversial figure in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.150" end="00:05:35.340" style="s2">the world of science and still kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.310" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">mainstream and isn&#39;t entirely sure what</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.340" end="00:05:40.350" style="s2">to do with him but he&#39;s been plugging</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:43.020" style="s2">away at this kind of where is the</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.900" end="00:05:50.940" style="s2">been involved in these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.860" end="00:05:53.460" style="s2">since like SLN it with people like</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.940" end="00:05:56.280" style="s2">Terence Mckenna and many of the the kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.460" end="00:05:58.380" style="s2">of countercultural figures of the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.280" end="00:06:00.990" style="s2">and 80s and he&#39;s kind of a link back to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.380" end="00:06:04.620" style="s2">the past and also kind of framing of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.990" end="00:06:06.060" style="s2">what are the lessons that maybe he and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.620" end="00:06:07.620" style="s2">others who were involved in these</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.280" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">on where we&#39;re at now so let&#39;s play a</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:17.400" style="s2">short clip from Rupert because I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:18.540" style="s2">kind of retained heretic in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.400" end="00:06:20.460" style="s2">science I mean it&#39;s not me that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.540" end="00:06:25.680" style="s2">proclaims that but I&#39;m sort of branded</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.460" end="00:06:28.230" style="s2">as a heretic then the normal gatekeepers</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.680" end="00:06:29.820" style="s2">and the mainstream media around the back</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.230" end="00:06:32.280" style="s2">off when it&#39;s anything to do with me</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.820" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">because it&#39;s too controversial it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.280" end="00:06:35.550" style="s2">that they&#39;re afraid of the views I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.490" end="00:06:49.040" style="s2">or are you is that some way off yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.750" end="00:06:52.010" style="s2">well the points I was making in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.040" end="00:06:55.610" style="s2">science delusion ten dogmas of science</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.010" end="00:06:57.020" style="s2">that I was talking about the changes</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.020" end="00:07:01.310" style="s2">came out have all gone in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.060" end="00:07:03.650" style="s2">I was suggesting and then we have Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.310" end="00:07:05.510" style="s2">SHM attenberger who a lot of viewers</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.650" end="00:07:07.130" style="s2">will be familiar with from the war on</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.510" end="00:07:08.420" style="s2">sense-making piece and some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.130" end="00:07:11.600" style="s2">pieces that we put out on the channel</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.420" end="00:07:14.540" style="s2">and Daniel brings a really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.600" end="00:07:17.210" style="s2">mix of sort of deep granular</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.540" end="00:07:18.470" style="s2">understanding of why it&#39;s so hard to</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.210" end="00:07:20.620" style="s2">make sense of the world why the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.470" end="00:07:24.370" style="s2">information ecology is so damaged</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.620" end="00:07:28.460" style="s2">together with a really broad sweep of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.370" end="00:07:30.860" style="s2">systems change paradigm shift and what</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.460" end="00:07:32.630" style="s2">is the what is the nature of the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.860" end="00:07:34.640" style="s2">that we seem to be in at the moment it</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.630" end="00:07:37.010" style="s2">seems to be accelerating and what might</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.640" end="00:07:39.320" style="s2">come next we&#39;re making more and more</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.010" end="00:07:41.390" style="s2">consequential choices with worse and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.320" end="00:07:44.030" style="s2">worse sense making to inform those</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.390" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">choices which is kind of running</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.030" end="00:07:53.090" style="s2">increasingly fast through the woods</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.550" end="00:07:54.950" style="s2">increasingly blind right and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.090" end="00:07:57.320" style="s2">many of the people that you&#39;ve had on</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.950" end="00:08:01.070" style="s2">row wisdom have been in a deep inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.320" end="00:08:03.140" style="s2">around how do we actually fix our own</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.070" end="00:08:04.820" style="s2">sense-making and it&#39;s some of what has</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.140" end="00:08:07.580" style="s2">brought us to have conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.820" end="00:08:08.690" style="s2">each other because a part of how we work</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.580" end="00:08:12.050" style="s2">with our own sense making as we</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.690" end="00:08:15.200" style="s2">recognize the cognitive complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.050" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">issues that the world faces is more than</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.200" end="00:08:18.500" style="s2">a single person can process a single</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:20.419" style="s2">brain that can&#39;t actually hold that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.500" end="00:08:22.100" style="s2">cognitive complexity so it requires</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.419" end="00:08:23.200" style="s2">collective intelligence and collective</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.100" end="00:08:26.120" style="s2">sense making</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.200" end="00:08:29.240" style="s2">but I can&#39;t just offload the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.120" end="00:08:31.130" style="s2">complexity to some Authority because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.240" end="00:08:32.660" style="s2">can&#39;t trust that they&#39;re actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.130" end="00:08:33.740" style="s2">good sense making maybe they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.660" end="00:08:36.110" style="s2">good sense making within a very limited</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.740" end="00:08:37.969" style="s2">context but then the application of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.110" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">outside of the context is different and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.969" end="00:08:40.940" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s even distortions within</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:42.260" style="s2">their context so I have to try and find</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.940" end="00:08:43.700" style="s2">other people that are also really</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.260" end="00:08:44.820" style="s2">endeavoring to sense make well which</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.700" end="00:08:47.490" style="s2">means they have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.820" end="00:08:48.150" style="s2">and what causes failures and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.490" end="00:08:49.500" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.150" end="00:08:50.910" style="s2">and then we have to see can we create</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.500" end="00:08:53.400" style="s2">relationships with each other that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.910" end="00:09:00.470" style="s2">removed the distortion basis that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.400" end="00:09:02.970" style="s2">normally there so I think I think what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.470" end="00:09:05.550" style="s2">from what I have seen of rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.970" end="00:09:07.230" style="s2">this is probably the strange attractor</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.550" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">of what is bringing everybody to watch</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.230" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">it is people who are trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:13.800" style="s2">sense of the world better themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:15.990" style="s2">are trying to find sources of content of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.800" end="00:09:18.870" style="s2">other other people that have been trying</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.990" end="00:09:21.210" style="s2">to make sense of it well which is what</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.870" end="00:09:22.980" style="s2">I&#39;m excited about and so those are just</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.210" end="00:09:27.810" style="s2">some opening thoughts and yeah I look</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.980" end="00:09:29.580" style="s2">forward to getting into why we have as</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.810" end="00:09:32.520" style="s2">broken and information ecology as we</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.580" end="00:09:35.790" style="s2">have and what it would take to correct</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.520" end="00:09:37.950" style="s2">that at a at scale so what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.790" end="00:09:39.690" style="s2">you talk about the historical trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.950" end="00:09:41.270" style="s2">of these kind of conversations because</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.690" end="00:09:44.190" style="s2">the next speaker we want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.270" end="00:09:46.860" style="s2">is Nora Bateson and Nora Bateson is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.190" end="00:09:48.540" style="s2">filmmaker a systems theorist and she</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.860" end="00:09:50.040" style="s2">threw the Bateson Institute is carrying</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.540" end="00:09:52.020" style="s2">on as well the work of her father who</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.040" end="00:09:54.410" style="s2">was Gregory Bateson and Gregory Bateson</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.020" end="00:09:56.700" style="s2">is one of the most well known</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.410" end="00:09:58.830" style="s2">philosophers in systems theory and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.700" end="00:10:02.610" style="s2">cybernetics and quite a few other areas</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.830" end="00:10:05.100" style="s2">of the 20th century so Nora has I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.610" end="00:10:07.230" style="s2">a very interesting take on systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.100" end="00:10:10.170" style="s2">change which she actually refers to as</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.230" end="00:10:12.030" style="s2">systems learning so moving beyond seeing</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.170" end="00:10:13.560" style="s2">it from a kind of engineering mode as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.030" end="00:10:17.250" style="s2">fixed system to seeing it as a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.560" end="00:10:19.710" style="s2">alive system so I&#39;ll just play a we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.250" end="00:10:21.630" style="s2">play a clip from Nora now there&#39;s plenty</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.710" end="00:10:22.590" style="s2">of great information you can get with</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.630" end="00:10:26.460" style="s2">reductionist</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.590" end="00:10:29.310" style="s2">process but you can&#39;t understand how the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.460" end="00:10:32.790" style="s2">vitality of a living system is actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.310" end="00:10:34.470" style="s2">shifting and moving and if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.790" end="00:10:39.060" style="s2">shifting and moving it&#39;s not alive</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.470" end="00:10:40.740" style="s2">anymore so we have a we have a conundrum</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.060" end="00:10:45.270" style="s2">there of how we&#39;re going to think about</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.740" end="00:10:47.820" style="s2">what information is when so much of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.270" end="00:10:49.820" style="s2">has been developed in terms of what we</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.820" end="00:10:54.120" style="s2">think of as authorized information</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.820" end="00:10:57.180" style="s2">aesthetic and what we need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.120" end="00:10:58.140" style="s2">and respond to is complex and alive so</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.180" end="00:10:58.769" style="s2">Nora is also going to be running</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.140" end="00:11:00.509" style="s2">something called</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.769" end="00:11:02.850" style="s2">warm day to lab which is very much based</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.509" end="00:11:05.279" style="s2">around the idea that information can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.850" end="00:11:07.759" style="s2">be taken out of its context we have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.279" end="00:11:10.529" style="s2">look at every piece of information as</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.759" end="00:11:11.939" style="s2">relationally connected to other pieces</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.529" end="00:11:14.069" style="s2">of information the workshops are all</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.939" end="00:11:15.209" style="s2">about how do we start perceiving in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.069" end="00:11:17.519" style="s2">way and how do we start solving problems</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.209" end="00:11:19.049" style="s2">using that methodology then we have one</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.519" end="00:11:21.259" style="s2">of our favorite people John Vevey key</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.049" end="00:11:23.579" style="s2">who many of you will know from his</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.259" end="00:11:24.989" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis series</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.579" end="00:11:27.779" style="s2">which made him a kind of little cult</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.989" end="00:11:31.230" style="s2">figure online and we&#39;ve had him on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.779" end="00:11:33.149" style="s2">channel a number of times and in this he</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.230" end="00:11:35.129" style="s2">will be speaking directly to the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.149" end="00:11:37.410" style="s2">crisis what is the meaning crisis what</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.850" end="00:14:00.770" style="s2">medicine starts to kind of turn on its</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.060" end="00:14:01.940" style="s2">head the the previous paradigm we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.770" end="00:14:03.380" style="s2">around medicine and what does it</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.940" end="00:14:04.640" style="s2">actually mean where does actually what</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.380" end="00:14:06.440" style="s2">do we need to know about that is there a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.640" end="00:14:08.990" style="s2">tension between because a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.440" end="00:14:11.240" style="s2">with with the medical model the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.990" end="00:14:13.010" style="s2">you take a pill and it has this effect</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.240" end="00:14:16.970" style="s2">on you like it&#39;s a very kind of material</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.010" end="00:14:18.410" style="s2">idea or a very mechanistic assumption it</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.970" end="00:14:20.120" style="s2">feels that there&#39;s something very</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.410" end="00:14:21.140" style="s2">different going on with psychedelics do</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.120" end="00:14:25.130" style="s2">you think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a weird</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.140" end="00:14:26.540" style="s2">tension I think it&#39;s a very good tension</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.130" end="00:14:29.060" style="s2">because I think the tension that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.540" end="00:14:30.830" style="s2">there has the power to really transforms</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.060" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">our system of care I think what</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.830" end="00:14:34.370" style="s2">psychedelics bring about is this</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:35.960" style="s2">absolute paradigm shift in that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.370" end="00:14:37.790" style="s2">can&#39;t use psychedelics in that way</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.960" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">psychedelics will never be able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.790" end="00:14:42.440" style="s2">safely be put into a kind of conveyor</p>

<p begin="00:14:42.440" end="00:14:46.520" style="s2">transform any system of care they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.880" end="00:14:49.340" style="s2">brought into you because in order to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.520" end="00:14:50.630" style="s2">them safely you need all the things I</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.340" end="00:14:52.640" style="s2">think we&#39;re important for therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.630" end="00:14:55.040" style="s2">changes to happen so you absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.640" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">cannot give a psychedelic substance to</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.040" end="00:15:00.020" style="s2">someone without proper trust and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:15:02.570" style="s2">means proper trust that they have for</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.610" end="00:15:11.450" style="s2">theme of new paradigms we have Jules</p>

<p begin="00:15:11.450" end="00:15:15.770" style="s2">channel a few times he actually wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.370" end="00:15:18.110" style="s2">really fascinating piece called dude</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.770" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">where&#39;s my paradigm shift kind of saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.110" end="00:15:22.580" style="s2">there&#39;s been this conversation since at</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.170" style="s2">least the 1960s and probably earlier</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.580" end="00:15:24.470" style="s2">than s about all we&#39;re on the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:15:24.470" end="00:15:29.210" style="s2">the edge of something new and why is</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.210" end="00:15:32.420" style="s2">naive to even think about things in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.070" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">way and talk about things in that way</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.420" end="00:15:35.480" style="s2">very possibly it could be a piece for</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:38.360" style="s2">the cultural shadows to kind of talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.480" end="00:15:41.930" style="s2">about is this whole idea kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.360" end="00:15:43.490" style="s2">naive wishful thinking but Jules is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.930" end="00:15:46.550" style="s2">really really fascinating thinker</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.490" end="00:15:47.630" style="s2">because he very deeply learned in into</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.550" end="00:15:51.110" style="s2">the various different types of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.630" end="00:15:52.940" style="s2">philosophy kind of very much was very</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.110" end="00:15:54.800" style="s2">involved in the stoic mute movement for</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.940" end="00:15:56.630" style="s2">a long time and then got a sense that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:58.840" style="s2">was missing something that stoicism was</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.630" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">missing the sort of deep lived</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.840" end="00:16:02.330" style="s2">transformational side of things I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:04.070" style="s2">interested in a history of ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.330" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">experiences and I feel like Western</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.070" end="00:16:10.820" style="s2">culture rather marginalized and</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:12.500" style="s2">pathologized ecstasy starting from</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.820" end="00:16:15.290" style="s2">around the Reformation as in by</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.500" end="00:16:20.060" style="s2">pathologized I mean it got redefined as</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.290" end="00:16:23.330" style="s2">a mental illness so in the 17th and 18th</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.060" end="00:16:25.370" style="s2">centuries rationalist materialist</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.330" end="00:16:29.930" style="s2">thinkers like Thomas Hobbes would say</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.370" end="00:16:31.190" style="s2">ecstasy is enthusiasm delusion you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.930" end="00:16:35.330" style="s2">just letting yourself be carried away</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.190" end="00:16:37.670" style="s2">with your imagination in the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.330" end="00:16:41.450" style="s2">century psychiatrists like jean-martin</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.670" end="00:16:43.880" style="s2">charcot said ecstasy is just hysteria a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.450" end="00:16:46.370" style="s2">symptom of a brain disorder all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.880" end="00:16:48.590" style="s2">ecstatics of yesteryear he said from</p>

<p begin="00:16:48.590" end="00:16:54.020" style="s2">actually suffering from brain disorders</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.490" end="00:16:57.950" style="s2">20th century psychiatry said something</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.020" end="00:16:59.720" style="s2">similar you know if you say I&#39;m spirits</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.950" end="00:17:03.550" style="s2">are talking to me I&#39;m connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.720" end="00:17:06.590" style="s2">universe that&#39;s actually just psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.550" end="00:17:08.170" style="s2">so that&#39;s the main story I think and as</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.590" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">a result of that there&#39;s a taboo around</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.170" end="00:17:12.950" style="s2">ecstasy this is something that Stan Grof</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.400" end="00:17:15.410" style="s2">talks really well about yeah Stan and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.950" end="00:17:16.970" style="s2">Stan Grof is very important in this in</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.410" end="00:17:21.890" style="s2">this kind of thing so psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.970" end="00:17:23.750" style="s2">pathologized ecstasy so we still have</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.890" end="00:17:26.090" style="s2">these experiences because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.750" end="00:17:27.290" style="s2">naturally occurring but we don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.090" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">about them because we don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.290" end="00:17:31.100" style="s2">ridiculous or stupid or mad so one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:32.570" style="s2">the things we&#39;ve been exploring on the</p>

<p begin="00:17:32.570" end="00:17:36.890" style="s2">intelligence this idea of us being more</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.300" end="00:17:37.940" style="s2">than the sum of our parts when we come</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.940" end="00:17:42.259" style="s2">solve a problem or make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.009" end="00:17:43.850" style="s2">world together and there&#39;s a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.259" end="00:17:46.399" style="s2">that keeps coming up over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.850" end="00:17:48.950" style="s2">which is jazz so a jazz ensemble is is</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.399" end="00:17:51.980" style="s2">often held up as a you know kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.950" end="00:17:55.370" style="s2">perfect collective intelligence idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.980" end="00:17:57.559" style="s2">metaphor and there&#39;s probably no bigger</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.370" end="00:17:59.929" style="s2">expert on that than Greg Thomas who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.559" end="00:18:02.269" style="s2">our next speaker and Greg runs with his</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.929" end="00:18:05.330" style="s2">wife jewel the jazz leadership project</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.269" end="00:18:07.460" style="s2">and so he&#39;s really excellent at</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.330" end="00:18:10.580" style="s2">explaining taking the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.460" end="00:18:12.860" style="s2">collective intelligence and then mapping</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.580" end="00:18:14.929" style="s2">against this jazz metaphor that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.860" end="00:18:17.960" style="s2">when I saw that conversation in other</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.929" end="00:18:20.600" style="s2">work on rebel wisdom it&#39;s exciting</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.960" end="00:18:23.799" style="s2">because you have folks that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.600" end="00:18:27.259" style="s2">listening deeply which is another very</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.799" end="00:18:30.019" style="s2">important practice in jazz that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.259" end="00:18:32.000" style="s2">should discuss but they&#39;re coming forth</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.019" end="00:18:35.240" style="s2">with inflammation and perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.000" end="00:18:37.519" style="s2">that&#39;s deeply informed so when jazz</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.240" end="00:18:40.159" style="s2">artists are playing together great jazz</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.519" end="00:18:41.629" style="s2">artists they&#39;re doing so in a way where</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.159" end="00:18:44.330" style="s2">they&#39;re communicating they&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.629" end="00:18:47.509" style="s2">conversation they&#39;re respecting the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.330" end="00:18:49.610" style="s2">individuality and leadership potential</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.509" end="00:18:52.879" style="s2">we call that shared leadership of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.610" end="00:18:55.070" style="s2">others as they engage in the moment so</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.879" end="00:18:57.139" style="s2">say the saxophone is solos first the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.070" end="00:18:59.029" style="s2">saxophone this is the lead during that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.139" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">moment everyone is supporting him or her</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.029" end="00:19:03.559" style="s2">same with the trumpet and then the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:06.350" style="s2">rhythm section they also get a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.559" end="00:19:07.970" style="s2">solo or improvise so that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.350" end="00:19:09.490" style="s2">models of shared leadership and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.970" end="00:19:12.110" style="s2">the same thing that happens in</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.490" end="00:19:14.840" style="s2">conversations among friends particularly</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.110" end="00:19:16.669" style="s2">deeply informed friends so Greg and his</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.840" end="00:19:18.830" style="s2">wife jewel are also going to be running</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.669" end="00:19:20.059" style="s2">a jazz leadership project workshop to</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.830" end="00:19:22.399" style="s2">kind of give give us all a lived</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.059" end="00:19:24.379" style="s2">experience of these ideas so then we</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.399" end="00:19:25.730" style="s2">have Alex Evans who&#39;s been on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.379" end="00:19:28.129" style="s2">channel talking about his collective</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.730" end="00:19:30.860" style="s2">psychology project but before that in</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.129" end="00:19:33.379" style="s2">2017 he wrote a really influential book</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.860" end="00:19:35.389" style="s2">called the myth gap and Alex&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.379" end="00:19:37.129" style="s2">background is in policymaking he was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.389" end="00:19:38.929" style="s2">government adviser for many years and</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.129" end="00:19:40.970" style="s2">what he noticed was that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.929" end="00:19:45.049" style="s2">conversation was very very narrow it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.970" end="00:19:46.789" style="s2">all about statistics and very dry and he</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.049" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">was sort of sensing there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.789" end="00:19:50.429" style="s2">really missing here and what&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:52.499" style="s2">is this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.429" end="00:19:55.409" style="s2">the stories that actually can move</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.499" end="00:19:57.929" style="s2">people and put be genuinely sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.409" end="00:19:59.369" style="s2">transformational what-what would and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.929" end="00:20:01.590" style="s2">myth gap was all about this like well</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.369" end="00:20:03.960" style="s2">religions have got this and there seems</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.590" end="00:20:06.179" style="s2">to be a gap where religion normally goes</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.960" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s having such a big kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.179" end="00:20:10.980" style="s2">sweeping impact on us as as people at</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:13.230" style="s2">their best religions have really</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.980" end="00:20:14.879" style="s2">performed this role of kind of putting</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.230" end="00:20:16.499" style="s2">tools for agency out there into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.879" end="00:20:18.749" style="s2">world and in terms of belonging of</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.499" end="00:20:21.299" style="s2">course religions have been all about</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.749" end="00:20:23.220" style="s2">creating congregational spaces where</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.299" end="00:20:25.230" style="s2">people feel like they can belong in</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.220" end="00:20:28.710" style="s2">spite of their differences in spite of</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.230" end="00:20:32.039" style="s2">their shortcomings so that&#39;s if you like</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.710" end="00:20:33.419" style="s2">a separate set of things that religions</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.039" end="00:20:36.269" style="s2">have historically done for us but you</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.419" end="00:20:37.919" style="s2">know as with myth it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.269" end="00:20:39.720" style="s2">turns out to be incredibly important for</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.919" end="00:20:41.789" style="s2">our collective psychological health and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.720" end="00:20:43.769" style="s2">now we&#39;re looking around for you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.789" end="00:20:45.929" style="s2">how to fill that gap so then we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.769" end="00:20:48.090" style="s2">Peter Limburg who we recently featured</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.929" end="00:20:49.919" style="s2">on the channel with the culture war 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.090" end="00:20:52.340" style="s2">piece and that&#39;s been a really</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.919" end="00:20:55.049" style="s2">influential piece in this sort of wider</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.340" end="00:20:57.269" style="s2">sense making conversation I think the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.049" end="00:20:58.769" style="s2">the framing of memetic tribes the idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.269" end="00:21:00.809" style="s2">of hermetic mediation and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.769" end="00:21:03.960" style="s2">other concepts that were put forward in</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.809" end="00:21:06.149" style="s2">that piece I&#39;ve had a really Illustrated</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.960" end="00:21:09.450" style="s2">a lot of what&#39;s going on from a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.149" end="00:21:12.389" style="s2">broader cultural perspective one aspect</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.450" end="00:21:15.450" style="s2">about mimetic tribes is this the sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.389" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">that they&#39;re disembodied because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.450" end="00:21:22.230" style="s2">exercising this sense of tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:23.159" style="s2">around a certain idea a certain ideology</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.230" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">a certain mean Plex</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.159" end="00:21:30.899" style="s2">but not really meeting or hearing in</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.679" end="00:21:32.700" style="s2">person and there&#39;s a an egoic aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.899" end="00:21:34.950" style="s2">this there there&#39;s their ego likely</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.700" end="00:21:40.049" style="s2">attached to the ideas that they&#39;re are</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.950" end="00:21:43.139" style="s2">fighting with where I think what rebel</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.049" end="00:21:44.399" style="s2">wisdom is gesturing towards and various</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.139" end="00:21:46.919" style="s2">different people in a sense making web</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.399" end="00:21:48.419" style="s2">is trying to create an embodied tribe</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.919" end="00:21:51.389" style="s2">where people actually get together in</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.419" end="00:21:52.980" style="s2">person and explore ideas and also Peter</p>
