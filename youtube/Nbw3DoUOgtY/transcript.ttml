<p begin="00:00:07.370" end="00:00:13.009" style="s2">know you so well you&#39;re Brett</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.740" end="00:00:15.110" style="s2">Weinstein&#39;s wife yeah you were also at</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.009" end="00:00:17.029" style="s2">Evergreen and the main reason I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.110" end="00:00:18.320" style="s2">that you were not as high-profile was</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.029" end="00:00:20.570" style="s2">that you were actually on sabbatical at</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.320" end="00:00:22.550" style="s2">the time the protest kicked off and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.570" end="00:00:24.410" style="s2">looked this stuff that people have seen</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.550" end="00:00:27.919" style="s2">I also have a different personality it</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.410" end="00:00:30.009" style="s2">would have been less like me to to</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.919" end="00:00:33.830" style="s2">continue going into the hornet&#39;s nest</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.009" end="00:00:35.570" style="s2">but I was I was there in the shadows the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.830" end="00:00:37.460" style="s2">whole way you know I read every single</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.570" end="00:00:42.020" style="s2">thing that he sent out before I send it</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.460" end="00:00:43.130" style="s2">out but yes I was on sabbatical I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.020" end="00:00:45.860" style="s2">doing a totally different thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.130" end="00:00:49.400" style="s2">blissfully for five months in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.860" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">immediate run-up to to what happened I</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.400" end="00:00:55.579" style="s2">never green and what I find really</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:59.780" style="s2">fascinating is that you have a really</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.579" end="00:01:02.000" style="s2">strong lived experience of a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.780" end="00:01:03.920" style="s2">a lot of people talk about this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.000" end="00:01:05.810" style="s2">force that they say at work in the media</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.920" end="00:01:08.270" style="s2">and in various places and that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.810" end="00:01:13.330" style="s2">very worried about it but your story</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.270" end="00:01:15.890" style="s2">seems to me to be the the new plus ultra</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.330" end="00:01:18.549" style="s2">example of what can happen when this</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.890" end="00:01:22.580" style="s2">tendency gets completely out of control</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.549" end="00:01:24.799" style="s2">indeed I mean it really even with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.580" end="00:01:27.440" style="s2">attempts of the Evergreen administration</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.799" end="00:01:29.869" style="s2">to basically pretend that the story was</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.440" end="00:01:33.040" style="s2">the opposite of what it was and to hire</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.869" end="00:01:35.450" style="s2">PR to to to make that happen</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.040" end="00:01:37.070" style="s2">for a while it seemed to be working and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.450" end="00:01:38.090" style="s2">people would say to us ah it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.070" end="00:01:39.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen the way you said it did</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.090" end="00:01:40.790" style="s2">you know there were never people with</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.200" end="00:01:41.570" style="s2">baseball bats you weren&#39;t chased out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.790" end="00:01:44.030" style="s2">your own home you know all of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.570" end="00:01:47.330" style="s2">things and increasingly people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.030" end="00:01:49.400" style="s2">saying well yes evergreen was bad but</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.330" end="00:01:53.810" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of a one-off thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.400" end="00:01:55.490" style="s2">and I would say you know I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.810" end="00:01:56.900" style="s2">horrified and dismayed and heartbroken</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.490" end="00:01:59.990" style="s2">and what happened but given that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.900" end="00:02:03.549" style="s2">what was going on that campus I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.990" end="00:02:06.470" style="s2">to know and to have been part of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.549" end="00:02:09.439" style="s2">couple that stood up and not be</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.470" end="00:02:12.829" style="s2">participating in it through be a silence</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.439" end="00:02:13.530" style="s2">I&#39;d rather not be there even as much as</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.829" end="00:02:16.830" style="s2">I loved</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.530" end="00:02:19.130" style="s2">when it was functional than to be there</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.830" end="00:02:22.230" style="s2">under very false and authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.130" end="00:02:25.370" style="s2">pretenses a lot of people say as you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.230" end="00:02:27.830" style="s2">said evergreen was a one-off and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.370" end="00:02:30.030" style="s2">when you talk about this kind of threat</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.830" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">your straw Manning you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.030" end="00:02:34.470" style="s2">creating a bogeyman that doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:36.120" style="s2">what what is your impression of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.470" end="00:02:38.100" style="s2">having gone through the Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.120" end="00:02:41.220" style="s2">experience and then seeing how the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.100" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">culture is at the moment it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.220" end="00:02:47.340" style="s2">getting worse while it is also true that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:50.610" style="s2">it is not a majority certainly no</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.340" end="00:02:53.850" style="s2">majority of students not a majority of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.610" end="00:02:56.630" style="s2">faculty who are pushing this</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.850" end="00:02:59.130" style="s2">authoritarian ideology this groupthink</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.630" end="00:03:05.790" style="s2">but I would say that a majority of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.130" end="00:03:08.850" style="s2">faculty are cowardly and probably so</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.790" end="00:03:10.020" style="s2">narrowly trained that they have</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.850" end="00:03:12.209" style="s2">convinced themselves that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.020" end="00:03:15.209" style="s2">themselves have the intellectual tools</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.209" end="00:03:18.120" style="s2">to assess what is going on when these</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.209" end="00:03:20.090" style="s2">little uprisings erupt as they do on</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.120" end="00:03:23.250" style="s2">most campuses to some degree that</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.090" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">strikes me as anti intellectual the idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.250" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">that oh that&#39;s you know this this phrase</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:29.790" style="s2">stay in your lane this is the most anti</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:31.380" style="s2">intellectual authoritarian phrase that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.790" end="00:03:33.930" style="s2">that&#39;s emerging right now stay in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.380" end="00:03:35.850" style="s2">lane what since when do I have a lane</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.930" end="00:03:37.170" style="s2">like okay I was I was trained in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.850" end="00:03:39.030" style="s2">number of different things as it turns</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.170" end="00:03:40.019" style="s2">out like I&#39;m apparently I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.030" end="00:03:41.489" style="s2">allowed to talk about classical music</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.019" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">because I was trained as a classical</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.489" end="00:03:45.510" style="s2">pianist but I don&#39;t I have very little</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:49.470" style="s2">interest in talking about that most days</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.510" end="00:03:52.200" style="s2">that&#39;s my lane and anything over in how</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.470" end="00:03:56.100" style="s2">society is erupting and falling apart is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.200" end="00:03:58.860" style="s2">not actually no like absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.100" end="00:04:01.230" style="s2">and in part and part I would say anyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.860" end="00:04:03.600" style="s2">who wants to be a broad thinker should</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.230" end="00:04:05.970" style="s2">be should feel entitled and is entitled</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.600" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">to speak and think in particular and any</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.970" end="00:04:10.830" style="s2">topic they want but and you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:13.170" style="s2">my distinct bias but I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.830" end="00:04:15.630" style="s2">warranted evolutionary tools</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.170" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">evolutionary thinking allow you access</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.630" end="00:04:20.040" style="s2">to thinking about just about anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:22.349" style="s2">with the exception of things like rocks</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.040" end="00:04:25.560" style="s2">and quirks alright rocks and quarks</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.349" end="00:04:27.840" style="s2">don&#39;t you know are not subject to</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.560" end="00:04:29.610" style="s2">the rules of evolution but otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.840" end="00:04:32.300" style="s2">everything else and pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.610" end="00:04:36.360" style="s2">everything that you&#39;ve got around here</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.300" end="00:04:38.730" style="s2">was created by humans or modified by</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.360" end="00:04:41.190" style="s2">humans for our purposes and we ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.730" end="00:04:45.120" style="s2">are evolved and we are you know we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.190" end="00:04:48.900" style="s2">these very strange generalists and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:52.230" style="s2">specialists who are also Apes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.900" end="00:04:54.210" style="s2">monkeys and primates and mammals and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.230" end="00:04:55.410" style="s2">know and reptiles and vertebrates and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.210" end="00:04:56.970" style="s2">all these things and there&#39;s truth in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.410" end="00:04:59.850" style="s2">each one of those layers and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.970" end="00:05:03.030" style="s2">that we&#39;re animals tells us for sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.850" end="00:05:04.680" style="s2">that we have that we are sexually</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.030" end="00:05:06.660" style="s2">reproducing and you know not all animals</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.680" end="00:05:08.340" style="s2">are but at their base animals are</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.660" end="00:05:11.310" style="s2">sexually reproducing we&#39;re sexual</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.340" end="00:05:13.020" style="s2">creatures that&#39;s what we are and when</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.310" end="00:05:15.390" style="s2">sex shows up in animals as it does</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.020" end="00:05:15.750" style="s2">across almost all of them there&#39;s two of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.390" end="00:05:19.590" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.750" end="00:05:21.750" style="s2">and so you know being able to talk from</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.590" end="00:05:23.630" style="s2">a scientific perspective and then go you</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.750" end="00:05:25.710" style="s2">know at one level narrow or narrower</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.630" end="00:05:27.960" style="s2">except once you get to humans then it</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.710" end="00:05:30.810" style="s2">explodes into this big thing again there</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.960" end="00:05:34.590" style="s2">is this there is a long history actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.810" end="00:05:37.080" style="s2">of the social sciences looking over at</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.590" end="00:05:39.479" style="s2">biology and going basically stay in your</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.080" end="00:05:41.789" style="s2">lane you can talk about chimps if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.479" end="00:05:43.320" style="s2">want to and bonobos and gorillas but</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.789" end="00:05:45.870" style="s2">that&#39;s it as soon as you get to humans</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.320" end="00:05:47.400" style="s2">you&#39;re not allowed and there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.870" end="00:05:51.630" style="s2">of us over an evolution space who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.400" end="00:05:53.039" style="s2">saying nope nope no way because only</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.630" end="00:05:54.500" style="s2">with the tools of evolution are you</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.039" end="00:05:56.460" style="s2">going to be able to more fully</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.500" end="00:05:57.930" style="s2">understand what it is that we are and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.460" end="00:06:00.270" style="s2">why we&#39;re why we&#39;re behaving the way we</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.930" end="00:06:01.350" style="s2">are and would you say that sex and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.270" end="00:06:03.930" style="s2">gender is at the core of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.350" end="00:06:05.700" style="s2">conversation I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.930" end="00:06:09.060" style="s2">the core but it&#39;s one of it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.700" end="00:06:11.850" style="s2">focal points for sure I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.060" end="00:06:14.729" style="s2">major confusions at least if I run into</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.850" end="00:06:16.530" style="s2">and maybe that maybe this is just more</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.729" end="00:06:18.690" style="s2">about the particular conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.530" end="00:06:20.580" style="s2">I&#39;m pulled into both because of my</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.690" end="00:06:24.270" style="s2">interests um because of what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.580" end="00:06:27.570" style="s2">speaking on but the confusion about sex</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.239" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">more possibility to do good in the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.309" end="00:07:50.059" style="s2">we were doing good with 25 or 50</p>

<p begin="00:07:50.059" end="00:07:56.709" style="s2">and that was amazing and through it we</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.389" end="00:07:59.059" style="s2">learned tools about engagement and</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.899" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">that evergreen was going off the rails</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.339" end="00:08:26.959" style="s2">in the way that it was and it refused to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:28.699" style="s2">be helped like it really actively</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.959" end="00:08:33.409" style="s2">refused to be helped we offered as many</p>

<p begin="00:08:33.409" end="00:08:37.909" style="s2">foolish of me to be anything but</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.930" end="00:08:41.870" style="s2">grateful for many aspects of this new</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.909" end="00:08:44.300" style="s2">life and one of the doors that has</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.870" end="00:08:47.179" style="s2">opened is the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.300" end="00:08:49.459" style="s2">which has a door that&#39;s a new metaphor</p>

<p begin="00:08:55.880" end="00:09:03.560" style="s2">the IDW as what&#39;s your frame for the</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.710" end="00:10:08.990" style="s2">may be somewhat less other a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.990" end="00:10:14.120" style="s2">interviewing and you know really having</p>

<p begin="00:11:46.390" end="00:11:50.920" style="s2">far back I can go in the logic tree and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.460" end="00:11:53.260" style="s2">see what basic assumption sits at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.920" end="00:11:55.060" style="s2">floor of that such that if I have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.260" end="00:11:58.210" style="s2">start questioning this thing here I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.060" end="00:12:00.580" style="s2">already done this backwards logic and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.210" end="00:12:01.870" style="s2">can as this starts to falter I can go</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.580" end="00:12:04.630" style="s2">back is this faltering - it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.870" end="00:12:06.610" style="s2">faltering and maybe it&#39;s the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.630" end="00:12:07.900" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s the basic fundamental</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.610" end="00:16:42.510" style="s2">body um in the 90s but it was somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.370" end="00:16:44.790" style="s2">diverse and I remember talking not at my</p>

<p begin="00:18:38.399" end="00:18:46.770" style="s2">in the IDW is this how I would say it is</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.929" end="00:19:03.570" style="s2">to be one-to-one just because the</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.289" end="00:19:11.880" style="s2">to be one-to-one because guess what on</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.600" end="00:19:14.520" style="s2">average men and women are different we</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.520" end="00:19:19.710" style="s2">just put that aside like there there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.370" end="00:19:21.270" style="s2">evidence in some regards and a you know</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.270" end="00:19:24.899" style="s2">so much but you know there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.890" end="00:19:27.510" style="s2">lot of varied stuff over in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.510" end="00:19:32.010" style="s2">have that are different you know women</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.520" end="00:19:33.539" style="s2">tend to be more about language and text</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.010" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">and men tend to be more about math and</p>

<p begin="00:20:20.669" end="00:20:25.590" style="s2">stood the test of time that actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.610" end="00:20:30.059" style="s2">women seem to prefer this kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.590" end="00:20:31.169" style="s2">less than men do and and that just that</p>

<p begin="00:20:31.169" end="00:20:43.140" style="s2">so I think that women on average</p>

<p begin="00:24:53.619" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">to the authoritarian right but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.100" end="00:25:04.659" style="s2">smaller group and pretty much pretty</p>

<p begin="00:25:34.509" end="00:25:46.570" style="s2">things are questions of sex and gender</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.369" end="00:25:49.480" style="s2">what sex is questions about religion and</p>

<p begin="00:29:11.620" end="00:29:18.700" style="s2">same a thing not the same thing because</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.710" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">a lot of these topics have become toxic</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.700" end="00:29:23.800" style="s2">on the left the only place because we</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:24.760" style="s2">can say well no one&#39;s talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.800" end="00:29:27.100" style="s2">no one&#39;s talking about this and then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.760" end="00:29:29.080" style="s2">you can look at the fact that these are</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.100" end="00:29:31.170" style="s2">being widely talked about on the right</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.080" end="00:29:33.490" style="s2">they&#39;ve been widely talked about online</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.170" end="00:29:35.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s not true that no one&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.490" end="00:29:38.290" style="s2">about them but the fact that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.080" end="00:29:41.440" style="s2">being talked about in the left in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.290" end="00:29:43.330" style="s2">media in these kinds of institutions is</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.440" end="00:29:44.710" style="s2">a big problem because suddenly the only</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.330" end="00:29:48.490" style="s2">people who are talking about not but are</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.710" end="00:29:49.960" style="s2">possibly people who don&#39;t have who may</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.490" end="00:29:52.480" style="s2">have some bigotry they&#39;re they&#39;re made</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.960" end="00:29:54.100" style="s2">the conversation may go toxic so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.480" end="00:29:58.480" style="s2">it&#39;s good to kind of define that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.100" end="00:30:01.600" style="s2">sometimes yeah so the right you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.480" end="00:30:03.400" style="s2">there are amazing numbers of good and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.600" end="00:30:06.160" style="s2">honorable and smart people on the right</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.400" end="00:30:07.810" style="s2">and I knew that I mean I I had friends</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.160" end="00:30:09.880" style="s2">on the right before this but I have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.810" end="00:30:13.420" style="s2">lot more now and I&#39;ve heard from a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.880" end="00:30:15.340" style="s2">more and the fact is that we both the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.420" end="00:30:17.080" style="s2">left should want a smart and educated</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.340" end="00:30:20.230" style="s2">right and the right should want a smart</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.080" end="00:30:25.720" style="s2">and educated left and and certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.230" end="00:30:30.340" style="s2">right hasn&#39;t had that for a while that</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.720" end="00:30:31.900" style="s2">said there are different ways to define</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.340" end="00:30:34.420" style="s2">what makes you a liberal versus a</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.900" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">conservative or left or right but one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.420" end="00:30:39.400" style="s2">the fundamental ways that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:41.620" style="s2">pretty standard to define the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.400" end="00:30:47.100" style="s2">differences is are you fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.620" end="00:30:49.510" style="s2">interested in regulation for either</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.100" end="00:30:52.390" style="s2">systems that are too big for individuals</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.510" end="00:30:53.330" style="s2">to regulate or to help people who have</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.390" end="00:30:56.030" style="s2">gotten the raw</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.330" end="00:30:58.040" style="s2">the stick if you are if you are if</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.030" end="00:31:01.210" style="s2">you&#39;re a pro regulation at some level</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.040" end="00:31:04.400" style="s2">then you&#39;re over in left space and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.210" end="00:31:05.900" style="s2">even imagining that we&#39;ve excluded that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.400" end="00:31:10.310" style="s2">tiny percentage of the right that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.900" end="00:31:11.990" style="s2">actually bigots and nasty and don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.310" end="00:31:13.630" style="s2">the best interest of all of humanity at</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.990" end="00:31:16.420" style="s2">heart and you take the remaining</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.630" end="00:31:18.710" style="s2">whatever it is 90 plus percent for sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.420" end="00:31:20.210" style="s2">the fact is we do disagree about real</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.710" end="00:31:24.500" style="s2">things right the left and the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.210" end="00:31:27.770" style="s2">disagree about the well first the level</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.500" end="00:31:29.600" style="s2">of actual inequality remaining in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.770" end="00:31:32.210" style="s2">world which is part of what the far left</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.600" end="00:31:34.340" style="s2">is screaming about but more to the point</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.210" end="00:31:35.750" style="s2">for right now left and right disagree on</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.340" end="00:31:39.520" style="s2">what we should do about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.750" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">and in general what the right has seen</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.520" end="00:31:46.970" style="s2">is boy do does the left not recognize</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:50.180" style="s2">unintended consequences of regulations</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.970" end="00:31:52.370" style="s2">and because we can&#39;t know we better just</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.180" end="00:31:54.380" style="s2">not let&#39;s just let&#39;s just let these</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.370" end="00:31:57.050" style="s2">systems go and the market will take care</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.380" end="00:31:59.270" style="s2">of it and people on the left are much</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.050" end="00:32:01.910" style="s2">more likely to say yes absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.270" end="00:32:03.470" style="s2">precautionary principle please but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.910" end="00:32:06.290" style="s2">gonna have to regulate some things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.470" end="00:32:09.500" style="s2">individual individuals and unregulated</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.290" end="00:32:11.930" style="s2">markets simply can&#39;t simply can&#39;t fix so</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.500" end="00:32:13.730" style="s2">you know we need we need all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.930" end="00:32:15.800" style="s2">reasonable people on both sides to try</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.730" end="00:32:17.600" style="s2">to shut down the bigots on their on</p>
