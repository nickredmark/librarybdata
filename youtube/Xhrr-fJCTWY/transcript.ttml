<p begin="00:01:39.810" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">what is your life purpose I think I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.670" end="00:01:54.149" style="s2">start with sharing a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:55.470" style="s2">how I think about that question the arc</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.149" end="00:01:58.110" style="s2">of how I&#39;ve thought about that question</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.470" end="00:02:01.110" style="s2">in my life which is probably going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.110" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">more relevant for people than what my</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.110" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">particular answer to the question</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:10.739" style="s2">happens to be as valuable as a question</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.409" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">as it is it&#39;s also a problematic one can</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.739" end="00:02:18.980" style="s2">be a problematic one so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:23.190" style="s2">a kid I didn&#39;t feel like I could</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.980" end="00:02:24.990" style="s2">actually make any choice without knowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.190" end="00:02:27.510" style="s2">that because I didn&#39;t have the context</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.990" end="00:02:29.520" style="s2">so the most trivial choices of what to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.510" end="00:02:32.040" style="s2">study or who to play with or what to pay</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.520" end="00:02:34.260" style="s2">attention to like well what is the what</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.040" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">is the ordinate us for choice for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.260" end="00:02:39.660" style="s2">what is it that I am making choices</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:41.670" style="s2">towards and why and so I needed to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:42.930" style="s2">a sense of the purpose of my life to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.670" end="00:02:44.790" style="s2">have a sense of the purpose of any</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.930" end="00:02:47.130" style="s2">decision to have a sense of a basis to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:48.810" style="s2">choose and then to have a sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.130" end="00:02:50.610" style="s2">purpose of my life I felt like I needed</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.810" end="00:02:53.250" style="s2">a sense of the purpose of life writ</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.610" end="00:02:55.050" style="s2">large to know what my life what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.250" end="00:02:57.900" style="s2">embedding function that my life was</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.050" end="00:03:00.570" style="s2">within and that usually looked like what</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.900" end="00:03:02.459" style="s2">is the purpose of human life within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.570" end="00:03:04.530" style="s2">whole and then even larger what about</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.459" end="00:03:06.510" style="s2">life a thing we call biologic life and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.530" end="00:03:08.370" style="s2">then even deeper what is the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.510" end="00:03:11.550" style="s2">reality at all of something rather than</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.370" end="00:03:15.420" style="s2">nothing and then of course we realized</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.550" end="00:03:17.160" style="s2">that even the question purpose imports a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.420" end="00:03:20.010" style="s2">whole bunch of concepts that may or may</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.160" end="00:03:25.080" style="s2">not be the right ones it purpose is an</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.010" end="00:03:26.549" style="s2">inherently utilitarian concept and so do</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.080" end="00:03:28.739" style="s2">I want to be asking what the purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.549" end="00:03:32.010" style="s2">do I want to be asking what the inherent</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.739" end="00:03:33.239" style="s2">value of life is what would I or what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.010" end="00:03:34.769" style="s2">value do I won&#39;t ask what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.239" end="00:03:36.269" style="s2">meaningfulness and the basis for</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.769" end="00:03:39.930" style="s2">meaningfulness is do I want to ask what</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.269" end="00:03:43.110" style="s2">the nature of it is so these are all non</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.930" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">sentence and all deep in terms of value</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.110" end="00:03:50.579" style="s2">meaning purpose and all deep questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:52.340" style="s2">and important ones we can also get in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.579" end="00:03:55.980" style="s2">trap when we start to think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.340" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">purpose in terms of doing exclusively</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.980" end="00:04:01.079" style="s2">and so very commonly people think what</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:03.480" style="s2">is the purpose of my life and they think</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.079" end="00:04:05.100" style="s2">that there is an answer in words that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.480" end="00:04:07.440" style="s2">relates to something that they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.100" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">to do so I&#39;m going to end extreme</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.440" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">poverty or prevent AI catastrophe or</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:17.790" style="s2">whatever it is and of course if that one</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:20.100" style="s2">doing is their purpose then every</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.790" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">opportunity to relieve suffering or add</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.100" end="00:04:24.840" style="s2">beauty other than that isn&#39;t part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:27.420" style="s2">their purpose and that means the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.840" end="00:04:29.100" style="s2">presence being present with and loving</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.420" end="00:04:31.260" style="s2">their family members isn&#39;t their purpose</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.100" end="00:04:32.490" style="s2">being present with opportunities that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.260" end="00:04:34.200" style="s2">present themselves that they could</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.490" end="00:04:37.170" style="s2">contribute to the piece of trash they</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.200" end="00:04:39.780" style="s2">walk by on the street and so we start to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.170" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">realize that one of the other challenges</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.780" end="00:04:44.370" style="s2">is as soon as I define it then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">outside nough something that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.370" end="00:04:49.920" style="s2">meaningful outside of that has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:52.230" style="s2">excluded from my sons of purpose right</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.920" end="00:04:54.060" style="s2">so then we start to say well there what</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.230" end="00:04:55.920" style="s2">is the purpose of my life not just at a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.060" end="00:04:58.430" style="s2">doing level but at a being level that</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.920" end="00:05:01.230" style="s2">all of the doing relates to and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.430" end="00:05:02.970" style="s2">obviously my best understanding of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.230" end="00:05:04.350" style="s2">now might also be quite different than</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.970" end="00:05:09.630" style="s2">my best understanding of it in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.350" end="00:05:11.640" style="s2">future so is is there is there an</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.630" end="00:05:17.340" style="s2">evolutionary process for how I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.640" end="00:05:19.890" style="s2">about this so with all that as preface</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.340" end="00:05:22.430" style="s2">I&#39;m obviously not going to address the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.890" end="00:05:25.740" style="s2">question comprehensively on this short</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.430" end="00:05:28.410" style="s2">conversation so I&#39;ll speak to a few</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.740" end="00:05:33.480" style="s2">things that are probably underneath a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.410" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">question I&#39;ll say a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.480" end="00:05:39.210" style="s2">about and I&#39;m gonna hold them as</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:40.680" style="s2">synonyms for now because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.210" end="00:05:43.230" style="s2">distinctions take more work</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.680" end="00:05:46.620" style="s2">philosophically and most people hold the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.230" end="00:05:48.840" style="s2">missing items so the purpose or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.620" end="00:05:51.330" style="s2">meaningfulness of life from a being and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.840" end="00:05:53.130" style="s2">a doing and a becoming perspective I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.330" end="00:05:57.000" style="s2">just say a little bit about this and how</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.130" end="00:05:58.650" style="s2">they fit together we can say that living</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.000" end="00:06:02.670" style="s2">a good life living a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.650" end="00:06:04.740" style="s2">purposeful life has different elements</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.670" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">to it and so I&#39;m gonna offer a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.740" end="00:06:08.790" style="s2">model here where there are at least that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:10.470" style="s2">will there are not at least there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.790" end="00:06:14.060" style="s2">three elements to living a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.470" end="00:06:20.270" style="s2">life that are distinct but all necessary</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.060" end="00:06:25.860" style="s2">so we can talk about the being mode in</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.270" end="00:06:28.200" style="s2">which one way of defining it is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.860" end="00:06:30.150" style="s2">purpose of life there is a to appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.200" end="00:06:33.300" style="s2">the beauty of existence as deeply as I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.150" end="00:06:37.130" style="s2">can to take it in to be moved by it to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.300" end="00:06:40.020" style="s2">experience at a depth that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.130" end="00:06:41.190" style="s2">purposefulness and the value of a piece</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.020" end="00:06:43.410" style="s2">of art</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.190" end="00:06:45.510" style="s2">requires it being appreciated there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.410" end="00:06:47.580" style="s2">the relationship between subject and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.510" end="00:06:49.860" style="s2">object that is neither subject nor</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.580" end="00:06:51.930" style="s2">object but but that triplicate the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.860" end="00:06:55.380" style="s2">relationship where the meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.930" end="00:06:57.540" style="s2">comes and so when I am taking in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.380" end="00:07:00.030" style="s2">beauty of reality reality is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.540" end="00:07:04.610" style="s2">more meaningful and the deeper that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.030" end="00:07:08.430" style="s2">taking it in right so we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.610" end="00:07:10.710" style="s2">purpose from the being point of view as</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.710" end="00:07:17.730" style="s2">present to reality as it is all the time</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.200" end="00:07:21.000" style="s2">and when we start to think about doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.730" end="00:07:23.430" style="s2">we can say that doing is about adding to</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.000" end="00:07:28.440" style="s2">the beauty of reality acting in ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.430" end="00:07:31.590" style="s2">that change reality with the hope with</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.440" end="00:07:33.420" style="s2">the intent to add to the beauty of it in</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.590" end="00:07:35.430" style="s2">ways that will increase the potential</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.420" end="00:07:37.470" style="s2">for the experience of beauty for others</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.430" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">right there will effect the beat of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.470" end="00:07:44.040" style="s2">others when I think about becoming I</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:46.830" style="s2">think about evolving my capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.040" end="00:07:48.570" style="s2">being in doing increasing my capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.830" end="00:07:51.930" style="s2">both appreciate and add to the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.570" end="00:07:57.510" style="s2">life and so I get that being doing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.930" end="00:07:59.490" style="s2">becoming are all meaningful and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.510" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">all meaningful only in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.490" end="00:08:03.810" style="s2">each other the doing adding to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:05.400" style="s2">beauty of life that&#39;s all anyone did and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.810" end="00:08:09.900" style="s2">no one actually appreciated it would</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.400" end="00:08:13.380" style="s2">ultimately be baseless etc right so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.900" end="00:08:17.300" style="s2">can see how those are those are bound</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.380" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">concepts we can think about the being as</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.300" end="00:08:24.330" style="s2">related to our relationship to reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:27.060" style="s2">on the perceptual side and doing on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.330" end="00:08:29.550" style="s2">expressive side we can see the whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.060" end="00:08:31.500" style="s2">thing as our relationship to life with a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.550" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">capital L or reality with a capital R</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.500" end="00:08:42.500" style="s2">and so then you know I just speak about</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:46.230" style="s2">it again in a broad way I can say my</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.500" end="00:08:52.010" style="s2">purpose is going to be expressed each</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.230" end="00:08:54.740" style="s2">moment in terms of how much presence and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.010" end="00:08:57.980" style="s2">love and integrity I can show</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.740" end="00:08:59.990" style="s2">to life and whatever aspect of life</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.980" end="00:09:03.320" style="s2">happens to be in front of me each moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.990" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">and across the arc of my life and so if</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.320" end="00:09:06.050" style="s2">I have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:07.940" style="s2">about what I should be doing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.050" end="00:09:10.250" style="s2">actually makes me less present with</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.940" end="00:09:13.670" style="s2">what&#39;s in front of me and less available</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.250" end="00:09:18.260" style="s2">to appreciate and serve what&#39;s in front</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.670" end="00:09:20.510" style="s2">of me that can be a problem now not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.260" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">the moments of life but also the arc of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.510" end="00:09:27.830" style="s2">life I want to see how full is my</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:29.660" style="s2">relationship with reality moment by</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.830" end="00:09:32.660" style="s2">moment and also across the whole arc of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.660" end="00:09:34.490" style="s2">my life how relevant was it to what was</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.660" end="00:09:42.830" style="s2">needed for the whole of life during that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.490" end="00:09:44.080" style="s2">time so these are all interesting and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.830" end="00:09:47.270" style="s2">think generally applicable</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.080" end="00:09:50.690" style="s2">considerations for everyone if we want</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.270" end="00:09:57.770" style="s2">to talk about the doing side for me as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.690" end="00:09:59.810" style="s2">specific person well it&#39;s different in</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.770" end="00:10:01.640" style="s2">this particular time in the world than</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.810" end="00:10:02.930" style="s2">it would have been in the past or in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.640" end="00:10:05.060" style="s2">future because different things are</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.930" end="00:10:06.410" style="s2">needed and I have different capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.060" end="00:10:08.329" style="s2">than I would have had in those</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.410" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">developmental environments etc and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.329" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s different here than if I</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:16.579" style="s2">was growing up in the Peruvian</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:18.290" style="s2">rainforest and so what mine is is not</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.579" end="00:10:20.329" style="s2">going to be what anyone else&#39;s is in</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.290" end="00:10:21.980" style="s2">that way right so it&#39;s there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.329" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">generalized things which we spoke about</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.980" end="00:10:25.660" style="s2">and then there&#39;s also the unique</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:30.649" style="s2">expression of those generalized things</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.660" end="00:10:34.100" style="s2">so having the orientation to think about</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.649" end="00:10:40.370" style="s2">systems and complex systems that my life</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.100" end="00:10:46.660" style="s2">brought that orientation to me and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.370" end="00:10:50.980" style="s2">various other capacities orientations</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.660" end="00:10:53.510" style="s2">doing what I can to help transition</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.980" end="00:10:57.829" style="s2">civilization from being on a path that</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.510" end="00:11:01.010" style="s2">is currently self terminating to a path</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.829" end="00:11:04.699" style="s2">that is not self terminating and that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.010" end="00:11:07.220" style="s2">as supportive of the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.699" end="00:11:11.269" style="s2">purpose and meaning for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.220" end="00:11:13.579" style="s2">enduringly into the future and working</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.269" end="00:11:18.620" style="s2">on changing the underlying structural</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.579" end="00:11:20.750" style="s2">dynamics that help make that possible is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.620" end="00:11:27.860" style="s2">what we could say my main sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.750" end="00:11:31.959" style="s2">purpose that are doing level is so if</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.860" end="00:11:35.920" style="s2">you think about your you&#39;re doing level</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.959" end="00:11:37.970" style="s2">do you have goals for the year 2050 of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.920" end="00:11:49.519" style="s2">what do you want to change in the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.970" end="00:11:57.470" style="s2">by then so 2050 is just over 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.519" end="00:12:01.699" style="s2">from now what I would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.470" end="00:12:05.740" style="s2">different in the world by them is first</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.699" end="00:12:08.810" style="s2">I think it weren&#39;t saying that there are</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.740" end="00:12:11.809" style="s2">existential risks risks of us continuing</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.810" end="00:12:13.730" style="s2">to exist or not that could play out in</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.809" end="00:12:17.750" style="s2">less time than that so it is not a given</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.730" end="00:12:19.850" style="s2">currently that we make it to 2050 this</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.750" end="00:12:22.519" style="s2">is an important part of framing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.850" end="00:12:24.500" style="s2">question there are other existential</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.519" end="00:12:26.959" style="s2">risks and catastrophic not necessary</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.500" end="00:12:31.189" style="s2">fully existential but civilization</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.959" end="00:12:32.629" style="s2">collapse type risks that even there are</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.189" end="00:12:33.949" style="s2">some that could actually play out in</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.629" end="00:12:35.449" style="s2">that time there are other ones that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.949" end="00:12:37.459" style="s2">might not play out in that time but we</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.449" end="00:12:39.379" style="s2">pass critical tipping points where they</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.459" end="00:12:42.680" style="s2">will inevitably play out after that time</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.379" end="00:12:46.879" style="s2">during that time so one thing by 2050 is</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.680" end="00:12:48.529" style="s2">I want us to not have experienced</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.879" end="00:12:51.620" style="s2">civilization collapse or existential</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.529" end="00:12:55.490" style="s2">risk and I also want us to not have past</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.620" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">tipping points that are irreversible</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.490" end="00:13:06.350" style="s2">towards catastrophic or existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:10.579" style="s2">and to speak even more broadly than I</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.350" end="00:13:13.819" style="s2">would say I want by 2050 that we that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.579" end="00:13:16.370" style="s2">there is a change in the vector and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.819" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">change in the overall trajectory of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.370" end="00:13:21.279" style="s2">path that civilization is on from one</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">that is heading</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.279" end="00:13:24.970" style="s2">towards many different</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:27.639" style="s2">self-determination scenarios where they</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.970" end="00:13:29.769" style="s2">were talking about the a hundred</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.769" end="00:13:32.649" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about world war three or</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.389" end="00:13:35.529" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about climate change</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.249" end="00:14:08.230" style="s2">onto a path that is developing all of</p>

<p begin="00:14:14.230" end="00:14:20.589" style="s2">speak to some pretty specific things</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.660" end="00:15:13.870" style="s2">specifically this requires new economics</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.110" end="00:15:17.559" style="s2">new governance new law new jurisprudence</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.870" end="00:15:19.809" style="s2">and philosophy as a basis of law new</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.730" end="00:19:39.590" style="s2">has all collapsed and but now we have a</p>

<p begin="00:19:39.590" end="00:19:45.200" style="s2">collapse is actually catastrophic and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.919" end="00:19:47.450" style="s2">when Rome fell it was a lot but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.200" end="00:19:49.490" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the whole world right when the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.450" end="00:19:51.320" style="s2">Mayans fell the Inca fell Mesopotamia</p>

<p begin="00:20:18.100" end="00:20:22.060" style="s2">because creating an anti reverse</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.720" end="00:20:24.640" style="s2">environment doesn&#39;t only prevent X risk</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.450" end="00:22:21.800" style="s2">supported by the tragedy of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.430" end="00:22:24.730" style="s2">rest of the thing right so until we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.800" end="00:22:26.420" style="s2">actually get a high-tech closed-loop</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.730" end="00:22:29.480" style="s2">civilization that does not require</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.420" end="00:22:31.160" style="s2">import that is actually more adaptive in</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.480" end="00:22:32.840" style="s2">the previous civilization we haven&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.160" end="00:22:38.170" style="s2">shown we can do that thing that happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.840" end="00:22:40.010" style="s2">at the scale of a high-tech city-state</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.170" end="00:22:42.500" style="s2">city-state meaning it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.010" end="00:22:44.270" style="s2">sovereign in law city meaning that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.500" end="00:22:46.220" style="s2">minimum kind of scale of</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.270" end="00:22:49.430" style="s2">self-organization that could actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.220" end="00:22:55.460" style="s2">produce all the ton needs so by 2050 I</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.430" end="00:22:57.740" style="s2">want to see a fully operating city-state</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.460" end="00:22:59.690" style="s2">new civilization model that is anti</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.740" end="00:23:01.370" style="s2">rival risks that has the right</p>

<p begin="00:23:06.890" end="00:23:13.460" style="s2">having men operating long enough and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.220" end="00:23:15.650" style="s2">well enough that the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.460" end="00:23:17.360" style="s2">is already starting to move in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.650" end="00:23:21.230" style="s2">direction that it is setting an example</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.360" end="00:23:29.510" style="s2">of and that means also off of the ex</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.230" end="00:23:32.540" style="s2">risk path so if you think about the 2050</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.510" end="00:23:37.190" style="s2">the full-stack prototype of the the city</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.540" end="00:23:40.040" style="s2">of the new civilization model maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.190" end="00:23:42.080" style="s2">can give us like a brief overview of how</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.040" end="00:23:44.440" style="s2">are you going to make that happen like</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.080" end="00:23:48.670" style="s2">what are you working on right now to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.440" end="00:23:48.670" style="s2">move civilization in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.090" end="00:23:55.270" style="s2">well what I&#39;m working on right now with</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.180" end="00:24:01.430" style="s2">a number of other people that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.270" end="00:24:04.040" style="s2">endeavoring similarly is what we started</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.430" end="00:24:06.830" style="s2">with is really inventory all of those</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.040" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">risks in areas catastrophic existential</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.830" end="00:24:11.150" style="s2">risks and then looking at what the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:14.150" style="s2">common generator functions is drive all</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.150" end="00:24:15.650" style="s2">of them are at a deep level and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.150" end="00:24:17.780" style="s2">looking at what would a categorical</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.650" end="00:24:19.820" style="s2">solution to that generator function be</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.780" end="00:24:21.110" style="s2">because whether I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.820" end="00:24:22.730" style="s2">depletion of phosphorous or the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.110" end="00:24:24.230" style="s2">depletion of nitrogen or the depletion</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.910" end="00:24:28.190" style="s2">those are all the police</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.870" end="00:24:29.930" style="s2">dynamics that are driven by certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.190" end="00:24:32.660" style="s2">things whether I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.930" end="00:24:34.850" style="s2">the excess of co2 or the excess of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.660" end="00:24:36.290" style="s2">nitrogen runoff in dead zones or the</p>

<p begin="00:24:38.090" end="00:24:41.150" style="s2">have something in common whether I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.470" end="00:24:43.040" style="s2">talking about this type of war scenario</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.150" end="00:24:44.390" style="s2">or that type of war scenario or is type</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.040" end="00:24:46.160" style="s2">of terrorism scenario they all have</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.390" end="00:24:48.230" style="s2">certain types of things in common we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.160" end="00:24:49.760" style="s2">go to deeper levels of assessment as to</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.230" end="00:24:52.910" style="s2">what the generator functions are and</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:54.650" style="s2">then say if I try to solve one of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.910" end="00:24:58.520" style="s2">but all the other ones are still on</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.650" end="00:25:00.140" style="s2">course at most I maybe move the curve of</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.520" end="00:25:02.390" style="s2">like giving us a few more months you</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.140" end="00:25:03.679" style="s2">know maybe a couple more years unless</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.390" end="00:25:04.970" style="s2">the one I&#39;m doing wasn&#39;t actually the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.679" end="00:25:07.820" style="s2">first one that hit so much case it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.970" end="00:25:09.260" style="s2">kind of worthless so given that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.820" end="00:25:12.440" style="s2">generator functions have so many</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.260" end="00:25:15.500" style="s2">different expressions unless we solve</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.440" end="00:25:18.830" style="s2">them at that level we we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.500" end="00:25:21.080" style="s2">move we don&#39;t really change the future</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.830" end="00:25:23.570" style="s2">possibility state that much so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.080" end="00:25:25.490" style="s2">been looking at being able to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.570" end="00:25:28.460" style="s2">the generator functions in ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.490" end="00:25:30.770" style="s2">can show our complete meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.460" end="00:25:32.630" style="s2">solutions there are not only necessary</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.770" end="00:25:38.210" style="s2">for civilization making it but also</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.630" end="00:25:43.850" style="s2">sufficient and then actually developing</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.210" end="00:25:46.520" style="s2">architectures for viable solutions to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.850" end="00:25:48.559" style="s2">those which means how how would an</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.520" end="00:25:50.330" style="s2">economic system a governance system a</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.559" end="00:25:52.160" style="s2">legal system and infrastructural system</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.330" end="00:25:54.050" style="s2">etc work that didn&#39;t do those things</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.160" end="00:25:56.210" style="s2">right that generated fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.050" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">different types of behaviour so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.210" end="00:26:00.080" style="s2">been been working basically on this</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:03.500" style="s2">level of understanding the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:05.870" style="s2">problem well enough and then being able</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.500" end="00:26:07.460" style="s2">to characterize design criteria of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.870" end="00:26:10.040" style="s2">solution and then starting to develop</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.460" end="00:26:12.620" style="s2">actual instantiations of solutions that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.040" end="00:26:14.720" style="s2">meet those design criteria next is</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.620" end="00:26:16.670" style="s2">starting to prototype then starting to</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.720" end="00:26:18.620" style="s2">prototype governance methods we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.670" end="00:26:20.290" style="s2">developed to see that they do what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.620" end="00:26:23.120" style="s2">think they will and we&#39;ll find them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.290" end="00:26:28.130" style="s2">then you know before we can build a city</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.120" end="00:26:29.809" style="s2">state since it has an economic system</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.130" end="00:26:31.460" style="s2">that isn&#39;t any economic system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.809" end="00:26:32.630" style="s2">ever been there&#39;s nobody trained and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.460" end="00:26:35.240" style="s2">things that they will need to be trained</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.630" end="00:26:37.000" style="s2">for how to administer it since it would</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.240" end="00:26:39.560" style="s2">have a governance system etc the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.000" end="00:26:40.470" style="s2">politicians and lawyers and judges and</p>

<p begin="00:26:40.470" end="00:26:45.059" style="s2">world would have nothing to do in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.179" end="00:26:47.909" style="s2">world and the corresponding functions</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.059" end="00:26:49.049" style="s2">don&#39;t yet exist fever into their that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.909" end="00:26:51.330" style="s2">people aren&#39;t trained on them so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.049" end="00:26:52.590" style="s2">a whole new civics right there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.330" end="00:26:53.820" style="s2">new set of stuff that people have to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.590" end="00:26:55.950" style="s2">trained there&#39;s a whole new process to</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.820" end="00:26:57.720" style="s2">technology design for how to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.950" end="00:27:02.429" style="s2">technology that doesn&#39;t cause toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.720" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">issues as you know an externality so</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.429" end="00:27:06.870" style="s2">that means that we have to have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">people working on components of it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.870" end="00:27:11.250" style="s2">getting trained in those components who</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:14.940" style="s2">will then be able to help build the city</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.250" end="00:27:20.039" style="s2">state scale and populate it you know to</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.940" end="00:27:21.539" style="s2">begin with and that is it it&#39;s deep</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.039" end="00:27:23.220" style="s2">enough training that lettle have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.539" end="00:27:26.429" style="s2">happen in immersive environments which</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.220" end="00:27:28.140" style="s2">means communities villages you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.429" end="00:27:32.580" style="s2">places where people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.140" end="00:27:35.940" style="s2">together working on training in these</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.580" end="00:27:38.610" style="s2">new skills and capacities that will then</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.940" end="00:27:40.340" style="s2">be able to boot and those will be not</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.610" end="00:27:43.020" style="s2">closed-loop they&#39;ll still require</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.340" end="00:27:47.549" style="s2">getting on a Boeing to fly somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.020" end="00:27:48.750" style="s2">buying a computer from Apple but but</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.549" end="00:27:50.309" style="s2">they will be developing some of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.750" end="00:27:51.809" style="s2">capacities necessary to build a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.309" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">civilization with that along the curve</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.809" end="00:27:59.100" style="s2">so we&#39;re working on kind of as best as</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:01.799" style="s2">we can the full articulation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.100" end="00:28:04.070" style="s2">description of the design criteria that</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.799" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">are necessary so that other people can</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.070" end="00:28:08.610" style="s2">can play with those ideas also and see</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:10.230" style="s2">if those design criteria makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.610" end="00:28:12.059" style="s2">them if they agree with our analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.230" end="00:28:14.909" style="s2">then also work on those things</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.059" end="00:28:18.059" style="s2">independently and then start to work on</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.909" end="00:28:21.059" style="s2">instantiate and then evolving the scale</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.059" end="00:28:26.039" style="s2">of them towards full-scale prototype and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.059" end="00:28:30.330" style="s2">then you know spread of that prototype</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.039" end="00:28:32.760" style="s2">that prototype has to be not only right</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.330" end="00:28:34.260" style="s2">in kind meaning that it is solved the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.760" end="00:28:36.570" style="s2">generator functions but it also has to</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.260" end="00:28:37.799" style="s2">be anti fragile in the presence of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.570" end="00:28:40.350" style="s2">fact that the rest of the world was</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.799" end="00:28:42.210" style="s2">still rival risk and this is a new</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.350" end="00:28:44.789" style="s2">system and it also has to be out of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.210" end="00:28:49.530" style="s2">poetic meaning it has to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.789" end="00:28:51.210" style="s2">expand and propagate itself so those are</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.530" end="00:28:54.070" style="s2">all parts of the design criteria so</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.210" end="00:28:58.510" style="s2">those are those are some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.070" end="00:29:05.590" style="s2">that I&#39;m working on now towards those</p>
