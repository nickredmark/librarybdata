<p begin="00:00:00.680" end="00:00:08.670" style="s2">today we are gonna talk about privilege</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.620" end="00:00:11.880" style="s2">and it is a concept I have looked into</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.670" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">him familiar with and I get it and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.880" end="00:00:16.049" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s helping us and I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:19.710" style="s2">this morning I tapped into why it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.049" end="00:00:23.820" style="s2">helping us and when I think of my areas</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.710" end="00:00:25.080" style="s2">where I have privilege and when I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.820" end="00:00:27.210" style="s2">of the areas where I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.080" end="00:00:29.760" style="s2">privilege and I think of all those other</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.210" end="00:00:31.859" style="s2">people who have privilege part of what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.760" end="00:00:34.020" style="s2">want to do is obtain some of their</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.859" end="00:00:36.180" style="s2">privilege it&#39;s like they&#39;re rich and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.020" end="00:00:38.010" style="s2">poor I want to go up to like the white</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.180" end="00:00:39.629" style="s2">sis able-bodied man and be like please</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.010" end="00:00:41.790" style="s2">so can I just have a little bit of your</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.629" end="00:00:44.730" style="s2">privilege just a little bit and they</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.790" end="00:00:46.739" style="s2">can&#39;t because it&#39;s not transferable even</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.730" end="00:00:51.059" style="s2">if they wanted to they can&#39;t transfer it</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.739" end="00:00:54.149" style="s2">and so we&#39;re asking all of these people</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.059" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">to acknowledge their privilege when</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:00:59.719" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing they can really do about</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:01:03.570" style="s2">it and I think there&#39;s a better analogy</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.719" end="00:01:05.250" style="s2">that actually puts us in power actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.570" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">gives us our own individual empowerment</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.250" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">and that isn&#39;t that we&#39;re walking around</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:11.299" style="s2">with buckets of privilege that people</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:14.280" style="s2">couldn&#39;t yet not transferable in any way</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.299" end="00:01:15.780" style="s2">but instead we&#39;re every single person on</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.280" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">this planet is walking around with their</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.780" end="00:01:20.119" style="s2">own container of trauma and they&#39;re full</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:23.130" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.119" end="00:01:24.299" style="s2">so the Karan&#39;s of the world have their</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.130" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">little teacup of trauma</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.299" end="00:01:31.110" style="s2">oh no can we meet the country club</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:33.090" style="s2">requirements this book oh no that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.110" end="00:01:35.520" style="s2">like it&#39;s laughable to me that might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.090" end="00:01:37.650" style="s2">their trauma but it&#39;s theirs it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:41.509" style="s2">central in their life and they&#39;re full</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.650" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">up of trauma they cannot take on anymore</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.509" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">whereas other people are walking around</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:50.820" style="s2">with big huge buckets of trauma they</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">have poverty and intergenerational stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.820" end="00:01:55.020" style="s2">they have their they have racism and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">sexism and ableism being thrown at them</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.020" end="00:01:58.729" style="s2">constantly</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2">they have big huge buckets of trauma</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.729" end="00:02:05.250" style="s2">there&#39;s nowhere to pour their trauma</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.229" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">because everyone&#39;s full up and as they</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.250" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">look it&#39;s like spilling everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:09.300" style="s2">they got a bigger bucket so it&#39;s having</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:11.620" style="s2">more of an impact</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.300" end="00:02:14.290" style="s2">Caryn&#39;s are like I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.620" end="00:02:17.830" style="s2">such a mess my little teacup never</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.290" end="00:02:23.379" style="s2">really makes a mess but the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.830" end="00:02:24.370" style="s2">part of this analogy so in this world we</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.379" end="00:02:27.250" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to deal with their own</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.370" end="00:02:29.470" style="s2">trauma even though there&#39;s nothing more</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.250" end="00:02:31.510" style="s2">beneficial to your own life than healing</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.470" end="00:02:33.970" style="s2">with your own trauma sitting with your</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.510" end="00:02:36.159" style="s2">own shadow and healing it and loving it</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.970" end="00:02:38.290" style="s2">is never gonna be like the payoff for</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.159" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">math there&#39;s nothing greater and yet we</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.290" end="00:02:42.459" style="s2">still don&#39;t do it and yet what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">asking it&#39;s someone we&#39;ve labeled as</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.459" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">fragile to take on more they can&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:50.890" style="s2">can&#39;t handle their own trauma let alone</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:54.190" style="s2">your huge bucket of trauma but what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.890" end="00:02:56.980" style="s2">can do as an individual no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.190" end="00:02:59.560" style="s2">big or small my bucket is to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.980" end="00:03:01.569" style="s2">I have a bucket of Charma heal it to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.560" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">give myself any amount of capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.569" end="00:03:04.959" style="s2">offer to take on somebody else&#39;s how can</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:08.019" style="s2">I lighten your load</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.959" end="00:03:09.819" style="s2">how can I help you but I can&#39;t demand</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.019" end="00:03:12.069" style="s2">anyone else do that and take off my</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.819" end="00:03:13.810" style="s2">trauma take on my drama they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.069" end="00:03:17.019" style="s2">they&#39;re not capable they&#39;re full up of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.810" end="00:03:21.190" style="s2">their own and the beautiful thing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.019" end="00:03:23.590" style="s2">that people with the larger your trauma</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.190" end="00:03:26.230" style="s2">bucket is and the more healing you do</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.590" end="00:03:28.660" style="s2">the more capacity you have to heal this</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.230" end="00:03:30.609" style="s2">world the Karan&#39;s of the world with</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.660" end="00:03:34.750" style="s2">their tiny little little teacup of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.609" end="00:03:37.359" style="s2">trauma even if they fully healed which</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.750" end="00:03:40.389" style="s2">is impossible even if they fully healed</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.359" end="00:03:42.669" style="s2">they have a tiny little capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.389" end="00:03:49.660" style="s2">your trauma and that&#39;s if they&#39;re fully</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.669" end="00:03:52.660" style="s2">healed and so we&#39;ve labeled especially</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.660" end="00:03:54.760" style="s2">white Karan&#39;s as white fragility and yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.660" end="00:03:56.590" style="s2">we&#39;re asking them to take on more how</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.760" end="00:03:58.870" style="s2">can we label something as fragile and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.590" end="00:04:00.129" style="s2">ask it to bear more weight and not see</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.870" end="00:04:01.780" style="s2">that that would absolutely crush it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.129" end="00:04:03.430" style="s2">because there is a truth than that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.780" end="00:04:06.069" style="s2">there&#39;s a truth that they&#39;re little</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.069" end="00:04:12.010" style="s2">take on any more but we can we can heal</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.790" end="00:04:14.230" style="s2">ourselves and we can offer the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.010" end="00:04:17.650" style="s2">resiliency to heal each other and when</p>
