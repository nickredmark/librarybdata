<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:20.800" style="s2">conceptual work</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.800" end="00:02:24.239" style="s2">and then we compress it down so that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.800" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">can experience some of it within</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.239" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">four short sessions um each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">sessions obviously could</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">support and anchor workshops we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.800" end="00:02:37.280" style="s2">workshop this so</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">each session could be six hour workshop</p>

<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">videos again</p>

<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:13.959" style="s2">have conversations around some of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.599" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">stuff because these are just</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.959" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">provocations of what you might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:20.239" style="s2">talking about or thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">or insights that you could have and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.239" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">those could be you know happen help</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">elsewhere so we really want to encourage</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:30.319" style="s2">you to take advantage of the material</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">itself and bring it into community</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.319" end="00:03:33.680" style="s2">and bring it into a larger conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:39.519" style="s2">um yeah so if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">if some of you are here and you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.519" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">uh watch the video from last time or</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">weren&#39;t here last time unfortunately you</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:50.319" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">quite lost because in the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.319" end="00:03:54.640" style="s2">series</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">they build on each other right so um a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.640" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">lot was covered</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">in the in the first session it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">mean you can&#39;t enjoy what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t really stand on its own</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:09.519" style="s2">if you&#39;re in this position come to it</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">with a much more imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.519" end="00:04:16.480" style="s2">orientation and with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:16.480" style="s2">i think we shall begin</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:21.280" style="s2">where am i</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.840" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">oops</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">okay so this is part two of the hollow</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">the hollow is a place where we come to</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">talk about secret things perhaps things</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:41.199" style="s2">that are just on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">tips of our imagination we also we must</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.199" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:47.199" style="s2">that this is designed as dispatches from</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">a time in between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.199" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">they&#39;re just little vignettes of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to deal with they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">half-born thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.080" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">so each slide kind of rhymes with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">other slide but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">doesn&#39;t build itself conceptually after</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">we do the presentation</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:04.639" style="s2">then we&#39;ll get into some of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">conceptual territory according to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.639" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">uh where you want to go with your</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">questions or we could just augment it</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.160" end="00:05:14.720" style="s2">into more imaginaries</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">all right so we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.720" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">look at three metaphysical primes of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:21.759" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:23.759" style="s2">um time change and causality so um</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.759" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">today we&#39;re going to look specifically</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.759" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">at time</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.919" end="00:05:33.120" style="s2">and why we&#39;re looking at these</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">is because they capture our ability</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">to think about reality to think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">our challenges to think about who we</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">are they reduce our imagination</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:45.520" style="s2">to the forms of time change and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">causality</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">that modernity offers so we want to try</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">to look at these from a different place</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">so in these presentations we&#39;ll all</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">we&#39;ll look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:57.520" style="s2">what modernity offers and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">look at some</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">alternatives but there are only one</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">alternative or two alternatives the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:07.199" style="s2">the real exercises here is can you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">insights into a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.199" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.319" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">to time than what modernity offers and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:15.919" style="s2">can you</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">start practicing not falling into</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.919" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">the limited mental models of time</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:24.160" style="s2">change and causality of modernity so we</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:27.600" style="s2">will be presenting some alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.160" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">but they&#39;re not the only alternatives um</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.600" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">so just be aware of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:37.039" style="s2">all right so um in</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">uh gesture talked a lot about this that</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.039" end="00:06:39.440" style="s2">the</p>

<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">which is um quite um impressive</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">really is so this is a gift of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:17.840" style="s2">is we get to have these wonderful maps</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:21.039" style="s2">about for example the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.840" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">um the evolution of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.039" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">so just take a moment and look at what</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.919" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.319" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">have discerned about</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">our universe from 13</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">galactic ages ago and this will go</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">all the way from the present from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:43.200" style="s2">past to the present and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">speculate into the future so we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.200" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">timeline it ticks away</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:54.880" style="s2">one of the things to notice is that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:57.839" style="s2">starts with geological processes</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.880" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">and then starts to move into geo and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.839" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">biological processes so</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a continuity here between the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.160" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">geologic and the biologic</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">so this is a very modern way to think of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s been going on</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">and just let yourself enter this deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">and instead of thinking of this as the</p>

<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">everything that&#39;s exists today</p>

<p begin="00:10:59.839" end="00:11:03.680" style="s2">so what does it take to be a u</p>

<p begin="00:11:47.760" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">and you see extinctions events of 75</p>

<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:12:11.839" style="s2">of species extinctions</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">so one of the mistakes we make as</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">moderns when we look at a timeline like</p>

<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:28.079" style="s2">just shown up and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">another way to look at this is is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.079" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">everything that exists now</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:37.279" style="s2">is just more of what has been happening</p>

<p begin="00:14:37.279" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">show up</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.079" end="00:14:44.959" style="s2">you&#39;re not possible without all these</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:47.680" style="s2">other aspects</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.959" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">of evolution and cosmology also</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">they didn&#39;t happen in the past the stars</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">are still burning the sun is still</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:59.279" style="s2">um living out its lifespan the earth is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">still moving the plates are still moving</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.279" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">the climate is still changing</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">all of this preamble to you</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:13.600" style="s2">is also present today</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:15.680" style="s2">it&#39;s all simultaneously dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.600" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">so the timeline is really cool because</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.680" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">it gives us this understanding of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:19.760" style="s2">events but it makes it seem like</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:23.440" style="s2">something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.760" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">done and over with but the geology is</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.440" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">done and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:30.079" style="s2">life and the animals are done and now</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.839" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">everything of importance happens on our</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.360" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">it&#39;s always the whole that is evolving</p>

<p begin="00:15:43.440" end="00:15:47.680" style="s2">painting of time and the big difference</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.680" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">so this is represents you could say it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:51.920" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">this represents the past this represents</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">the future you notice the placement</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:16:00.240" style="s2">the futures in the ground emerging like</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">and the difference here is that the</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">is not suspended between the past and</p>

<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">but anchored by the past and the future</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.880" end="00:16:20.560" style="s2">that the past and futures implicate in</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">the position that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.560" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">that the individual holds right now</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">right between being suspended</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">the past is gone the future has not yet</p>

<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:34.839" style="s2">versus everything that&#39;s been before and</p>

<p begin="00:16:34.839" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">composes me in the presence now</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">it anchors me in where i am</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:46.959" style="s2">do you see that can you feel the</p>

<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">and this is actually psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:23.039" style="s2">quite unhealthy</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">because we never quite leave and we</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.039" end="00:17:27.120" style="s2">never quite get there</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:30.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of suspension and not a</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.120" end="00:17:30.160" style="s2">sense of belonging</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:38.080" style="s2">and even the future as it orients itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.760" end="00:17:40.880" style="s2">is implicit in where we are right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.080" end="00:17:41.440" style="s2">so this notion of this this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">living</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.440" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">wholeness between</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:48.160" style="s2">quote unquote the events of the past</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:50.799" style="s2">that which</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.160" end="00:17:51.360" style="s2">is actually doesn&#39;t make sense and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.799" end="00:17:54.559" style="s2">events</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.360" end="00:17:57.840" style="s2">of the future so</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.559" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">um this is like i said it&#39;s a modern</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.840" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">painting but you can really see the</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:09.120" style="s2">difference between</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">being suspended in time versus being</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.120" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">anchored</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.760" end="00:18:17.200" style="s2">by time by the profound simultaneity</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:20.559" style="s2">of the dynamic processes of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.200" end="00:18:22.799" style="s2">or and cosmogenesis</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.559" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">we have those two terms cosmogenesis and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.799" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">evolution because we also make a gap</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:27.600" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">la you know living and non-living so all</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:33.039" style="s2">these all these categories we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:33.039" style="s2">create gaps</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">another way to look at it the way the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">greeks uh the greeks</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:45.360" style="s2">thoughts uh there was something</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.760" end="00:18:47.520" style="s2">something funny about time</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">and you can see you can feel how this</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.520" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">still leads to modernity</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:55.280" style="s2">they had three words uh for a time</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">uh most people know the first two cronus</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.280" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:19:02.320" style="s2">passage of time um</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s represented here in these</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.320" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">depictions</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:09.039" style="s2">as kind of a burden the tree is old</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.240" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">it&#39;s been burdened by time all these</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.039" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">kind of uh time burdens</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:19.039" style="s2">then there was cairo&#39;s and kairos is</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:22.799" style="s2">a has the quality of being</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.039" end="00:19:26.080" style="s2">saturated with resonance so it&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.799" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">of being playful or opportune time</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.080" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">um but there&#39;s still something you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">there&#39;s still um</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:33.919" style="s2">there&#39;s still this kind of specter of</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:37.039" style="s2">death here</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.919" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">um and so that&#39;s a depiction by this</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.039" end="00:19:42.240" style="s2">artist of cairo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:43.200" style="s2">then there&#39;s a third meaning of time</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.200" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">called chinos and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">kainos um is a word that i learned from</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">donna haraway</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">and she translates it as now a time of</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">beginnings a time for</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">ongoing so she says nothing in kindness</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">must mean conventional past presence or</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">it&#39;s full of inheritance remembering</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2">comings nurturing</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">and so this notion of this this being</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">composed by and anchored in</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">time versus um</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">versus being suspended between time so</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:25.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a progression here</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:27.679" style="s2">in this way of relating through through</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.280" end="00:20:27.679" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.760" end="00:20:32.799" style="s2">now gepser said that um</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">the new structure of consciousness would</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.799" end="00:20:37.200" style="s2">have this quality of time</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">freedom so this is i think the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">progression of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:42.320" style="s2">this artist&#39;s work is this one is much</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:45.840" style="s2">more uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.320" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">yeah like she&#39;s becoming liberated from</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.840" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">uh time itself and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">gabster said that time freedom is</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">is being aware of time as an activity of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:21:00.240" style="s2">and this gives us a lot of wiggle room</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:03.120" style="s2">so if my consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.240" end="00:21:04.159" style="s2">is constructing time and then i live</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.120" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">inside that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.159" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">construct then i can actively</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">and creatively re-imagine a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:15.200" style="s2">to time</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">and so gebzer said that that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.200" end="00:21:19.120" style="s2">point is not to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">rid of any concept of time is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.120" end="00:21:23.600" style="s2">is to take control and be creatively and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">imaginative</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.600" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">about how we relate to time and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">and be able that to be a lens by which</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:36.640" style="s2">we reveal more of reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">we reveal more of the universe we reveal</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.640" end="00:21:39.840" style="s2">more about our</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">our own place in the universe instead of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.840" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">being stuck in one time construction</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.280" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">so one person who reimagined</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">time was uh whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">and one of the interesting things is</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:01.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">of resonance rhythm rhyming between</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.039" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:09.760" style="s2">and indigenous conceptions metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">and that it&#39;s not coincidental not</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.760" end="00:22:13.679" style="s2">because white had studied</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:14.720" style="s2">indigenous people because he moved back</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.679" end="00:22:18.080" style="s2">toward process</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.720" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">thinking pure process thinking and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.080" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">interesting thing about whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">is one of his his critiques about</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">time as understood by modernity</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">is he said in modernity in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.159" end="00:22:34.559" style="s2">scientific materialism this mentalist</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">attitude we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.559" end="00:22:39.280" style="s2">we only include actuals we only include</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:42.559" style="s2">the actual events</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.280" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">not the potentials so he said this is so</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.559" end="00:22:46.720" style="s2">we put the actual events in the past the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">potentials in the future and he said</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:51.520" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">is a um incorrect categorization</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.520" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">that every moment actuals and potentials</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:57.840" style="s2">exist together</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.840" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">and the potentials even though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">not made actuals</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">they subsist and they&#39;re causally</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:08.320" style="s2">in the present moment in other words</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">he&#39;s saying what the future is is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.320" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">causally effective potentials</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:15.120" style="s2">that exist in the present and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">we imagine</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.120" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">that there is a future calling us not</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:22.320" style="s2">because we can get ahead of us</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">ourselves in time but the future is</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.320" end="00:23:27.039" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">the potentials that are implicated</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.039" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">in the present and he called these</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:31.520" style="s2">potentials that they don&#39;t exist but</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.520" end="00:23:37.679" style="s2">subsist and they play a part</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">in the causal emergence of the next</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.679" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.480" end="00:23:44.240" style="s2">we&#39;ll get back to this later when we at</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:46.240" style="s2">the end of the last session we talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.240" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">about causality and a process approach</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.240" end="00:23:50.480" style="s2">to causality</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">but the sense there&#39;s a lot more going</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.480" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">on than just the substance of what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">so he said</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:04.720" style="s2">consider the possibility space as an</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:08.200" style="s2">infinite array</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.720" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">of dimensionless dots of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.200" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">infinitesimally small but non-zero</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">capacity to connect with another dot</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">okay first i have to say he never said</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:20.159" style="s2">this this</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:23.200" style="s2">is a my metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.159" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2">for getting into what he said okay so</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.200" end="00:24:26.640" style="s2">the possibility space is an infinite ray</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">of dimensionless dots</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.640" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they have no dimension</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">and they&#39;re infinitesimally small</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.039" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">but they have non-zero capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:36.480" style="s2">connect with one another</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">so this is like pure subsisting</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.480" end="00:24:40.559" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:40.880" style="s2">right whitehead was a process relational</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.559" end="00:24:44.400" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.880" end="00:24:47.039" style="s2">philosopher so the array is</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.400" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">infinite so the potential is also</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.039" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">infinite</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">what actually exists is a small</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.400" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">fragment of what potentially exists</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">now we&#39;re going to look at this why this</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">is important later</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">because we&#39;re going to try to see an</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">alternative to complex adaptive systems</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">and move toward the concept of concept</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">potential states</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">so instead of always adapting reactively</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:21.919" style="s2">to what exists</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:24.720" style="s2">is to creatively potentiate what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.919" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">potential in this state so this move</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.720" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">from like</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">well what&#39;s out there is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">small fragment of what potentially</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">exists</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:35.039" style="s2">because there&#39;s this infinite array of</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">potentiality and not all of it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.039" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.880" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">the latent potential composes a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.960" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.320" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">that is causally implicit</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">in what actually exists</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:57.360" style="s2">so this is whitehead&#39;s way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">looking at this so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.360" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">one galactic era ago</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">humans potentially existed then</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:12.320" style="s2">and and in this reality</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">we subsisted then also and the future</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.320" end="00:26:18.240" style="s2">potentially exists in the spaces</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">between these these connections that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.240" end="00:26:22.159" style="s2">here today</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:24.880" style="s2">so you start to compose a simultaneity</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.159" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">of potential in actuality</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.880" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">and this makes us feel more</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">intimate in in part of what is rather</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">than this</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">being suspended between the past and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:38.159" style="s2">future and who are we and who are we</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:41.200" style="s2">going to become like everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.159" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">everything is here to be sensed and to</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.200" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">be senseful with</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">right now it&#39;s all implicated and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.919" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">anchored in</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">the actuality itself</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:56.720" style="s2">so he&#39;s so potential subsist as</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:27:00.400" style="s2">capacitors</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.720" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">can we learn not to react to adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.400" end="00:27:03.679" style="s2">pressures</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2">that word i&#39;m going to throw out but can</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.679" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">instead we</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:11.919" style="s2">sense into the potentials in the state</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:11.919" style="s2">of the moment</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.279" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">new relationships are always threatening</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">to appear</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">just think how cool that feels</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">new relationships are always threatening</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:31.279" style="s2">to appear we got a little hit of this</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:32.159" style="s2">during kobit when some people are like</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.279" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">wow</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.159" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">things are moving now things are moving</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">and the sense of these we&#39;ll look at it</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:44.240" style="s2">later also in terms of resilience</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:46.080" style="s2">this sense of not being clinging that</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.240" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">all the connections that are already</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.080" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">here can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">cut you know we don&#39;t want all the past</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:54.159" style="s2">connections</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.919" end="00:27:56.399" style="s2">and all the interget no we can we want</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.159" end="00:27:58.080" style="s2">to disentangle some of the pieces so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.399" end="00:28:00.159" style="s2">new potentials</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.080" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">that are threatening to appear this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.159" end="00:28:04.159" style="s2">like a completely</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">different reframe with time and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.159" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:11.919" style="s2">and of course this also resonates not</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.919" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">only with indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.919" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">but with a lot of spiritual um mystical</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">um people and dogan said the time has</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.399" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">and beings appear</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">so this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.039" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">really if you think of like we started</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">off with does the world make sense well</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">this is a different reframe whether it</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:37.039" style="s2">makes sense or not what is threatening</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">to appear</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.039" end="00:28:40.559" style="s2">this is this is very this very</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:42.640" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.559" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">there&#39;s all these cracks now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.640" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">threatening to appear it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">very vital very exciting i find it very</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">exciting</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">uh yeah so that&#39;s more of my orientation</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.720" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:56.840" style="s2">so where is where is time in this time</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.840" end="00:29:03.840" style="s2">is is a simultaneity nothing has ever</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">you know i had this insight once nothing</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.840" end="00:29:09.120" style="s2">is ever lost and nothing&#39;s ever gained</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:13.039" style="s2">there&#39;s just this change between</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.120" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">potentials and actuals</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.039" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">and the movement between them</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.279" end="00:29:24.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s less contracted than</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.919" end="00:29:26.080" style="s2">this so it&#39;s civilization collapsing we</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.000" end="00:29:28.320" style="s2">looked at this timeline i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.080" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">is this little western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.320" end="00:29:32.080" style="s2">collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:32.960" style="s2">look look what had to happen for us to</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.080" end="00:29:36.080" style="s2">get here</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.960" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">i mean taking a deep time even from a</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.080" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">modernity standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">perspective is can be very very limiting</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.840" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">but liberating</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:57.039" style="s2">okay so this is another way</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.000" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">to look at it again which is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.039" end="00:30:00.720" style="s2">we looked at it from whitehead&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:02.559" style="s2">of view and</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.720" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">we&#39;re going to see the resonance with an</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.559" end="00:30:05.200" style="s2">indigenous point of view so this notion</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:07.760" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.200" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">this is an indigenous painting again</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.760" end="00:30:13.600" style="s2">it&#39;s very similar to this notion</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">of an infinite array of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.600" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">capacitors do you see how that is very</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:21.120" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:21.120" style="s2">in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.760" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">imagination or vision</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.520" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">of how reality comes to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:38.360" style="s2">and so from this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.200" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">we could reimagine this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.360" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">appearances and disappearances</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:47.279" style="s2">coming from the emerging and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.679" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">disappearing from</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.279" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">and through the background potentials</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:56.159" style="s2">as some things come into existence and</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">some things remain</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:31:02.840" style="s2">subsistent or subsist in the background</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:04.799" style="s2">and come come forth ground and be</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.840" end="00:31:08.399" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.799" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">nothing ever really lost nothing ever</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.399" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">really gained</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.840" end="00:31:33.919" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:31:59.360" style="s2">in this this experience of where where</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.320" end="00:32:02.480" style="s2">did those</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.360" end="00:32:04.000" style="s2">beings go oh can you still see them in</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.480" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">there in the potential</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.000" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">for them to appear this would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">a kind of time freedom</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.440" end="00:32:30.000" style="s2">so the takeaway here</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.640" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">is that we are weavers of time and we do</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.000" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">this freely</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">it just is the way our consciousness the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.000" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">way conscious</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:38.480" style="s2">human consciousness works but we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:41.760" style="s2">been weaving</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.480" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">unconsciously and so we trap ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.760" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">in our own nets of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">so we want to become aware of our</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:04.559" style="s2">weaving skills</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:07.519" style="s2">and to be cognizant of what</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.559" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">what we weave is it working for us is it</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.519" end="00:33:11.360" style="s2">limiting</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">us are there new ways to weave</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.360" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">these primary</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">structures of time</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:35.679" style="s2">so this brings us back to where we</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:37.840" style="s2">started we have the potential to be in</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.679" end="00:33:38.799" style="s2">resonance with this time in between</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.840" end="00:33:41.039" style="s2">worlds</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.799" end="00:33:42.240" style="s2">instead of thinking as being suspended</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.039" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">in time</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.240" end="00:33:46.799" style="s2">we see that something very unique is</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:49.120" style="s2">emerged and we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.799" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">the potential to be in resonance to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.120" end="00:33:53.600" style="s2">sense full</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">with this new feeling with these cracks</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.600" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">and holes in modernity</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">where things are threatening to appear</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">we could be eagerly await them</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:09.279" style="s2">we could respond with openings and</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:09.279" style="s2">welcomings</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:18.079" style="s2">we have the potential to savor its</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.960" end="00:34:18.079" style="s2">precious flavors</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.720" end="00:34:23.919" style="s2">to articulate and communicate this as</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.679" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2">dispatches to those</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.919" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2">who are missing out of this time</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">instead of rushing to overcome it using</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.440" end="00:34:39.839" style="s2">artifices of the one</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.879" end="00:34:42.079" style="s2">that is falling away returning to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.839" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">background to the world of disappearance</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.079" end="00:34:46.800" style="s2">that yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:48.399" style="s2">modernity is falling away</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.800" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">returning to the background of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">disappearance</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s lost it means it</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">fully potentiates</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">the next moment it&#39;s causally implicated</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">in the next moment</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:14.079" style="s2">this kind of change in our consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:17.359" style="s2">would be of such</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.079" end="00:35:19.839" style="s2">radical proportion</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">that if we were to gaze on the humans of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.839" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">they would be barely recognizable</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2">we would peer into the future and see</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.359" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">our future selves</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:49.359" style="s2">the same way we peer at the animals</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:49.359" style="s2">and see them as somehow other than us</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.760" end="00:35:57.440" style="s2">and this is the existential anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">that we have by putting time</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.440" end="00:36:03.359" style="s2">on a line we look into the past we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.680" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">see ourselves in the animals they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.359" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">other than us</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:09.119" style="s2">so here we are in between we look into</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:11.839" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.119" end="00:36:12.480" style="s2">we&#39;re afraid where will we go they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.839" end="00:36:16.480" style="s2">other than</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.480" end="00:36:19.599" style="s2">us so we&#39;re forever suspended</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.480" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">in between the life force that</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.599" end="00:36:27.359" style="s2">is continuously in and simultaneous</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">in the deep past in the deep future</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.359" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">this notion of this this timeline this</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:35.040" style="s2">this timeline thing makes us see the</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">stars as</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.040" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">other than us the animals is other than</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:44.480" style="s2">us so here we are orphans</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">then when we see we might change ah this</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">is really sad the last of the mohicans</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:54.640" style="s2">because what&#39;s coming through us</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">will also be other than us and so this</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.640" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">is incredible existential anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">that we don&#39;t see the our own continuity</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:06.400" style="s2">it&#39;s this exact same move here into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.400" end="00:37:12.160" style="s2">other than us appear into the future</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:14.480" style="s2">other than us</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.160" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">what&#39;s left nothing we&#39;re we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.480" end="00:37:20.839" style="s2">time between worlds where</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">we&#39;re temporary</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.839" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">short</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.880" end="00:37:30.640" style="s2">so this is a kind of existential pickle</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.880" end="00:37:34.839" style="s2">we put ourselves in with these</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.640" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">with these this this temporal frame of</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.839" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:47.920" style="s2">and if you switch this around and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:48.560" style="s2">look at nature and you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.920" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">animals</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.560" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">there i was i&#39;m looking today</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:56.079" style="s2">there i was it&#39;s a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">compassion</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.079" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">for not only how you resonate with them</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">but that whole long long long effort all</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">the things</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">that have been done have appeared</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">and disappeared in order to set the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">conditions for you to be here</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:24.000" style="s2">and that it&#39;s moving continually moving</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:24.000" style="s2">toward</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:29.200" style="s2">destinies that we share what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.839" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.240" end="00:38:49.760" style="s2">contemplate instead that all spheres of</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.960" end="00:38:52.240" style="s2">existence are coming into being together</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.760" end="00:38:53.359" style="s2">in a time-space dimension that forms a</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.240" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">unity</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.359" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.079" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">and i think this is the last slide so</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">we&#39;ll have plenty of time</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">for q and a</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.560" end="00:39:31.359" style="s2">we are destined to be forever in between</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:31.839" style="s2">never having completely left never</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.359" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.839" end="00:39:45.359" style="s2">fully arrived</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:46.640" style="s2">it has it has become the proposition of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.359" end="00:39:50.000" style="s2">our era to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.640" end="00:39:53.119" style="s2">in a time between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">unable to reside among them</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.119" end="00:39:57.599" style="s2">in resonance with their protect</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">perpetual fluxes</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.599" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">and flows</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.280" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot there</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.960" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">thank you bonita we&#39;ll jump into</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.560" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">questions now</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">question</p>

<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">so benita once again just a fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.400" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">presentation thank you so very much</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.280" end="00:40:54.960" style="s2">when you were speaking it reminded me of</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.280" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">some of the conceptions that i&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.960" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">across about</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:41:04.560" style="s2">death i mean a lot of western society</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">fears death is not you know you prolong</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.560" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">life as long as you can and all this</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:14.240" style="s2">but i&#39;ve also heard that</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:17.440" style="s2">people don&#39;t actually really die</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.240" end="00:41:20.640" style="s2">in in a real sense because</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.440" end="00:41:21.359" style="s2">if they have touched others their</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.640" end="00:41:24.880" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.359" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">lives in the other is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.880" end="00:41:28.560" style="s2">consistent with what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">about yes um</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.560" end="00:41:33.760" style="s2">it does lead to re trying to reinform us</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">about death</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.760" end="00:41:36.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s a couple again i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:40.960" style="s2">riff around but</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.960" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">it&#39;ll circle back um</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.960" end="00:41:44.319" style="s2">so there&#39;s a couple of different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:46.800" style="s2">look at this like</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.319" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">one of the thought experiments is to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">is the first amoeba</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:54.480" style="s2">still around and you know how amoeba</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">reproduce they just</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.480" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">split into two and then like so is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">first amoeba still around</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:08.319" style="s2">well yeah sort of right</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.800" end="00:42:09.359" style="s2">um and that&#39;s more of what a process</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.319" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">view looks like</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.359" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">now because we don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">we see we don&#39;t see the continuity</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">people because we see ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:24.640" style="s2">separate bodies</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">we don&#39;t it&#39;s harder for us to say is</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.640" end="00:42:28.400" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:28.400" style="s2">human still around</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.720" end="00:42:32.960" style="s2">an amoeba you know it&#39;s not like you see</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:35.520" style="s2">one of them go away</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.960" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">and we&#39;re hyper vigilant about well the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.520" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">other one&#39;s not around</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:41.599" style="s2">but if you could see the continuity like</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:44.400" style="s2">you expressed</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.599" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">the person lives in the imagination in</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.400" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">the actions in the ripples</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">of their life those subsist</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:56.079" style="s2">into the future</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:59.119" style="s2">that&#39;s not comforting to an ego that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.079" end="00:43:01.040" style="s2">contracted but that&#39;s a good start</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.119" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">another way to think about it is in</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.040" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">process philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.400" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">that number of potentials are infinite</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.680" end="00:43:14.560" style="s2">and the number of actuals are infinite</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">but they&#39;re not exhaustive so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.560" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:19.119" style="s2">so this is how whitehead talks and</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">that&#39;s why those quotes weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.119" end="00:43:23.200" style="s2">whiteheads but</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:25.359" style="s2">what means to be infinite but not</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:28.480" style="s2">exhaustive means</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.359" end="00:43:31.440" style="s2">there are an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.480" end="00:43:33.599" style="s2">potentials in the future</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.440" end="00:43:35.440" style="s2">but some of them have been taken out of</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.599" end="00:43:37.440" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.440" end="00:43:38.880" style="s2">and i&#39;ll give you an example of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.440" end="00:43:42.319" style="s2">kinds of things are taken</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.880" end="00:43:45.280" style="s2">out of existence there was a time before</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.319" end="00:43:45.280" style="s2">there were elephants</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.440" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">there may be a time when there are no no</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.760" end="00:43:52.319" style="s2">more elephants</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:52.720" style="s2">but there&#39;ll never be a time when there</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.319" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">no elephants and that always subsists</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:02.079" style="s2">in the reality so the potential for</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:04.400" style="s2">there never to have been elephants</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.079" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">that potentially is taken out of</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.400" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:08.720" style="s2">even though it&#39;s an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:09.520" style="s2">potential so that&#39;s another way of look</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.720" end="00:44:11.599" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:12.640" style="s2">the miracle and the preciousness of your</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.599" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.640" end="00:44:19.200" style="s2">it&#39;s never taken out of existence</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:20.800" style="s2">it never has a beginning i mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.200" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">you go back and then you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.800" end="00:44:24.319" style="s2">first person and then a miracle happens</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">and then there&#39;s evolut you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.319" end="00:44:28.079" style="s2">where do you start and you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:30.240" style="s2">taken out of existence</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.079" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">so from the from the here and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.240" end="00:44:32.800" style="s2">like well what are you gonna do with</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:36.960" style="s2">your life are you gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:39.359" style="s2">gonna worry about global trumpism</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.960" end="00:44:40.319" style="s2">like i mean can you put that in</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.359" end="00:44:42.560" style="s2">perspective you may</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.319" end="00:44:44.240" style="s2">act on it but are you gonna worry about</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:46.720" style="s2">it from a contracted space</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.240" end="00:44:48.720" style="s2">you know so that&#39;s one another way to</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.720" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">look at it</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">and the third way to look at it is when</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2">you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.400" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">deep evolution and you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:45:00.480" style="s2">the human species</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:02.079" style="s2">so you might say um</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.480" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s another way to look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.079" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">it because people today</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">uh another thought experiment is</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.640" end="00:45:12.160" style="s2">okay i&#39;m reconciled that i i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:15.359" style="s2">die</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.160" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">but i don&#39;t want humans to die and this</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.359" end="00:45:18.920" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">bumps up the problem at an</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.920" end="00:45:24.240" style="s2">anthropocentric</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">uh level right so</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.240" end="00:45:30.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like so that long timeline so</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:32.640" style="s2">the the more if you can identify with</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.880" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">all the human race that&#39;s helpful but</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.640" end="00:45:37.680" style="s2">then you don&#39;t want humans to go extinct</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:38.720" style="s2">then if you can identify with life force</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.680" end="00:45:42.079" style="s2">in general</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.720" end="00:45:42.400" style="s2">and then you go on and on and on who are</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.079" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.400" end="00:45:46.240" style="s2">identifying with what are you the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">product of well you&#39;re a product of</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.240" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">all that that we saw and that doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:55.200" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">um but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.200" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">that&#39;s not salve you know it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.240" end="00:46:02.000" style="s2">rough</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.720" end="00:46:04.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be satisfy the ego</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.000" end="00:46:06.720" style="s2">but it is a background that you can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.800" end="00:46:09.119" style="s2">aware of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.720" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">and live from make your decisions from</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.119" end="00:46:14.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:16.800" style="s2">uh from from more from that place</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.480" end="00:46:16.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:22.160" style="s2">it&#39;s always tricky territory because it</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.640" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean well then forget i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:25.280" style="s2">going to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:26.800" style="s2">because you know the sun&#39;s going to die</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.280" end="00:46:31.359" style="s2">out anyways</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.800" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">but what you do to address the suffering</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.359" end="00:46:36.640" style="s2">or to speak to your neighbor is now</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">qualitatively different</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:40.720" style="s2">because it&#39;s not driven by threat and</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">contraction</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:48.240" style="s2">it&#39;s driven by a deep sense of</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">well-being belonging and intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.240" end="00:46:56.240" style="s2">and humility because at a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:57.119" style="s2">if you start to say well we have to take</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.240" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.119" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">like uh well then you have a god problem</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:03.599" style="s2">because you say well i</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:05.359" style="s2">i could design this thing better than</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.599" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.359" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">chances are you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.839" end="00:47:13.839" style="s2">um so all of that&#39;s in play in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">these thought experiments</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.839" end="00:47:19.680" style="s2">um but death is certainly death and</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.319" end="00:47:24.480" style="s2">extinction</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.680" end="00:47:25.280" style="s2">are certainly two big ones um what goes</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.480" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">extinct</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">you know we&#39;ll look at a slide uh next</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">time these are all good questions</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">because they preview</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.520" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">are the dinosaurs extinct</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:40.160" style="s2">well they just turned into birds it</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.800" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">depends where you</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.160" end="00:47:44.640" style="s2">assign continuity and where you sign a</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:49.760" style="s2">sign change</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.640" end="00:47:50.319" style="s2">um if we ever manage to gmo not gmo but</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.319" end="00:47:55.440" style="s2">to dinosaur dna</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.839" end="00:47:57.680" style="s2">and then they come back did they go</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.440" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">extinct</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.680" end="00:48:02.559" style="s2">extinction is not just the disappearance</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.079" end="00:48:04.559" style="s2">and appearance of the dinosaurs</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.559" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">it&#39;s the change across time and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.559" end="00:48:08.000" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.599" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">for them to be reanimated by science</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.000" end="00:48:11.200" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">so we spent too much time looking just</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.200" end="00:48:15.680" style="s2">at the actual the substance</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.680" end="00:48:17.760" style="s2">and not of all the potentials all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.680" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">protocols that are in the system</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.760" end="00:48:23.440" style="s2">that can create new potentials</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:25.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s something we can work on you</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.440" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">cannot work on the fact that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.040" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">going to die</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:31.440" style="s2">perhaps you can be you know you can be</p>

<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">that makes some people happy but you</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:38.000" style="s2">could also be</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:39.920" style="s2">downloaded into your children or the</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.920" end="00:48:43.839" style="s2">why doesn&#39;t that make people happy in</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.160" end="00:48:45.440" style="s2">the same way</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:47.839" style="s2">or you could be downloaded into</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.440" end="00:48:50.480" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t look like a human</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.839" end="00:48:54.319" style="s2">a million years from now</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.480" end="00:48:57.839" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.319" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">so that you know this these these</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.839" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">these sessions are meant to elicit just</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.640" end="00:49:06.000" style="s2">that these kind of thought experiments</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.680" end="00:49:06.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:11.839" style="s2">notice how many different ways you could</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:14.000" style="s2">relate to time</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.839" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">and appearance and disappearance and how</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.000" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">few ways we do</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:25.839" style="s2">and notice also how the indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.880" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.839" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">in the white head science which got</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:31.599" style="s2">incorporated into a lot of modern signs</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:34.000" style="s2">around quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.599" end="00:49:35.599" style="s2">are very resonant they&#39;re not these</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.000" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">aren&#39;t just throwback</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.599" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">kind of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.400" end="00:49:57.920" style="s2">thank you bonita i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.160" end="00:49:59.760" style="s2">skylar your question is a great</p>

<p begin="00:49:59.760" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">yourself and ask it</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:08.800" style="s2">go for it hi bonnie</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:12.400" style="s2">thank you so much um</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.800" end="00:50:15.760" style="s2">yeah i just was feeling into</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:18.800" style="s2">grief and um</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.760" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">you know thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.800" end="00:50:22.400" style="s2">that nothing ever is ever really lost</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:25.440" style="s2">and nothing has ever really</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.400" end="00:50:27.839" style="s2">gained what</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.440" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">why do we feel the loss so much or what</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.839" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">is the role of grief</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">maybe and and mourning um</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:40.559" style="s2">in that case in the human experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.800" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">um yeah so this is very similar to what</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.559" end="00:50:45.760" style="s2">came up last time so</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:49.040" style="s2">we were talking about the affect streams</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.760" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">and how um there&#39;s a hand there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.040" end="00:50:52.480" style="s2">primary affects streams and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">contracted forms</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.480" end="00:50:59.280" style="s2">and there&#39;s ex or expanded forms and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:51:01.480" style="s2">then there&#39;s spiritual forms</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">and these are neuroanatomically and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.480" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">neurochemically dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.280" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">identifiable in all mammalian bodies</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">so the affect stream of</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">connection is care</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:20.839" style="s2">panic and grief so care is when you care</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:23.760" style="s2">for something</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.839" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">someone a thing also</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.760" end="00:51:28.079" style="s2">an animal or a thing what we call a</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">thing panic is the fear of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.079" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">losing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.119" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">and grief is the experience of having</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.280" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">lost it</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.079" end="00:51:43.130" style="s2">and so um</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:43.130" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:49.440" style="s2">when you so the move is to notice that</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with grief it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.440" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s the affect of</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">care the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">hyper expanded or liberated form of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">is inter being or interconnectedness</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">or um</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.800" end="00:52:11.839" style="s2">yeah this no feeling of being connected</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.240" end="00:52:14.720" style="s2">with all things and all things being</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.839" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">connected so that the fear of losing or</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.720" end="00:52:18.720" style="s2">having lost</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.680" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">goes away but</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.720" end="00:52:24.319" style="s2">the way i relate to grief is um</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:25.839" style="s2">and the way i relate to all affects is</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.319" end="00:52:28.480" style="s2">first i i want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.839" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">have that awareness and understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:35.280" style="s2">but you know affects come and go and</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:40.800" style="s2">they take the time they take</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.280" end="00:52:43.440" style="s2">and so if you notice you&#39;re in grief</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.800" end="00:52:43.440" style="s2">that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.559" end="00:52:48.800" style="s2">what&#39;s its function is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.200" end="00:52:52.160" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.800" end="00:52:53.200" style="s2">um it occurs to me i&#39;m thinking as you</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">speak that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.200" end="00:53:01.040" style="s2">um it does show me what i care about</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:02.960" style="s2">yeah it just is it&#39;s and the more you</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.040" end="00:53:05.359" style="s2">grief you&#39;re just like wow i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.960" end="00:53:05.359" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.839" end="00:53:11.119" style="s2">there was so much love there</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.119" end="00:53:12.800" style="s2">that turns into another question you</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">know and of course</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:20.480" style="s2">the the the act to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.000" end="00:53:24.160" style="s2">active move is to care more</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.480" end="00:53:27.680" style="s2">and um not to care less</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.160" end="00:53:28.000" style="s2">and and and liberate that energy of how</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.680" end="00:53:31.760" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.000" end="00:53:34.800" style="s2">you cared and that you can care</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.760" end="00:53:39.119" style="s2">and and yeah and this</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.800" end="00:53:39.920" style="s2">sense of uh um someone just wrote it you</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.119" end="00:53:42.160" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.920" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">this one&#39;s taken out of existence it</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">liberates you to care</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:51.280" style="s2">more care again care</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:54.839" style="s2">for others and so to use that</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.280" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">decisive action is very important</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.839" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">that&#39;s different than this feeling and</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.119" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">this is important</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.720" end="00:54:13.119" style="s2">some people have grief</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.440" end="00:54:14.720" style="s2">i mean this happened to me these are all</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.119" end="00:54:17.599" style="s2">things that i i</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.720" end="00:54:18.480" style="s2">i have sharing you my experiences you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.599" end="00:54:21.520" style="s2">have grief</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.480" end="00:54:25.760" style="s2">and then you look at it and you realize</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.520" end="00:54:30.720" style="s2">the grief is much</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.760" end="00:54:33.440" style="s2">seems out of proportion to the reality</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.720" end="00:54:36.559" style="s2">so this is not really grief this is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.440" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">loss of connection with reality</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not a loss of the thing you cared</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:43.119" style="s2">for that&#39;s the trigger</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:45.520" style="s2">and it feels like this it feels like you</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.119" end="00:54:48.000" style="s2">walk around with a hole in your heart</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.520" end="00:54:50.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just a hole and you realize you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.000" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">not really grieving over that person</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.720" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve discovered a hole in your heart</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:54:57.760" style="s2">this can be there for many years you</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:00.640" style="s2">just notice oh</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.760" end="00:55:02.160" style="s2">here i am a successful woman i do this i</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:05.119" style="s2">go to new york city every day</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.160" end="00:55:05.680" style="s2">i have a hole in my heart that means you</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.119" end="00:55:08.240" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.680" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">don&#39;t you&#39;re not connected so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.240" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">the loss of that connection</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:13.520" style="s2">it&#39;s just you you&#39;re just not connected</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:16.079" style="s2">so be very</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.520" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">very careful to separate those two</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.079" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.480" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">some people when they lose they put all</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.480" end="00:55:25.599" style="s2">their care into one individual</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:28.079" style="s2">they agree for that individual yes but</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.599" end="00:55:29.359" style="s2">the real thing is they realize</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.079" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">they want they&#39;re not connected to</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.359" end="00:55:32.319" style="s2">anything else so there&#39;s a hole in their</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:34.480" style="s2">heart</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.319" end="00:55:37.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s a different problem does that</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.480" end="00:55:37.040" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.200" end="00:55:47.280" style="s2">and literally the grief feels more like</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.119" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">in your heart this feels like right here</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">there&#39;s just a hole right there</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.480" end="00:56:02.000" style="s2">here grief you hold mostly up here</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.079" end="00:56:04.000" style="s2">panic up here</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.000" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">see and it moves to the lower chakras</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.000" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">because you&#39;re not connected</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.000" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">is that helpful amazing thank you</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:20.240" style="s2">it&#39;s all right to have a hole in your</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.839" end="00:56:21.599" style="s2">heart uh when it happened to me i did</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.240" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">nothing about it i just</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.599" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">just knew i had a hole in my heart</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.920" end="00:56:41.200" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got a few questions here</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:43.119" style="s2">and they&#39;re very similar it almost</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.200" end="00:56:46.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.119" end="00:56:47.119" style="s2">who asks their question and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:50.240" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.119" end="00:56:53.760" style="s2">um how do we embody</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.240" end="00:56:57.440" style="s2">this new relationship with potentiality</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.760" end="00:56:59.359" style="s2">um and so yeah maybe keep that in mind</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.440" end="00:57:01.920" style="s2">bonita that this is touched on in</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.359" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">a few different questions but i&#39;ll let</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.920" end="00:57:07.520" style="s2">victor if you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:12.240" style="s2">he&#39;d like to ask your question hey</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.520" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">hi bonnie uh so my question came out as</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.240" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">what do you feel it means to be in right</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.000" end="00:57:18.160" style="s2">relationship to potentialities</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:19.839" style="s2">right um i really liked what pradeep</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.160" end="00:57:22.000" style="s2">said too so i&#39;ll read his as well</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.839" end="00:57:23.520" style="s2">so what he said was like what heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.000" end="00:57:25.280" style="s2">do you consider in choosing</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.520" end="00:57:27.119" style="s2">to actualize across an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.280" end="00:57:30.160" style="s2">potentialities</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.119" end="00:57:33.200" style="s2">um is it based on well-being compassion</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.160" end="00:57:36.079" style="s2">um you know that&#39;s kind of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.200" end="00:57:39.280" style="s2">same flavor but yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.079" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s you know it&#39;s funny because i</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.280" end="00:57:43.440" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:46.960" style="s2">a lot of this work right now as um</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.440" end="00:57:50.559" style="s2">metacognitive um</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.960" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">and so so um i&#39;ll start with there and</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.559" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">then i&#39;ll work to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.000" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">more of what you asked in your question</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:58.559" style="s2">so and for me it&#39;s kind of like we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:00.000" style="s2">get to this i&#39;m glad we&#39;re asking this</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.559" end="00:58:00.799" style="s2">now because we&#39;re going to be crunched</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.000" end="00:58:03.440" style="s2">for time</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.799" end="00:58:04.640" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to end up time changing</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.440" end="00:58:06.839" style="s2">causality</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.640" end="00:58:08.160" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to end up seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.839" end="00:58:11.760" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.160" end="00:58:14.720" style="s2">all of what we think of causality</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.760" end="00:58:17.599" style="s2">comes in the insist with systems now is</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.720" end="00:58:20.559" style="s2">complex adaptive processes</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.599" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">it took me a long time because i kept on</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.559" end="00:58:25.119" style="s2">thinking about systems and</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:27.520" style="s2">find out that i couldn&#39;t think of them</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.119" end="00:58:30.960" style="s2">outside of this</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.520" end="00:58:35.040" style="s2">and what happens is at first we</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.960" end="00:58:37.359" style="s2">imagined complex adaptation as the agent</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.040" end="00:58:39.040" style="s2">in the environment the environment</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.359" end="00:58:42.000" style="s2">exerts pressure</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.040" end="00:58:43.200" style="s2">and the organisms adapt and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.000" end="00:58:45.359" style="s2">really what darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.200" end="00:58:46.720" style="s2">darwin said but i call it the darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.359" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">attitude we we</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.720" end="00:58:51.760" style="s2">take it like that then we get to this</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">funny place where we say no the</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.760" end="00:58:56.880" style="s2">environment&#39;s adapting too</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:59.839" style="s2">right so that&#39;s a good move uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.880" end="00:59:00.960" style="s2">but then what happens is we get to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.839" end="00:59:03.680" style="s2">anthropocene</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.960" end="00:59:04.880" style="s2">where the environment is actually being</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.680" end="00:59:06.400" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.880" end="00:59:09.440" style="s2">really put a lot of pressure on by</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.400" end="00:59:11.839" style="s2">humans now we have a closed loop</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.440" end="00:59:14.720" style="s2">in our in our model of change everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.839" end="00:59:16.720" style="s2">is adapting to everything else</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.720" end="00:59:18.720" style="s2">and it&#39;ll just it&#39;ll just it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.720" end="00:59:21.280" style="s2">perpetual arms race</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.720" end="00:59:22.960" style="s2">every and it&#39;s just it&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.280" end="00:59:24.640" style="s2">the news is tightening</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.960" end="00:59:26.160" style="s2">and this is how we think about climate</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.640" end="00:59:29.040" style="s2">this is how we think about the markets</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.160" end="00:59:33.200" style="s2">this is how we think about everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.040" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">so this is self-destructive conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.200" end="00:59:39.920" style="s2">uh material so the first thing is</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.880" end="00:59:43.440" style="s2">is to really</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.920" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">work hard at not thinking of things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.440" end="00:59:46.400" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.920" end="00:59:46.960" style="s2">in the first and the first way you do</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.400" end="00:59:50.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.960" end="00:59:53.599" style="s2">is you notice the absurdity of it</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.160" end="00:59:57.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like uh antibiotics</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.599" end="01:00:00.319" style="s2">and uh and bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.119" end="01:00:03.680" style="s2">and insects and pesticides and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.319" end="01:00:06.240" style="s2">markets and the speed of trade and</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.680" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">nuclear warheads and nuclear defense and</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.240" end="01:00:10.640" style="s2">everything is like this right</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.319" end="01:00:12.720" style="s2">but what&#39;s really hard is then to ask</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.640" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">yourself well what is going on</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.720" end="01:00:15.839" style="s2">and it&#39;s almost impossible at first to</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:19.280" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.839" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">something else going on do i feel</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.280" end="01:00:23.280" style="s2">pressure from the economy yeah but then</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.240" end="01:00:25.920" style="s2">i say but</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.280" end="01:00:26.480" style="s2">that i don&#39;t want to see that so a lot</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.920" end="01:00:29.440" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.480" end="01:00:31.040" style="s2">really has to do in my experience with</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.440" end="01:00:34.799" style="s2">working hard</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.040" end="01:00:39.200" style="s2">at metacognitively releasing</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.799" end="01:00:41.359" style="s2">that um that kind of way of looking at</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.200" end="01:00:45.119" style="s2">systems and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.359" end="01:00:48.440" style="s2">um i started doing that a lot for</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.119" end="01:00:51.200" style="s2">a while and then um in</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.440" end="01:00:54.319" style="s2">2012 i had the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.200" end="01:00:55.680" style="s2">opportunity to lose my career of 33</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.319" end="01:00:58.799" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.680" end="01:01:00.799" style="s2">and you know i was really good at what i</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.799" end="01:01:04.480" style="s2">was doing we just bought the farm</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.799" end="01:01:05.520" style="s2">everything was like you know generative</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.480" end="01:01:08.079" style="s2">and adapting</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.520" end="01:01:09.520" style="s2">and i would wake up in the morning and i</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.079" end="01:01:12.480" style="s2">would look into the future and i&#39;d see</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.520" end="01:01:14.720" style="s2">nothing there was nothing to adapt to</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.480" end="01:01:17.680" style="s2">there was like everything was just</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.720" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">done over and my husband&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.680" end="01:01:23.119" style="s2">contracting industry also</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.520" end="01:01:24.319" style="s2">the housing bubble burst and little by</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.119" end="01:01:27.599" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.319" end="01:01:27.599" style="s2">my relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.559" end="01:01:31.920" style="s2">that changed you know when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.559" end="01:01:33.760" style="s2">business you&#39;re always under threat and</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.920" end="01:01:35.359" style="s2">you&#39;re adapting and this and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.760" end="01:01:37.440" style="s2">strategizing</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.359" end="01:01:39.200" style="s2">so then i started talking about complex</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.440" end="01:01:43.119" style="s2">potential states</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.200" end="01:01:47.599" style="s2">and complex potential states theory</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.119" end="01:01:50.640" style="s2">which um initially and we&#39;ll get into it</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.599" end="01:01:52.480" style="s2">more conceptually but initially uh took</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.640" end="01:01:55.920" style="s2">the form of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.480" end="01:01:58.400" style="s2">um okay so</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.920" end="01:02:00.559" style="s2">here i have a plant and then here i have</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:03.520" style="s2">insects on my plants</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.559" end="01:02:04.960" style="s2">hmm what&#39;s the potential in this like</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.520" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">what is it about</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.960" end="01:02:08.559" style="s2">this situation there&#39;s more life here</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:10.720" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.559" end="01:02:11.680" style="s2">okay so you want to feel like oh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.720" end="01:02:13.599" style="s2">less life well</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.680" end="01:02:15.440" style="s2">now i have insects on my plants there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.599" end="01:02:18.079" style="s2">more life here now</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.440" end="01:02:18.880" style="s2">what&#39;s the potential in that little by</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.079" end="01:02:21.359" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.880" end="01:02:24.240" style="s2">you you do these things with your mind</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.359" end="01:02:28.160" style="s2">but it opens your organs of perception</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.240" end="01:02:30.799" style="s2">and you start to see ah</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.160" end="01:02:32.880" style="s2">i have those bluebirds now and all of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.799" end="01:02:36.160" style="s2">sudden</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.880" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">the way things unfold is different than</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.160" end="01:02:38.960" style="s2">they did before</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:42.160" style="s2">because your actions on them have</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.960" end="01:02:45.520" style="s2">changed because your questions changed</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.160" end="01:02:49.599" style="s2">so i know that this is truly</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.520" end="01:02:51.839" style="s2">something to experiment around with but</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.599" end="01:02:54.960" style="s2">it&#39;s very subtle but the first part is</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.839" end="01:02:54.960" style="s2">just noticing how</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.599" end="01:02:58.960" style="s2">you have to commit to i&#39;m just not going</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.760" end="01:03:00.240" style="s2">to see</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.960" end="01:03:02.400" style="s2">just not going to look at things from</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.240" end="01:03:05.200" style="s2">the darwinian attitude</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.400" end="01:03:06.960" style="s2">and at first there&#39;s nothing to put in</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.200" end="01:03:11.440" style="s2">its place</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.960" end="01:03:15.119" style="s2">um and and that&#39;s a really funny thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.440" end="01:03:17.280" style="s2">to place to be in because</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.119" end="01:03:19.200" style="s2">because of the way we&#39;ll see this next</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.280" end="01:03:21.839" style="s2">time because the more people that</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.200" end="01:03:24.240" style="s2">believe in the darwinian attitude</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.839" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">the more society acts as if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.240" end="01:03:28.079" style="s2">actually happening which</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:30.319" style="s2">projects back onto you reason to believe</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.079" end="01:03:33.200" style="s2">that that&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.319" end="01:03:34.319" style="s2">so you get this feedback loop right uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.200" end="01:03:37.119" style="s2">if if i think</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.319" end="01:03:37.920" style="s2">china is going if if i&#39;m afraid china is</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.119" end="01:03:39.839" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.920" end="01:03:41.760" style="s2">invade us then we get ready to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.839" end="01:03:45.119" style="s2">invaded china sees that</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.760" end="01:03:48.319" style="s2">so then they invade us so having the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.119" end="01:03:53.119" style="s2">darwinian attitude is actually creates</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.319" end="01:03:56.400" style="s2">real ontology real darwinian dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.119" end="01:03:59.520" style="s2">so it gets difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.400" end="01:04:02.240" style="s2">pull out of that but i think that</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.520" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">um for me that that&#39;s that&#39;s how the</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.240" end="01:04:05.839" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:05.839" style="s2">runs</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.839" end="01:04:13.039" style="s2">so that would be the embodied thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.280" end="01:04:16.079" style="s2">first metacognitively and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.039" end="01:04:16.079" style="s2">just try not to</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.480" end="01:04:21.680" style="s2">to use that framing not having any other</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.240" end="01:04:24.000" style="s2">frame</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.680" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">that changes your behaviors that changes</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.000" end="01:04:28.559" style="s2">what&#39;s actual</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:30.799" style="s2">and then you see oh my god a change in</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.559" end="01:04:33.839" style="s2">my frame or suspension of that actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.799" end="01:04:33.839" style="s2">changes something</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.280" end="01:04:43.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s an interesting way to live</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.680" end="01:04:54.079" style="s2">thanks bonita i think that&#39;s a good um</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.680" end="01:04:56.319" style="s2">good segue into this question from tim</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.079" end="01:04:59.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple questions around</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.319" end="01:04:59.839" style="s2">um intention and agency and they seem</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.200" end="01:05:01.920" style="s2">related</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.839" end="01:05:03.119" style="s2">and and tim&#39;s question if you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.920" end="01:05:05.839" style="s2">ask it</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.119" end="01:05:08.319" style="s2">about agency and defeatism kind of ties</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.839" end="01:05:11.280" style="s2">into some of the like adaptive fear that</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.319" end="01:05:11.280" style="s2">you were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.359" end="01:05:16.559" style="s2">sure sure um i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.880" end="01:05:19.680" style="s2">i&#39;ll ask the question as i phrase it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.559" end="01:05:21.680" style="s2">then i can clarify if needed but i said</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.680" end="01:05:22.960" style="s2">um could you speak to the paradox of</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.680" end="01:05:24.559" style="s2">agency</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.960" end="01:05:27.200" style="s2">a little bit with regard to the fear of</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.559" end="01:05:28.640" style="s2">stepping into futures that are unknown</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.200" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">um seems to me like there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.640" end="01:05:32.160" style="s2">folks in the world of complexity that i</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:35.359" style="s2">hear and i may be</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.160" end="01:05:37.680" style="s2">mishearing or mischaracterizing who</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.359" end="01:05:39.280" style="s2">seem to become almost defeatist about</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.680" end="01:05:40.400" style="s2">human consciousness like it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.280" end="01:05:42.000" style="s2">sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.400" end="01:05:43.599" style="s2">not in a religious sense but like the</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.000" end="01:05:44.400" style="s2">original sin right like that our</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.599" end="01:05:48.079" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.400" end="01:05:50.160" style="s2">is um really problematic and so then</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.079" end="01:05:51.280" style="s2">what that seems to translate into is</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.160" end="01:05:55.760" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.280" end="01:05:58.319" style="s2">um we we can&#39;t make decisions that</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.760" end="01:05:59.039" style="s2">uh that our agency is actually a a</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.319" end="01:06:00.240" style="s2">negative</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.039" end="01:06:01.520" style="s2">thing and so i&#39;m wondering if you could</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.240" end="01:06:02.319" style="s2">speak to that a little bit because it</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.520" end="01:06:05.359" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.319" end="01:06:09.359" style="s2">to me is like the abyss of all abysses</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.359" end="01:06:13.119" style="s2">yeah yeah so for example</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.359" end="01:06:16.400" style="s2">um the original sin of being human</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.119" end="01:06:19.520" style="s2">right this is like very buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.400" end="01:06:22.880" style="s2">and christian and um</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.520" end="01:06:26.559" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.880" end="01:06:29.599" style="s2">anthropocene imagination right so</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.559" end="01:06:31.760" style="s2">um i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.599" end="01:06:32.640" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna get right to your answer but</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.760" end="01:06:36.960" style="s2">i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.640" end="01:06:36.960" style="s2">talk around it so for example um</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.280" end="01:06:40.559" style="s2">the people who think</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.799" end="01:06:46.079" style="s2">the environmentalists always have had</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.559" end="01:06:48.000" style="s2">this problem</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.079" end="01:06:49.599" style="s2">because on the one hand when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.000" end="01:06:51.680" style="s2">feeling good</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.599" end="01:06:53.920" style="s2">they&#39;ll argue that well people are</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.680" end="01:06:55.760" style="s2">nature you know people are natural we</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.920" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">should have natural we have natural</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.760" end="01:06:58.720" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.559" end="01:07:00.000" style="s2">we need to live in natural environments</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.720" end="01:07:02.319" style="s2">we&#39;re just nature</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.000" end="01:07:04.160" style="s2">but then they&#39;ll say well people are</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.319" end="01:07:06.640" style="s2">destroying nature so basically you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.160" end="01:07:09.440" style="s2">said nature is destroying itself and</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.640" end="01:07:10.480" style="s2">now do you think nature is evil or is</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.440" end="01:07:13.440" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.480" end="01:07:15.599" style="s2">you know 100 good and so you get into</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.440" end="01:07:18.880" style="s2">this tautology so</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.599" end="01:07:20.880" style="s2">um the agency</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.880" end="01:07:22.640" style="s2">so if you believe in the continuity of</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.880" end="01:07:25.280" style="s2">life the agency of people</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.640" end="01:07:28.079" style="s2">is the age agency of life is the agency</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.280" end="01:07:30.400" style="s2">of nature</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.079" end="01:07:31.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s also a long game right so</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.400" end="01:07:34.559" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.280" end="01:07:38.960" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.559" end="01:07:42.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t um define the whole from</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.960" end="01:07:45.839" style="s2">these short this short time</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.000" end="01:07:49.200" style="s2">of modernity so that&#39;s that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.839" end="01:07:49.520" style="s2">another thing is um whenever we talk</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.200" end="01:07:52.480" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.520" end="01:07:56.720" style="s2">agency there&#39;s two types of agency one</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.480" end="01:07:56.720" style="s2">type of meanings in that one type is</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.440" end="01:08:02.400" style="s2">the ability to act out or behave on my</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.920" end="01:08:05.839" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.400" end="01:08:09.680" style="s2">intentions right so</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.839" end="01:08:12.319" style="s2">can i speak my truth that&#39;s agency</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.680" end="01:08:13.119" style="s2">now the ability to predict what effect</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.319" end="01:08:16.159" style="s2">that has</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.119" end="01:08:19.359" style="s2">is different than agency right so is my</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.159" end="01:08:22.960" style="s2">agency coupled with predictable outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.359" end="01:08:26.159" style="s2">no um</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.960" end="01:08:26.480" style="s2">but one of the reasons why that disturbs</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.159" end="01:08:28.239" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.480" end="01:08:30.000" style="s2">is again and we&#39;re going to look at this</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.239" end="01:08:34.159" style="s2">and when we look at causality</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.000" end="01:08:37.279" style="s2">is because basically we think agency</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.159" end="01:08:40.560" style="s2">in order for it to have</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.279" end="01:08:42.080" style="s2">outcomes it has to act like the billiard</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.560" end="01:08:44.960" style="s2">ball</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.080" end="01:08:46.640" style="s2">uh notion of causality that my agency</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.960" end="01:08:48.159" style="s2">has to trigger something that then</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.640" end="01:08:50.000" style="s2">triggers something that then triggers</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.159" end="01:08:53.839" style="s2">something and down that linear path is</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.000" end="01:08:57.359" style="s2">the outcome i want and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.839" end="01:09:00.080" style="s2">how complex systems work um</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.359" end="01:09:01.199" style="s2">if i take a billiard ball it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.080" end="01:09:03.199" style="s2">the billiard ball</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.199" end="01:09:04.400" style="s2">theory of causality you know one billion</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.199" end="01:09:06.719" style="s2">ball hits another and</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.400" end="01:09:08.799" style="s2">hits another and hits another and we</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.719" end="01:09:10.560" style="s2">sometimes think that human agency should</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.799" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2">be like that and when we find out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.560" end="01:09:13.440" style="s2">not like that</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:14.960" style="s2">we say we either we don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.440" end="01:09:17.839" style="s2">agency well we have</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.960" end="01:09:19.279" style="s2">agency because not all people have</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.839" end="01:09:21.759" style="s2">agency but if you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.279" end="01:09:25.199" style="s2">act on your own intentions and your own</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.759" end="01:09:25.199" style="s2">motivation you have agency</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.440" end="01:09:29.839" style="s2">but you&#39;re not a billiard ball that then</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.759" end="01:09:32.640" style="s2">hits another billiard ball accurately</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.839" end="01:09:33.520" style="s2">and down the line you get what you want</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.640" end="01:09:35.359" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.520" end="01:09:37.199" style="s2">if you think of this the difference</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.359" end="01:09:39.359" style="s2">between if i</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.199" end="01:09:41.120" style="s2">have a billiard ball and i hit another</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.359" end="01:09:43.600" style="s2">billiard ball</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.120" end="01:09:44.239" style="s2">we think of that as you know we do the</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.600" end="01:09:46.480" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.239" end="01:09:48.000" style="s2">in terms of angles and linear angles and</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.480" end="01:09:50.480" style="s2">stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:52.560" style="s2">it works for a billiard balls but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.480" end="01:09:54.800" style="s2">really happening</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.560" end="01:09:56.320" style="s2">is if i take a billiard ball and throw</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.800" end="01:09:59.920" style="s2">it in the pond</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.320" end="01:10:01.840" style="s2">what happens ripples right</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.920" end="01:10:03.440" style="s2">well when a billiard ball hits another</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.840" end="01:10:04.000" style="s2">billiard ball the same thing is</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.440" end="01:10:07.360" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.000" end="01:10:10.960" style="s2">energy is rippling but the</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.360" end="01:10:12.000" style="s2">but the ripple effect is inconsequential</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.960" end="01:10:14.080" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.000" end="01:10:16.320" style="s2">the scale at which we want the movement</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.080" end="01:10:18.000" style="s2">to happen so we don&#39;t include it</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.320" end="01:10:19.600" style="s2">does that make sense this is a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.000" end="01:10:22.480" style="s2">i&#39;m going fast but</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.600" end="01:10:23.760" style="s2">so the same thing with our agency</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.480" end="01:10:25.440" style="s2">agencies just</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.760" end="01:10:27.679" style="s2">it&#39;s like throwing you throw yourself in</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.440" end="01:10:30.960" style="s2">the pond and then there&#39;s ripple effects</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.679" end="01:10:31.360" style="s2">you don&#39;t have control over those so you</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.960" end="01:10:34.560" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.360" end="01:10:36.400" style="s2">linearly tie yourself into projected</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.560" end="01:10:38.159" style="s2">outcomes like a billiard ball but when</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.400" end="01:10:40.320" style="s2">you ask that question of agency and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.159" end="01:10:42.400" style="s2">you get nervous that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.320" end="01:10:44.000" style="s2">i can have agency if i can&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.400" end="01:10:47.760" style="s2">physics the linear physics from</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.000" end="01:10:50.800" style="s2">here to my outcome</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.760" end="01:10:52.719" style="s2">so again it&#39;s a matter of taking the</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.800" end="01:10:54.640" style="s2">mental models in which we ask our</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.719" end="01:10:57.679" style="s2">question to be very very careful</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.640" end="01:10:59.440" style="s2">that one mental model is not create</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.679" end="01:11:01.199" style="s2">that&#39;s where a paradox come from because</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.440" end="01:11:02.960" style="s2">we&#39;re in one mental model that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.199" end="01:11:05.040" style="s2">make sense with the other mental model</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.960" end="01:11:09.120" style="s2">and we try to put them together and</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.040" end="01:11:09.120" style="s2">and the question self-destructs into a</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.840" end="01:11:13.840" style="s2">paradox</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.719" end="01:11:20.080" style="s2">we&#39;ll look at that more um in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.600" end="01:11:23.199" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.080" end="01:11:25.360" style="s2">causality the last one</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.199" end="01:11:26.880" style="s2">which is where all these time change and</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.360" end="01:11:41.840" style="s2">then we get to causality</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.880" end="01:11:41.840" style="s2">which is where we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.320" end="01:11:50.880" style="s2">uh yeah so potential is like into a</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.400" end="01:11:51.520" style="s2">capacitor which discharges the capacitor</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.880" end="01:11:53.199" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.520" end="01:11:55.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a very interesting thought</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.199" end="01:11:55.840" style="s2">experiment</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.040" end="01:12:02.080" style="s2">where i go with that when you when you</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.520" end="01:12:05.040" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.080" end="01:12:05.920" style="s2">causality if you get outside of the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.040" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">billiard ball</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.920" end="01:12:10.719" style="s2">model of causality which even when you</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:15.760" style="s2">throw the billiard ball into the water</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.719" end="01:12:18.800" style="s2">that metaphor has has some of that in it</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.760" end="01:12:22.960" style="s2">at the bottom you you end up</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.800" end="01:12:24.640" style="s2">um with a lot of the pan psychists and</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.960" end="01:12:28.239" style="s2">neo-animists</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.640" end="01:12:33.280" style="s2">and that is that um</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.239" end="01:12:36.640" style="s2">that the capacitors are self-animated</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.280" end="01:12:38.320" style="s2">and um this is actually a move that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.640" end="01:12:41.120" style="s2">happening in the amount that happened in</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.320" end="01:12:43.440" style="s2">the imagination of einstein for example</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.120" end="01:12:44.719" style="s2">he said there&#39;s no such thing as gravity</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.440" end="01:12:47.760" style="s2">there&#39;s not like the earth</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.719" end="01:12:51.600" style="s2">and then in gravity mass</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.760" end="01:12:54.080" style="s2">itself self animate space</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.600" end="01:12:54.719" style="s2">which we call gravity it it has the</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.080" end="01:12:57.440" style="s2">property</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.719" end="01:12:59.199" style="s2">that curve space it&#39;s self animating you</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.440" end="01:13:02.320" style="s2">don&#39;t need gravity</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.199" end="01:13:05.520" style="s2">to add to the earth to curve space</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.320" end="01:13:09.280" style="s2">right so um</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.520" end="01:13:11.600" style="s2">the same thing like when i was a kid</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.280" end="01:13:12.400" style="s2">and we learned like you know you take an</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.600" end="01:13:15.760" style="s2">iron bar</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.400" end="01:13:18.880" style="s2">i think a magnet and</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.760" end="01:13:22.000" style="s2">you wrap copper around it and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.880" end="01:13:23.280" style="s2">it electricity flows through it right</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.000" end="01:13:25.440" style="s2">and you would i would say well where</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.280" end="01:13:27.040" style="s2">does electricity come from and this</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.440" end="01:13:29.920" style="s2">the teacher would say no you just take</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.040" end="01:13:33.600" style="s2">the magnet and you wrap copper around it</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.920" end="01:13:37.440" style="s2">and you get electricity so we tend to</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.600" end="01:13:40.880" style="s2">have this this mental model</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.440" end="01:13:44.080" style="s2">of force and</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.880" end="01:13:44.960" style="s2">objects this newtonian and objects have</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.080" end="01:13:48.480" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.960" end="01:13:49.360" style="s2">power or agency unless a force acts on</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.480" end="01:13:52.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.360" end="01:13:55.040" style="s2">right this is so what gives the</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.880" end="01:13:56.880" style="s2">what gives the capacitors the potential</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.040" end="01:14:00.320" style="s2">to connect nothing</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.880" end="01:14:02.000" style="s2">they have self potential</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.320" end="01:14:04.719" style="s2">you start to realize that this right</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.000" end="01:14:07.040" style="s2">reframe itself is very powerful</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.719" end="01:14:08.800" style="s2">what does gives you what gives the</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.040" end="01:14:12.840" style="s2">electricity is not something</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.800" end="01:14:15.679" style="s2">plus the magnets</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.840" end="01:14:17.520" style="s2">and the copper wire</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.679" end="01:14:18.880" style="s2">it&#39;s what they do when they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.520" end="01:14:20.480" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.880" end="01:14:23.440" style="s2">so you can say well where does</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.480" end="01:14:23.440" style="s2">electricity come from</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.520" end="01:14:28.800" style="s2">so the way we we relate to this word</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.640" end="01:14:31.760" style="s2">force is like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.800" end="01:14:33.520" style="s2">something other than the bodies in</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.760" end="01:14:35.760" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.520" end="01:14:37.840" style="s2">and this is what the way we relate to</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.760" end="01:14:42.000" style="s2">our life force we think that</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.840" end="01:14:45.120" style="s2">our life force is in our body the way a</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.000" end="01:14:45.120" style="s2">glove is in a hand</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.440" end="01:14:50.800" style="s2">but there is the potential that all the</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.640" end="01:14:51.520" style="s2">bodies in my body including my cells</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.800" end="01:14:54.840" style="s2">there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.520" end="01:14:56.400" style="s2">scales of bodies and the molecules in my</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.840" end="01:14:58.719" style="s2">cells</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.400" end="01:14:59.760" style="s2">and the atoms in my molecules they all</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.719" end="01:15:04.480" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.760" end="01:15:04.480" style="s2">self and they&#39;re all self animating</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.040" end="01:15:09.679" style="s2">in their own characteristic and then you</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.040" end="01:15:12.159" style="s2">put bodies in relationship to each other</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.679" end="01:15:14.159" style="s2">and you have new potentials and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.159" end="01:15:16.800" style="s2">actually part of my</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.159" end="01:15:19.199" style="s2">theory of complex potential states</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.800" end="01:15:23.040" style="s2">bodies in relationship</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.199" end="01:15:26.159" style="s2">constitute potential so the capacitors</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.040" end="01:15:26.640" style="s2">you know they&#39;re self potentiating to</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.159" end="01:15:27.920" style="s2">connect</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.640" end="01:15:30.960" style="s2">and then when they connect when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.920" end="01:15:33.920" style="s2">in relationship even in proximity</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.960" end="01:15:35.920" style="s2">they&#39;re self animated to connect so</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.920" end="01:15:39.440" style="s2">that&#39;s how the theory goes</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.920" end="01:15:43.280" style="s2">um um you can take it as a you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.440" end="01:15:46.560" style="s2">a theory constitutive metaphor um</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.280" end="01:15:48.000" style="s2">but uh that would be uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.560" end="01:15:50.640" style="s2">other people have written sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.000" end="01:15:54.080" style="s2">this is graham harmon and neoanimism</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.640" end="01:15:55.600" style="s2">and again it&#39;s white hedian um basically</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.080" end="01:15:58.159" style="s2">essentially white hedian</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.600" end="01:16:00.400" style="s2">and process philosophy and some of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.159" end="01:16:00.400" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.360" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">the the the buddhists and the chan</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.840" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">buddhists</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.080" end="01:16:13.600" style="s2">so let me just follow up on that a</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.600" end="01:16:15.600" style="s2">little bit so if the</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.600" end="01:16:16.960" style="s2">interaction with the terrain around here</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.600" end="01:16:18.640" style="s2">the people around you</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.960" end="01:16:22.159" style="s2">is part of what creates the potential</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.640" end="01:16:23.840" style="s2">where does agency come into play</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.159" end="01:16:25.360" style="s2">so this helped the animator has some</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.840" end="01:16:27.679" style="s2">agency too right</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.360" end="01:16:28.640" style="s2">exactly well that&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.679" end="01:16:31.120" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.640" end="01:16:32.880" style="s2">even um this is a funny thing because</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.120" end="01:16:34.320" style="s2">it&#39;s disembodied so i don&#39;t want to go</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.880" end="01:16:37.199" style="s2">there but like</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.320" end="01:16:38.480" style="s2">e when you just have you put a boy next</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.199" end="01:16:40.560" style="s2">to a frog</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.480" end="01:16:41.840" style="s2">and they both have their own agency but</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.560" end="01:16:43.120" style="s2">then something there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.840" end="01:16:45.520" style="s2">there&#39;s something else that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.120" end="01:16:46.000" style="s2">composed like boys like the poke frogs</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.520" end="01:16:48.640" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.000" end="01:16:50.960" style="s2">uh it doesn&#39;t even have to be a frog uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.640" end="01:16:54.239" style="s2">this is very weird but like john paul</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.960" end="01:16:56.719" style="s2">sartre in what&#39;s that long book he wrote</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.239" end="01:16:58.080" style="s2">the big big one not being in time but</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.719" end="01:17:01.199" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.080" end="01:17:03.360" style="s2">anyways he even said that a hole in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.199" end="01:17:07.120" style="s2">ground</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.360" end="01:17:09.440" style="s2">animates a boy so like even even certain</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.120" end="01:17:11.840" style="s2">features of the world you know like you</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.440" end="01:17:16.159" style="s2">want to put your hand in it right</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.840" end="01:17:17.679" style="s2">um so um so when i talk about bodies in</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.159" end="01:17:21.280" style="s2">space i just mean any</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.679" end="01:17:24.880" style="s2">any kind of proximity and um</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.280" end="01:17:24.880" style="s2">um i talk about how</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.040" end="01:17:32.159" style="s2">coffee every morning coffee animates</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.880" end="01:17:35.520" style="s2">millions of people this is neoanimism so</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.159" end="01:17:36.880" style="s2">if you really look at it who&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.520" end="01:17:40.239" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.880" end="01:17:42.719" style="s2">you know is the coffee moving me</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.239" end="01:17:44.480" style="s2">um you know the the shamans are like</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.719" end="01:17:46.480" style="s2">this they move through the forest and</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.480" end="01:17:48.159" style="s2">then the plant calls them they can smell</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.480" end="01:17:49.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what they need that has some</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.159" end="01:17:53.120" style="s2">well-being so</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.840" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">um the agency</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.120" end="01:17:56.239" style="s2">is another term for its your own</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.960" end="01:18:00.480" style="s2">self-animation</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.239" end="01:18:02.800" style="s2">right it&#39;s very close to it um</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.480" end="01:18:03.520" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s interesting because we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.800" end="01:18:06.719" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.520" end="01:18:09.840" style="s2">how um philosophically people</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.719" end="01:18:12.480" style="s2">got into like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.840" end="01:18:13.120" style="s2">like if i have an intention to move my</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.480" end="01:18:14.560" style="s2">arm</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.120" end="01:18:16.320" style="s2">how does the intention this was</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.560" end="01:18:19.679" style="s2">descartes problem how does not</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.320" end="01:18:22.719" style="s2">substantive intention move my arm</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.679" end="01:18:23.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s like well the agency is the</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.719" end="01:18:25.920" style="s2">intention</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.440" end="01:18:29.360" style="s2">and then somehow it has to make an arm</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.920" end="01:18:31.760" style="s2">move but again this is the billiard ball</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.360" end="01:18:33.679" style="s2">uh notion of causation that the</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.760" end="01:18:37.440" style="s2">intention has to trigger the arm</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.679" end="01:18:40.360" style="s2">and that there&#39;s a gap and so</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.440" end="01:18:41.600" style="s2">the the intention and the arm arise</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.360" end="01:18:44.719" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.600" end="01:18:45.840" style="s2">or or you have to you have to move to</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.719" end="01:18:48.640" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.840" end="01:18:50.560" style="s2">different ways of speaking about this</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.640" end="01:18:53.199" style="s2">and because we all know it&#39;s silly</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.560" end="01:18:54.000" style="s2">to use a billiard ball model of</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.199" end="01:18:55.600" style="s2">causality</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.000" end="01:18:57.679" style="s2">to talk about these complex things but</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.600" end="01:18:59.280" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard for us to get outside of</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.679" end="01:19:02.400" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.280" end="01:19:04.320" style="s2">and you&#39;ll find that even in some of</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.400" end="01:19:05.679" style="s2">these sophisticated maneuvers and</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.320" end="01:19:07.600" style="s2">complexity science</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.679" end="01:19:09.040" style="s2">ultimately that&#39;s the framework they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.600" end="01:19:11.199" style="s2">working on</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.040" end="01:19:13.120" style="s2">and and it hasn&#39;t really escaped that</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.199" end="01:19:16.960" style="s2">reductive newtonian</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.120" end="01:19:19.679" style="s2">um newtonian thing um in my paper</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.960" end="01:19:21.679" style="s2">what will i say ultimately you have to</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.679" end="01:19:24.400" style="s2">learn how to become the first mover</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.679" end="01:19:26.640" style="s2">you&#39;re not reacting to something you</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.400" end="01:19:28.800" style="s2">don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.640" end="01:19:29.920" style="s2">but you just have to do something and</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.800" end="01:19:31.360" style="s2">and the truth is</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.920" end="01:19:33.679" style="s2">that happens anyways you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.360" end="01:19:36.239" style="s2">up tomorrow and breathe</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.679" end="01:19:38.320" style="s2">so can you put take that energy and put</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.239" end="01:19:40.800" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.320" end="01:19:42.159" style="s2">put it somewhere new it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.800" end="01:19:45.760" style="s2">do something new or</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.159" end="01:19:48.159" style="s2">out of nothing but it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.760" end="01:19:48.880" style="s2">well given how your environment sort of</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.159" end="01:19:51.760" style="s2">gives</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.880" end="01:19:52.719" style="s2">you a range of possibilities i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.760" end="01:19:56.400" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.719" end="01:19:59.920" style="s2">about that i once was in an office where</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.400" end="01:20:00.320" style="s2">uh we were working for henry kissinger</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.920" end="01:20:04.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.320" end="01:20:06.000" style="s2">we took care of his um um property here</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.400" end="01:20:06.880" style="s2">in connecticut and they were having a</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.000" end="01:20:10.080" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.880" end="01:20:11.840" style="s2">department you know nancy was having</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.080" end="01:20:12.800" style="s2">this state department dinner there or</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.840" end="01:20:15.679" style="s2">something and</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.800" end="01:20:18.800" style="s2">um we had really really cold spring and</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.679" end="01:20:22.000" style="s2">a cold rain and it killed her pop uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.800" end="01:20:25.280" style="s2">yeah her poppies not her puppies her</p>

<p begin="01:20:29.760" end="01:20:35.360" style="s2">and um um</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.760" end="01:20:37.679" style="s2">she was hysterical she wanted them</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.360" end="01:20:40.080" style="s2">replaced by the next day because</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.679" end="01:20:40.880" style="s2">it was ugly and they were like 40 year</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.080" end="01:20:42.719" style="s2">old</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.880" end="01:20:44.639" style="s2">uh plants and it was impossible and</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.719" end="01:20:48.159" style="s2">people are running around like</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.639" end="01:20:50.480" style="s2">trying to adapt to this crisis right</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.159" end="01:20:52.239" style="s2">which was impossible and i&#39;m like watch</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.480" end="01:20:53.360" style="s2">this office like get everybody on the</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.239" end="01:20:56.239" style="s2">phone</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.360" end="01:20:58.480" style="s2">and it was like crazy so like i didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:20:58.480" end="01:21:02.239" style="s2">of operations i didn&#39;t want to add</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.080" end="01:21:03.280" style="s2">to yet another voice just yelling at</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.239" end="01:21:05.280" style="s2">people so</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.280" end="01:21:08.239" style="s2">i stood on my head in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.280" end="01:21:11.760" style="s2">office and waited for someone to notice</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.239" end="01:21:16.480" style="s2">and then we reframed the problem so</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.760" end="01:21:16.480" style="s2">so it can be very playful</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.120" end="01:21:25.560" style="s2">and then when they noticed i said you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.760" end="01:21:27.360" style="s2">talking about a person who</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.560" end="01:21:30.400" style="s2">systematically</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.360" end="01:21:32.159" style="s2">watched her husband systematically</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.400" end="01:21:34.239" style="s2">and you know kill innocent people in</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.159" end="01:21:37.040" style="s2">lebanon i think she&#39;ll get over this or</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.239" end="01:21:37.040" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.440" end="01:21:42.239" style="s2">uh yeah she used to uh she used to</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.639" end="01:21:45.199" style="s2">complain that some of</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.239" end="01:21:47.760" style="s2">the workers the maintenance people that</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.199" end="01:21:50.080" style="s2">we sent to our house were hats</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.760" end="01:21:50.880" style="s2">you know these garden heads and she</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.080" end="01:21:52.400" style="s2">refused</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.880" end="01:21:53.920" style="s2">she didn&#39;t she wouldn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.400" end="01:21:57.600" style="s2">because it reminded her of</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.920" end="01:22:01.360" style="s2">vietnamese people she was crazy</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.600" end="01:22:01.360" style="s2">okay uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.840" end="01:22:07.040" style="s2">that was a that was a uh what divergence</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.960" end="01:22:09.360" style="s2">but something like that trying to bring</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.040" end="01:22:11.120" style="s2">out like</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.360" end="01:22:12.719" style="s2">that&#39;s what you have to that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.120" end="01:22:14.560" style="s2">comes up when you</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.719" end="01:22:16.960" style="s2">start thinking of just being a first</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.560" end="01:22:20.639" style="s2">mover it becomes very playful</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.960" end="01:22:22.000" style="s2">and crazy and uh it&#39;s a difference that</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.639" end="01:22:23.360" style="s2">can make a difference but you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.000" end="01:22:25.840" style="s2">what direction</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.360" end="01:22:25.840" style="s2">it&#39;s going to go</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.960" end="01:22:32.159" style="s2">maybe one more question</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.880" end="01:22:38.320" style="s2">yeah um i&#39;ve got a good question</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.920" end="01:22:41.040" style="s2">from robert stonehill if you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.320" end="01:22:41.040" style="s2">unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.000" end="01:22:52.639" style="s2">um hi you first um</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.760" end="01:22:55.040" style="s2">as like practical takeaways uh the first</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.639" end="01:22:58.600" style="s2">thing that individuals can do</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.040" end="01:23:01.520" style="s2">is work on metacognition uh for</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.600" end="01:23:05.040" style="s2">non-reactivity and</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.520" end="01:23:07.840" style="s2">the second thing that uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.040" end="01:23:09.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve talked a lot about imagination</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.840" end="01:23:11.520" style="s2">and it seems like a lot of these ideas</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.760" end="01:23:15.280" style="s2">require</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.520" end="01:23:19.040" style="s2">a vivid or a deep imagination</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.280" end="01:23:22.560" style="s2">um what are ways that we can develop</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.040" end="01:23:26.719" style="s2">this imagination thanks</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.560" end="01:23:30.560" style="s2">yeah so everybody has</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.719" end="01:23:33.440" style="s2">imagination all the time right because</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.560" end="01:23:34.239" style="s2">all these all these common ways we think</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.440" end="01:23:37.920" style="s2">about time</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.239" end="01:23:42.080" style="s2">are actually imaginaries so</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.920" end="01:23:45.600" style="s2">so we are we are built to serve up</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.080" end="01:23:48.159" style="s2">imagination um the way we get</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.600" end="01:23:49.120" style="s2">caught up in the war on sense making</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.159" end="01:23:51.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a war</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.120" end="01:23:53.840" style="s2">that&#39;s an imaginary okay it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.440" end="01:23:56.480" style="s2">meaningful fiction</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.840" end="01:23:59.600" style="s2">so first to notice that no one&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.480" end="01:24:03.120" style="s2">unpossessed of imaginaries</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.600" end="01:24:06.400" style="s2">that this is always happening</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.120" end="01:24:10.320" style="s2">so the first step is to notice</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.400" end="01:24:12.159" style="s2">how much of this is imaginary</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.320" end="01:24:13.520" style="s2">and then being able to okay i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.159" end="01:24:16.480" style="s2">do a jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.520" end="01:24:17.120" style="s2">clean your room is this an imaginary you</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.480" end="01:24:19.679" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.120" end="01:24:20.400" style="s2">being served up automatically without</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.679" end="01:24:23.040" style="s2">your choice</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.400" end="01:24:25.280" style="s2">or not and if it&#39;s not just get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.040" end="01:24:27.840" style="s2">it now in the meantime you have nothing</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.280" end="01:24:29.679" style="s2">nothing it&#39;s for for a while maybe</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.840" end="01:24:31.920" style="s2">nothing interesting happens</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.679" end="01:24:34.320" style="s2">but something will because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.920" end="01:24:35.520" style="s2">help but be an imaginary add imagination</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.320" end="01:24:37.120" style="s2">to your experience because you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.520" end="01:24:39.040" style="s2">human being</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.120" end="01:24:40.800" style="s2">now you could sit on the cushion and get</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.040" end="01:24:42.880" style="s2">rid of that entirely</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.800" end="01:24:44.800" style="s2">but that&#39;s not useful because you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.880" end="01:24:47.760" style="s2">you won&#39;t be imaginary</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.800" end="01:24:49.520" style="s2">and the people that do that very well</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.760" end="01:24:52.800" style="s2">they add imagination to it</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.520" end="01:24:54.400" style="s2">too the animations add imagination like</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.800" end="01:24:57.360" style="s2">emptiness</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.400" end="01:25:00.080" style="s2">or awareness rising from storehouse</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.360" end="01:25:03.440" style="s2">consciousness those are imaginaries too</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.080" end="01:25:05.040" style="s2">as far as i&#39;m concerned unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.440" end="01:25:08.480" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.040" end="01:25:10.000" style="s2">completely non-conceptual non-conscious</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.480" end="01:25:11.520" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.000" end="01:25:13.440" style="s2">something&#39;s going to be served up in</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.520" end="01:25:15.679" style="s2">your imagination</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.440" end="01:25:17.760" style="s2">so first be aware of all of that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.679" end="01:25:21.040" style="s2">the metacognitive skill</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.760" end="01:25:23.199" style="s2">and then try to clean your room</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.040" end="01:25:24.320" style="s2">nature abhors a vacuum the mind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.199" end="01:25:27.199" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:25:24.320" end="01:25:29.679" style="s2">uh not having something in there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.199" end="01:25:32.960" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.679" end="01:25:36.080" style="s2">um yeah so um</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.960" end="01:25:37.760" style="s2">playfulness stubbornness is like ah</p>

<p begin="01:26:01.520" end="01:26:05.120" style="s2">yeah sometimes living in something</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.280" end="01:26:08.000" style="s2">that&#39;s so completely imaginary you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.120" end="01:26:09.280" style="s2">even believe it is helpful too</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.000" end="01:26:11.440" style="s2">as long as you know you&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.280" end="01:26:13.120" style="s2">through that imaginary you know children</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.440" end="01:26:15.440" style="s2">pretend all the time</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.120" end="01:26:16.480" style="s2">they have wild pretends and you read</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.440" end="01:26:19.360" style="s2">some of these</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.480" end="01:26:20.320" style="s2">vygotsky transcripts of children can</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.360" end="01:26:21.840" style="s2">pretend</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.320" end="01:26:23.600" style="s2">and let&#39;s say there&#39;s only two children</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.840" end="01:26:24.560" style="s2">so one&#39;s pretending to the father the</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.600" end="01:26:26.239" style="s2">other one but then</p>
