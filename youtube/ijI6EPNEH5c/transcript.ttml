<p begin="00:00:34.710" end="00:00:38.460" style="s2">weren&#39;t sure we wanted a YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:40.020" style="s2">yet so it wasn&#39;t super high on that list</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.460" end="00:00:43.320" style="s2">but that&#39;s pretty easy to create well</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:45.360" style="s2">whenever we want to it was on the agenda</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.320" end="00:00:47.940" style="s2">was like Jubilee sends WordPress to</p>

<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:00:56.789" style="s2">because I kind of thought we talked</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.649" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">about and then around the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.789" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">conversation it seems like the yellow</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">confused on whether that was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:05.000" style="s2">in you know an actual action item but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:10.260" style="s2">didn&#39;t think it was that important so</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.000" end="00:01:12.510" style="s2">but yeah if we want us I guess jublia I</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.260" end="00:01:13.619" style="s2">thought as we would go ahead and create</p>

<p begin="00:01:13.619" end="00:01:18.270" style="s2">videos on that channel does that sound</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">right yeah and so someone else this</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.270" end="00:01:21.750" style="s2">stream yard because part of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:24.420" style="s2">reasoning is to keep the tech</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.750" end="00:01:26.570" style="s2">cooperative separate then the journey</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:30.570" style="s2">that is emerging on crowd democracy</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.570" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">channel right keep it separate so people</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.570" end="00:01:34.770" style="s2">who want to follow the tech cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:36.390" style="s2">are following just that right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.770" end="00:01:38.189" style="s2">following the board meetings and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.390" end="00:01:39.900" style="s2">raisins and whatever mastermind groups</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.189" end="00:01:43.530" style="s2">or whatever else that involves into and</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.790" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">the budget for together tech yeah I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:01:58.469" style="s2">sign up I upgraded my stream yard like</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:01:59.820" style="s2">two days ago so it didn&#39;t yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.469" end="00:02:02.840" style="s2">it made sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.820" end="00:02:02.840" style="s2">did I do it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:12.860" style="s2">I was at you Bentley who added the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:12.860" style="s2">workplace Facebook to the agenda</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.950" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">something like facebook or slicin what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.020" end="00:02:21.330" style="s2">that Yunus or a drill I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:22.650" style="s2">added it was that for last week no it</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.330" end="00:02:24.150" style="s2">was on the agenda for this week but</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.650" end="00:02:28.170" style="s2">maybe it was yonas you know I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.150" end="00:02:30.240" style="s2">anything this week yeah because I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.170" end="00:02:31.290" style="s2">so would be weird to talk about it if</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.240" end="00:02:33.720" style="s2">he&#39;s not here he&#39;s the one who suggested</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.290" end="00:02:37.080" style="s2">it but I do think Facebook workplace is</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.720" end="00:02:39.450" style="s2">more it is free for the amount of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.080" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">we have I just don&#39;t know what it offers</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.450" end="00:02:43.980" style="s2">that a Facebook group doesn&#39;t but we</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:45.510" style="s2">could try it you see I mean our point</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.980" end="00:02:47.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t to use Facebook to the end of time</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.510" end="00:02:51.480" style="s2">it&#39;s to use it until something else</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.520" end="00:02:53.100" style="s2">emerges that is better right there</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.480" end="00:02:54.510" style="s2">within our value you know what all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.100" end="00:02:56.820" style="s2">features are like what does it offer</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.510" end="00:02:58.380" style="s2">that we&#39;d be interested in and that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.820" end="00:03:01.020" style="s2">I&#39;m like well whoever put it on there</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.380" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">can tell us that but no no so watching a</p>

<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">a conversation until there&#39;s more people</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.989" end="00:03:10.140" style="s2">than who want to get involved and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:13.709" style="s2">need to have a place to necessarily take</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.140" end="00:03:16.920" style="s2">notes we have the agenda it seems to to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.709" end="00:03:20.010" style="s2">be working however I don&#39;t know what</p>

<p begin="00:03:20.010" end="00:03:22.860" style="s2">should have watched the end of last</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.970" end="00:03:27.420" style="s2">week&#39;s one again to remember where we</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.860" end="00:03:29.880" style="s2">left off but I did usually do so Finkel</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.420" end="00:03:31.410" style="s2">like last week was a very full week like</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.880" end="00:03:33.299" style="s2">we talked for the full hour and it felt</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.410" end="00:03:34.530" style="s2">like we were getting stuff done but now</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.299" end="00:03:36.810" style="s2">I don&#39;t know for who you are</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.530" end="00:03:39.170" style="s2">that&#39;s just my memory let me just look</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.810" end="00:03:42.420" style="s2">back knack and bubble dot IO</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.170" end="00:03:45.720" style="s2">drag-and-drop programming it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.420" end="00:03:49.170" style="s2">you yeah it started that sicko bubble</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.720" end="00:03:51.299" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty cool it seems like a much</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.170" end="00:03:52.799" style="s2">like it&#39;s harder to use the neck but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.299" end="00:03:58.590" style="s2">seems a lot like you can do a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.799" end="00:03:59.850" style="s2">with it yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s um yeah with</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.590" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">that extra power you have extra</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.850" end="00:04:04.320" style="s2">complexity and challenge and a steeper</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:06.829" style="s2">learning curve I was trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.320" end="00:04:12.750" style="s2">out a good way to get past the costs</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.829" end="00:04:14.580" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty expensive to like I think it</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.750" end="00:04:16.349" style="s2">definitely will get kinds of once the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.580" end="00:04:18.370" style="s2">sort of needs to scale but I think in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.349" end="00:04:19.959" style="s2">the earlier models I wouldn&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.370" end="00:04:22.960" style="s2">need anything past the first or second</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.959" end="00:04:25.180" style="s2">tier right well something that bends on</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.960" end="00:04:27.729" style="s2">how much money you have to invest $30 a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.180" end="00:04:30.970" style="s2">month could be a lot true yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.729" end="00:04:34.540" style="s2">have a I had no problem with spending</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.970" end="00:04:36.760" style="s2">you know I think that&#39;s also - is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.540" end="00:04:39.340" style="s2">just one dev at 30 and it&#39;s a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.760" end="00:04:42.520" style="s2">and something a month for from two</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.340" end="00:04:43.990" style="s2">people but I mean with like with version</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.520" end="00:04:45.160" style="s2">control and stuff I wouldn&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.990" end="00:04:47.050" style="s2">to devs yet anyway</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.160" end="00:04:48.550" style="s2">I think like you sort of need a system</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.050" end="00:04:49.979" style="s2">to manage who&#39;s doing what and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.550" end="00:04:51.940" style="s2">implementing it and you know like</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.979" end="00:04:54.100" style="s2">storyboards and sprints and all that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.940" end="00:04:59.470" style="s2">kind of stuff before you really get into</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.100" end="00:05:02.289" style="s2">multiple developers I would think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.470" end="00:05:03.910" style="s2">just just maybe sometimes someone&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.289" end="00:05:07.090" style="s2">available and someone else can throw</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.910" end="00:05:09.400" style="s2">something up there you would I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.090" end="00:05:10.990" style="s2">theoretically if if you&#39;re just doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.400" end="00:05:12.580" style="s2">that every once while you could share an</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.990" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">account yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.580" end="00:05:19.180" style="s2">just temporarily we do stuff like use a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:20.860" style="s2">must-pass you can share a login so like</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.180" end="00:05:23.380" style="s2">if I have an account I could share that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.860" end="00:05:25.539" style="s2">with you and then if you know we ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.380" end="00:05:26.710" style="s2">not want know if you ever don&#39;t wanna</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.539" end="00:05:30.789" style="s2">share I can just punch share that log</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.710" end="00:05:38.200" style="s2">him yeah yeah you have to start 115 a</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.330" end="00:06:24.820" style="s2">system I haven&#39;t checked about their</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.720" end="00:06:27.700" style="s2">calendar into their integrations yet I</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.820" end="00:06:30.370" style="s2">think they do have some yeah yeah I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.700" end="00:06:31.810" style="s2">a pretty extensive integration library</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.370" end="00:06:34.360" style="s2">most pretty impressed</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.810" end="00:06:36.820" style="s2">and like if push comes to shove they</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.360" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">have zapier integration so you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.820" end="00:06:41.530" style="s2">integrate with almost anything well that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:44.320" style="s2">I mean you need to be able to look at 15</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.530" end="00:06:46.600" style="s2">calendars and find a date that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.320" end="00:06:49.480" style="s2">available or something so zapier</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.600" end="00:06:51.460" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t help and I mean I guess she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.480" end="00:06:54.310" style="s2">getting all the data into a database and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.460" end="00:06:55.600" style="s2">do searches but yeah I personally like</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.310" end="00:06:57.760" style="s2">I&#39;m not too worried about that part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.600" end="00:06:59.650" style="s2">it yet cuz like I don&#39;t plan to share my</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.760" end="00:07:02.470" style="s2">calendar with it Oh like I&#39;ll tell it</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.650" end="00:07:04.780" style="s2">when I&#39;m available and then or like just</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.470" end="00:07:06.790" style="s2">have a list of what spots are and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.780" end="00:07:09.910" style="s2">some tool to you know convert that time</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.790" end="00:07:11.770" style="s2">into my little time zone because I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.910" end="00:07:14.200" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m not sure but you guys I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.770" end="00:07:16.840" style="s2">very hesitant to give any apps access to</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.200" end="00:07:18.820" style="s2">my personal like calendar email any of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.840" end="00:07:21.490" style="s2">that stuff well when you&#39;re when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.820" end="00:07:24.580" style="s2">setting it up it could be read-only and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.490" end="00:07:27.550" style="s2">busy free data so that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.580" end="00:07:29.260" style="s2">permission settings of using Google so</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.550" end="00:07:32.110" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t have be able to I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.260" end="00:07:36.220" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine I&#39;d share that publicly on</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.110" end="00:07:39.580" style="s2">my website so yeah and for me I would</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.220" end="00:07:42.430" style="s2">rather not type in all the times because</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.580" end="00:07:45.070" style="s2">my schedule is very spotty right no I</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.430" end="00:07:47.110" style="s2">could set aside just a couple hours a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.070" end="00:07:50.410" style="s2">couple days a week and see if anyone</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.110" end="00:07:53.380" style="s2">happens to yeah like combined I can see</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.410" end="00:07:55.419" style="s2">sort of in in later versions I think it</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.380" end="00:07:58.390" style="s2">makes sense but to start with like just</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.419" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">having it you know did a duct tape and</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.390" end="00:08:03.669" style="s2">and popsicle sticks for perversion where</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:04.990" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of just like you list the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.669" end="00:08:06.820" style="s2">times and you check your own calendar</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.990" end="00:08:09.250" style="s2">and see what times are available and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.820" end="00:08:10.870" style="s2">it most it probably just translated into</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.250" end="00:08:12.610" style="s2">your time zone so it makes it a bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.870" end="00:08:15.490" style="s2">easier so you have to do that every time</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.610" end="00:08:17.140" style="s2">and it&#39;s prone to error and as we get</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.490" end="00:08:19.180" style="s2">more people and that becomes harder</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.140" end="00:08:20.860" style="s2">harder to do we figure out okay what</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.180" end="00:08:23.020" style="s2">kind of integrations do we want what do</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.860" end="00:08:25.600" style="s2">the current users actually what would</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.020" end="00:08:27.130" style="s2">you use if we give you you know GTL</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.600" end="00:08:31.660" style="s2">integration if it can look at a public</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.130" end="00:08:33.669" style="s2">calendar what options are available yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.660" end="00:08:35.409" style="s2">I&#39;m just saying it may be easier for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.669" end="00:08:39.219" style="s2">to do the integration than to type in my</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.409" end="00:08:42.520" style="s2">time so I&#39;ll do that I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.219" end="00:08:44.380" style="s2">do it but yeah we&#39;ll sees a calendar</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.520" end="00:08:44.690" style="s2">mine&#39;s always paper because it just</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.380" end="00:08:46.430" style="s2">makes</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.690" end="00:08:48.860" style="s2">although I need to get one because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.430" end="00:08:50.270" style="s2">can&#39;t keep all of my conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.860" end="00:08:51.800" style="s2">the weekly ones that are scheduled at</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.270" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">the same time or easy but the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.800" end="00:08:55.580" style="s2">I&#39;m getting confused and not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:59.270" style="s2">where I am at what time</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.580" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">but yeah I know I would like to say I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.270" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">mean that&#39;s part of the reason how that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:05.210" style="s2">individual to see all the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:06.470" style="s2">and to be able to follow them and which</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.210" end="00:09:08.660" style="s2">ones are available when I&#39;m available</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.470" end="00:09:12.710" style="s2">and when I&#39;m available that it can match</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.660" end="00:09:14.990" style="s2">me with to your point that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.710" end="00:09:17.210" style="s2">it maybe because there will be people</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.990" end="00:09:18.290" style="s2">that don&#39;t have calendars online</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.210" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">calendars and they will want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.290" end="00:09:25.340" style="s2">participate so the minimum you know we</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:28.900" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a requirement the calendar</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.340" end="00:09:31.460" style="s2">integration is is that so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.900" end="00:09:33.350" style="s2">integration is a nice to have that will</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.460" end="00:09:36.680" style="s2">probably become more important over time</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.350" end="00:09:39.200" style="s2">as we get users time where you know we</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.680" end="00:09:41.360" style="s2">have a number of people say this is too</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.200" end="00:09:43.160" style="s2">cumbersome to go through the list of you</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:44.660" style="s2">know of all the different things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.160" end="00:09:46.550" style="s2">interested in and then compare it to my</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.660" end="00:09:48.410" style="s2">calendar at a certain point we say okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.550" end="00:09:51.280" style="s2">it&#39;s now worthwhile to add this feature</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.410" end="00:09:54.440" style="s2">people have been asking for it great</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.280" end="00:09:56.300" style="s2">course I guess one discusses is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.440" end="00:09:59.230" style="s2">scheduler still the kind of the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.300" end="00:10:05.210" style="s2">thing we&#39;re hoping for</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.230" end="00:10:07.100" style="s2">what&#39;s the most powerful thing but in</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.210" end="00:10:08.660" style="s2">anything we create like I don&#39;t want it</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.100" end="00:10:09.950" style="s2">to be created for the three of us like I</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.660" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">want more people involved but at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.950" end="00:10:16.040" style="s2">same time how do you like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:17.330" style="s2">we need conversations on zoom&#39; with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.040" end="00:10:20.030" style="s2">hundred people to see kind of how that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.330" end="00:10:21.110" style="s2">goes before with with we pick a schedule</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.030" end="00:10:23.270" style="s2">right which is I think what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.110" end="00:10:25.610" style="s2">with the conference that we kind of came</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.270" end="00:10:28.700" style="s2">out of with that was last week&#39;s project</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.610" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">raising right like bring your project</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.700" end="00:10:35.089" style="s2">and let&#39;s talk about that and working</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:36.290" style="s2">through what that looks like then we</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.089" end="00:10:38.150" style="s2">kind of have more of an idea of what the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.290" end="00:10:41.000" style="s2">scheduler it looks like but if we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.150" end="00:10:42.410" style="s2">just have the scheduler I feel like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.000" end="00:10:43.910" style="s2">would draw more people in because then</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.410" end="00:10:45.560" style="s2">they can talk about anything they want</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.910" end="00:10:47.030" style="s2">to talk about within the game be space</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.560" end="00:10:50.870" style="s2">or whatever you know let&#39;s save the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.030" end="00:10:52.760" style="s2">world space as opposed to come talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.870" end="00:10:55.850" style="s2">about talking about it right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.760" end="00:10:58.550" style="s2">very niche what we&#39;re into talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.850" end="00:11:01.339" style="s2">and having more broad converse</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.550" end="00:11:02.750" style="s2">Asians but it&#39;s chicken-and-egg</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.339" end="00:11:04.010" style="s2">everything&#39;s chicken eggs I got the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.750" end="00:11:05.630" style="s2">people to know what it leads to look</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.010" end="00:11:06.769" style="s2">like and without those people we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.630" end="00:11:08.540" style="s2">have the funding and we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.769" end="00:11:10.430" style="s2">capacity and at the same time if we</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.540" end="00:11:12.110" style="s2">don&#39;t have it how do we schedule those</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.430" end="00:11:14.720" style="s2">how do we schedule those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.110" end="00:11:17.390" style="s2">and we can do it but I can&#39;t do it like</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.720" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">yet even I can either say I&#39;m available</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.390" end="00:11:20.540" style="s2">at this time it&#39;s at this time who wants</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:22.670" style="s2">to come and there that doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.540" end="00:11:25.300" style="s2">work other people put out a doodle poll</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.670" end="00:11:28.370" style="s2">like here all the time so then pick one</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.300" end="00:11:31.250" style="s2">which I although I can do that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.370" end="00:11:32.690" style="s2">not with outside of my capacity it kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.250" end="00:11:34.130" style="s2">of is because by the time the doodle</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.690" end="00:11:36.290" style="s2">poll is done my schedule has changed</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.130" end="00:11:40.790" style="s2">what I hate like it&#39;s like okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.290" end="00:11:43.490" style="s2">just easier to pick one I can see it as</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.790" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">such a powerful tool that if humanity</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.490" end="00:11:51.800" style="s2">has a way to connect on video about a</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:53.329" style="s2">topic they care about it is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.800" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">beginning stage of everything we want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.329" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">create and then how do we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:11:58.420" style="s2">ideas come out of there how do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:12:00.680" style="s2">actually work together how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.420" end="00:12:03.890" style="s2">100 people have a conversation and have</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.680" end="00:12:05.750" style="s2">it be effective is like iteration - yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.890" end="00:12:09.560" style="s2">yes I think the scheduler is important</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.750" end="00:12:11.120" style="s2">unless those did did we ask people</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.560" end="00:12:12.829" style="s2">whether if we had that they would</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.120" end="00:12:16.010" style="s2">participate and describe a rule well we</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.829" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">haven&#39;t done that right well part of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.010" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">is the problem of describing it right</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:21.320" style="s2">like you can almost need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:24.260" style="s2">conversation to be like here&#39;s what a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.320" end="00:12:27.560" style="s2">schedule looks like that&#39;s sort of where</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.260" end="00:12:29.810" style="s2">my initial plan is just like you know me</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.560" end="00:12:31.100" style="s2">Bentley yonis Jubilee anybody else that</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.810" end="00:12:32.779" style="s2">sort of like has a project right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.100" end="00:12:36.200" style="s2">that they&#39;re trying to do something with</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.779" end="00:12:37.760" style="s2">just just build stuff for us because</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.200" end="00:12:39.890" style="s2">stuff for the four of us and then you</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.760" end="00:12:41.660" style="s2">know to have that part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.890" end="00:12:44.600" style="s2">conversation publicly and emphasize that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.660" end="00:12:47.870" style="s2">in the game be space with you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.600" end="00:12:50.149" style="s2">the sup note up if you want to join let</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.870" end="00:12:52.820" style="s2">us know and then I think you know and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.149" end="00:12:55.160" style="s2">you get like five ten other projects</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.820" end="00:12:57.500" style="s2">involved to me that&#39;s kind of the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.160" end="00:12:59.959" style="s2">version of this application is we list</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.500" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">the projects for each project we weigh</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.959" end="00:13:04.670" style="s2">less like what sort of sessions are</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:06.949" style="s2">available like around okay here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.670" end="00:13:09.079" style="s2">meta project here&#39;s wiki election here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.949" end="00:13:11.300" style="s2">a reason score here&#39;s the things that</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.079" end="00:13:12.250" style="s2">each one is offering and then as well</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.300" end="00:13:15.010" style="s2">you live</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.250" end="00:13:17.080" style="s2">like each project has requested help in</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.010" end="00:13:18.430" style="s2">these areas and then you have people say</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.080" end="00:13:19.660" style="s2">here&#39;s the skills I have and here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.430" end="00:13:20.830" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in showing me what</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.660" end="00:13:23.380" style="s2">sessions I can attend them about</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.830" end="00:13:24.790" style="s2">projects I can help with and just like</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.380" end="00:13:25.800" style="s2">as their bones a version of that as</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.790" end="00:13:35.800" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.800" end="00:13:37.560" style="s2">so I think we&#39;re crossing some things so</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.800" end="00:13:39.790" style="s2">maybe we need to be more specific</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.560" end="00:13:41.740" style="s2">because when I was discussing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.790" end="00:13:43.330" style="s2">scheduler my thought was this is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.740" end="00:13:46.990" style="s2">thing that allows a group of a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.330" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">people to break up into groups of four</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.990" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">or something so it&#39;s unrelated to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">projects right it&#39;s just to discuss on</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:55.570" style="s2">topics and I don&#39;t I think if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.680" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">doing that project sort of thing I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.570" end="00:14:01.780" style="s2">think you need that scheduler that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:03.400" style="s2">right I think but I how I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.780" end="00:14:04.890" style="s2">visioning it which I&#39;m now getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.400" end="00:14:07.210" style="s2">straight here at a drill talk is like</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.890" end="00:14:08.680" style="s2">yes doing that because I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.210" end="00:14:10.090" style="s2">where became B is is to bring the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.680" end="00:14:12.460" style="s2">project and create the meta project</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.090" end="00:14:14.470" style="s2">together and the scheduler is almost my</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.460" end="00:14:16.120" style="s2">project for idea cafe right it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.470" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">the thing I bring and like hey we do</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.120" end="00:14:19.870" style="s2">this even though I have no capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:22.330" style="s2">actually make it right but to like hold</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.870" end="00:14:24.790" style="s2">the space for the power of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.330" end="00:14:26.770" style="s2">have a video conversation with hundred</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.790" end="00:14:28.330" style="s2">people or a million people right like to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.770" end="00:14:30.960" style="s2">have the social media platform that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.330" end="00:14:33.790" style="s2">actually helps us create a better world</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.960" end="00:14:35.320" style="s2">and whatever nebulous that means right</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.790" end="00:14:37.900" style="s2">but like the scheduler is like the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.320" end="00:14:40.990" style="s2">piece of that and you know reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.900" end="00:14:43.720" style="s2">an wiki election and whatever the issue</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.990" end="00:14:46.120" style="s2">is like the scheduler brings people not</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.720" end="00:14:47.950" style="s2">people with projects but not really</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.120" end="00:14:49.089" style="s2">unless it has a way to market it and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.950" end="00:14:53.110" style="s2">way to get people there and a way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.089" end="00:14:55.480" style="s2">sign people up and whereas the projects</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.110" end="00:14:57.490" style="s2">coming together theoretically already</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.480" end="00:14:59.620" style="s2">bring people with them or not</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.490" end="00:15:01.750" style="s2">right like and then those people become</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.620" end="00:15:02.890" style="s2">the more mad at people right like if</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.750" end="00:15:04.839" style="s2">they&#39;re involved in wiki election they</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.890" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">can also be involved and to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.839" end="00:15:07.810" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the main reasons that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:09.160" style="s2">think we start with projects because</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.810" end="00:15:11.290" style="s2">that seems to be the easiest way to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.160" end="00:15:13.540" style="s2">bring people on because we&#39;re all we</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.290" end="00:15:15.880" style="s2">we&#39;re all interested in this partially</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.540" end="00:15:17.920" style="s2">through the lens of our projects I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.880" end="00:15:21.370" style="s2">that&#39;s the the you know the first step</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.920" end="00:15:23.650" style="s2">the the easiest gap to bridge is hey</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.370" end="00:15:25.810" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this meta project thing to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.650" end="00:15:26.920" style="s2">help with our projects publicly anybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.810" end="00:15:29.170" style="s2">who likes what we&#39;re doing and feel free</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.920" end="00:15:30.459" style="s2">to join us we do that until we get</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.170" end="00:15:31.870" style="s2">problems until we say hey we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.459" end="00:15:33.699" style="s2">to schedule things and there&#39;s a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.870" end="00:15:36.759" style="s2">of us and it&#39;s a mess cool now we</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.699" end="00:15:38.709" style="s2">definitely need scheduler and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.759" end="00:15:40.480" style="s2">hundred people to ask how would you use</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.709" end="00:15:42.220" style="s2">it do you need to I wonder in racing you</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:44.709" style="s2">need this you need that perfect we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.220" end="00:15:46.420" style="s2">you know our MVP well let&#39;s go so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.709" end="00:15:48.129" style="s2">question then is if the schedulers in</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.420" end="00:15:50.559" style="s2">our first project and the Mehta project</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.129" end="00:15:52.120" style="s2">project is our first project what does</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.559" end="00:15:53.410" style="s2">that actually look like on YouTube right</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.120" end="00:15:54.970" style="s2">because not everyone kids is gonna of</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.410" end="00:15:56.889" style="s2">course make this this is our board</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.970" end="00:15:58.689" style="s2">meeting tonight the motor project</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.889" end="00:16:01.329" style="s2">forward to discuss the things that come</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.689" end="00:16:04.839" style="s2">up in the theoretical future and as well</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.329" end="00:16:07.930" style="s2">as project raising which are us focusing</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.839" end="00:16:11.170" style="s2">on one how do we use a YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.930" end="00:16:12.699" style="s2">and possibly one or two other things to</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.170" end="00:16:16.470" style="s2">create that right a Facebook group of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.699" end="00:16:16.470" style="s2">slack whatever you know somebody that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.680" end="00:16:21.279" style="s2">creating like if we had a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.300" end="00:16:22.569" style="s2">projects if he had a dozen projects and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.279" end="00:16:23.439" style="s2">we had like five different time slots</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.569" end="00:16:24.490" style="s2">throughout the week someone could</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.439" end="00:16:26.829" style="s2">probably meet one of them this is our</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.490" end="00:16:28.540" style="s2">finance one our marketing one but any of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.829" end="00:16:29.829" style="s2">it is like we need people before we kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.540" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">of grow to that point right right now</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.829" end="00:16:33.670" style="s2">together tech the meta project is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:36.939" style="s2">three of us the four of us which Jonas</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.670" end="00:16:38.110" style="s2">right so which honestly when you could</p>

<p begin="00:16:41.860" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">never actually had a conversation as</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.110" end="00:16:47.559" style="s2">like hey do you want to join he just</p>

<p begin="00:16:47.559" end="00:16:52.360" style="s2">of part of this is kind of the nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.329" end="00:16:54.430" style="s2">come when you can this space is held for</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.360" end="00:16:55.930" style="s2">that the more people that we can hold</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.430" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">this space for the better because then</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.930" end="00:16:59.230" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to show up right you</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:00.670" style="s2">don&#39;t need to absolutely be here on a</p>

<p begin="00:17:13.240" end="00:17:18.280" style="s2">going on which is the project raising</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.799" end="00:17:19.689" style="s2">and I think at least one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.280" end="00:17:23.380" style="s2">things I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.689" end="00:17:25.390" style="s2">single first thing is me Bentley yonus</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.380" end="00:17:26.679" style="s2">not sure if you have a project that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.390" end="00:17:28.600" style="s2">similar enough do you believe but like</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.679" end="00:17:30.730" style="s2">start to sort of meet for like the co-op</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.600" end="00:17:33.010" style="s2">petition councils or actually talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.730" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">specifics about hey how are our projects</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.010" end="00:17:36.580" style="s2">you know what similar areas do they</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:37.730" style="s2">touch on we know how can we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.580" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">share</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.730" end="00:17:43.820" style="s2">plans knowledge skills stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:45.490" style="s2">and start actually doing some of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.820" end="00:17:47.480" style="s2">meta project like actually talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.490" end="00:17:49.640" style="s2">projects and the kinds of answers that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.480" end="00:17:52.940" style="s2">that we&#39;d want have those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.640" end="00:17:54.350" style="s2">publicly where part of the goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.940" end="00:17:56.300" style="s2">either find other projects that would</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.350" end="00:17:57.920" style="s2">join or you know I have maybe three</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.300" end="00:17:59.960" style="s2">people in the game beat space be like</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.920" end="00:18:01.640" style="s2">wait we the three of us have similar</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.960" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">projects can we start doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.640" end="00:18:07.280" style="s2">instead start to actually design the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.400" end="00:18:10.490" style="s2">framework around what we want around</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.280" end="00:18:12.440" style="s2">what like what do we think will help our</p>

<p begin="00:24:36.830" end="00:24:42.500" style="s2">uploaded to the YouTube channel I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.770" end="00:24:44.690" style="s2">that&#39;s like a really close behind Phase</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.500" end="00:24:46.970" style="s2">two where once we have a list of all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.690" end="00:24:49.220" style="s2">projects we start to say great what are</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.970" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">you all doing and like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.220" end="00:24:52.820" style="s2">other stuff because that&#39;s where it gets</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:54.920" style="s2">a bit harder to track on a sheet because</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.820" end="00:24:56.300" style="s2">it you know a single project some might</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.920" end="00:24:58.580" style="s2">have had nothing and some might have</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.300" end="00:25:00.680" style="s2">four things and so you kind of want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.580" end="00:25:02.600" style="s2">be able to say like what are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.680" end="00:25:05.240" style="s2">what time at what</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.600" end="00:25:06.410" style="s2">so that means are you I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.240" end="00:25:08.450" style="s2">and show me everything I could</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.410" end="00:25:10.160" style="s2">participate in part of that is what</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.450" end="00:25:11.540" style="s2">project it&#39;s a part of but then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.160" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">also like what skills are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.540" end="00:25:16.250" style="s2">date and time and oh no absolutely and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:18.290" style="s2">was in my mind I was only thinking for</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.250" end="00:25:20.870" style="s2">together tech I was like a calendar for</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.290" end="00:25:22.010" style="s2">us that we&#39;re like you&#39;re invited to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.870" end="00:25:23.540" style="s2">know I mean if you want to talk finance</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.010" end="00:25:25.940" style="s2">it&#39;s at this time period like the more</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.540" end="00:25:27.410" style="s2">meta project but yes of course people</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.940" end="00:25:29.630" style="s2">are gonna have the one-off ones like</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.410" end="00:25:32.390" style="s2">wiki elections talking at noon on what</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.630" end="00:25:35.090" style="s2">is and I think the tool that we built</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.390" end="00:25:37.160" style="s2">for this one of the things is the meta</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.090" end="00:25:39.290" style="s2">project is just another project but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.160" end="00:25:41.510" style="s2">one of the projects on itself which I</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.290" end="00:25:42.950" style="s2">kind of gets weird like whatever list we</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.510" end="00:25:45.260" style="s2">have the meta product is probably number</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.950" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">one and then the first iteration of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.260" end="00:25:49.340" style="s2">tool that we build that out I&#39;ll manage</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:50.540" style="s2">this you know we&#39;ll have recent score</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.340" end="00:25:53.210" style="s2">and wiki election and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.540" end="00:25:54.950" style="s2">plus the you know together tech and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.210" end="00:25:56.570" style="s2">will have its own here&#39;s you know here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.950" end="00:25:58.970" style="s2">the website here&#39;s this and that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.570" end="00:26:00.710" style="s2">here&#39;s any of the things that you can do</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.970" end="00:26:03.560" style="s2">to participate here&#39;s the work they need</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.710" end="00:26:05.060" style="s2">here&#39;s the sessions they have do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.560" end="00:26:06.920" style="s2">want a brainstorm a bit what I want</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.060" end="00:26:08.660" style="s2">these questionnaires what I want this</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.920" end="00:26:10.580" style="s2">questionnaire to be like what do I want</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.660" end="00:26:12.800" style="s2">to ask them honestly the exact wording</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.580" end="00:26:15.890" style="s2">but like the name of your project</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.800" end="00:26:17.690" style="s2">yeah what information what are the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.890" end="00:26:19.340" style="s2">columns in that Google spreadsheet if</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.690" end="00:26:21.050" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at like a spreadsheet of</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.340" end="00:26:24.980" style="s2">all Deepti projects what information</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.050" end="00:26:27.110" style="s2">would you want to know yeah yeah yes I</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.980" end="00:26:30.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t get yelling sprays mean who owns</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.110" end="00:26:31.310" style="s2">it the website I would say all their</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.560" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">different channels do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.310" end="00:26:33.080" style="s2">Facebook page</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:36.470" style="s2">you have a YouTube page do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.080" end="00:26:38.030" style="s2">Twitter account all of them yeah do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.470" end="00:26:42.530" style="s2">have a patriot but like individual</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.030" end="00:26:44.300" style="s2">columns for each okay patreon is an</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.530" end="00:26:45.410" style="s2">important one that&#39;s if people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.300" end="00:26:47.870" style="s2">using that they probably should because</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.410" end="00:26:49.970" style="s2">that seems to be one of the better</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.870" end="00:26:51.740" style="s2">options there might be one or two for</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.970" end="00:26:53.360" style="s2">like things we don&#39;t have listed and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.740" end="00:26:55.940" style="s2">then if enough people add if it can be</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.360" end="00:27:00.230" style="s2">oh we forgot you know indiegogo or well</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.940" end="00:27:01.670" style="s2">or whatever I think um I guess not like</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.230" end="00:27:03.020" style="s2">I say the same is crowdfunding right</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.670" end="00:27:05.420" style="s2">your crowd which would be like patreon</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.020" end="00:27:07.040" style="s2">Kickstarter those kind of things but you</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.420" end="00:27:10.220" style="s2">might have all three yeah you might have</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.040" end="00:27:11.480" style="s2">it might be an area where like IndieGoGo</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.220" end="00:27:13.790" style="s2">and Kickstarter you can do it multiple</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.480" end="00:27:16.160" style="s2">times so that might almost fit under the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.790" end="00:27:18.350" style="s2">like things they&#39;re doing so if you if</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.160" end="00:27:20.030" style="s2">you launch a Kickstarter that becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.350" end="00:27:21.160" style="s2">part of that same thing as like here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.030" end="00:27:23.720" style="s2">the help that you need here&#39;s this oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.160" end="00:27:25.280" style="s2">you know one of the projects in a space</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.720" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in just launched a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.280" end="00:27:28.700" style="s2">crowdfunding campaign could go take a</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:31.850" style="s2">look if you want or basically figure</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.700" end="00:27:35.810" style="s2">letting a game be incubator that is like</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.850" end="00:27:39.650" style="s2">very not 100% yes yeah that&#39;s unless I</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.810" end="00:27:42.890" style="s2">got that phrase in my novel so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.650" end="00:27:45.050" style="s2">looking at the at the game be wiki so</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.890" end="00:27:48.770" style="s2">yeah they do have this sheet now I I</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.050" end="00:27:50.930" style="s2">think when we post it we could say first</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.770" end="00:27:52.460" style="s2">of all like I don&#39;t know which of us</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.930" end="00:27:53.900" style="s2">will have time but I think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.460" end="00:27:55.730" style="s2">Adria would be good to go ahead and take</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.900" end="00:27:58.850" style="s2">these projects to put there so one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.730" end="00:28:00.560" style="s2">the columns would be like the type which</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.850" end="00:28:03.260" style="s2">are kind of the headings here so like</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.560" end="00:28:06.760" style="s2">eight well and I don&#39;t know when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.260" end="00:28:12.830" style="s2">about projects I don&#39;t know if we would</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.760" end="00:28:14.570" style="s2">include all of these things I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.830" end="00:28:17.540" style="s2">we don&#39;t pre-fill whatever just saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.570" end="00:28:19.190" style="s2">hey we know this page exists we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.540" end="00:28:21.350" style="s2">know who in that page wants to do it we</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.190" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">only have that the project exists so if</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.350" end="00:28:24.920" style="s2">you do it by all means you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:26.390" style="s2">not asking you to remove the wheel but</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.920" end="00:28:28.520" style="s2">nine out of ten questions or things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.390" end="00:28:31.310" style="s2">we don&#39;t already have yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.520" end="00:28:33.140" style="s2">wiki&#39;s support tables so we could also</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.310" end="00:28:34.670" style="s2">mention that when we&#39;re done we&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.140" end="00:28:37.430" style="s2">it out of the Google sheet and put it in</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.670" end="00:28:42.650" style="s2">the wiki either you know there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.430" end="00:28:45.080" style="s2">ways to do that and I&#39;d rather either</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.650" end="00:28:45.680" style="s2">link out to it or see if MediaWiki</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.080" end="00:28:47.540" style="s2">support</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.680" end="00:28:49.460" style="s2">embedding a Google sheet just because</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.540" end="00:28:51.590" style="s2">then it&#39;s isolated and it&#39;s still like</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.460" end="00:28:54.230" style="s2">not concurrent editing and the anything</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.590" end="00:28:56.690" style="s2">in wikis is it is messy in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.230" end="00:28:59.030" style="s2">and whereas I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s my yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.690" end="00:29:01.280" style="s2">that&#39;s my preference I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.030" end="00:29:03.740" style="s2">the game be wiki people would think</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.280" end="00:29:06.260" style="s2">after this phone call I&#39;m jumping on</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.740" end="00:29:07.730" style="s2">like an half an hour exactly jumping on</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.260" end="00:29:10.430" style="s2">a phone call with people who are talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.730" end="00:29:13.690" style="s2">about somewhat of a meta project within</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.430" end="00:29:15.440" style="s2">game B which is the like media wiki I</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.690" end="00:29:17.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you know what that means</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.440" end="00:29:20.420" style="s2">it was like sure I&#39;ll come be more into</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.420" end="00:29:24.620" style="s2">the one who owns the wiki okay I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.180" end="00:29:28.100" style="s2">assign monopolize the conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.620" end="00:29:28.610" style="s2">asking questions but I might have more</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.100" end="00:29:31.400" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.610" end="00:29:34.460" style="s2">okay they&#39;re using it the typical term</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.400" end="00:29:37.940" style="s2">media wiki is the open source platform</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.460" end="00:29:41.420" style="s2">put out basically by Wikipedia like it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:29:46.870" end="00:29:51.760" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah they&#39;ve maybe talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.270" end="00:29:57.140" style="s2">that that may also be talked about</p>

<p begin="00:29:57.140" end="00:30:03.800" style="s2">the media right to the wiki yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.910" end="00:30:08.630" style="s2">I think technically that what the wiki</p>

<p begin="00:35:51.420" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">with fairly easily assuming that we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.519" end="00:35:58.829" style="s2">get the workers interested as well but</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">if you have a list like if you once you</p>

<p begin="00:36:03.809" end="00:36:07.589" style="s2">an AK or bubble or wherever to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.700" end="00:36:09.150" style="s2">here&#39;s the projects dick and then go in</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.440" end="00:36:24.690" style="s2">its own platform</p>

<p begin="00:36:38.250" end="00:36:42.900" style="s2">here&#39;s our pool of money if eventually</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.220" end="00:36:45.539" style="s2">that happens right where we&#39;re going to</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.150" end="00:37:13.019" style="s2">started selling essential oil yes I</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.579" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">think one of the things that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.019" end="00:37:16.710" style="s2">answer fairly early on and this will</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:18.990" style="s2">evolve over time is like what are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.710" end="00:37:21.750" style="s2">values that we kind of a all agree on</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.990" end="00:37:24.000" style="s2">and be like a good number of us still</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.750" end="00:37:25.920" style="s2">care about so that we can start to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.000" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">figure out oh we all agree that there</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.920" end="00:37:29.099" style="s2">should be no slavery okay so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:32.220" style="s2">that&#39;s like a core principle but no</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.099" end="00:37:33.630" style="s2">projects can violate its you know if</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.220" end="00:37:35.730" style="s2">half of us care about environmentalism</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.630" end="00:37:39.050" style="s2">okay that&#39;s something that we track but</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.730" end="00:37:41.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not a requirement yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.050" end="00:37:43.310" style="s2">you know be able to see okay what is</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.120" end="00:37:45.880" style="s2">your environmental what I think like</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.310" end="00:37:48.350" style="s2">I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been geeking out over</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.880" end="00:37:50.990" style="s2">together tech pretty much since we had</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.350" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">our weekend conversation that spawned my</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.990" end="00:37:55.610" style="s2">involvement in this and I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:57.080" style="s2">seeing like there&#39;s the allied projects</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.610" end="00:38:00.050" style="s2">where it&#39;s you know to start with like</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.080" end="00:38:01.520" style="s2">the recent score and and with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.050" end="00:38:03.170" style="s2">election and so on where it&#39;s not being</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.520" end="00:38:06.050" style="s2">funded by it it&#39;s kind of being used to</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.170" end="00:38:08.270" style="s2">launch together pick itself and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.050" end="00:38:10.550" style="s2">figure things out but an order for a</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.270" end="00:38:13.070" style="s2">project to sort of be officially allied</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.550" end="00:38:15.710" style="s2">to together tech we need to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.070" end="00:38:17.000" style="s2">what does it need to do what things does</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.710" end="00:38:18.950" style="s2">it need to do we&#39;ll put things does it</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.000" end="00:38:21.140" style="s2">need not to do like MLMs</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.950" end="00:38:23.750" style="s2">what key part in there is it that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.140" end="00:38:25.970" style="s2">don&#39;t want a part of or what does it</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.750" end="00:38:28.700" style="s2">need to do in order to be under</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.970" end="00:38:32.270" style="s2">consideration and then one or more</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.700" end="00:38:34.130" style="s2">layers you know deeper than that is if</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.270" end="00:38:35.540" style="s2">we actually get funding what would a</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.130" end="00:38:37.570" style="s2">project need to look like in order for</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.540" end="00:38:40.310" style="s2">us to actually like financially</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.570" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">contribute as ticked it I gather tech</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.310" end="00:38:45.410" style="s2">but I think we just need more people</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:48.680" style="s2">first like more actual projects to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.410" end="00:38:51.170" style="s2">hey there&#39;s 10 or 20 of us now what do</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.680" end="00:38:53.290" style="s2">we value what projects do we think you</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.170" end="00:38:55.850" style="s2">know should or shouldn&#39;t join the fold</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.290" end="00:38:58.130" style="s2">and unfortunately that might involve oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.850" end="00:39:01.610" style="s2">there&#39;s you know a pretty game a project</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.130" end="00:39:03.350" style="s2">in here that maybe doesn&#39;t fit do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.610" end="00:39:05.830" style="s2">want to fit to a line with our values or</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.350" end="00:39:08.270" style="s2">do you want to leave that&#39;s up to you</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.830" end="00:39:11.930" style="s2">it&#39;s just like you know stop working on</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.270" end="00:39:14.330" style="s2">your project you don&#39;t it&#39;s just hey we</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.930" end="00:39:16.910" style="s2">all decided that you know in order for</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.330" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">like 90% of the people decided that</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.910" end="00:39:21.140" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to avoid slavery and for</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:24.830" style="s2">whatever reason your your project is you</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.140" end="00:39:27.080" style="s2">know tied to a supply chain that you you</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.830" end="00:39:28.850" style="s2">have no other option as a group what do</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.080" end="00:39:30.380" style="s2">we want to do if that person ends up not</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.850" end="00:39:32.300" style="s2">being able to participate they still</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.380" end="00:39:33.980" style="s2">have their project together that won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.300" end="00:39:36.200" style="s2">own anything I think until they actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.980" end="00:39:39.710" style="s2">start to I talk together Tech has money</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.200" end="00:39:41.210" style="s2">and actually starts to invest and also</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.710" end="00:39:43.550" style="s2">like I think that that&#39;ll be a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.210" end="00:39:45.260" style="s2">conversation to showcase because it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.550" end="00:39:47.960" style="s2">like we&#39;re all having these</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.260" end="00:39:49.670" style="s2">conversations on slavery right like I</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.960" end="00:39:51.430" style="s2">don&#39;t mean here talking about it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.670" end="00:39:55.480" style="s2">literally I&#39;m on a computer that&#39;s fun</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.430" end="00:39:59.500" style="s2">I can&#39;t there&#39;s no option to not do that</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.480" end="00:40:03.339" style="s2">so to make that better is a very kinky</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.500" end="00:40:06.550" style="s2">thing but you can&#39;t make it perfect</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.339" end="00:40:08.200" style="s2">right so like to use less slavery seems</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.550" end="00:40:11.950" style="s2">like that&#39;s great you&#39;re still using</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.200" end="00:40:13.510" style="s2">slavery right anyway but but well</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.950" end="00:40:15.730" style="s2">together create that because if</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.510" end="00:40:18.730" style="s2">someone&#39;s like gonna use let&#39;s say 20%</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.730" end="00:40:20.290" style="s2">slavery light of a computer that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.730" end="00:40:22.359" style="s2">game B but at the same time you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.290" end="00:40:23.770" style="s2">creating a supply chain that&#39;s full of</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.359" end="00:40:25.540" style="s2">slavery don&#39;t we&#39;re owning that and</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.770" end="00:40:27.220" style="s2">being transparent on that part of it so</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.540" end="00:40:28.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like then we can kind of say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.220" end="00:40:31.210" style="s2">we get that there is that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.630" end="00:40:32.950" style="s2">trading what and especially that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.210" end="00:40:33.910" style="s2">area where it gets weird Lee gray is</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.950" end="00:40:36.280" style="s2">you&#39;re like okay if they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.910" end="00:40:38.109" style="s2">slavery involved but it&#39;s 80% less</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.280" end="00:40:39.430" style="s2">slavery that&#39;s a pretty marked</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.109" end="00:40:42.579" style="s2">improvement like do we want to support</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.430" end="00:40:44.410" style="s2">that you might yeah until we actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.579" end="00:40:46.150" style="s2">get to an option of oh they did it with</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.410" end="00:40:48.790" style="s2">no slavery how do they do that okay now</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.150" end="00:40:51.040" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna push that project I guess</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.790" end="00:40:54.750" style="s2">for do we want to use I know we already</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.040" end="00:40:56.920" style="s2">said this but do we want to use the wiki</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.750" end="00:41:00.000" style="s2">categories or do we want to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.920" end="00:41:06.579" style="s2">our own because I feel like there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.000" end="00:41:08.140" style="s2">really think we can use text just just</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.579" end="00:41:10.059" style="s2">have them type of what they think their</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.140" end="00:41:12.579" style="s2">category is and then we might have like</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.059" end="00:41:15.250" style="s2">tooltips with some examples like we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.579" end="00:41:17.559" style="s2">use the examples from the wiki to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.250" end="00:41:19.150" style="s2">like was your category for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.559" end="00:41:21.010" style="s2">education that&#39;s making better than it</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.150" end="00:41:23.170" style="s2">up but they can tell anything cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.010" end="00:41:26.980" style="s2">also so that was one of the things was</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.170" end="00:41:28.329" style="s2">um what is it even called like so here</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.980" end="00:41:29.920" style="s2">they have cooperatives as one of their</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.329" end="00:41:31.450" style="s2">own well we are a cooperative but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.920" end="00:41:33.730" style="s2">also not a cooperative not actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.450" end="00:41:36.819" style="s2">incorporated right but it&#39;s like what is</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.730" end="00:41:38.230" style="s2">your business model like you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.819" end="00:41:42.990" style="s2">are you a corporation are you a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.230" end="00:41:46.150" style="s2">not-for-profit are you a I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.990" end="00:41:47.950" style="s2">business type like because then you</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.150" end="00:41:51.490" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to say examples right like</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.950" end="00:41:54.730" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of cooperative yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.490" end="00:41:57.040" style="s2">maybe we keep it like I think almost our</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.730" end="00:41:58.660" style="s2">our first goal is to just start a list</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.040" end="00:41:59.980" style="s2">so we get at least I would say maybe 20</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.660" end="00:42:02.260" style="s2">and then start to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.980" end="00:42:04.420" style="s2">with that community on how do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.260" end="00:42:04.810" style="s2">categorize ourselves like how can we</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.420" end="00:42:07.120" style="s2">split</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.810" end="00:42:08.860" style="s2">what are the groups those three are</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.120" end="00:42:10.480" style="s2">for-profit but they&#39;re still doing it</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.860" end="00:42:12.550" style="s2">ethically these ones are nonprofit these</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.480" end="00:42:14.890" style="s2">ones are cooperatives where are the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.550" end="00:42:17.080" style="s2">lines and are all of them mutually</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.890" end="00:42:18.700" style="s2">exclusive you might have some where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.080" end="00:42:20.460" style="s2">actually you can be both so that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.700" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">like a checkbox instead of an either/or</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.460" end="00:42:24.190" style="s2">like it becomes a checkbox for call the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:30.400" style="s2">checkbox for a profit a checkbox for</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.190" end="00:42:33.370" style="s2">this and that the other so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.400" end="00:42:35.770" style="s2">TED talk by a woman called Barbara shear</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.370" end="00:42:37.060" style="s2">that&#39;s like wish obstacle the idea so</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.770" end="00:42:38.620" style="s2">you get enough people together</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.060" end="00:42:40.300" style="s2">someone says here&#39;s my wish she knows my</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.620" end="00:42:41.530" style="s2">obstacle almost always there&#39;s somebody</p>

<p begin="00:42:42.310" end="00:42:45.490" style="s2">partly because like in project raising</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.110" end="00:42:47.620" style="s2">its lot easier to find someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.490" end="00:42:49.030" style="s2">obstacle like right associate to theirs</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.620" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">than yours even if you have the exact</p>

<p begin="00:43:07.210" end="00:43:11.140" style="s2">like not necessarily conference but just</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.790" end="00:43:12.910" style="s2">a mastermind type group or you bring</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.140" end="00:43:15.070" style="s2">together people and say hey my wish is</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.910" end="00:43:16.480" style="s2">that wiki like exists my obstacle</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.070" end="00:43:19.990" style="s2">is that it doesn&#39;t but like something</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.480" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">more concrete than that or a certain</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.990" end="00:43:23.800" style="s2">problem you&#39;re trying to solve that</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:26.080" style="s2">could that that can be a westlake and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.800" end="00:43:27.610" style="s2">everyone has five minutes so like you</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.080" end="00:43:29.170" style="s2">get together with four other people and</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.610" end="00:43:32.860" style="s2">you each have five minutes to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.170" end="00:43:34.270" style="s2">your I see so I I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.860" end="00:43:35.710" style="s2">probably like a five minute intro the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.270" end="00:43:37.270" style="s2">four people go through and they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.710" end="00:43:39.100" style="s2">a five minute conclusion that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.270" end="00:43:40.870" style="s2">half an hour and so that&#39;s more what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.100" end="00:43:42.430" style="s2">sorry that yeah and now I&#39;m remembering</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.870" end="00:43:44.590" style="s2">when I brought that up that could be</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.430" end="00:43:46.090" style="s2">like a conference we do like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.590" end="00:43:48.090" style="s2">keep saying conferences meeting bringing</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.090" end="00:43:51.070" style="s2">people and having more than three of us</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.090" end="00:43:52.690" style="s2">having like a two-hour Zoo meeting where</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.070" end="00:43:55.030" style="s2">people are bringing their projects</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.690" end="00:43:57.220" style="s2">giving us a 30 seconds feel and what the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.030" end="00:43:59.770" style="s2">project is and what their greatest</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.220" end="00:44:02.650" style="s2">barrier is right and then you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.770" end="00:44:04.330" style="s2">don&#39;t help them fix it we just are kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.650" end="00:44:06.490" style="s2">of collecting information on that of</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.330" end="00:44:10.060" style="s2">like oh okay your biggest one is</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.490" end="00:44:12.190" style="s2">marketing and finance and and then from</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.060" end="00:44:13.660" style="s2">that putting them into groups of these</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.190" end="00:44:17.200" style="s2">people want to talk about finance even</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.660" end="00:44:18.289" style="s2">if it&#39;s not related right and or these</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.200" end="00:44:21.439" style="s2">people have edgy</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.289" end="00:44:23.979" style="s2">projects are we matching them based on</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.439" end="00:44:26.869" style="s2">their project or on their pain point and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.979" end="00:44:28.489" style="s2">both it like it&#39;s where do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.869" end="00:44:30.789" style="s2">be matched and just finding it finding</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.489" end="00:44:34.609" style="s2">out that that for an exploratory caddy</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.789" end="00:44:38.419" style="s2">exploratory all over the place all right</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.609" end="00:44:39.589" style="s2">like my inkling here is that like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.419" end="00:44:41.539" style="s2">number one goal which I think we all</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.589" end="00:44:43.999" style="s2">kind of agreed on is to get other</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.539" end="00:44:45.319" style="s2">projects involved I wouldn&#39;t even worry</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.999" end="00:44:46.489" style="s2">too much about planning past that</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.319" end="00:44:47.749" style="s2">because the whole thing is to start</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.489" end="00:44:49.789" style="s2">asking them to the kinds of questions</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.749" end="00:44:50.989" style="s2">that we have for the next step in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.789" end="00:44:52.759" style="s2">next step so we can start to have like</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.989" end="00:44:55.009" style="s2">oh no we have 20 people to ask we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.759" end="00:44:57.469" style="s2">start to get a sampling of what do you</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.009" end="00:44:58.669" style="s2">think about this this be our</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.469" end="00:45:00.679" style="s2">next step if five people are like</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.669" end="00:45:04.009" style="s2">actually here&#39;s our number one problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.679" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">both Bentley and I might say oh actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.009" end="00:45:08.869" style="s2">I had a problem too okay yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.839" end="00:45:10.640" style="s2">probably a better one just like trying</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.869" end="00:45:12.289" style="s2">to plan out what we think it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.640" end="00:45:16.009" style="s2">in two or three iterations when we</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.289" end="00:45:17.599" style="s2">probably don&#39;t even have 5% of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.009" end="00:45:19.429" style="s2">people that we need to be involved</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:21.829" style="s2">before we can move to the next step I</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.429" end="00:45:24.199" style="s2">think you can have some general ideas</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.829" end="00:45:25.669" style="s2">and like here&#39;s our suggestions to kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.199" end="00:45:28.729" style="s2">of start those conversations once we</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.669" end="00:45:30.739" style="s2">have 20 30 50 projects but everything</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.729" end="00:45:31.909" style="s2">focuses on just getting those people so</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.739" end="00:45:41.929" style="s2">we can start to ask them that these</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.909" end="00:45:43.339" style="s2">questions in context when I make the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.929" end="00:45:44.689" style="s2">forum and put out the forum that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.339" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">they answer it that&#39;s there but I guess</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.689" end="00:45:49.640" style="s2">that&#39;s I guess the call to action is</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:51.049" style="s2">fill out the form and then it&#39;s we pick</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.640" end="00:45:54.019" style="s2">a time and put out to them hey who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.049" end="00:45:55.459" style="s2">available at this time or put our two</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.019" end="00:45:56.809" style="s2">doodle poll to these people which times</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.459" end="00:45:59.749" style="s2">are you available which one runs the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.809" end="00:46:01.609" style="s2">most times is the one that we look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.749" end="00:46:02.839" style="s2">here&#39;s the structure of the meeting we</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.609" end="00:46:05.390" style="s2">can discuss maybe the start for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.839" end="00:46:06.469" style="s2">meeting in such next time yeah we do</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.390" end="00:46:08.630" style="s2">want to make sure we can get in touch</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.469" end="00:46:09.890" style="s2">with everybody so I think on the Google</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.630" end="00:46:11.630" style="s2">Form there&#39;s an option to collect the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.890" end="00:46:14.839" style="s2">emails and that may be the best way</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.630" end="00:46:16.669" style="s2">right yeah I that might be kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.839" end="00:46:18.079" style="s2">tight end thing to do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.669" end="00:46:19.839" style="s2">participate in this project mark going</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.079" end="00:46:21.619" style="s2">forward or do you just want to be like a</p>

<p begin="00:46:28.039" end="00:46:31.690" style="s2">although I guess if they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.659" end="00:46:33.640" style="s2">listed we would need</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.690" end="00:46:35.770" style="s2">sort of way to contact them I mean if</p>

<p begin="00:46:35.770" end="00:46:40.109" style="s2">enough they don&#39;t want to pretend right</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">yeah so I think we probably ask for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.109" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">can we contact them about this and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.640" end="00:46:54.549" style="s2">be if so how and then I guess it might</p>

<p begin="00:48:20.710" end="00:48:27.099" style="s2">that relates to game be read further</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.559" end="00:48:28.630" style="s2">otherwise sawed-off yeah because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.099" end="00:48:31.440" style="s2">a very related which we&#39;re not taking</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.630" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">this path but there&#39;s a very related</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:35.140" style="s2">like there&#39;s what&#39;s all of our pain</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.000" end="00:48:36.760" style="s2">points are for why we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.140" end="00:48:38.529" style="s2">participating more in game B and they</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.760" end="00:48:40.299" style="s2">are the same it&#39;s like well I need a job</p>

<p begin="00:48:45.030" end="00:48:48.900" style="s2">are actually more common pain points to</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.800" end="00:48:50.760" style="s2">touch but when I put like I said when I</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.900" end="00:48:52.440" style="s2">put out like the food one no crickets</p>

<p begin="00:48:52.440" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">an issue so that&#39;s why we&#39;re focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:48:57.810" style="s2">this one but I think there will be</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:49:00.870" style="s2">people who come forward and almost to</p>

<p begin="00:49:12.630" end="00:49:19.110" style="s2">know it&#39;s a way to find ways to meet or</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.350" end="00:49:22.170" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that&#39;s a have a job in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.110" end="00:49:27.980" style="s2">game be space so let&#39;s make transition</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.170" end="00:49:27.980" style="s2">to game be by co-creating the tools</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.260" end="00:49:38.130" style="s2">projects yeah some of the ground like</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.240" end="00:49:39.810" style="s2">setting a framework for game B projects</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.130" end="00:49:41.490" style="s2">to sort of they actually start being</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.810" end="00:49:43.350" style="s2">game being being cooperative because you</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.490" end="00:49:44.820" style="s2">know if we want to talk to talk maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.350" end="00:49:49.560" style="s2">should start doing that instead of all</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.820" end="00:49:52.500" style="s2">being off in our own silos and then just</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.560" end="00:49:54.150" style="s2">like you know once we have that actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.500" end="00:49:55.620" style="s2">figuring out what do we need to move all</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.150" end="00:49:58.700" style="s2">of our projects forward because in</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.620" end="00:50:01.350" style="s2">theory our projects are our</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.700" end="00:50:03.450" style="s2">interpretation of what&#39;s necessary just</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.350" end="00:50:09.210" style="s2">in general and possibly what&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.450" end="00:50:10.830" style="s2">for can be and I think like you would if</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.210" end="00:50:13.290" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to attract people with</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.830" end="00:50:14.700" style="s2">projects it&#39;s all about the T projects</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.290" end="00:50:16.140" style="s2">it&#39;s not even about like the amount a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.700" end="00:50:18.390" style="s2">project in this and game B in</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.140" end="00:50:20.760" style="s2">cooperative it&#39;s just do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.390" end="00:50:22.410" style="s2">work with other project owners both in</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.760" end="00:50:23.880" style="s2">general and that have very similar</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.410" end="00:50:29.220" style="s2">projects to sort out sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.880" end="00:50:30.630" style="s2">collaborate and that was to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.220" end="00:50:32.010" style="s2">with other project people to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.630" end="00:50:33.510" style="s2">how to move your project part</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.010" end="00:50:40.370" style="s2">specifically and how to set a framework</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.510" end="00:50:40.370" style="s2">for other projects to follow yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.290" end="00:50:44.320" style="s2">with yours and if you want to you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.760" end="00:50:46.210" style="s2">get involved in the meta project and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.320" end="00:50:50.740" style="s2">know that&#39;s what that one which is its</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.210" end="00:50:52.390" style="s2">own project which is I think that as it</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.740" end="00:50:55.690" style="s2">were like as we have the conversations I</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.390" end="00:50:57.700" style="s2">think the the start is just project</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.690" end="00:50:59.920" style="s2">owners helping product owners it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.700" end="00:51:02.130" style="s2">a really simplified version and you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.920" end="00:51:03.760" style="s2">it needs some more meat there but</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.130" end="00:51:05.620" style="s2">personally I think that we should avoid</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.760" end="00:51:07.540" style="s2">even saying that a project or take like</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.620" end="00:51:11.950" style="s2">our gym owners cooperating on their</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.540" end="00:51:14.290" style="s2">projects operating - yeah I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.950" end="00:51:18.070" style="s2">like a get get help on your project but</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.290" end="00:51:20.440" style="s2">then also and this may even be able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.070" end="00:51:22.600" style="s2">work on that framework so other projects</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.440" end="00:51:25.480" style="s2">so we can start to build the rule set</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.600" end="00:51:26.890" style="s2">for what helps launch project how do you</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.480" end="00:51:29.050" style="s2">get an audience how do you get funding</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.890" end="00:51:31.570" style="s2">how do you do like all the questions</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.050" end="00:51:33.430" style="s2">that we all have working on answers</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.570" end="00:51:36.040" style="s2">together and sort of sharing our results</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.430" end="00:51:37.750" style="s2">yeah maybe maybe something as short as</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.040" end="00:51:51.370" style="s2">get help on your project and help other</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.750" end="00:51:55.780" style="s2">projects yeah you know I do think</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.370" end="00:51:57.730" style="s2">there&#39;s something very attractive about</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.780" end="00:52:00.190" style="s2">this proposal because when I talk to</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.730" end="00:52:01.120" style="s2">people even about um project raising</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.190" end="00:52:02.770" style="s2">they don&#39;t necessarily want to come to</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.120" end="00:52:04.300" style="s2">be part of fix our old Friday&#39;s they do</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.770" end="00:52:07.210" style="s2">want to be part of project raising</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.300" end="00:52:09.220" style="s2">either as the project or even to help</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.210" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">other people&#39;s projects like yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.220" end="00:52:13.960" style="s2">sounds fun um even if they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:14.860" style="s2">available at that time and or don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.960" end="00:52:18.550" style="s2">if they have the expertise to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.860" end="00:52:20.860" style="s2">participate and all of that so which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.550" end="00:52:22.060" style="s2">its own its own problem so thing every</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.860" end="00:52:24.190" style="s2">wants our project raised and nobody</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.060" end="00:52:25.510" style="s2">wants raise other people&#39;s projects it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.190" end="00:52:27.040" style="s2">an issue but it&#39;s an issue that has</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.510" end="00:52:29.020" style="s2">arisen and we&#39;re figuring it out as we</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.040" end="00:52:31.660" style="s2">go we&#39;re raising people&#39;s projects cuz</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.020" end="00:52:36.010" style="s2">we like it they&#39;re getting what they get</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.660" end="00:52:37.480" style="s2">out of it alright get help on your</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.010" end="00:52:39.640" style="s2">project help other people&#39;s projects</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.480" end="00:52:47.110" style="s2">please this first point fill up the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.640" end="00:52:50.170" style="s2">survey do we want to do I want to also</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.110" end="00:52:51.820" style="s2">put in a doodle poll like another like</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.170" end="00:52:54.040" style="s2">both of those things at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.820" end="00:52:56.890" style="s2">like also fill out they do a poll for if</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.040" end="00:52:59.590" style="s2">you are do you want to get in contacted</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.890" end="00:53:02.110" style="s2">for the meta project right to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.590" end="00:53:04.780" style="s2">this framework if yes or do we just</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.110" end="00:53:07.840" style="s2">invite them to this next week I think we</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.780" end="00:53:10.000" style="s2">just invited them to this yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.840" end="00:53:11.980" style="s2">would err on the side of if we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.000" end="00:53:13.540" style="s2">to find times like until we can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.980" end="00:53:15.430" style="s2">hit phase two and have a tool for it I</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.540" end="00:53:17.530" style="s2">would say just picked three times that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.430" end="00:53:19.390" style="s2">work like for us or for two of us and</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.530" end="00:53:21.730" style="s2">then you know here&#39;s three or four times</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.390" end="00:53:23.980" style="s2">that work please vote on them and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.730" end="00:53:25.960" style="s2">you know do one that gets the most likes</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.980" end="00:53:27.910" style="s2">for uploads forever cool we&#39;ll do it</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.960" end="00:53:29.800" style="s2">that way and then once that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.910" end="00:53:31.630" style="s2">become really unwieldy we say alright we</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.800" end="00:53:34.150" style="s2">need something now it&#39;s time to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.630" end="00:53:35.920" style="s2">the scheduling tool I think also if this</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.150" end="00:53:39.160" style="s2">isn&#39;t like we&#39;ve had no one here today</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.920" end="00:53:40.360" style="s2">if we have more interests like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.160" end="00:53:41.800" style="s2">we have ten people who really want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.360" end="00:53:42.900" style="s2">get started and for next week we move on</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.800" end="00:53:45.130" style="s2">to zoom</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.900" end="00:53:47.740" style="s2">we need to zoom account then and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.130" end="00:53:49.690" style="s2">sure I can borrow one just leaving the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.740" end="00:53:52.270" style="s2">coffee shop we can example one of those</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.690" end="00:53:54.280" style="s2">ten people want to join this exact</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.270" end="00:53:56.920" style="s2">session and have that conversation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.280" end="00:53:59.590" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s beyond the the stream</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.920" end="00:54:01.910" style="s2">yard six-person which is a great problem</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.590" end="00:54:03.349" style="s2">to have I&#39;m saying I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.910" end="00:54:04.789" style="s2">I have to solve that problem my own mind</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.349" end="00:54:05.900" style="s2">I&#39;ll be like no we can only have six oh</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.789" end="00:54:07.880" style="s2">now I don&#39;t know how to have six</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.900" end="00:54:09.950" style="s2">whereas yes if we&#39;re okay moving on to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.880" end="00:54:13.010" style="s2">zoom I&#39;m okay with having that problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.950" end="00:54:15.500" style="s2">and then therefore I would all sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.010" end="00:54:17.359" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ve leaning towards it at least</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.500" end="00:54:19.490" style="s2">until it becomes even more a problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.359" end="00:54:20.990" style="s2">like asking people didn&#39;t want to join</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.490" end="00:54:23.030" style="s2">sort of figuring out what capacity they</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.990" end="00:54:25.220" style="s2">are plan around having six people and</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.030" end="00:54:28.309" style="s2">then part of it is seeing like as we</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.220" end="00:54:30.020" style="s2">also need to sort of practice having an</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.309" end="00:54:31.760" style="s2">interactive audience and saying what</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.020" end="00:54:33.589" style="s2">what happens as chats come in how does a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.760" end="00:54:36.530" style="s2">conversation work who answers what like</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.589" end="00:54:43.250" style="s2">if we&#39;re working on that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.530" end="00:54:44.809" style="s2">that also sort of to use a term build a</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.250" end="00:54:47.720" style="s2">bit of scarcity and might make it more</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.809" end="00:54:50.150" style="s2">interesting you like you wanted to know</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.720" end="00:54:51.650" style="s2">to took it in here&#39;s your pitch for why</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.150" end="00:54:53.990" style="s2">you should be a part of the six on</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.650" end="00:54:56.030" style="s2">screen and then if you don&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.990" end="00:54:57.309" style="s2">this week cool you might make it next</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.030" end="00:55:02.630" style="s2">week you put the topic that you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.309" end="00:55:04.099" style="s2">attuned to yeah so also I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.630" end="00:55:06.589" style="s2">need this YouTube channel by next week</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.099" end="00:55:09.079" style="s2">no I think starting this on a new</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.589" end="00:55:10.250" style="s2">YouTube channel is also good cuz I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.079" end="00:55:15.470" style="s2">forget like those will be our</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.250" end="00:55:18.049" style="s2">subscribers and having everyone</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.470" end="00:55:19.760" style="s2">subscribe to that one and be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.049" end="00:55:23.270" style="s2">comments which means we also have be</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.760" end="00:55:26.450" style="s2">able to go live right yeah so probably</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.270" end="00:55:28.730" style="s2">what all do is all set up the D chip</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.450" end="00:55:32.599" style="s2">channel add it to my my stream yard and</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.730" end="00:55:34.700" style="s2">then all share the that login info with</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.599" end="00:55:36.380" style="s2">just you for now Jubilee so that will</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.700" end="00:55:38.450" style="s2">have two people that can do it and if we</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.380" end="00:55:40.970" style="s2">need to I can sure prevent me as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.450" end="00:55:43.700" style="s2">but the goal is to have as few as few</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.970" end="00:55:45.319" style="s2">fingers and that PI as possible yeah</p>
