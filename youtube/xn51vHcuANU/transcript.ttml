<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:21.900" style="s2">no even the scenario planners and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.810" end="00:01:24.330" style="s2">futurists among us who like I remember</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.900" end="00:01:28.020" style="s2">being in rooms with governments talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.330" end="00:01:30.630" style="s2">about that global pandemics were the</p>

<p begin="00:01:35.579" end="00:01:39.869" style="s2">government always had that on its radar</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:43.110" style="s2">and and so many governments but somehow</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.869" end="00:01:46.170" style="s2">we are so hypnotized by all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.110" end="00:01:48.770" style="s2">economic conversations that we even let</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.170" end="00:01:51.270" style="s2">down the guard on watching out for</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.770" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">situations like this one like with Trump</p>

<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:13.370" style="s2">going on on the planet right now and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.050" end="00:02:13.370" style="s2">find find it difficult to</p>

<p begin="00:05:09.210" end="00:05:16.840" style="s2">going that is 50 percent dependent on</p>

<p begin="00:05:18.280" end="00:05:24.930" style="s2">and I feel like Ovid is showing us and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.420" end="00:05:29.920" style="s2">inviting us as when all sitting in our</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.930" end="00:05:32.710" style="s2">confinement even that the linguistic</p>

<p begin="00:05:37.570" end="00:05:42.940" style="s2">the spread but we need to socially</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.120" end="00:05:46.180" style="s2">connect and and and have the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.940" end="00:05:47.920" style="s2">conversation about what&#39;s next and to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.180" end="00:05:52.990" style="s2">that is also taking the time to look</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.920" end="00:05:55.150" style="s2">into that what we had before was killing</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.170" end="00:06:06.250" style="s2">feel in my own personal and I think is</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.160" end="00:06:08.950" style="s2">it that&#39;s what that&#39;s why I find it</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.350" end="00:06:25.870" style="s2">couple of weeks when I see these</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.590" end="00:06:31.300" style="s2">horrific images of of people were trying</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.870" end="00:06:34.120" style="s2">to help beyond I pushed beyond their</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.300" end="00:06:36.810" style="s2">capacities people that have for for 48</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.120" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">hours 78 hundreds of hours</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.810" end="00:06:42.640" style="s2">hardly slept and tried to help people</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:44.500" style="s2">and they keep dying and new ones keep</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.640" end="00:06:47.350" style="s2">coming in and and they have to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.500" end="00:06:49.810" style="s2">decisions about this one we can still</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.350" end="00:06:53.470" style="s2">say this person is young this person is</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.810" end="00:06:54.550" style="s2">over 70 we don&#39;t have a incubator for</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.470" end="00:06:57.250" style="s2">this person anymore and this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.550" end="00:06:59.800" style="s2">happening life in Italy and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.250" end="00:07:02.980" style="s2">happening life in Madrid not far from</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.980" end="00:07:09.970" style="s2">happening in New York already and for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.300" end="00:07:14.170" style="s2">on the one hand to really feel touched</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.970" end="00:07:17.380" style="s2">by it by the horror of that and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.170" end="00:07:20.290" style="s2">suddenly to realize that every day 5,000</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.380" end="00:07:24.730" style="s2">children die of lack of access to clean</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.290" end="00:07:27.490" style="s2">drinking water and I personally have</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.490" end="00:07:36.100" style="s2">daily horror to a point where I somehow</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:40.000" style="s2">accepted it I find that is even far more</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.100" end="00:07:41.950" style="s2">shocking to me at the moment and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.000" end="00:07:44.140" style="s2">like this is the invitation to really</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.950" end="00:07:46.150" style="s2">dig deep and understand that the system</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.640" end="00:07:55.960" style="s2">back to as quickly as possible was</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.990" end="00:07:58.780" style="s2">murderous beyond belief to people in</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.780" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">to her um but I also don&#39;t feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.040" end="00:08:16.120" style="s2">apart from what we&#39;ve been talking on</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:19.350" style="s2">for a long long time which is bringing</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.120" end="00:08:22.300" style="s2">the connection between people in place</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.350" end="00:08:24.280" style="s2">into a healing union again people</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.300" end="00:08:26.140" style="s2">understanding themselves of belonging to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.280" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">a place and belonging to a region and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.140" end="00:08:33.430" style="s2">Riaan habit in it in a truly supportive</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:35.530" style="s2">way understanding that the land provides</p>

<p begin="00:08:35.530" end="00:08:38.680" style="s2">land and life provides for us and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.270" end="00:08:41.740" style="s2">therefore we provide for life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.680" end="00:08:44.380" style="s2">ancient wisdom that so many cultures</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.740" end="00:08:46.120" style="s2">have tried to hand down from one</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.380" end="00:08:49.390" style="s2">generation to the next and we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.120" end="00:08:51.730" style="s2">grown deaf too for too long</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.390" end="00:08:55.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about again and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.730" end="00:08:57.130" style="s2">and and it makes me even question do I</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.000" end="00:08:59.260" style="s2">need to still sit and from my computer</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.130" end="00:09:01.180" style="s2">and have these conversations or should I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.260" end="00:09:03.310" style="s2">just get my hands back into the soil and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.180" end="00:09:05.350" style="s2">probably a bit of both for all of us now</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.310" end="00:09:07.690" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing I&#39;m locked in</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.350" end="00:09:10.930" style="s2">a flat but I&#39;m planting some things on</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.690" end="00:09:14.590" style="s2">my Terrace to keep myself saying I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.930" end="00:09:17.020" style="s2">there are a few differences from this</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.590" end="00:09:19.270" style="s2">pandemic to what we had been</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.020" end="00:09:22.810" style="s2">experiencing in planetary collapse over</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.270" end="00:09:25.060" style="s2">the last decades one is it&#39;s one agent</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.810" end="00:09:28.450" style="s2">and that fits with the reductionist</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.060" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">mindset of the Western system so</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.450" end="00:09:33.940" style="s2">identifying it&#39;s like the ozone hole and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:37.260" style="s2">the atmosphere it was three four</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.940" end="00:09:40.990" style="s2">chemicals so it was something tackle</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.260" end="00:09:43.720" style="s2">poverty and global change climate change</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.990" end="00:09:45.580" style="s2">all these issues are complex and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.720" end="00:09:48.730" style="s2">don&#39;t have the framework behind for</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.580" end="00:09:50.410" style="s2">complex dealing with complex issues we</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.730" end="00:09:51.850" style="s2">really need holistic approaches I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.410" end="00:09:54.450" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the big challenges we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.850" end="00:09:59.070" style="s2">and I think the second difference is</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.450" end="00:10:04.420" style="s2">this has affected people like Tom Hanks</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.070" end="00:10:07.710" style="s2">so we see 20 million children dying in</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.420" end="00:10:10.420" style="s2">Africa right now as you mentioned and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.710" end="00:10:14.860" style="s2">nobody gets moved because it&#39;s far it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.420" end="00:10:20.920" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t really touch me but</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.860" end="00:10:23.020" style="s2">when you see people from all different</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.920" end="00:10:26.740" style="s2">sectors and even the rich people getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.020" end="00:10:28.420" style="s2">affected that is where people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.740" end="00:10:29.290" style="s2">starting to react and say oh this this</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.420" end="00:10:32.110" style="s2">can hit me</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.290" end="00:10:35.260" style="s2">and yet we actually I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.110" end="00:10:38.110" style="s2">normal physiological thing that we turn</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.260" end="00:10:40.660" style="s2">on to these things if I would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.110" end="00:10:42.550" style="s2">thinking of the 27 million children I</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.660" end="00:10:44.710" style="s2">and I see these images all the time on</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.550" end="00:10:49.210" style="s2">on the networks of these children that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.710" end="00:10:52.500" style="s2">are just boning and skin that even if</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.210" end="00:10:54.900" style="s2">you bring them food back there already</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.500" end="00:10:57.520" style="s2">underdeveloped in their brain capacity</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.900" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">so they will never be functional totally</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.520" end="00:11:03.379" style="s2">many of them because of their</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:05.449" style="s2">undernutrition lasting so long</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.379" end="00:11:09.500" style="s2">that if we didn&#39;t turn them would go</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.449" end="00:11:13.910" style="s2">crazy now the thing is how how do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.500" end="00:11:16.819" style="s2">avoid or how can we stimulate moving</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.910" end="00:11:18.949" style="s2">into this new paradigm and avoid hopping</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.819" end="00:11:20.569" style="s2">back into the old system as soon as the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.949" end="00:11:23.839" style="s2">quarantine is lifted and everybody wants</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.569" end="00:11:27.470" style="s2">to go out and shop again I see here a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.839" end="00:11:29.720" style="s2">lot of discussion now very strong and</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.470" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">all over Latin America actually between</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.720" end="00:11:37.160" style="s2">those that say the economy is more</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.480" end="00:11:38.810" style="s2">important than a few people dying and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.160" end="00:11:42.259" style="s2">see that more and more and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.810" end="00:11:45.949" style="s2">expect to hear it from some my friends</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.259" end="00:11:47.930" style="s2">on Facebook which I basically have just</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.949" end="00:11:49.699" style="s2">started unfriending a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.930" end="00:11:52.660" style="s2">because I just don&#39;t want to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.699" end="00:11:57.829" style="s2">that sort of information coming to my</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.660" end="00:12:00.860" style="s2">computer every day so how do we move</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.829" end="00:12:03.790" style="s2">forward from your regenitive cultural</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.860" end="00:12:05.990" style="s2">design experience how can we actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.790" end="00:12:08.389" style="s2">manage to get to that three and a half</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.990" end="00:12:10.939" style="s2">percent or ten percent whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.389" end="00:12:14.089" style="s2">that&#39;s required to create an avalanche</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.939" end="00:12:19.670" style="s2">of change into a new paradigm having</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.089" end="00:12:23.269" style="s2">people gone through this experience I I</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.670" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">don&#39;t think I know one answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.269" end="00:12:30.310" style="s2">but what I do know is that that what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:33.860" style="s2">just said raises the question for me of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.310" end="00:12:35.899" style="s2">he said if we let all that in we&#39;d go</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.860" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">crazy my question would be haven&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.899" end="00:12:42.019" style="s2">gone crazy already that we&#39;ve grown numb</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:53.000" style="s2">to that and really right yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.019" end="00:12:58.040" style="s2">and so I in that sense I think not so</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.000" end="00:13:02.920" style="s2">much has changed we needed to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.040" end="00:13:05.839" style="s2">drastically build community resilience</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.920" end="00:13:09.110" style="s2">for food sovereignty energy sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.839" end="00:13:13.790" style="s2">water sovereignty education basic needs</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.110" end="00:13:18.350" style="s2">of people in place in ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.790" end="00:13:21.140" style="s2">that ideally would be oriented in such a</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.350" end="00:13:24.140" style="s2">way that they actually heal local</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.140" end="00:13:26.770" style="s2">ecosystems that they reconnect local</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.140" end="00:13:30.470" style="s2">communities with each other that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.770" end="00:13:33.470" style="s2">wherever possible connect spare capacity</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.470" end="00:13:37.270" style="s2">and unmet needs at the bio regional</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.470" end="00:13:41.300" style="s2">scale to create really vibrant</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.270" end="00:13:43.670" style="s2">mechanisms of providing for each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.300" end="00:13:45.800" style="s2">and for that place so that place can</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.670" end="00:13:47.930" style="s2">provide for us in the long term and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.800" end="00:13:51.140" style="s2">there and we and this is also a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.930" end="00:13:53.990" style="s2">technological why is use of technology</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.140" end="00:13:56.510" style="s2">of understanding what technologies to</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.990" end="00:13:58.070" style="s2">use and what not to use and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.510" end="00:14:00.950" style="s2">what&#39;s important and what this has</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.070" end="00:14:06.590" style="s2">driven us much more the crisis is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.950" end="00:14:08.900" style="s2">we have at a crossroads between being</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.590" end="00:14:10.550" style="s2">informed by a deeper ethic like I know</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.900" end="00:14:12.140" style="s2">you you know we&#39;re both involved with</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.550" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">the earth charter I think this would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.140" end="00:14:15.500" style="s2">the moment to really bring out the Earth</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:18.110" style="s2">Charter again and say we actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.500" end="00:14:22.010" style="s2">base line of an ethics document that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.110" end="00:14:23.960" style="s2">aspire to live by as a human species mmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.010" end="00:14:26.450" style="s2">because it&#39;s precisely like for me</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.960" end="00:14:27.950" style="s2">that&#39;s the hopeful fact is that then</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.450" end="00:14:30.110" style="s2">almost all around the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.950" end="00:14:32.570" style="s2">the initial response to this of</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.110" end="00:14:35.540" style="s2">governments was to protect the elderly</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.570" end="00:14:37.400" style="s2">and the weak and not to protect the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.540" end="00:14:39.530" style="s2">economy I mean this they had a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.400" end="00:14:41.750" style="s2">slow response in making that ethical</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.530" end="00:14:45.410" style="s2">choice but they made the ethical choice</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.750" end="00:14:47.690" style="s2">we we are driving the economies against</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.410" end="00:14:50.450" style="s2">the wall fast something that that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.690" end="00:14:52.940" style="s2">thought when that we had asked to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.450" end="00:14:55.910" style="s2">because we&#39;d said this economy is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.940" end="00:14:56.750" style="s2">destructive and deadly but they said no</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.910" end="00:14:59.420" style="s2">that&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.750" end="00:15:02.360" style="s2">with regard to the diffuse threat of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.420" end="00:15:04.670" style="s2">climate change that was already killing</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.360" end="00:15:06.590" style="s2">more people and will kill many more</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.670" end="00:15:10.370" style="s2">people if we don&#39;t do anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.590" end="00:15:12.500" style="s2">but now the initial response was an</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.370" end="00:15:15.320" style="s2">ethical one and and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.500" end="00:15:17.510" style="s2">also something to be hopeful about but</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.320" end="00:15:19.580" style="s2">now we are at this crossroads of saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.510" end="00:15:22.460" style="s2">my people are celebrating the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.580" end="00:15:24.380" style="s2">response and suddenly that all these</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.460" end="00:15:25.280" style="s2">voices of our how good if you just have</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.380" end="00:15:27.860" style="s2">everybody connected</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.280" end="00:15:30.590" style="s2">to AI completely and utterly observable</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.860" end="00:15:32.570" style="s2">through their smartphones 24/7 with</p>

<p begin="00:15:38.210" end="00:15:46.100" style="s2">become not desirable anymore remotely</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.160" end="00:15:48.370" style="s2">yeah and then that&#39;s a wonderful step</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.100" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">because we can respond to things like</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.370" end="00:15:54.440" style="s2">epidemics very rapidly yeah it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:56.450" style="s2">world I want to live in and it&#39;s if me</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.440" end="00:15:58.100" style="s2">don&#39;t speak up that&#39;s the only reason</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.450" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">why I&#39;m not keeping my mouth shut in</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.100" end="00:16:01.070" style="s2">this situation because I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.360" end="00:16:03.260" style="s2">worried I was just saying something</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.070" end="00:16:05.210" style="s2">stupid at this point because most people</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.260" end="00:16:08.120" style="s2">I listen to out there saying stupid</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.210" end="00:16:10.070" style="s2">things because we don&#39;t know what this</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.120" end="00:16:13.100" style="s2">is going to bring but I&#39;ve made the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.070" end="00:16:17.570" style="s2">decision to not completely shut up and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.100" end="00:16:19.250" style="s2">sit and listen because of now my clients</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.570" end="00:16:21.590" style="s2">little announcement of one child for</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.250" end="00:16:24.920" style="s2">Colonia Corona capitalism and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.590" end="00:16:27.500" style="s2">reminder that there are lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.920" end="00:16:31.400" style="s2">out there who will use this crisis also</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.500" end="00:16:34.610" style="s2">to erode civil liberties even more and</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.400" end="00:16:37.220" style="s2">to implement control from top down even</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.610" end="00:16:39.950" style="s2">more and if we don&#39;t also have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.220" end="00:16:42.310" style="s2">deeper conversation at this point we</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.950" end="00:16:43.520" style="s2">might wake up coming out of our</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.310" end="00:16:46.510" style="s2">lockdowns</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.520" end="00:16:50.930" style="s2">into a different world if we we need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.510" end="00:16:59.420" style="s2">ask these civil liberties to be held</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.930" end="00:17:01.280" style="s2">high and and so yeah for me that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.420" end="00:17:04.010" style="s2">we need global solidarity and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.280" end="00:17:07.670" style="s2">address the issue that as we re</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.010" end="00:17:09.709" style="s2">regionalize we have to watch out for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.670" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">people who are weary generalizing next</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.709" end="00:17:14.930" style="s2">to us shoulder to shoulder because some</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:18.189" style="s2">of them are xenophobic Nazis and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.930" end="00:17:21.290" style="s2">not save the planet and save humanity</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.189" end="00:17:23.990" style="s2">people at this point there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.290" end="00:17:26.930" style="s2">riri generalizing pulling back America</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.990" end="00:17:30.770" style="s2">first this bioregion first this little</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.930" end="00:17:32.870" style="s2">neighborhood first and of course we need</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.770" end="00:17:35.000" style="s2">to meet our needs first but in a much</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.870" end="00:17:38.870" style="s2">wiser like the way that the indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.000" end="00:17:40.309" style="s2">people say wise decisions have to serve</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.870" end="00:17:41.720" style="s2">yourself they have to serve your</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.309" end="00:17:43.250" style="s2">community and they have to serve the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.720" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">planet they have to serve at all three</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.250" end="00:17:49.190" style="s2">levels and and as what I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:52.700" style="s2">about is that there will be a push</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.190" end="00:17:57.890" style="s2">towards more regional structures the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.700" end="00:18:01.970" style="s2">virus is forcing them upon us now but in</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.890" end="00:18:05.059" style="s2">hungry that is turning into eroding</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.970" end="00:18:08.030" style="s2">democracy and creating another fascist</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.059" end="00:18:13.190" style="s2">dictatorship and and that can happen in</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.030" end="00:18:15.380" style="s2">so many other places so so for me we</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.190" end="00:18:21.410" style="s2">need global solidarity and local action</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.380" end="00:18:23.330" style="s2">we need to not make the mistake that yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.410" end="00:18:28.940" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how long we&#39;re all under</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.330" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">lockdown but I think we can&#39;t afford to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.940" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">look back in four months time saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:37.070" style="s2">well had I known that we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:39.380" style="s2">under lockdown for four months and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.070" end="00:18:42.200" style="s2">in that time the global economic system</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.380" end="00:18:44.600" style="s2">was going to meltdown and everything</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.200" end="00:18:47.929" style="s2">would change well I had acted I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.600" end="00:18:50.270" style="s2">have acted differently in week two three</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.929" end="00:18:53.630" style="s2">four or five or seven of lockdown I</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.270" end="00:18:56.510" style="s2">think it&#39;s wiser to assume that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.630" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">this for at least three to six most</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.510" end="00:19:04.340" style="s2">likely six to 12 or 18 months in</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:06.140" style="s2">different facets and I don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.340" end="00:19:08.480" style="s2">global system to completely melt down</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.140" end="00:19:11.630" style="s2">because that would be quite difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:17.030" style="s2">even find the energy to build a response</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.630" end="00:19:20.210" style="s2">from so let&#39;s not call for that because</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.030" end="00:19:23.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s difficult but but we need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.210" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">still in collaboration with all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.720" end="00:19:27.590" style="s2">people who are now willing to be like to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:31.090" style="s2">collaborate who will even have the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.590" end="00:19:33.890" style="s2">to listen who didn&#39;t before to say hey</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.090" end="00:19:36.020" style="s2">there are certain sensible things to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.890" end="00:19:37.580" style="s2">right now and they are about real</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.020" end="00:19:39.170" style="s2">localizing production and consumption</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.580" end="00:19:41.900" style="s2">and building renewable energy capacity</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.170" end="00:19:44.770" style="s2">and sorting out the way we treat water</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.900" end="00:19:47.240" style="s2">at the local scale in order to give um</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.770" end="00:19:49.340" style="s2">good sanitation and clean drinking water</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.240" end="00:19:51.590" style="s2">to people everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.340" end="00:19:53.120" style="s2">locally and regionally these are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.590" end="00:19:56.210" style="s2">basic things and that&#39;s where the SDGs</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.120" end="00:19:59.090" style="s2">are not that out of a compound they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.210" end="00:20:02.660" style="s2">like all the goals that we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.090" end="00:20:04.460" style="s2">implement bar number eight we we now</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.660" end="00:20:06.620" style="s2">have a wonderful opportunity to make it</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.460" end="00:20:09.350" style="s2">qualitative growth at the regional scale</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.620" end="00:20:13.910" style="s2">rather than exponential economic growth</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.350" end="00:20:16.160" style="s2">and and continued madness yeah it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.910" end="00:20:19.580" style="s2">interesting because we started the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.160" end="00:20:27.860" style="s2">regenerate Costa Rica initiative back in</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.580" end="00:20:29.980" style="s2">mid July 2018 and it has been always a</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.860" end="00:20:32.990" style="s2">difficult situation to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.980" end="00:20:34.850" style="s2">decision-makers in this country because</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.990" end="00:20:39.620" style="s2">most of them are trained or at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.850" end="00:20:44.710" style="s2">Kennedy School or Chicago with with</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.620" end="00:20:49.450" style="s2">exactly that neoliberal market</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.710" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">philosophy we just had a discussion on</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.450" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">networks about the avocado and basically</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:20:57.140" style="s2">the avocado is consumed by the middle</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:21:00.500" style="s2">upper classes of Costa Rica this is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.140" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">an expensive product and a few years ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.500" end="00:21:04.160" style="s2">the government shut down importation</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:07.850" style="s2">from Mexico because of health issues</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.160" end="00:21:10.520" style="s2">with avocado and there has been a</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.850" end="00:21:12.800" style="s2">tremendous movement on on internet</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.520" end="00:21:15.860" style="s2">criticizing the government and actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.800" end="00:21:19.490" style="s2">with legal processes to open up the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.860" end="00:21:22.220" style="s2">marketing and very influential people in</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.490" end="00:21:25.100" style="s2">the decision-making process saying that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.220" end="00:21:28.130" style="s2">this government is totally wrong because</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.100" end="00:21:31.460" style="s2">it&#39;s protective and we should open the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.130" end="00:21:33.170" style="s2">economy even more and if avocados is</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.460" end="00:21:35.330" style="s2">cheaper in Mexico why do they have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.170" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">pay a high price and and these are</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.330" end="00:21:42.410" style="s2">people that go in with 40 $50,000 cars</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.000" end="00:21:45.830" style="s2">to a supermarket to buy and my reaction</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.410" end="00:21:48.950" style="s2">was well you know that the avocado</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.830" end="00:21:50.420" style="s2">Mexico is produced mostly Michoacan by</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.950" end="00:21:52.910" style="s2">destroying native forests</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.420" end="00:21:54.020" style="s2">they&#39;re killing campesino indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.910" end="00:21:57.020" style="s2">leaders that are trying to predict the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.020" end="00:21:59.000" style="s2">land and it&#39;s it&#39;s the the drug industry</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.020" end="00:22:00.500" style="s2">which has taken over there as a laundry</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.000" end="00:22:02.420" style="s2">machine they don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.500" end="00:22:02.970" style="s2">competitive we cannot compete it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.420" end="00:22:06.150" style="s2">free</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.970" end="00:22:07.980" style="s2">market its it&#39;s a biased market because</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.150" end="00:22:10.049" style="s2">they&#39;re not even paying for it for you</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.980" end="00:22:11.970" style="s2">know it&#39;s just a laundry process so of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.049" end="00:22:14.580" style="s2">course they can sell it cheap or or</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.970" end="00:22:17.100" style="s2">chilly then the other one of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.580" end="00:22:19.200" style="s2">person said well I also think Chile has</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.100" end="00:22:20.820" style="s2">good avocado and yeah and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.200" end="00:22:24.179" style="s2">destroyed their ecosystems they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.820" end="00:22:25.470" style="s2">now without water if the cost of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.179" end="00:22:28.169" style="s2">destroying the ecosystem would have been</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.470" end="00:22:30.870" style="s2">built into their avocados they&#39;d be a</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.169" end="00:22:36.809" style="s2">lot higher in price so we have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.870" end="00:22:38.970" style="s2">political tendency to go against the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.809" end="00:22:42.150" style="s2">local production the bioregional</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.169" end="00:23:24.299" style="s2">so I think this this pandemic now is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.289" end="00:23:26.700" style="s2">tremendous opportunity I wish it would</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.299" end="00:23:28.350" style="s2">have come in two or three years where we</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.700" end="00:23:30.539" style="s2">would have had these seven bioregions</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.350" end="00:23:31.679" style="s2">that we&#39;re working on already set up I</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.539" end="00:23:34.169" style="s2">mean we&#39;ve been working on local</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.679" end="00:23:37.020" style="s2">currencies with farmers to enable them</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.169" end="00:23:38.669" style="s2">to survive yeah all of those I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.020" end="00:23:41.309" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot of us who say I wish</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.669" end="00:23:42.929" style="s2">we would have had a little longer and to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.309" end="00:23:44.580" style="s2">prepare a little more of course these</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.929" end="00:23:47.100" style="s2">like even though they&#39;re the work that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.580" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">the regenerative communities network and</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.100" end="00:23:53.280" style="s2">all the bio regions and in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:55.919" style="s2">wider global alliance are doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.280" end="00:23:57.450" style="s2">had it been a few more years along the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.919" end="00:23:59.280" style="s2">lines than we would have a real test</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.450" end="00:24:02.070" style="s2">case of saying how can these structures</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.280" end="00:24:06.299" style="s2">buffer such global collapses and global</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.070" end="00:24:08.070" style="s2">changes and actually come out better</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.299" end="00:24:11.429" style="s2">because they&#39;ve already thought about</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.070" end="00:24:14.730" style="s2">how to build that ecosystem of</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.429" end="00:24:18.460" style="s2">regenerative enterprises that</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.730" end="00:24:21.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t maximize profit but maximizes</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.460" end="00:24:25.090" style="s2">the win-win-win effects across all</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.610" end="00:24:27.460" style="s2">aspects of of the region and and does so</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.090" end="00:24:30.309" style="s2">in global solidarity with other regions</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.460" end="00:24:34.630" style="s2">I think that yeah but but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.309" end="00:24:36.610" style="s2">really we&#39;ve got we were having to serve</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.630" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">the wave and it&#39;s much bigger than we</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.610" end="00:24:45.250" style="s2">all expected it to be quite so quickly</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:46.450" style="s2">and it&#39;s still building right now so</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.250" end="00:24:52.150" style="s2">buddy are you positive about</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.450" end="00:24:58.780" style="s2">regenerative yoga now I&#39;m positive that</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.150" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">that impulse of regeneration is aligned</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.780" end="00:25:06.100" style="s2">with life&#39;s way of creating conditions</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.559" end="00:25:09.309" style="s2">conducive to life and whether you make</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.100" end="00:25:12.190" style="s2">it or not aligning yourself with that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.309" end="00:25:15.490" style="s2">impulse which is to me to my mind the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.190" end="00:25:19.059" style="s2">evolutionary impulse of what our second</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.490" end="00:25:21.580" style="s2">identity not at what Miller and Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.059" end="00:25:24.190" style="s2">are but our second identity as being</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.580" end="00:25:29.169" style="s2">part of this planetary process that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.190" end="00:25:30.789" style="s2">life wanting to continue I&#39;m positive</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.169" end="00:25:35.020" style="s2">that aligning myself with that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.789" end="00:25:38.919" style="s2">meaningful whether what I see at the end</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.020" end="00:25:43.030" style="s2">of my life seems like it was worth it</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.919" end="00:25:45.270" style="s2">for me and and at the same time I still</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.030" end="00:25:49.240" style="s2">think it is meaningful for me in my life</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.270" end="00:25:50.169" style="s2">to now reconnect to place and reconnect</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.240" end="00:25:55.830" style="s2">to my community</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.169" end="00:25:59.080" style="s2">and continue to do what I can to</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.830" end="00:26:01.000" style="s2">facilitate that global solidarity of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.080" end="00:26:04.570" style="s2">people who are wanting to do this</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.000" end="00:26:06.970" style="s2">healing work everywhere I can&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.570" end="00:26:08.799" style="s2">guarantees but I never said we anybody</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.970" end="00:26:13.990" style="s2">could and I think anybody who pretends</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.799" end="00:26:17.740" style="s2">is is kind of over stating the point and</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.990" end="00:26:20.080" style="s2">possibly on an ego trip we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.740" end="00:26:22.090" style="s2">and so I I don&#39;t know whether to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.080" end="00:26:24.330" style="s2">positive but I&#39;m positive that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.090" end="00:26:24.330" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.170" end="00:26:32.030" style="s2">sensible thing to do from where I stand</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:35.860" style="s2">that connecting with life&#39;s impulse to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.030" end="00:26:39.440" style="s2">create plenty of life connecting with</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.860" end="00:26:44.810" style="s2">regenerating my community&#39;s capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.440" end="00:26:46.850" style="s2">meet an uncertain future and to heal the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.810" end="00:26:48.710" style="s2">local ecosystems in ways that might my</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.850" end="00:26:53.180" style="s2">daughter might have a richer rather than</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.710" end="00:26:54.830" style="s2">a pure world to live in and is what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.180" end="00:26:57.230" style="s2">always been committed to and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.830" end="00:27:00.410" style="s2">even more committed to it and and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.230" end="00:27:04.550" style="s2">urgency like I think that change is now</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.410" end="00:27:06.260" style="s2">definitely no longer something that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.550" end="00:27:07.520" style="s2">need to ask for like an aura Bateson has</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.260" end="00:27:10.010" style="s2">if there&#39;s wonderfully like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.520" end="00:27:13.130" style="s2">the notion of being a change maker has</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.010" end="00:27:15.220" style="s2">just kind of been made obsolete change</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.130" end="00:27:17.810" style="s2">made itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.220" end="00:27:21.500" style="s2">now we just need to respond to this</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.810" end="00:27:23.630" style="s2">change wisely and and yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.500" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">weird because I keep saying the right</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.630" end="00:27:29.000" style="s2">response is to shut up and listen and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:30.890" style="s2">yeah I am babbling on about it and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.000" end="00:27:32.960" style="s2">but I try to do a lot of listening at</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.890" end="00:27:36.200" style="s2">the moment because I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:39.860" style="s2">where the wisdom is in in letting it in</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.200" end="00:27:43.190" style="s2">even more so I&#39;d like to I like to bring</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.860" end="00:27:47.030" style="s2">up one last topic before we we had this</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.190" end="00:27:49.250" style="s2">conversation over the years I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.030" end="00:27:52.310" style="s2">lot to do with young people in many</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.250" end="00:27:54.620" style="s2">different countries and first thing I</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.310" end="00:27:56.810" style="s2">always do when I talk with with an</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.620" end="00:27:59.990" style="s2">audience of students I asked who wants</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.810" end="00:28:02.960" style="s2">to be a politician and they all go oh my</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.990" end="00:28:06.490" style="s2">god no that no no then I tell them I</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.960" end="00:28:08.660" style="s2">look if you leave politics to older</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.490" end="00:28:12.980" style="s2">white-haired people like me you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.660" end="00:28:14.180" style="s2">have a future and then I came to to at</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.980" end="00:28:17.390" style="s2">the beginning I could actually not</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.180" end="00:28:19.280" style="s2">really move them but then I came to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.390" end="00:28:22.310" style="s2">conclusion that if I give them hope and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.280" end="00:28:26.300" style="s2">I say we being told that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.310" end="00:28:28.820" style="s2">adapt to a changing planet adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.300" end="00:28:32.390" style="s2">will be important and I say that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.820" end="00:28:36.050" style="s2">biggest lie there is we have to build</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.390" end="00:28:37.560" style="s2">the future we want not adapt to a coming</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.050" end="00:28:41.850" style="s2">future which doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.560" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">and we can and that hope actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.850" end="00:28:48.810" style="s2">engages youth to want to do things to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:51.000" style="s2">want to learn to want to participate it</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.810" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">triggers them from totally I&#39;m not doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.000" end="00:28:59.160" style="s2">anything I&#39;m just here with my Instagram</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:29:03.060" style="s2">to I want to be involved and I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.160" end="00:29:04.050" style="s2">that is a true potential to achieve this</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.060" end="00:29:06.750" style="s2">change we need</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.050" end="00:29:08.460" style="s2">and I I even see it with a even younger</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.750" end="00:29:11.370" style="s2">generations the Millennials are still</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.460" end="00:29:13.710" style="s2">there in between but the younger kids</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.370" end="00:29:16.110" style="s2">they want to build their future and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.710" end="00:29:18.000" style="s2">they&#39;re excited about hey thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.110" end="00:29:19.980" style="s2">saying that and because that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.000" end="00:29:21.720" style="s2">important like is at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.980" end="00:29:24.170" style="s2">designing regenerative cultures that</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.720" end="00:29:27.150" style="s2">were designing and it is that design</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.170" end="00:29:29.970" style="s2">impulse is giving the agency back to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.150" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">each and every one of us to understand</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.970" end="00:29:35.490" style="s2">that we can&#39;t but co-create the future</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:37.290" style="s2">that all our actions and all our in</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.490" end="00:29:42.120" style="s2">actions what we do and what we fail to</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.290" end="00:29:44.550" style="s2">do create the future and that yes I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.120" end="00:29:46.350" style="s2">people like like William William Blake</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.550" end="00:29:48.990" style="s2">said this two hundred fifty years ago</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.350" end="00:29:52.380" style="s2">you must create the system or be</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.990" end="00:29:56.790" style="s2">enslaved by another man&#39;s and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.380" end="00:30:01.290" style="s2">basically we need to be vigilant to what</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.790" end="00:30:03.750" style="s2">the world is people people are accepting</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.290" end="00:30:06.690" style="s2">far too many structures rather than</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.750" end="00:30:08.940" style="s2">taking agency in transforming them and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.690" end="00:30:11.220" style="s2">like well particularly the politics</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.940" end="00:30:13.410" style="s2">issues I was probably blind to that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.220" end="00:30:15.660" style="s2">always thought politics was was a sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.410" end="00:30:20.910" style="s2">of arena for people where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.660" end="00:30:23.640" style="s2">slight ego issue but one of my great</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.910" end="00:30:25.110" style="s2">mentors David all has just recently last</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.640" end="00:30:28.140" style="s2">couple of weeks published a book called</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.750" end="00:30:46.530" style="s2">greatest omission that our movement has</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.360" end="00:30:49.090" style="s2">done that we created NGOs we lobbied</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.530" end="00:30:52.600" style="s2">issues and stuff but we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.090" end="00:30:55.150" style="s2">we create political parties and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.600" end="00:30:58.210" style="s2">enter in the political process and in</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.150" end="00:31:01.570" style="s2">the meantime a lot of people rig it</p>

<p begin="00:33:24.400" end="00:33:32.049" style="s2">um the whole mindset of how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.150" end="00:33:33.640" style="s2">this quickly how do we take this to</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.049" end="00:33:37.690" style="s2">scale all those kind of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.640" end="00:33:42.130" style="s2">they&#39;re there they&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.690" end="00:33:43.660" style="s2">problem as well because the way that a</p>

<p begin="00:34:29.700" end="00:34:34.810" style="s2">what really matters and reconnection and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.859" end="00:34:37.600" style="s2">for me that that is really the deep</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.810" end="00:34:42.369" style="s2">invitation and to just like really sit</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.600" end="00:34:46.780" style="s2">and listen and and also as this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.369" end="00:34:53.320" style="s2">getting worse let the emotions come up</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.780" end="00:34:55.720" style="s2">and then have enough of a zooming out to</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.320" end="00:34:59.410" style="s2">say okay if I&#39;m so touched by what is</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.720" end="00:35:02.850" style="s2">now going on through cope with 19 and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.410" end="00:35:05.350" style="s2">how many people are suffering</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.850" end="00:35:07.150" style="s2">how does this relate to all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.350" end="00:35:10.900" style="s2">suffering that there was that I was just</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.150" end="00:35:13.000" style="s2">simply blind to prior to corporate 19 I</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.900" end="00:35:15.550" style="s2">think that&#39;s a really important jump and</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.000" end="00:35:17.830" style="s2">to understand that that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.550" end="00:35:20.070" style="s2">first of many pandemics if we don&#39;t heal</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.830" end="00:35:22.510" style="s2">the ecosystems because of course</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.070" end="00:35:25.210" style="s2">weakened ecosystems and biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.510" end="00:35:27.130" style="s2">loss create the perfect conditions for</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.210" end="00:35:31.870" style="s2">these kind of pandemics to spread and</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.130" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">for viruses to jump and so so they this</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.870" end="00:35:38.740" style="s2">is all connected and we I think we need</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">to make that connection but Bob right</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.740" end="00:35:49.300" style="s2">now I think really listening is the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:52.090" style="s2">important thing yeah the final come the</p>

<p begin="00:38:49.830" end="00:38:53.190" style="s2">of knowing into this and they I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.570" end="00:38:54.780" style="s2">people might not get this from my</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.190" end="00:38:56.610" style="s2">writing because my writing is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.780" end="00:39:00.410" style="s2">influenced through my academic</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.610" end="00:39:03.420" style="s2">to the point that sometimes doses seems</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.410" end="00:39:05.670" style="s2">very kind of male and academic and so on</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.420" end="00:39:07.860" style="s2">but but actually I think this is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.670" end="00:39:11.100" style="s2">the bridge we need to make to really</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.860" end="00:39:13.530" style="s2">trust our intuitions and our emotions in</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.100" end="00:39:15.780" style="s2">this context informed by good systems</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.530" end="00:39:17.730" style="s2">analysis and systemic lateral thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.780" end="00:39:20.670" style="s2">and all those kind of things but but if</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.730" end="00:39:23.910" style="s2">we if we only covered it too much from</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.670" end="00:39:28.380" style="s2">kind of a project management line and</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.910" end="00:39:32.730" style="s2">without the heart and then I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.380" end="00:39:35.120" style="s2">it&#39;s truly regenerative and also if even</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.730" end="00:39:39.060" style="s2">even within the regenerative movement we</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.120" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">should rigid rigidify what it means</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.060" end="00:39:44.670" style="s2">because it&#39;s for me ultimately it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:46.980" style="s2">evolutionary impulse of life creating</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.670" end="00:39:49.700" style="s2">conditions conducive to life to keep</p>

<p begin="00:39:54.750" end="00:39:59.790" style="s2">serve and that&#39;s a big umbrella and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.200" end="00:40:01.950" style="s2">holds a lot of different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.790" end="00:40:05.280" style="s2">but that&#39;s our strength not a weakness</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.950" end="00:40:08.330" style="s2">um that&#39;s the best closing thank you</p>
