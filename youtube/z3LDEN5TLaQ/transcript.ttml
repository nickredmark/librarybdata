<p begin="00:00:04.339" end="00:00:08.160" style="s2">Charles it&#39;s really good to speak to you</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.690" end="00:00:10.170" style="s2">again we put out a piece with you about</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:11.639" style="s2">a month ago called an epidemic of</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.170" end="00:00:13.740" style="s2">control that seems to have done really</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.639" end="00:00:17.010" style="s2">well since we put that out I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.740" end="00:00:19.529" style="s2">working quite a lot on initially stories</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.010" end="00:00:22.020" style="s2">to do with the David Icke appearance on</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.529" end="00:00:24.269" style="s2">London real and to issues to do with</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.020" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">particularly free speech censorship and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.269" end="00:00:28.289" style="s2">conspiracy theory and as I was working</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.760" end="00:00:31.800" style="s2">on it you brought out another piece</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.289" end="00:00:33.809" style="s2">called the conspiracy myth and you</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.800" end="00:00:35.100" style="s2">echoed so many of the pieces that I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.809" end="00:00:37.760" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been thinking about been</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.100" end="00:00:40.050" style="s2">writing about being making a film about</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.760" end="00:00:41.309" style="s2">so I really wanted to get you on and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.050" end="00:00:43.559" style="s2">maybe we can kind of explore some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.309" end="00:00:45.960" style="s2">these topics together but firstly just</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.559" end="00:00:47.820" style="s2">because I know that people that this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.960" end="00:00:49.739" style="s2">a topic that people get very exercised</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.820" end="00:00:51.539" style="s2">about get very energized about I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.739" end="00:00:53.820" style="s2">well let&#39;s start by unpacking what you</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.539" end="00:00:55.890" style="s2">mean by the conspiracy myth because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:00:59.550" style="s2">think people might kind of react to that</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.890" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">in some way right generally people react</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.550" end="00:01:03.960" style="s2">to it with either a big sigh of relief</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:05.820" style="s2">that I&#39;m not one of those conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.960" end="00:01:10.729" style="s2">people because Here I am calling it a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.820" end="00:01:13.610" style="s2">myth or with indignation because now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.729" end="00:01:16.259" style="s2">smearing them with this epithet of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.610" end="00:01:19.320" style="s2">conspiracy theorists which was in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.259" end="00:01:23.689" style="s2">well who knows what a fact is but was in</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.320" end="00:01:26.759" style="s2">fact invented by the CIA CIA to</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.689" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">discredit people who disagreed with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.759" end="00:01:29.189" style="s2">warren commission&#39;s verdict on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:31.560" style="s2">kennedy assassination</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.189" end="00:01:33.659" style="s2">so yeah really good question what do I</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.560" end="00:01:36.150" style="s2">mean by the conspiracy myth what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.659" end="00:01:39.420" style="s2">by a myth is very different than what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.150" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">mean by a fantasy or delusion I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.420" end="00:01:42.930" style="s2">the key point is that by calling a myth</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">you&#39;re not saying that it&#39;s untrue</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.930" end="00:01:47.850" style="s2">that&#39;s right I mean we right I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.780" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">oh yeah I&#39;m saying that it&#39;s true but</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.850" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">the truth may not be the literal truth</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:54.320" style="s2">it reminds me very much of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">evolutionary biologist Brett Weinstein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.320" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">comment about religion being literally</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">false but metaphorically true and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:05.490" style="s2">Jordan Pederson also talking about myths</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">being almost hyper true or hyper hyper</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.490" end="00:02:11.069" style="s2">objects in some way right yes I would I</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.210" style="s2">would agree with that with that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.069" end="00:02:17.410" style="s2">understanding of it with the caveat</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.210" end="00:02:21.310" style="s2">that the whole idea of literally true is</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.410" end="00:02:25.290" style="s2">itself based on a myth and the myth</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.310" end="00:02:27.900" style="s2">being the myth of objectivity the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.290" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">understanding that it&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.900" end="00:02:33.100" style="s2">narration of what the universe is and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:34.810" style="s2">our relationship to it that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.100" end="00:02:40.620" style="s2">subjective reality outside of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.810" end="00:02:44.140" style="s2">that is unaffected by our story making</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.620" end="00:02:46.030" style="s2">that that the results of experiments are</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.140" end="00:02:48.130" style="s2">unaffected by the kind of experiment and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.030" end="00:02:52.650" style="s2">the intention with which we go into that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.130" end="00:02:56.680" style="s2">experiment so so if you discard that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.650" end="00:03:00.130" style="s2">myth then you know then you&#39;ve opened</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.680" end="00:03:02.910" style="s2">Pandora&#39;s box which that would be like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.130" end="00:03:05.290" style="s2">whole conversation in and of itself but</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.910" end="00:03:08.500" style="s2">yeah like our last conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.290" end="00:03:10.780" style="s2">epidemic of control that from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.500" end="00:03:12.370" style="s2">conspiracy myth and this is another</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.780" end="00:03:16.240" style="s2">illustration of what I mean by it from</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.370" end="00:03:20.200" style="s2">the conspiracy myth the the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.240" end="00:03:23.800" style="s2">is ah there must be somebody in somebody</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.200" end="00:03:28.060" style="s2">in control somebody controlling us let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.800" end="00:03:32.380" style="s2">find those people and do what ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.060" end="00:03:35.530" style="s2">control them so in a way the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.380" end="00:03:40.330" style="s2">myth is part of the epidemic of control</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.530" end="00:03:45.400" style="s2">it&#39;s just identifying the controlling</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.330" end="00:03:47.110" style="s2">force as a group of conspirators and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.400" end="00:03:49.540" style="s2">in in the essay when I what I really</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.110" end="00:03:54.190" style="s2">meant by conspiracy myth is is like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.540" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">arch arch theory that the whole world</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.190" end="00:03:59.220" style="s2">that the workings of the world can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:01.750" style="s2">fundamentally explained by conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.220" end="00:04:04.600" style="s2">there&#39;s somebody behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.750" end="00:04:06.610" style="s2">pulling the strings and that explains</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.600" end="00:04:08.950" style="s2">everything yeah this is such an</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.610" end="00:04:10.480" style="s2">important distinction and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.950" end="00:04:12.910" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we even have language to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.480" end="00:04:15.870" style="s2">express it because there seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.910" end="00:04:18.850" style="s2">be such a qualitative difference between</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.870" end="00:04:21.410" style="s2">conspiracy hypothesis which a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.850" end="00:04:25.370" style="s2">turned out to be true from MKULTRA to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.410" end="00:04:27.350" style="s2">until pro and we&#39;ve put out films on our</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.370" end="00:04:29.690" style="s2">channel about the Epstein case like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.350" end="00:04:31.370" style="s2">looks very much like some kind of big</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.690" end="00:04:34.370" style="s2">structure that Epstein was just the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.370" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">frontman for those sort of things like</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.370" end="00:04:38.660" style="s2">whenever we talk about conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:41.510" style="s2">once we roll those two things together</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.660" end="00:04:43.580" style="s2">we&#39;re in a very difficult place but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.510" end="00:04:47.030" style="s2">think there is a qualitative difference</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.580" end="00:04:51.020" style="s2">between alternative histories collusion</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.030" end="00:04:52.610" style="s2">corruption and what feels to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.020" end="00:04:54.770" style="s2">think we need to bring in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.610" end="00:04:57.080" style="s2">mythopoetic or religious dimension to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.770" end="00:05:00.860" style="s2">understand the latter which is this</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.080" end="00:05:02.540" style="s2">sense of an all-powerful force how do</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.860" end="00:05:04.370" style="s2">you differentiate because that for me is</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.540" end="00:05:07.130" style="s2">one of the central problems in talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.370" end="00:05:09.950" style="s2">about this is we&#39;re rolling it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.130" end="00:05:11.780" style="s2">scientists call it an overloaded turn so</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.950" end="00:05:13.550" style="s2">conspiracy theory is such an overloaded</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.780" end="00:05:17.150" style="s2">turn that it&#39;s very difficult to pull</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.550" end="00:05:21.110" style="s2">apart and talk about right yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.150" end="00:05:23.450" style="s2">mostly it&#39;s a term of derision and I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.110" end="00:05:27.170" style="s2">really like I&#39;m actually even in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.450" end="00:05:33.440" style="s2">conversation I&#39;m noticing what tone of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.170" end="00:05:37.040" style="s2">voice do I adopt when I said the idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.440" end="00:05:38.450" style="s2">that you know a group of evil puppet</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.040" end="00:05:40.280" style="s2">masks I&#39;m not sure what I said but</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.450" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">something like the idea that a group of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.280" end="00:05:43.160" style="s2">evil puppet masters are pulling the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.840" end="00:05:45.380" style="s2">strings and who are and they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.160" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">in control of the world did I say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.380" end="00:05:50.900" style="s2">within neutral turn a neutral tone or</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:52.460" style="s2">did I say that with a derisive tone if I</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.900" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">say it with a derisive tone guess what</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.460" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">I&#39;m doing I am joining the playground</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:03.380" style="s2">bullies and gaining acceptance by</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:07.310" style="s2">displaying the correct attitude of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.380" end="00:06:08.810" style="s2">in-group and I wonder so it&#39;s not and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.310" end="00:06:11.770" style="s2">wonder if you like I read your essay as</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.810" end="00:06:14.870" style="s2">well um which I very much appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.770" end="00:06:17.419" style="s2">for its nuance actually but I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.870" end="00:06:19.400" style="s2">like if you have that impulse sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.419" end="00:06:22.610" style="s2">and if you&#39;re aware of that impulse to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.400" end="00:06:24.470" style="s2">kind of establish your legitimacy by</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.610" end="00:06:28.070" style="s2">criticizing those who are even farther</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.470" end="00:06:31.940" style="s2">out on the fringes than you are because</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.070" end="00:06:33.580" style="s2">I&#39;ve been you know aware of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.940" end="00:06:37.230" style="s2">tendency in myself</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.580" end="00:06:39.580" style="s2">yeah but I do wonder if it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.230" end="00:06:43.630" style="s2">to talk about these things from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.580" end="00:06:45.400" style="s2">completely neutral place at all I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.630" end="00:06:47.680" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to be careful with my</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.400" end="00:06:49.900" style="s2">language while talking about like there</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.680" end="00:06:52.630" style="s2">is for example you can talk about and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.900" end="00:06:54.490" style="s2">have sort of fringe medical figures but</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.630" end="00:06:57.310" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried hard to talk about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.490" end="00:06:58.990" style="s2">context of saying fringe by definition</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.310" end="00:07:01.150" style="s2">not part of the mainstream conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.990" end="00:07:03.880" style="s2">but I&#39;ve also tried to frame it as a way</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.150" end="00:07:06.040" style="s2">by saying we don&#39;t know if this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.880" end="00:07:07.750" style="s2">actually valuable information like there</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.040" end="00:07:09.550" style="s2">have been people that have been medical</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.750" end="00:07:11.050" style="s2">figures coming out and saying for</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.550" end="00:07:12.940" style="s2">example the doctor in New York I quoted</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.050" end="00:07:14.470" style="s2">he said this doesn&#39;t look like you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.940" end="00:07:17.860" style="s2">pneumonia this looks like altitude</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.470" end="00:07:19.710" style="s2">sickness and that then 2-3 weeks later</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.860" end="00:07:22.030" style="s2">was then incorporated into our</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.710" end="00:07:24.340" style="s2">understanding of the disease so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.030" end="00:07:26.370" style="s2">trying to talk about this but even using</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.340" end="00:07:29.350" style="s2">the word fringe for some people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.370" end="00:07:30.940" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of you&#39;re you&#39;re loading</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.350" end="00:07:33.400" style="s2">your terms you&#39;re pushing people out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.940" end="00:07:35.560" style="s2">the conversation so I I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.400" end="00:07:38.140" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to use language accurately</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.560" end="00:07:40.300" style="s2">and not do that in some way I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.140" end="00:07:42.490" style="s2">you&#39;re right I think that the ideal of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.300" end="00:07:46.330" style="s2">impartiality is actually impossible</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.490" end="00:07:48.250" style="s2">because it it almost by definition it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.330" end="00:07:51.160" style="s2">like okay I&#39;m gonna stand on the solid</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.250" end="00:07:53.470" style="s2">ground but nobody even agrees on what</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.160" end="00:07:56.830" style="s2">the solid ground is there&#39;s no consensus</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.470" end="00:07:59.770" style="s2">about what constitutes a legitimate fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.830" end="00:08:00.420" style="s2">and where legitimate facts are to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.770" end="00:08:02.980" style="s2">sourced from</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.420" end="00:08:07.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s I think as long as we</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.980" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">recognize that then at least we have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.480" end="00:08:15.690" style="s2">potential to be aware of our biases and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:18.280" style="s2">even that is is a process of progressive</p>

<p begin="00:09:30.430" end="00:09:34.209" style="s2">it&#39;s really about the culture of the</p>

<p begin="00:09:34.209" end="00:09:39.700" style="s2">they operate in just gonna butt in and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.730" end="00:09:41.740" style="s2">say that I think my the most persuasive</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.700" end="00:09:43.959" style="s2">explanation that I&#39;ve heard of that kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.740" end="00:09:44.950" style="s2">of the institutional decay that I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.959" end="00:09:47.740" style="s2">has happened to a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.950" end="00:09:50.290" style="s2">institutions we put out a film with with</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.740" end="00:09:53.290" style="s2">Eric Weinstein talking about how since</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.290" end="00:09:55.930" style="s2">the 1980s what a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.290" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">institutions have done have effectively</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.930" end="00:10:00.400" style="s2">once you politicize an institution you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:01.990" style="s2">take it away from its main from its main</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.400" end="00:10:04.900" style="s2">function you get people jockeying for</p>

<p begin="00:10:07.540" end="00:10:10.959" style="s2">designed for I think there&#39;s some sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.029" end="00:10:12.580" style="s2">see there</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.959" end="00:10:14.410" style="s2">this is actually an interesting parallel</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.580" end="00:10:15.940" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s that&#39;s the felt</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.410" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">sense that I think a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.940" end="00:10:19.900" style="s2">picking up and that&#39;s why I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:22.630" style="s2">what I think the metaphorical truth of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.900" end="00:10:26.170" style="s2">lot of the conspiracy by the overarching</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.630" end="00:10:28.300" style="s2">conspiracy narratives are is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.170" end="00:10:33.520" style="s2">we have these some very very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.300" end="00:10:35.800" style="s2">corrupt fragile hollow systems and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.520" end="00:10:39.190" style="s2">look for example I look at the wire</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.800" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">David Simon&#39;s the wire which he called a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.190" end="00:10:42.700" style="s2">meditation on the death of America where</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:45.339" style="s2">he looked at like what happened to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.700" end="00:10:47.020" style="s2">police force when you&#39;re basically just</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.339" end="00:10:49.540" style="s2">trying to meet the stats rather than to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.020" end="00:10:51.310" style="s2">do your job the parallels between the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.540" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">police and the drug gangs you get</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.310" end="00:10:55.660" style="s2">trapped in these systems of incentive</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:57.400" style="s2">structures and essentially and then he</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.660" end="00:10:58.600" style="s2">looked at the media he looked at</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.400" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">teaching you look to all of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.600" end="00:11:02.470" style="s2">different systems and say</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:06.339" style="s2">they&#39;re all kind of being hollowed out</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.470" end="00:11:07.720" style="s2">at the same time and my sense is we my</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.339" end="00:11:09.700" style="s2">sense is that this is what people are</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.720" end="00:11:12.550" style="s2">picking up on a real felt sense level</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.700" end="00:11:16.660" style="s2">that something is deeply off in society</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.550" end="00:11:18.910" style="s2">and it&#39;s not too it&#39;s not too big a leap</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.660" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">to say okay well who is doing this and</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.910" end="00:11:24.250" style="s2">who is who is gaining from this i</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:26.920" style="s2">totally resonate with that that that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.250" end="00:11:29.889" style="s2">conspiracy myth comes from a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.920" end="00:11:32.110" style="s2">authentic accurate perception that our</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.889" end="00:11:34.000" style="s2">institutions have betrayed us that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.110" end="00:11:35.970" style="s2">they&#39;re not serving their declared</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.000" end="00:11:41.459" style="s2">interests that they have a secret agenda</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.970" end="00:11:48.310" style="s2">that they are the puppets of something</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.459" end="00:11:50.440" style="s2">personally i don&#39;t think that that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.310" end="00:11:52.570" style="s2">are the puppets of a group of evil</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.440" end="00:11:54.630" style="s2">conspirators i think it&#39;s more accurate</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.570" end="00:11:59.860" style="s2">to say that they&#39;re the puppets of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.630" end="00:12:02.620" style="s2">paradigm of a mythology of a set of</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:11.850" style="s2">know that this is what i wrote about in</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.640" end="00:12:14.500" style="s2">the other essay you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.850" end="00:12:17.380" style="s2">civilization defines progress as the</p>

<p begin="00:12:41.140" end="00:12:46.420" style="s2">more and more control or if you have say</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.290" end="00:12:50.410" style="s2">it&#39;s like more mundane lis if you have a</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.260" end="00:14:18.070" style="s2">removing the bad actors yeah my friend</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.100" end="00:14:20.650" style="s2">Peter I think he said something like</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.070" end="00:14:22.480" style="s2">becoming we all have to become</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.650" end="00:14:26.080" style="s2">conspiracy theorists or some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:28.150" style="s2">initiation mm-hmm that it&#39;s part of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.080" end="00:14:29.500" style="s2">kind of world initiation like and we</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.150" end="00:14:31.900" style="s2">have to obviously we have to question</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.500" end="00:14:35.470" style="s2">consensus reality and I think those of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.900" end="00:14:36.810" style="s2">us who&#39;ve been in sort of what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.470" end="00:14:40.540" style="s2">have a better word than spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.810" end="00:14:42.370" style="s2">communities to kind of to go with that</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.540" end="00:14:44.920" style="s2">but those of us who&#39;ve been in those</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.370" end="00:14:46.780" style="s2">kind of communities questioning</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.920" end="00:14:48.910" style="s2">consensus reality is is such an</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.780" end="00:14:50.410" style="s2">important part of that and awakening to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.910" end="00:14:52.570" style="s2">something deeper and awakening to some</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.410" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">deeper sense of what humanity is and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.570" end="00:14:57.670" style="s2">what our potentials are but then I guess</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:59.740" style="s2">that struggle as difficulty is not to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.670" end="00:15:01.720" style="s2">collapse into another fixed narrative on</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.740" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">the other side of that awakening which</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.720" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">is what I&#39;ve seen a lot of can happen</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:07.810" style="s2">very easily once we&#39;ve had those</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:09.880" style="s2">experiences we can have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.810" end="00:15:13.450" style="s2">shattering an old world view but what we</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.880" end="00:15:15.640" style="s2">often do is we reform an equally solid</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.450" end="00:15:18.460" style="s2">world view around some new material that</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.640" end="00:15:20.560" style="s2">then just kind of it&#39;s part of the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.460" end="00:15:22.300" style="s2">problem in a way rather than allowing</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.560" end="00:15:23.580" style="s2">ourselves to remain open to uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.300" end="00:15:27.210" style="s2">and an open</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.580" end="00:15:28.980" style="s2">to the journey totally and often that</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.210" end="00:15:32.610" style="s2">new world view is actually the old world</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.980" end="00:15:34.860" style="s2">view in coded form it&#39;s just a different</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.610" end="00:15:37.740" style="s2">form of the same thing and the real</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.860" end="00:15:40.380" style="s2">initiation or like maybe I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.740" end="00:15:45.390" style="s2">another stage of the initiation is you</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.380" end="00:15:48.990" style="s2">you you go from the default consensus</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.390" end="00:15:50.910" style="s2">reality to you know a conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.990" end="00:15:53.370" style="s2">or a cult you know it could be anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.910" end="00:15:54.900" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the receiving room for</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.370" end="00:15:56.520" style="s2">people who have left the old story and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.900" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">then you&#39;re like actually that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.520" end="00:16:00.450" style="s2">working either like that has some of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:03.180" style="s2">same limitations and so you go to</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.450" end="00:16:07.530" style="s2">another one another one and that process</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.180" end="00:16:10.440" style="s2">is the is is it&#39;s a series of stepping</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.530" end="00:16:12.840" style="s2">stones into the unknown into the place</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.440" end="00:16:16.140" style="s2">of being comfortable with uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.840" end="00:16:23.940" style="s2">and looking at the parts of you that</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.140" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">yeah that you&#39;ve kept at bay by offering</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.940" end="00:16:30.030" style="s2">them certainty what comes up when you</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">allow yourself to be in uncertainty when</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.030" end="00:16:35.400" style="s2">you allow yourself not to know that one</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:38.160" style="s2">that requires undoing some pretty deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.400" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">programming in our school system for</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.160" end="00:16:42.060" style="s2">example you&#39;re rewarded for knowing</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:46.470" style="s2">you&#39;re rewarded for producing the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.060" end="00:16:48.480" style="s2">correct answer not knowing is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.470" end="00:16:51.660" style="s2">that&#39;s a new habit and we have an entire</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.480" end="00:16:54.060" style="s2">scientific ideology that says that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.660" end="00:16:56.940" style="s2">humanity is converging closer and closer</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.060" end="00:16:58.650" style="s2">to the literal objective truth that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.940" end="00:17:01.890" style="s2">are approaching a theory of everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.650" end="00:17:06.560" style="s2">of the universe and a technological</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.890" end="00:17:10.740" style="s2">system that that says once we order and</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.560" end="00:17:13.980" style="s2">fix a number to each object in the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.740" end="00:17:16.110" style="s2">and each person in the world we convert</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.980" end="00:17:18.930" style="s2">everything into data then we will be</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.110" end="00:17:24.240" style="s2">able to rationally and optimally manage</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.930" end="00:17:26.910" style="s2">this world so this this prejudice toward</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.240" end="00:17:29.970" style="s2">knowing and the punishments we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.910" end="00:17:33.510" style="s2">received for not knowing these these</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.970" end="00:17:37.290" style="s2">constitute a deep programming that</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.510" end="00:17:43.280" style="s2">really takes some courage and some</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.290" end="00:17:47.190" style="s2">community to undo to be okay with maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.280" end="00:17:49.470" style="s2">nobody knows and it&#39;s okay not to know</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.190" end="00:17:51.750" style="s2">for a while I really like that Charles</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.470" end="00:17:54.870" style="s2">because it it seems that that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.750" end="00:17:56.970" style="s2">the failure conditions right now of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.870" end="00:17:59.550" style="s2">politics of journalism as of all these</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.970" end="00:18:02.010" style="s2">different areas is this people who are</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.550" end="00:18:03.630" style="s2">claiming to know things like this air of</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.010" end="00:18:05.610" style="s2">certainty that everyone seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.630" end="00:18:07.170" style="s2">coming in with and it&#39;s just falling</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.610" end="00:18:09.660" style="s2">apart it&#39;s just being obviously</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.170" end="00:18:13.500" style="s2">challenged because especially under the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.660" end="00:18:15.350" style="s2">influence or impact of so much novelty</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.500" end="00:18:19.140" style="s2">that we&#39;re seeing with the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.350" end="00:18:21.330" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s in a public any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.140" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">public role who is claiming certainty</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.330" end="00:18:26.270" style="s2">and they they sort of claim certainty</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">like a kind of defensive posture</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.270" end="00:18:30.560" style="s2">everyone is starting to see through that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:33.570" style="s2">now and it feels like that particular</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.560" end="00:18:36.360" style="s2">mentality is is what we&#39;re seeing being</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.570" end="00:18:39.330" style="s2">tested to destruction right now it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.360" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">affectation like I come from from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.330" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">traditional media and I think that more</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:47.040" style="s2">than anything is what people pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:49.550" style="s2">um really distrust is this sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.040" end="00:18:51.810" style="s2">voice from nowhere this sense of instant</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.550" end="00:18:53.100" style="s2">expertise on a subject that probably the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.810" end="00:18:56.340" style="s2">journalist has just started researching</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.100" end="00:19:00.210" style="s2">that morning all of those things like</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.340" end="00:19:02.460" style="s2">that air of defensive certainty just</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.210" end="00:19:04.680" style="s2">seems to be something that&#39;s being that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.460" end="00:19:06.420" style="s2">that to me is like right at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.680" end="00:19:08.730" style="s2">what&#39;s being undermined and dissolving</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.420" end="00:19:12.270" style="s2">right now yeah especially when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.730" end="00:19:15.690" style="s2">from the elites from from you know</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.690" end="00:19:21.720" style="s2">authority because I think with very very</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:25.710" style="s2">good reason over the last few decades</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.720" end="00:19:29.840" style="s2">people have been in growing distrust of</p>

<p begin="00:20:50.489" end="00:20:56.700" style="s2">might have in 1965 well I think is I</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.989" end="00:20:59.129" style="s2">think that centrally important to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.700" end="00:21:01.739" style="s2">recognize where we are thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.129" end="00:21:03.960" style="s2">religious terms and how frequently we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.739" end="00:21:07.169" style="s2">thinking in religious kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.960" end="00:21:12.119" style="s2">mythological language because my sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.169" end="00:21:13.710" style="s2">is with with the most again we come to</p>

<p begin="00:21:13.710" end="00:21:17.700" style="s2">what I&#39;m thinking about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.940" end="00:21:20.159" style="s2">all-encompassing conspiracy theories for</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.700" end="00:21:21.509" style="s2">example David Icke talks about a</p>

<p begin="00:21:24.690" end="00:21:29.820" style="s2">like those for me feel qualitatively</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.499" end="00:21:32.339" style="s2">whatever the word is the sort of it all</p>

<p begin="00:21:32.339" end="00:21:37.019" style="s2">in on this side of it what I find really</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.649" end="00:21:39.179" style="s2">fascinating about those is that even</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.019" end="00:21:41.489" style="s2">though you could argue that there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.179" end="00:21:45.690" style="s2">dark material in there there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.489" end="00:21:47.429" style="s2">the idea of sort of evil evil cult evil</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.690" end="00:21:48.869" style="s2">small groups of people they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.429" end="00:21:51.239" style="s2">wrapped your ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.869" end="00:21:54.149" style="s2">because they&#39;re saying if only we could</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.239" end="00:21:56.609" style="s2">expose this defined group of people then</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.149" end="00:21:59.460" style="s2">the better world is just the other side</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.609" end="00:22:01.229" style="s2">of that if we could only only kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.460" end="00:22:04.260" style="s2">overthrow the Cabal if we could only</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.229" end="00:22:07.080" style="s2">expose this evil cult and it could have</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.260" end="00:22:10.049" style="s2">today it could happen tomorrow utopia is</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.080" end="00:22:12.500" style="s2">at hand like the deep Christian roots of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.049" end="00:22:16.169" style="s2">a worldview like that I think have to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.500" end="00:22:19.890" style="s2">really made explicit and and seen for</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.169" end="00:22:21.540" style="s2">what it is because I&#39;d like if only the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.890" end="00:22:25.250" style="s2">world was that simple if only it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.540" end="00:22:27.809" style="s2">that easy to achieve utopia</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.250" end="00:22:31.080" style="s2">totally I mean that&#39;s a perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.809" end="00:22:33.900" style="s2">of the new story being actually the old</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.080" end="00:22:37.020" style="s2">story in different form the old story</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.900" end="00:22:41.280" style="s2">being progress through the conquest of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.020" end="00:22:42.510" style="s2">evil the conspiracy narrative is very</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.280" end="00:22:46.049" style="s2">much the same you know it&#39;s we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.510" end="00:22:48.690" style="s2">expose the core of evil and overthrow it</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.049" end="00:22:53.880" style="s2">and a better world paradise will be at</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.690" end="00:22:58.760" style="s2">hand the dominant story is the same evil</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.880" end="00:23:04.500" style="s2">taking the guise of chaos of the wild of</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.760" end="00:23:07.260" style="s2">the the you know the germs the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.500" end="00:23:09.559" style="s2">unruliness of nature the natural forces</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.260" end="00:23:13.309" style="s2">that are indifferent to human well-being</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.559" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">that was in fact the the concept of evil</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.309" end="00:23:21.470" style="s2">was originally associated with chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:24.510" style="s2">the wild there are like ancient Sumerian</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.470" end="00:23:26.970" style="s2">inscriptions to this effect but that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.510" end="00:23:29.309" style="s2">know the good king goes out and conquers</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.970" end="00:23:32.540" style="s2">the barbarians drains the wetlands cuts</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.309" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">down the forests slays the wild beasts</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.540" end="00:23:38.460" style="s2">who are become like the wolf the big bad</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:42.270" style="s2">wolf they are evil and the Sheep is good</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.460" end="00:23:43.559" style="s2">the weeds are evil the corn is good the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.270" end="00:23:45.690" style="s2">barbarians are evil</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.559" end="00:23:49.140" style="s2">the civilized people are good that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.690" end="00:23:53.250" style="s2">where evil came from as a concept so so</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.140" end="00:23:55.919" style="s2">and and it and it leads to an ideology</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.250" end="00:23:59.100" style="s2">of progress through domination because</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.919" end="00:24:03.179" style="s2">we&#39;re always good you know and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.100" end="00:24:05.400" style="s2">evil so yeah it mutates into conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.179" end="00:24:07.820" style="s2">theory but in my view that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.400" end="00:24:11.130" style="s2">actually a very fundamental revolution</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.820" end="00:24:12.870" style="s2">it&#39;s still exploring the territory of</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.130" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">separation of</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.870" end="00:24:23.040" style="s2">troll and and to molt beyond that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.600" end="00:24:26.220" style="s2">have to go through the territory of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.040" end="00:24:29.490" style="s2">again unknowing so yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.220" end="00:24:34.050" style="s2">very perceptive David that um you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.490" end="00:24:36.870" style="s2">the the coded judeo-christian dimension</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.050" end="00:24:39.930" style="s2">to their conspiracy theories I wondered</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.870" end="00:24:41.520" style="s2">whether you also get the sense that this</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.930" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">kind I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:44.940" style="s2">phenomenon but it certainly seems to</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:48.110" style="s2">have accelerated under the under the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.940" end="00:24:50.309" style="s2">kind of impact of the pandemic of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.110" end="00:24:53.010" style="s2">spiritual communities new age</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.309" end="00:24:55.380" style="s2">communities like it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.010" end="00:24:57.620" style="s2">nowadays to see to kind of tell where</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.380" end="00:25:00.120" style="s2">some kind of all-encompassing conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.620" end="00:25:02.190" style="s2">narrative has come from whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.120" end="00:25:03.890" style="s2">come from sort of the more traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.190" end="00:25:08.340" style="s2">kind of pro-trump</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.890" end="00:25:10.530" style="s2">right-wing sources or it could have come</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.340" end="00:25:13.290" style="s2">from sort of more left weighing natural</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.530" end="00:25:17.340" style="s2">news New Age places but there seems to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.290" end="00:25:20.220" style="s2">be this coming together of the of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.340" end="00:25:22.230" style="s2">narratives in a really strange way if</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.220" end="00:25:24.870" style="s2">you noticed that accelerates I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.230" end="00:25:25.980" style="s2">tell right from left anymore I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.870" end="00:25:28.230" style="s2">thought it was supposed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.980" end="00:25:30.660" style="s2">leftists that were eating organic food</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.230" end="00:25:33.300" style="s2">and using natural medicine and who doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.660" end="00:25:36.270" style="s2">home births and saying question</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.300" end="00:25:39.990" style="s2">authority don&#39;t trust the man and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.270" end="00:25:42.870" style="s2">now all of that in the in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.990" end="00:25:45.030" style="s2">coded that&#39;s being associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.870" end="00:25:47.190" style="s2">right wing I&#39;m like hold on I thought it</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.030" end="00:25:50.160" style="s2">was the left that was supposed to doubt</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.190" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">Authority and rebel and stuff so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.160" end="00:25:55.950" style="s2">it&#39;s on the bright side I think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:59.100" style="s2">this is pointing through the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.950" end="00:26:02.100" style="s2">of a new populism an authentic populism</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.100" end="00:26:04.620" style="s2">that transcends current political</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.100" end="00:26:06.360" style="s2">categories and that would draw from both</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.620" end="00:26:10.670" style="s2">the left and the right from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.360" end="00:26:13.340" style="s2">anarchists and the libertarians that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.670" end="00:26:17.820" style="s2">basically it&#39;s the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.340" end="00:26:22.350" style="s2">defecting from the the establishment</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.820" end="00:26:23.550" style="s2">from various forms of orthodoxy for you</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.350" end="00:26:26.580" style="s2">know and on the other side are the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.550" end="00:26:29.880" style="s2">people who are who are still bought</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.580" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2">to the orthodoxy and again like this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.880" end="00:26:34.860" style="s2">actually to black and white a picture</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:39.210" style="s2">because almost everybody I know is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.860" end="00:26:43.710" style="s2">rebel in some ways and unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.210" end="00:26:48.019" style="s2">Orthodox in other ways so this is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.710" end="00:26:51.630" style="s2">actually an us-versus-them this is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.019" end="00:26:55.080" style="s2">process that every person on earth is is</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.630" end="00:27:01.250" style="s2">going through this it&#39;s an inner an</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.080" end="00:27:03.360" style="s2">inner split or an inner indeterminacy</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.250" end="00:27:05.370" style="s2">which side am I on</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:07.260" style="s2">actually maybe the reason that people</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.370" end="00:27:09.630" style="s2">are so hostile to those on the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.260" end="00:27:11.010" style="s2">side is because the other side</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.630" end="00:27:15.510" style="s2">represents a shadow part of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.010" end="00:27:18.929" style="s2">that they&#39;re afraid of like there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.510" end="00:27:23.010" style="s2">I&#39;m sure that the most viciously</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.929" end="00:27:26.519" style="s2">Orthodox person harbors an inner rebel</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.010" end="00:27:28.679" style="s2">that is being suppressed harbors part of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.519" end="00:27:32.299" style="s2">them that actually does doubt everything</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.679" end="00:27:35.730" style="s2">that they themselves are saying and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.299" end="00:27:38.820" style="s2">that the fear of that suppressed part</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.730" end="00:27:40.620" style="s2">it&#39;s actually pretty justified because</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.820" end="00:27:43.289" style="s2">that will tear your life apart it will</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.620" end="00:27:46.940" style="s2">tear your identity apartment if you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.289" end="00:27:49.710" style="s2">identified with being right and if your</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.940" end="00:27:51.240" style="s2">position in society depends on you being</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.710" end="00:27:56.149" style="s2">right and depends on this whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.240" end="00:27:59.159" style="s2">worldview being right then the heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.149" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">positions the dissenting narratives</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.159" end="00:28:08.760" style="s2">these are a literal threat to your</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:13.340" style="s2">identity so how how welcome almost it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.760" end="00:28:18.230" style="s2">to have somebody like David Icke as the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.340" end="00:28:23.630" style="s2">projection screen for these suppressed</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.230" end="00:28:26.070" style="s2">shadow rebellious parts that can then be</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.630" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">ridiculed and attacked and the more</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.070" end="00:28:31.649" style="s2">ridiculous he is the better the better</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:35.909" style="s2">he serves that purpose so you see the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.649" end="00:28:38.690" style="s2">the guardians of the orthodoxy</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.909" end="00:28:43.880" style="s2">cherry-picking the most ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.690" end="00:28:47.890" style="s2">of conspiracy theories in order to debt</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.880" end="00:28:51.610" style="s2">to demonstrate the unacceptability of</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.890" end="00:28:54.920" style="s2">what&#39;s actually in themselves as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.610" end="00:28:57.050" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s an interesting comparison I</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.920" end="00:28:59.210" style="s2">mean I obviously that the article that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.050" end="00:29:00.980" style="s2">wrote talked about David I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.210" end="00:29:03.650" style="s2">David Icke in the context of the London</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.980" end="00:29:05.960" style="s2">real interview but I also have this</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.650" end="00:29:08.300" style="s2">sense that David Icke should be part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.960" end="00:29:10.100" style="s2">the conversation he&#39;s been saying he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.300" end="00:29:12.200" style="s2">been saying what he&#39;s been saying for a</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.100" end="00:29:14.330" style="s2">very long time and I don&#39;t get the sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.200" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">with for example with someone like Alex</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.330" end="00:29:18.590" style="s2">Jones who seems to kind of I don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:19.880" style="s2">the sense that he believes a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.590" end="00:29:21.310" style="s2">stuff that he&#39;s saying he&#39;s following</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.880" end="00:29:24.020" style="s2">whatever the audience is wanting</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.310" end="00:29:27.080" style="s2">conspiracy is entertainment David Icke</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.020" end="00:29:29.300" style="s2">has been kind of true to his stuck to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.080" end="00:29:31.190" style="s2">his guns for about thirty years and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.300" end="00:29:34.970" style="s2">don&#39;t think he can be kept out he can be</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.190" end="00:29:37.250" style="s2">kind of gate keep gate heaped gate kept</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.970" end="00:29:39.710" style="s2">out of the conversation in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.250" end="00:29:41.090" style="s2">he has been in the cast yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.710" end="00:29:45.470" style="s2">part of me resonates with it let me say</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.090" end="00:29:49.480" style="s2">like part of me feels almost a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.470" end="00:29:51.890" style="s2">relief at the idea that there is this</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.480" end="00:29:56.890" style="s2">Luciferian cult that controls the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.890" end="00:30:01.640" style="s2">and standing behind them negative aliens</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.890" end="00:30:04.520" style="s2">and demonic beings the part of me that</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.640" end="00:30:08.330" style="s2">breathes a sigh of relief is the part</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.520" end="00:30:10.280" style="s2">that then can understand it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.330" end="00:30:13.160" style="s2">of the world not being able to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.280" end="00:30:14.900" style="s2">sense of the world is stressful we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.160" end="00:30:17.570" style="s2">especially in this civilization that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.900" end="00:30:22.220" style="s2">so predicated on control so what David</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.570" end="00:30:25.940" style="s2">Icke offers is is a sense making</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.220" end="00:30:29.810" style="s2">narrative that delivers people from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.940" end="00:30:31.460" style="s2">uncomfortable state of uncertainty but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.810" end="00:30:35.860" style="s2">think actually what we need is to stay</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.460" end="00:30:40.490" style="s2">in the uncertainty even more that said</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.860" end="00:30:44.210" style="s2">you know so so basically so I am weary</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.490" end="00:30:48.170" style="s2">of the part of me that wants to leap</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.210" end="00:30:50.780" style="s2">into a new sense a new meaning a new</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.170" end="00:30:52.509" style="s2">story to replace the one that I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.780" end="00:30:57.980" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.509" end="00:30:59.980" style="s2">the conventional one you know where well</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.980" end="00:31:02.690" style="s2">ma&#39;am I&#39;m not going to try to recite it</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.980" end="00:31:06.470" style="s2">however another thing though is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.690" end="00:31:09.470" style="s2">that a lot of the data points that he</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.470" end="00:31:14.419" style="s2">weaves into his narrative deserve</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.470" end="00:31:16.490" style="s2">attention there are lower level</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.419" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">conspiracies that actually like we were</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.490" end="00:31:19.480" style="s2">saying like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:23.509" style="s2">conspiracies actually do happen and</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.480" end="00:31:25.610" style="s2">governments lie corporations lie we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.509" end="00:31:28.999" style="s2">no one should have any doubt that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.610" end="00:31:31.789" style="s2">happens and and to look into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.999" end="00:31:33.799" style="s2">possibility that the extent of their</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.789" end="00:31:37.809" style="s2">line could be a lot bigger than the ones</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.799" end="00:31:41.710" style="s2">that we found out about and David Icke</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.809" end="00:31:47.539" style="s2">brings light to some of those things and</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.710" end="00:31:49.009" style="s2">that and and helps helps like another</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.539" end="00:31:51.019" style="s2">positive thing that he&#39;s doing is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.009" end="00:31:57.110" style="s2">he&#39;s offering people and expanded</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.019" end="00:32:00.019" style="s2">reality our art our world&#39;s problems are</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.110" end="00:32:03.919" style="s2">actually technically easy to solve if</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.019" end="00:32:06.669" style="s2">only we expanded the scope of of what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.919" end="00:32:09.980" style="s2">understand to be a legitimate solution</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.669" end="00:32:11.619" style="s2">if we expanded medicine to include all</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.980" end="00:32:15.409" style="s2">of the holistic and alternative</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.619" end="00:32:17.059" style="s2">medicines that I mean I know from</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.409" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">firsthand experience secondhand</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.059" end="00:32:22.450" style="s2">experience that they work and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:26.600" style="s2">even a lot of scientific research like</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.450" end="00:32:28.899" style="s2">artemisia annua is is is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.600" end="00:32:32.649" style="s2">well-established anti-malarial drug and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.899" end="00:32:36.860" style="s2">it&#39;s the mechanism by which it</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.649" end="00:32:38.090" style="s2">interferes with blood-borne viruses I</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.860" end="00:32:39.889" style="s2">can&#39;t actually remember I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.090" end="00:32:41.450" style="s2">want to pretend to be scientific here</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.889" end="00:32:44.869" style="s2">but there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of science</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.450" end="00:32:46.490" style="s2">behind it let me just say that so like</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.869" end="00:32:47.929" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s so many data points and</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.490" end="00:32:50.059" style="s2">I don&#39;t know like personally if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.929" end="00:32:53.690" style="s2">experienced things in your own life that</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.059" end="00:32:58.009" style="s2">the dominant story of the world encoded</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.690" end="00:33:01.369" style="s2">in science says are impossible I have so</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.009" end="00:33:02.620" style="s2">and many people have like people have</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.369" end="00:33:04.450" style="s2">experienced in</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.620" end="00:33:07.150" style="s2">precognitive dreams and psychic</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.450" end="00:33:09.520" style="s2">phenomena and mystical experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.150" end="00:33:12.220" style="s2">anomalous healings and just like like</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.520" end="00:33:13.330" style="s2">like incredible synchronicities that</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.220" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">blow your mind</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.330" end="00:33:19.480" style="s2">and I think that and experiences with</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:24.250" style="s2">indigenous people and those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.480" end="00:33:27.090" style="s2">technologies I think we need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.250" end="00:33:30.760" style="s2">that in I think that our our</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.090" end="00:33:34.299" style="s2">civilizations impasse requires that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.760" end="00:33:38.380" style="s2">reach outside of the world&#39;s story that</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.299" end="00:33:42.039" style="s2">we&#39;ve operated so the the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.380" end="00:33:44.169" style="s2">myth helps us to open to a larger world</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.039" end="00:33:46.659" style="s2">story because it&#39;s saying things are not</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.169" end="00:33:49.510" style="s2">as they seem and that is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.659" end="00:33:51.940" style="s2">psychic truths that takes form in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.510" end="00:33:55.210" style="s2">conspiracy theory even if the details</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.940" end="00:34:01.390" style="s2">are not literally true that that psychic</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.210" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">truth is crying for attention you get</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.390" end="00:34:09.460" style="s2">into these into these realms that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.559" end="00:34:13.750" style="s2">beyond what we recognize as proven</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.460" end="00:34:16.929" style="s2">provable or disprovable and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.750" end="00:34:19.210" style="s2">engage those realms this is beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.929" end="00:34:25.290" style="s2">scope of journalism it&#39;s more entering</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.210" end="00:34:31.990" style="s2">the scope of a fiction of poetry and</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.290" end="00:34:34.060" style="s2">fiction and poetry I think are essential</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.990" end="00:34:37.589" style="s2">they&#39;ve been kind of marginalized as</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.060" end="00:34:40.869" style="s2">entertainment today but they are</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.589" end="00:34:44.139" style="s2">essential organs of human knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.869" end="00:34:47.169" style="s2">we also need to bring in so I&#39;m I&#39;m when</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.139" end="00:34:50.859" style="s2">I call something a myth that is not to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.169" end="00:34:53.109" style="s2">devalue it I honored David Icke for his</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.859" end="00:34:55.839" style="s2">work and Lisa Renee and all these other</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.109" end="00:34:57.910" style="s2">people for their work in telling us a</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.839" end="00:35:01.560" style="s2">myth and elaborating a myth in giving</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.910" end="00:35:06.130" style="s2">some form to hidden psychic truths and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.560" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">repressed social truths find it</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.130" end="00:35:11.140" style="s2">interesting as well that these</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:12.970" style="s2">alternative narratives these myths are</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.140" end="00:35:14.890" style="s2">coming up in the middle of what is</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.970" end="00:35:16.690" style="s2">effectively a really liminal space for</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.890" end="00:35:19.510" style="s2">everyone like we just get this</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.690" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">of the worlds between or the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.510" end="00:35:23.890" style="s2">distance between these worlds are</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:25.390" style="s2">growing ever thinner we&#39;re in a liminal</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.890" end="00:35:29.140" style="s2">we&#39;re all going through some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.390" end="00:35:33.250" style="s2">liminal initiation experience in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.140" end="00:35:37.630" style="s2">middle of this yeah and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.250" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">gonna this is just the first step things</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.630" end="00:35:39.990" style="s2">might go somewhat back to normal for a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:44.609" style="s2">little while</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.990" end="00:35:46.810" style="s2">but we&#39;re just getting a taste of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.609" end="00:35:52.859" style="s2">dissolving of what we thought was real</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.810" end="00:35:55.750" style="s2">and permanent in normal I think I agree</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.859" end="00:35:57.099" style="s2">Charles thank you very much for making</p>
