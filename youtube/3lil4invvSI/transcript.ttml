<p begin="00:01:04.479" end="00:01:08.960" style="s2">focused talking about sense making</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.799" end="00:01:10.479" style="s2">and we won&#39;t forget that sense making is</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.960" end="00:01:12.640" style="s2">principally important due to its</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.479" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">relationship to decision making and</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:18.080" style="s2">action taking so daniel welcome back</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.520" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">discussion today</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:25.360" style="s2">yeah i think it&#39;s going to be great and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">needless to say it&#39;s highly timely</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.360" end="00:01:29.119" style="s2">so why is sense making so important</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:31.520" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.119" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">why i think sense making is always</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.520" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">is uh we can look at all of the object</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">level problems in the world whether</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about environmental</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:42.320" style="s2">or war pathways to war or infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:46.399" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.320" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">as coordination issues why are humans</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.399" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">choosing the things they do and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.799" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">particularly large-scale behavior</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">type issues and that if we want to solve</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:01:56.079" style="s2">climate</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">change or wealth inequality or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.079" end="00:01:59.119" style="s2">we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">humanity coordinating quite differently</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.119" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">the basis of large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">or collective choice making is</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:06.840" style="s2">collective sense making</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">and our ability to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.840" end="00:02:10.959" style="s2">effectively and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">i think that for instance if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.959" end="00:02:14.879" style="s2">trying to solve climate change</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">and we&#39;re not looking at the attendant</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.879" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">issues that are associated say the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">economic issues or the geopolitical</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">issues so we come up with a solution</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">say if the u.s and europe were to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">implement a particular kind of carbon</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">tax and china wasn&#39;t and there was no</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">enforcement mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">it would have geopolitical ramifications</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:32.879" style="s2">that are also very problematic</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:34.160" style="s2">as long as the solutions we&#39;re coming up</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.879" end="00:02:35.920" style="s2">with to problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.160" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">are based on that kind of partial sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.920" end="00:02:39.599" style="s2">making then you&#39;ll have lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">who care about the thing that is being</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.599" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">harmed by the very partial solution that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:46.080" style="s2">is trying to benefit</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:49.120" style="s2">one thing that actively resist it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.080" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">even if it&#39;s not that even if we had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.120" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">fairly good solution</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.000" end="00:02:53.519" style="s2">but we didn&#39;t have high quality sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:55.040" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.519" end="00:02:56.560" style="s2">generally where a lot of people didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.040" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">understand the issues and we&#39;re against</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:02:59.760" style="s2">it it&#39;s very hard to do anything at</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.760" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2">uh when you&#39;re fighting very high</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">friction of a lot of people disagreeing</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.920" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">not wanting to implement a particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">solution and right now i would say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.879" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">kind of at</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">peak bad sense making where on almost</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:15.760" style="s2">every consequential issue</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">either people have no idea what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.760" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">or they&#39;re very fervent about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:21.599" style="s2">in total polar opposition to other</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:23.599" style="s2">people that think</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.599" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">nearly opposite things and we see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">in the covid time with</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:30.959" style="s2">mass squaring and hydroxychloroquine and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">lockdowns that these got to the level of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.959" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">massive civil tensions in the u.s and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">other places in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">and the question of you know is covid</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">actually an exaggerated mostly hoax or</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">is it a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">very serious pandemic is lockdown the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">appropriate solution or is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">does that cause problems that are much</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">worse than it or</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">is systemic racism the biggest issue in</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">america or really a kind of non-issue</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:03:58.159" style="s2">and what are chinese intentions with</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">regard to the world and how should u.s</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.159" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">relate to it pretty much across all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">the spectrum of all the most critical</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">issues there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">nothing like shared coherent sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">what is true and what should happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">and so not only can we not solve any of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:14.560" style="s2">the problems but then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.799" end="00:04:16.000" style="s2">inherent polarization of the different</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.560" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">views on it becomes its own</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:20.639" style="s2">source of civil breakdown and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">watching a very rapid civil breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">and if we can&#39;t do a better job of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">getting people to be able to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:28.639" style="s2">of the world in a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">coherent way and communicate in a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.639" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">effective way</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">then i think we see civil breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">continue to unravel</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:37.600" style="s2">yep i&#39;m afraid you&#39;re right a couple</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">points i&#39;ll toss in is</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.600" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">you mentioned scale and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">that i think is fundamental when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">about the problem and that the world is</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">now finally coupled on a global basis at</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">high density</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">that&#39;s really only been true since maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">the 1980s if you look at the growth of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">for instance trade</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">world trade previously peaked in 1914</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">and didn&#39;t recover to 1914 levels as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">percentage of gdp until the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">kind of a surprise but true of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">it&#39;s continued to grow since</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:09.039" style="s2">and of course the globalization of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">finance etc</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.039" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">and the fact that we are apparently at</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">or beyond the carrying capacity of the</p>

<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:24.080" style="s2">much more difficult hard enough to</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:33.199" style="s2">mentioned the other and i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">somewhat underappreciated by many people</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">stumbled into a communications</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:47.680" style="s2">designed that it just emerged</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.360" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">right i&#39;m old enough to remember when</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.680" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">there were three tv networks</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:53.440" style="s2">and the typical american household</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">watched one of those three</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.440" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">at any given hour in the evening and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">something like 60 or 70 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">americans</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">got their news from those three tv</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">networks</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">what&#39;s replaced that has been a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">cacophony of voices</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">none of whom have any high status with</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:10.800" style="s2">think the other day we were having a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.479" end="00:07:13.520" style="s2">chat</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.800" end="00:07:14.160" style="s2">i looked up online that breitbart for</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.520" end="00:07:16.560" style="s2">all of its</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.160" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">influence reaches about five million</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:22.319" style="s2">per month so in the old days that would</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">have been considered a fringe network</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.319" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">but because of its ability to propagate</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">on these social networks and email and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">talk radio</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:31.960" style="s2">and all these coupled highly</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">fractionated networks we&#39;re living in an</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.960" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">unprecedented</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:36.479" style="s2">information ecosystem and i think this</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">is a theme i&#39;m going to come back to i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.479" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">be interested to get your thoughts on it</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">that this communications ecosystem is</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:43.759" style="s2">just what you&#39;d think any ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.759" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a platform for evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">stuff&#39;s evolving</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">very rapidly that&#39;s why i said it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">not called for it was not designed</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:55.440" style="s2">it&#39;s just evolving you know no one</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:57.840" style="s2">directed from on high for</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.440" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">zuckerberg to design facebook god knows</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.840" end="00:08:01.759" style="s2">what exact reason he actually did it for</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.840" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">maybe it was just to get laid who knows</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.759" end="00:08:05.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s ended up by good execution and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">by being at the right place and right</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.680" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:11.199" style="s2">to have created an unprecedented way for</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.199" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">people to communicate on a global basis</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.199" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">which we have no experience in dealing</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">with so</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">with those themes out there is ones that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">i&#39;d be interested in getting your</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:21.520" style="s2">thoughts on is</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">global scale complexity and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.520" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">that we have an evolved</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:27.199" style="s2">and radically new communications</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">platform</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.199" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">in which to try to do sense making yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">okay we&#39;ll come back to the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">i&#39;ll start with the communications</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">platform</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">so interesting thing about human</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:46.000" style="s2">communication is even if we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:48.000" style="s2">share true information it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.000" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">decouple it from a gentic interest</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.000" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">so if i&#39;m sharing something with you</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">you&#39;re taking it as something that could</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">inform your better choice</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">making but i&#39;m also taking it as an</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">opportunity to influence your choice</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">in a direction that&#39;s possibly</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">beneficial for me so</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">lying is not a new thing people have</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:06.839" style="s2">lied or at least just created spin or</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">marketing since</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.839" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">forever and you can read sun tzu</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">and see that the whole idea of narrative</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2">that and then as the media technology</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:31.519" style="s2">changed</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.000" end="00:09:34.160" style="s2">the ability to do effective influence</p>

<p begin="00:09:34.160" end="00:09:37.920" style="s2">word you could scale a message much</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">further and then with the gutenberg</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.920" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">press and then with</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:43.040" style="s2">you know various forms of broadcast and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:45.600" style="s2">then</p>

<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">so there&#39;s basically no shared reality</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:25.760" style="s2">democracy just can&#39;t work in an</p>

<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:33.839" style="s2">and so we can see that in the u.s there</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.720" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">is no real</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.839" end="00:11:39.120" style="s2">kind of sense of a who are our</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">that creates national unity and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">ability to have something like a</p>

<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">governance we have instead</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.399" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">so much internal enmity and in-group</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:57.600" style="s2">out-group dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:11:59.600" style="s2">that for the most part more enmity than</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:00.399" style="s2">we have towards any external forces that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.600" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">that&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:03.519" style="s2">driving the breakdown and lack of</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">system as a whole and so when we look at</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">the movement from</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:11.680" style="s2">broadcast to internet and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">things we see is like</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.680" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">you were there you remember well there</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">was this kind of libertarian idea that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">that would be awesome because it would</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:19.839" style="s2">remove the ability of a few</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.320" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">people who held the monopoly on</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.839" end="00:12:23.120" style="s2">broadcast to control the message</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">everyone could put out their own stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.120" end="00:12:26.639" style="s2">through youtube and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">maybe the the best ideas would emerge to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.639" end="00:12:31.600" style="s2">the top which was like</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:34.160" style="s2">a naive hopeful thing because</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.600" end="00:12:35.920" style="s2">when so much content gets produced that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a billion search results for any</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.920" end="00:12:38.639" style="s2">topic and no one</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:39.680" style="s2">could even like it would take your whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.639" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">life just to go through the search</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.680" end="00:12:43.200" style="s2">results for one topic</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">then of course how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:46.959" style="s2">algorithms that curate all of this</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">content becomes the central topic and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.959" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">we see that with</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">the youtube recommendation algorithm and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">the facebook news feed algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:56.000" style="s2">massive machine learning indexing</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.000" end="00:12:59.519" style="s2">that can actually sort through that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.839" end="00:13:00.880" style="s2">then the question is what is their basis</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.519" end="00:13:02.079" style="s2">to sort through the information and put</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.880" end="00:13:05.200" style="s2">it in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:07.040" style="s2">and when we had broadcast the tv</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.200" end="00:13:09.040" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get a lot of information about</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.040" end="00:13:10.959" style="s2">me directly so it had to have very</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.040" end="00:13:11.680" style="s2">generalized kind of marketing it could</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">tell</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.680" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">more ratings or less ratings but when</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">i&#39;m on my news feed and it can pay</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.720" end="00:13:20.480" style="s2">attention to what i click on what i</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">share how long my mouse hovers over</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">by the time i&#39;ve liked 300 things on</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.079" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">facebook the algorithm can predict what</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">i&#39;m going to like better than my spouse</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:32.160" style="s2">and then develop a psychographic model</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">of me that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.160" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">is actually better than you know any</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:37.760" style="s2">kind of psychologist psychographic model</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">of me could be</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.760" end="00:13:41.360" style="s2">then it curates all the content to my</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.839" end="00:13:43.360" style="s2">interest which in a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.360" end="00:13:45.440" style="s2">but my interest in a very specific sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.360" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">because these platforms are businesses</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.440" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">that have their own agentic interests</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">and their agenda</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:51.120" style="s2">interest is that they have a business</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:52.399" style="s2">model that&#39;s based on selling</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.120" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">advertising</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.399" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">and they sell more advertising by</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:57.760" style="s2">maximizing</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:59.760" style="s2">user engagement mostly meaning time on</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.760" end="00:14:03.680" style="s2">site also sharing and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.760" end="00:14:04.160" style="s2">and most people don&#39;t plan i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.680" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">spend</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.160" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">six hours on facebook today and their</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">life would be better if they got off and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:12.639" style="s2">went and did something else</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">so time on site is usually maximized by</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.639" end="00:14:15.760" style="s2">getting people to not be in their</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">prefrontal cortex remembering what their</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:21.760" style="s2">but to get hooked somehow so</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.079" end="00:14:23.519" style="s2">how to put the content in front of me</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.760" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">that will maximally hook me</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.519" end="00:14:27.839" style="s2">ends up being a combination of appealing</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:30.639" style="s2">to emotional</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">triggers and cognitive bias when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.639" end="00:14:33.519" style="s2">so much information and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">most of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.519" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">my relevance filters are going to pay</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">attention to the things i already know</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">are important which is going to have me</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:42.399" style="s2">double down on bias</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:44.399" style="s2">and the things that scare me or anger me</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.399" end="00:14:46.240" style="s2">are worth more of my time for kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.399" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">evolutionary protective reasons</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.240" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">so as there&#39;s so much content and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">there&#39;s micro targeted psychographic</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:54.399" style="s2">information about me</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:56.399" style="s2">and it&#39;s curating that feed uniquely to</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.399" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">me not even to a demographic profile but</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.399" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">n equals one optimization</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">to maximize time on site for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">then everyone gets more bias and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:07.440" style="s2">everyone gets more emotionally hijacked</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">so you end up in a world where you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.440" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">not just</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">two competing points of view but</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">increasingly more fractured</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:16.160" style="s2">narrative camps all of whom have less</p>

<p begin="00:15:16.160" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">overlap with each other and everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.560" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">both more certain</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:23.519" style="s2">and more outraged while simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">being more wrong because</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.519" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">the complexity is such that no one can</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">really do epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">people believe yes or no on climate</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">change or whatever the topic is and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:34.639" style="s2">almost nobody has tried to read all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:37.360" style="s2">the data and model it themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.639" end="00:15:37.680" style="s2">so there&#39;s a kind of epistemic nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.360" end="00:15:40.480" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.680" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">i can&#39;t possibly really make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:43.839" style="s2">so if i can&#39;t make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">there&#39;s almost more of an unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.839" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">move to a tribalism of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">who are the leaders that i want to be</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.120" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">that has these very tight empirical</p>

<p begin="00:16:33.120" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:38.639" style="s2">getting more certain and more bias it</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">becomes easier for other actors that</p>

<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">just kind of push them further in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:44.000" end="00:16:48.800" style="s2">and so then it becomes very easy for</p>

<p begin="00:17:10.799" end="00:17:16.959" style="s2">in that information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">indeed indeed yeah let me respond to</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.959" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">several different points you made which</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:21.120" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:23.919" style="s2">good one you&#39;re right i&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.120" end="00:17:26.640" style="s2">this since 1980 i worked for the source</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.919" end="00:17:28.559" style="s2">the very first consumer online system</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">and i can tell you we all thought we</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.559" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">were doing great work for democracy and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">that in the future everybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">have access to all the information they</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">need and democracy</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:38.880" style="s2">would be better than it ever been before</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">how naive we were</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.880" end="00:17:43.840" style="s2">on the other hand i would suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.360" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">there was a phase change that occurred</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.840" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">in the economics of online that actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">caused it to trend towards the direction</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:56.160" style="s2">that you so vividly</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">outlined and that was prior to 2004-2005</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.160" end="00:18:00.240" style="s2">most information sources on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:02.720" style="s2">that were of any quality or depth</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.240" end="00:18:04.160" style="s2">were paid and so there was an alignment</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.720" end="00:18:05.600" style="s2">between the person that operated the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.160" end="00:18:08.000" style="s2">service and the user</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">to get you the most value as quickly as</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.000" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">possible and get you the hell off</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">because they didn&#39;t want to pay for your</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">time online which was also more</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">expensive in those days</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:19.200" style="s2">around 2004 2005 the economics</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.280" end="00:18:21.200" style="s2">changed such that platforms and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.200" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">bandwidth became cheap enough</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.200" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">that you could actually fully fund a</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.000" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">service at scale by advertising alone</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">and suddenly the dynamic that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">described came into being where the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">business model</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">wasn&#39;t in alignment with the customer</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">which is to provide them as much value</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">for as little time online as possible</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">but quite the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">the revenue source was tightly coupled</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">to time online</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:46.240" style="s2">so now the platforms think of them you</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">know google</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.240" end="00:18:52.000" style="s2">facebook twitter etc have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">overriding business incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.000" end="00:18:55.919" style="s2">maximize</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:58.240" style="s2">your time online and as you say you add</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.919" end="00:19:00.400" style="s2">in the new capability to do group of one</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">micro targeting on what hooks you the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">most what hijacks your attention</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">to keep you online for as long as</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:09.679" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">and then to loop back with i guess you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.679" end="00:19:13.840" style="s2">call it dopamine hijacking</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:15.039" style="s2">which is to provide the most vivid the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.840" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">most insane</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.039" end="00:19:18.320" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of work on the fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">that for instance that fake news which</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.320" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">is intentionally designed to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">high impact will spread five or six</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:26.799" style="s2">times farther than true news on</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:28.640" style="s2">a similar topic and we all know how easy</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.799" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">it is to get sucked into</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.640" end="00:19:32.160" style="s2">you know violent arguments on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:34.559" style="s2">internet rather than a thoughtful</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.160" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">discussion about the pros and cons of</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.559" end="00:19:38.720" style="s2">a piece of literary fiction and so again</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:41.039" style="s2">these were not</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.720" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">designed in the sense that someone said</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.039" end="00:19:43.520" style="s2">i think we should hijack people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.520" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">to make them feel bad about themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">and their neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">so that we can have a great business it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">went step by step</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">in kind of a natural evolutionary way</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:19:57.679" style="s2">from the introduction of fully</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">advertising based products in the</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:04.559" style="s2">and now we get to the next step which i</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.799" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen that much about yet</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.559" end="00:20:08.320" style="s2">if we have a system based on dopamine</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.320" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">if you know anything at all about drug</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">or not so much addiction but you know</p>

<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">there&#39;s the concept of dopamine</p>

<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:30.640" style="s2">it&#39;s because of dopamine exhaustion</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.559" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">dopamine no longer sends a meaningful</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:05.679" style="s2">just sort of point out maybe name</p>

<p begin="00:21:37.440" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">those same affordances can now be used</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">for ways they probably were not</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">anticipated in originally</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">you know for non-state actors or state</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:49.679" style="s2">actors or political actors of any sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">so again step back a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.679" end="00:21:53.600" style="s2">think about the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">and the evolutionary context in which it</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.600" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">provides</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s actually worth just taking</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">a moment on this topic of hypernormal</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">stimuli and dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">to just simplify radically dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">is a molecule associated with</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">motivational networks other things as</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">well pattern matching and things that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:17.679" style="s2">would have motivation but kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">feels good do it again type dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.679" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">the things that give dopamine hits</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.240" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">evolutionarily are things that also</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">would confer</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">a collective advantage and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">let&#39;s say in a natural hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">environment pre-agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.159" end="00:22:34.799" style="s2">most of you know human evolutionary time</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.080" end="00:22:36.720" style="s2">has been it was pretty hard to get salt</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.799" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">it was pretty hard to get a lot of fat</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">pretty hard to get sugar because</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">you know a small amount of berries lean</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">meat and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">salt fat and sugar conferred</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:47.679" style="s2">evolutionary advantage because</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">of caloric density and electrolytes to</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.679" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">make it through famine</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">so there was a increased dopamine hit on</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.840" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">that over</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">say leafy stuff uh that was quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">abundant</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:22:59.520" style="s2">but didn&#39;t have the same kind of caloric</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">density obviously salt doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.520" end="00:23:04.720" style="s2">caloric density but the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:06.400" style="s2">and so those people who uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.720" end="00:23:07.679" style="s2">worked hardest to get those things would</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.400" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">have made it through more so there would</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.679" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:11.840" style="s2">also a selection for kind of strong</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:14.640" style="s2">dopaminergic response to that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.840" end="00:23:16.080" style="s2">but that was evolutionarily useful in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.640" end="00:23:17.120" style="s2">time where it was very hard to get those</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">things so then</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.120" end="00:23:23.039" style="s2">we move forward to modern environments</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">where we can make fast food that is just</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.039" end="00:23:28.159" style="s2">combinations of salt fat and sugar</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:30.000" style="s2">and like run the experiments for maximum</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.159" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">palatability make it not</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.000" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">stuff that doesn&#39;t require chewing too</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">much and we get obesity epidemics</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">because the dopaminergic dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">haven&#39;t changed but they&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">evolutionarily adaptive now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:42.960" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">anti-adaptive and so we basically</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.960" end="00:23:47.520" style="s2">extracted the dopamine part from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">associated evolutionary context and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.520" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">kind of nutrient part and now that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">creates</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">a its own kind of catastrophic risk and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:23:59.760" style="s2">what fast food is to food</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:02.400" style="s2">and nutrition is the same thing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">porn is to sexuality and relationship</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.400" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">take something that has a normal</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">dopaminergic process associated with</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.320" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">something that has evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:11.600" style="s2">advantage for</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:13.840" style="s2">raising kids and bonding and etc</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.600" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">and just extract the hypernormal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.840" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">parts devoid of any of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">would actually be</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">relevant to human life and the same is</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:22.159" style="s2">true for what social media relationships</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.440" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">are to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.159" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">social dynamics and relationships in</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:29.760" style="s2">and we can see that from a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.000" end="00:24:30.880" style="s2">marketing perspective or from a business</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.760" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.880" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">every business owner wants to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">the lifetime value of the customer and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:38.640" style="s2">maximize the number of customers</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">and addiction is a really good way to</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.640" end="00:24:41.120" style="s2">maximize the lifetime value of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2">customer</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.120" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">and so from the supply side figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">how to get marketing that manufactures</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:47.679" style="s2">demand</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">and even to the point of manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.679" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">addiction is a straightforwardly</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:53.679" style="s2">profitable thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:54.720" style="s2">and so we can see a mcdonald&#39;s or a</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">hostess or a</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.720" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">phillips morris or whatever could do</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.240" end="00:24:59.919" style="s2">that well in the domain of chemistry but</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:01.919" style="s2">now we have dopaminergic hits that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.919" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">just as powerful as that that are photon</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.919" end="00:25:06.400" style="s2">mediated rather than chemically mediated</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">can be sent out to everyone can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.400" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">personalized to them</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">based on empirical feedback and that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.919" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">can start giving</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:14.799" style="s2">kids with the screens that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:17.600" style="s2">looking at and touching</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.799" end="00:25:18.960" style="s2">as children um and not control in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.600" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">way that we would control for you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:22.000" style="s2">to be 18</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:23.039" style="s2">for a cigarette or 21 for alcohol or</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.000" end="00:25:26.559" style="s2">whatever else</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.039" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">so i think understanding</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.559" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">our susceptibility to hypernormal</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:32.320" style="s2">stimuli and</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.840" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">the perverse incentives to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">hypernormal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">and then for each company on its own to</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:38.000" style="s2">optimize hypernormal stimuli but then</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.000" end="00:25:41.679" style="s2">a company that is a curator of other</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:44.000" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.679" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">where its motive is to maximize your</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.000" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">engagement and your engagement with all</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">the things that are maximally sticky for</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">you maximize your engagement for it in</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:52.159" style="s2">total</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">and to really get that the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.159" end="00:25:55.919" style="s2">machine learning ai that&#39;s running the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">facebook algorithm or the google youtube</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.919" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">algorithm is a more powerful ai than the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:02.080" style="s2">one that beat kasparov</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:04.559" style="s2">chess that that is maximizing for</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.080" end="00:26:06.799" style="s2">hypernormal stimuli across every axis</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.559" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">for you that it can in the platform</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:09.919" style="s2">it&#39;s an important piece of context to</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">understand and for us to really think</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.919" end="00:26:13.919" style="s2">seriously about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:14.799" style="s2">as individuals and parents and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.919" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.799" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">be cognizant of that and create some</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">resilience and protection to it</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">factoring how</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:24.880" style="s2">profound it is and as a society how do</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">we start to</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.880" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">remove the perverse incentive for</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">hypernormal stimuli because</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">when we talk about what is a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">civilization what are the right indices</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">we know it&#39;s not just gdp per capita</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:37.840" style="s2">i would say one of the inverse indices</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:39.919" style="s2">is addiction the more addiction a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.840" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">society has the less healthy it is writ</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.919" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:45.840" style="s2">and so this is a this is a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:48.000" style="s2">part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s a very deep insight</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.000" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever heard it</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">described quite that way but a measure</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">of addictive behavior across</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:26:59.039" style="s2">all modalities is actually kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">measure of anti-sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.039" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">yeah exactly that&#39;s actually deep i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">actually going to think about that for</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">a second at least in the background but</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">while i&#39;m processing it in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:08.799" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">i also want to kind of go to slightly</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.799" end="00:27:12.159" style="s2">different direction which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:14.159" style="s2">the result of all this</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.159" end="00:27:16.159" style="s2">one of the results is fragmentation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.159" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">destruction of all authority or at least</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.159" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">any consensus about authority</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:21.120" style="s2">and replacing it with nothing so far at</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.120" end="00:27:25.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s also worth remembering that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">good old days weren&#39;t necessarily so</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.440" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">remember there was a book called the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:31.679" style="s2">best and the brightest talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:33.679" style="s2">really smart people that worked in the</p>

<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">course the title was meant to be ironic</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.240" end="00:27:40.720" style="s2">because those best and the brightest led</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">us into the idiotic quagmire the vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.720" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:45.039" style="s2">right and one of the problems with too</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">much agreement</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.039" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">is not enough checks and balances in our</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">and people who think that the best and</p>

<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">i think that&#39;s worth keeping in mind too</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.399" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">so how to deal with this new emergent</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">world where there is no authority and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">it&#39;s been replaced by nothing</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:03.279" style="s2">probably we don&#39;t want to replace it</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:06.000" style="s2">with a single</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.279" end="00:28:07.200" style="s2">definitive authority the status quo that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.000" end="00:28:11.200" style="s2">was so powerful</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:15.200" style="s2">seems as close as any of the high water</p>

<p begin="00:29:07.760" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">at various times so we should also</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:15.039" style="s2">always keep in mind that this</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:16.640" style="s2">wide open information ecosystem provides</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.039" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">a substrate for good</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.640" end="00:29:20.640" style="s2">as well so when we&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:23.039" style="s2">interventions to</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.640" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">down regulate the bad we also have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.039" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">make sure that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">eliminate the good at the same time okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">yeah this is very interesting um i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:33.279" style="s2">address the authority</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">part first and then the things getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.279" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">better and worse and how we&#39;d address</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.039" end="00:29:37.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">the reason we don&#39;t want a single</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.360" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">monolithic authority on what is true is</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:42.720" style="s2">the same reason</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t want a single top-down world</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.720" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:47.039" style="s2">is because we don&#39;t trust anybody with</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:49.279" style="s2">that much power and we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.039" end="00:29:50.960" style="s2">um and so one of our best ways of</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.279" end="00:29:53.200" style="s2">dealing with the corrupting</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.960" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">nature of power is to at least keep it</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.200" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">in check with other powers</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:59.520" style="s2">and so this is one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:03.279" style="s2">free speech issues are so tricky</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.520" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">is should speech be</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.279" end="00:30:08.399" style="s2">absolutely free meaning</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:10.240" style="s2">should we not bind any kind of speech</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.399" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">and we we know that like</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.240" end="00:30:14.480" style="s2">libel and slander and yelling fire in an</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:15.760" style="s2">open building and fake bomb threats are</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.480" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">problematic enough things that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:17.919" style="s2">actually want to regulate them in some</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:20.080" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.919" end="00:30:21.039" style="s2">but what about in an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.080" end="00:30:23.360" style="s2">the original</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.039" end="00:30:24.320" style="s2">considerations around free speech in</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.360" end="00:30:26.080" style="s2">this country</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.320" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">were in a time where at most if i was</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">going to say something that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">not true and dangerous i might be able</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">to have a couple hundred people hear it</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">in a town hall and somebody else could</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">get up and talk i couldn&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">scale to millions or billions of people</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">through kind of viral type dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">and so in a situation where the things</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">that actually appeal to bias</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.440" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">and emotional hijack will get up</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:48.840" style="s2">regulated</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">in a way that they could never have been</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.840" end="00:30:52.000" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:53.760" style="s2">based on the the algorithms and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:55.000" style="s2">platforms free speech</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.760" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a such a different</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.000" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">consequentiality around the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:30:58.960" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">so it&#39;d be very tempting to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.960" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">well we should have fact checkers or</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">something like that but then the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">becomes who is the arbiter</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:09.039" style="s2">of what is actually true and what is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:11.279" style="s2">true and is there anyone that we would</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:14.399" style="s2">actually trust with that power</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.279" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">and i would say like a way that i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.399" end="00:31:16.559" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.039" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">going back in time as you were</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.559" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">mentioning to previous</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">administrations where we have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">government authority that is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:27.760" style="s2">the arbiter of truth in an area or</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">um you know academia or going back to</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.760" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">when it was the church is whenever</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:35.039" style="s2">something becomes</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">the legitimate authority on truth for a</p>

<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">it&#39;s extraordinarily powerful because</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:42.880" style="s2">what everyone else thinks is real which</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">is the basis of how they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.880" end="00:31:45.279" style="s2">behave</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">is actually like at the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.279" end="00:31:49.120" style="s2">stack of power</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:50.320" style="s2">and so even if a legitimate authority</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.120" end="00:31:53.200" style="s2">emerges</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.320" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">rightly because it&#39;s actually earnest</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.200" end="00:31:57.120" style="s2">and doing better</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.480" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">empiricism and whatever as soon as it</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.120" end="00:32:00.559" style="s2">starts to get that power</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:02.799" style="s2">there will be maximum incentive for all</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.559" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">of the power players to try to corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.799" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">it and influence it</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:08.159" style="s2">in various ways which they usually can</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">because which science is going to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.159" end="00:32:11.519" style="s2">funded is</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:13.440" style="s2">is going to be based on someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.519" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">funds putting money into something that</p>

<p begin="00:32:17.279" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">even if say a piece of science is</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.640" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">technically accurate it&#39;s not wrong it</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:26.320" style="s2">might be that only certain topics within</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">a domain that have</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.320" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">roi more associated get funded other</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">ones don&#39;t like for instance</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">you know patentable small molecules and</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">pharma compared to</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">peptides or biologics or plant-based</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.159" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:41.279" style="s2">and so then the preponderance of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:42.080" style="s2">research doesn&#39;t actually map to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.279" end="00:32:44.880" style="s2">overall space</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.080" end="00:32:45.840" style="s2">well so even things that are true can</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.880" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">still be</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.840" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2">misrepresentative or misleading so this</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">problem of</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:56.640" style="s2">that legitimate authority within a</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:58.640" style="s2">economic game theoretic environment</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.640" end="00:32:59.840" style="s2">will always get captured or influenced</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.640" end="00:33:02.880" style="s2">to various degrees</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.840" end="00:33:04.720" style="s2">and so how do we address that yep i</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:06.000" style="s2">think that&#39;s getting damn close to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.720" end="00:33:07.840" style="s2">center of the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.000" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">as people listen to podcasts no i</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">consider myself a madisonian</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:13.440" style="s2">james madison the somewhat neglected but</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">my mind</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.440" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">deepest of all the founding fathers who</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">set up our system of checks and balances</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:21.919" style="s2">probably not quite the optimal system</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.159" end="00:33:24.159" style="s2">for the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">but his fundamental belief was sooner or</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.159" end="00:33:27.120" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:28.960" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have bad people capture</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.120" end="00:33:30.880" style="s2">the levers of power and you better</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.960" end="00:33:32.720" style="s2">build that into your design or you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:34.399" style="s2">regret it you know in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">when you talk about one world government</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.399" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">number of my friends think we should</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:38.399" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:40.159" style="s2">a world government and i say uh when we</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.399" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">have five planets then i&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.159" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">okay with having a world government so</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">if one of them up there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:47.679" style="s2">four others to recover and to provide</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:48.320" style="s2">alternative models for each other so</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.679" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">again a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.320" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">very very very important design</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:55.840" style="s2">characteristics i wanted to say one</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">thing on the one world government</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.840" end="00:33:59.679" style="s2">we need to have governance i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">separate governance as a process in</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.679" end="00:34:03.120" style="s2">government as</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:05.039" style="s2">a established top-down enforcement of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.120" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">rule of law with monopoly of violence</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.039" end="00:34:08.079" style="s2">we need to have governance at the level</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:10.639" style="s2">that we&#39;re having effects</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">meaning we have to be able to actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.639" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">make sense of the effects we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">and factor that into the choices that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:18.079" style="s2">and when we have planetary effects on</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">the atmosphere and the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.079" end="00:34:21.760" style="s2">and etc but we don&#39;t have planetary</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:25.040" style="s2">governance</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:27.119" style="s2">then we just get multipolar traps where</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.040" end="00:34:29.119" style="s2">okay we don&#39;t want to fish all the fish</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.119" end="00:34:31.200" style="s2">out but if we can&#39;t make an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.119" end="00:34:32.480" style="s2">that china or somebody else is going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.200" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">also follow</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.480" end="00:34:35.040" style="s2">and they&#39;re going to get ahead</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:36.000" style="s2">economically and the ocean&#39;s still going</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.040" end="00:34:38.159" style="s2">to get ruined then they&#39;re going to use</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.000" end="00:34:39.040" style="s2">that economic benefit to damage us not</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.040" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">will we not make an agreement to manage</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:43.839" style="s2">the commons we actually have to race to</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">fish all the fish out faster than they</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.839" end="00:34:46.639" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:49.280" style="s2">or make ai weapons faster than they do</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.639" end="00:34:52.639" style="s2">or whatever else it is it&#39;s exploitive</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.280" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">and so not having global governance when</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.639" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">we&#39;re having global effect leads to</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">but having global government of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">types that have only ever become</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:04.000" style="s2">corrupted and then as a result</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.520" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">broke down also leads to catastrophe and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.000" end="00:35:07.599" style="s2">so we need something</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:10.640" style="s2">that is different than either of those</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.599" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">things that have been imagined so far</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.640" end="00:35:14.560" style="s2">i think that&#39;s pretty much bang on or we</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:17.359" style="s2">need to be very clever</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.560" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">in creating emergent networks that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">essentially produce coordination</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:22.960" style="s2">without actually having mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:25.760" style="s2">governance</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.960" end="00:35:27.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s a fairly subtle job but as an</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.760" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">example i think you actually mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.119" end="00:35:31.040" style="s2">it somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:32.720" style="s2">earlier suppose china doesn&#39;t conform to</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.040" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">carbon neutrality and the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.720" end="00:35:35.119" style="s2">world does the rest of the world could</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:38.160" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.119" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">massive tariffs on implicit</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.160" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">carbon to stifle trade from china</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.200" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">until they do come along so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">way to essentially set up a signaling</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">in which we get the coherent behavior</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">without actually having</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">formal institutions of governance or</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">mechanisms of governments so again</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.640" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">that&#39;s at least one area to think about</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:58.640" style="s2">a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">we talk about free speech and this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.640" end="00:36:01.280" style="s2">you know something we really do have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">think about again</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.280" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">as a madisonian there&#39;s a reason the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:07.359" style="s2">first amendment is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">first one in the u.s constitution and i</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.359" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">do believe that</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:14.240" style="s2">free speech is hugely important and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">giving large powers the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.240" end="00:36:18.960" style="s2">suppress speech</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">is dangerous but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:22.320" style="s2">i think there&#39;s at least one line that i</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:23.599" style="s2">think most of us can agree on</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.320" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">and unfortunately this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.599" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">propagating most rapidly now on the nets</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">and that is speech that is made in bad</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:32.160" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:33.280" style="s2">i actually remembered something that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.160" end="00:36:36.000" style="s2">said about</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.280" end="00:36:37.920" style="s2">what is good faith and i&#39;m going to read</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">this back to you and maybe you can react</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.920" end="00:36:40.560" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">that there is a correspondence between</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:43.200" style="s2">the signal that you&#39;re communicating to</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:46.320" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.200" end="00:36:48.640" style="s2">and what you believe is true</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.320" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">that strikes me as a good definition of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">good faith</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:54.240" style="s2">and yet we have you know people like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:56.000" style="s2">russians meddling in our elections or</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.240" end="00:36:57.920" style="s2">the oil companies putting out false</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.000" end="00:37:00.079" style="s2">narratives about climate change</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">which seem pretty clearly to be bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.079" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">faith discourse</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:04.960" style="s2">and it strikes me that bad faith</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:08.400" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.960" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">is to the mimetic sphere what pollution</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.400" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">is to the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:13.760" style="s2">and that if there were a way to detect</p>

<p begin="00:37:13.760" end="00:37:20.079" style="s2">that would be the first line to draw</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.119" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">yeah i mean yes and it&#39;s tricky i would</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.079" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">say</p>

<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">both intentionally by what you call bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:28.800" style="s2">faith discourse where someone is sharing</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">something they know</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.800" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t true and unintentionally where</p>

<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">is true that&#39;s just really wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.720" end="00:37:39.920" style="s2">and both of those end up damaging the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.839" end="00:37:42.480" style="s2">information in epistemic commons</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.920" end="00:37:44.480" style="s2">but how do i who&#39;s going to then be the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">arbiter of what is actually true</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.480" end="00:37:48.480" style="s2">and how do i know what someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">actual intent was</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.480" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">maybe if i find a whole paper trail that</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">shows</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:54.880" style="s2">that that person knew the thing wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:56.880" style="s2">true and was</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.880" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">you know setting the thing up as a psyop</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.880" end="00:38:00.880" style="s2">sure but oftentimes it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">prove intent</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.880" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">especially when the actors are hidden</p>

<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">several layers of sock puppets so</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.760" end="00:38:11.119" style="s2">so now we have to say okay well is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">about a</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.119" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">judge or some kind of centralized</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:17.119" style="s2">authority that should be able to tell</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">if something&#39;s bad faith or not or is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.119" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">about increasing the collective</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:22.240" style="s2">intelligence that is aware of and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.480" end="00:38:23.119" style="s2">sensitive to these things where everyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.240" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">is doing it</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.119" end="00:38:26.160" style="s2">and those things simply don&#39;t trend in</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:29.359" style="s2">the same way</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.160" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">and this starts to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.359" end="00:38:32.800" style="s2">the kind of answer and theory of change</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">that i&#39;m particularly focused on these</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.800" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">days</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">is we have this system you know a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:40.320" style="s2">republic or a democratic type system of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">participatory governance</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.320" end="00:38:43.599" style="s2">that wants everyone to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">participate in governance rather than</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.599" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">just be ruled by one or a few people</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">and if we look from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">of what we call civilization we exclude</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:55.839" style="s2">dunbar number tribes because it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:58.240" style="s2">different phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.839" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">very few civilizations since the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.240" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">beginning of civilization until now have</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:02.800" style="s2">been republics or democracies they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">almost all been</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.800" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">feudalistic or autocratic of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">and that actually makes sense because</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">one guy ruling everything or some very</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:14.320" style="s2">small number of people that can talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">coming up with a consensus</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.320" end="00:39:18.240" style="s2">and then being able to rule is way</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">easier than getting a huge number of</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.240" end="00:39:21.599" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:22.480" style="s2">mostly who are anonymous to each other</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.599" end="00:39:24.079" style="s2">to all</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.480" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">actually be able to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.079" end="00:39:26.800" style="s2">world and coordinate like a large number</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">of people coordinating is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.800" end="00:39:31.839" style="s2">very expensive tricky thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:33.200" style="s2">and from the way i see it throughout</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.839" end="00:39:35.520" style="s2">history the few times</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.200" end="00:39:37.280" style="s2">democracies emerged they emerged</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:39.440" style="s2">following cultural enlightenments that</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.280" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">had a few things in common</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.440" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">when we look at the athenian democracy</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">coming out of the greek enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:47.760" style="s2">stoicism plus the aristotelian school</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">and you know a few things had caught on</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.760" end="00:39:51.359" style="s2">to the place where they had a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">value around education</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.359" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">that everyone would learn formal logic</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">and everyone would learn</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:39:59.359" style="s2">uh rhetoric and history and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.160" end="00:40:02.079" style="s2">those types of things</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.359" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">plus the kind of stoic culture where</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.079" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">they&#39;re all learning emotional</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:06.720" style="s2">regulation</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:08.079" style="s2">and the socratic method where they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:40:08.079" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">perspectives debate any side of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.319" end="00:40:14.720" style="s2">conversation well if i have a bunch of</p>

<p begin="00:40:14.720" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">assess base reality clearly on their own</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.240" end="00:40:22.560" style="s2">they have emotional regulation so they</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">are not as susceptible to emotional and</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.560" end="00:40:26.400" style="s2">cognitive hijacks and groupthink and</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">have the courage to disagree and things</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">and they can take each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.680" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">perspective and they&#39;re actively seeking</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">well those are the prerequisites to</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:39.119" style="s2">democratic system being able to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:40.960" style="s2">because those people can have a good</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.119" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">quality conversation about shared sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.960" end="00:40:44.560" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.680" end="00:40:46.079" style="s2">recognize that some compromises to agree</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.560" end="00:40:47.359" style="s2">are better than warfare with each other</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.079" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">and come up with</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.359" end="00:40:50.480" style="s2">solutions so collective choice making</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.960" end="00:40:52.160" style="s2">emerges out of the collective sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.480" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">making meaning making and conversation</p>

<p begin="00:41:15.040" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">requires looking at a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:19.280" style="s2">things but the idea that we could become</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">renaissance people that we could all</p>

<p begin="00:43:39.920" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">of muscle the moment they stop working</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.359" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">out they start losing it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:45.440" style="s2">very expensive metabolically to keep</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:46.640" style="s2">that much muscle they have to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.440" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">keep working at it</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.640" end="00:43:51.040" style="s2">it&#39;s very expensive to keep an entire</p>

<p begin="00:43:51.040" end="00:43:55.359" style="s2">actively engaged</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">and once it seems like the government&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.359" end="00:43:58.880" style="s2">working well and a generation passes and</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:44:00.640" style="s2">the kids didn&#39;t go through the pain of</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.880" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">the revolutionary war and the grandkids</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.640" end="00:44:03.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">it becomes very easy to just get engaged</p>

<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:10.480" style="s2">and then you stop having a government of</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.200" end="00:44:11.440" style="s2">for and by the people and you start</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.480" end="00:44:14.319" style="s2">having a</p>

<p begin="00:44:22.240" end="00:44:25.920" style="s2">and then the market ends up capturing it</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:27.520" style="s2">you get regulatory capture and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.920" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">rather than liberal democracy you get a</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.520" end="00:44:30.240" style="s2">kleptocracy that eventually becomes an</p>

<p begin="00:44:30.240" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s what i see that we have right</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">now and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.280" end="00:44:37.760" style="s2">do i trust any particular authority to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:40.160" style="s2">arbitrate truth or</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.760" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">good faith or whatever right now no do i</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:43.839" style="s2">trust a collective intelligence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:44.880" style="s2">actually increasing in its authentic</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">i would trust that much more it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.560" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">expensive hard proposition</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.240" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">but i don&#39;t see any other good choices</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:55.359" style="s2">yeah and i i think i agree with you a</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.680" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">key part of my own thinking that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.359" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">formulating over the last year or two</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:02.160" style="s2">is that as we talked about earlier we</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">live in an era of scale and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.160" end="00:45:06.960" style="s2">which is completely unprecedented</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">in human affairs and i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.960" end="00:45:10.800" style="s2">reasonable to assert</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">that the combination of scale and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.800" end="00:45:16.000" style="s2">complexity has made the ability for an</p>

<p begin="00:45:17.760" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">are inadequate to the task</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.160" end="00:45:24.000" style="s2">at hand i read a lot i know a lot i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:27.119" style="s2">through a lot but i don&#39;t feel myself</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.119" end="00:45:30.400" style="s2">all to make certain kinds of decisions</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.359" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2">and nor in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.400" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">era of informational nihilism is it easy</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">to find</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:36.720" style="s2">in who the right people are to make</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:38.240" style="s2">these decisions that&#39;s less true</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.720" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">if you do some work you can find people</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.240" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">who actually know more than you do</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">and so i&#39;m wondering if the you know</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.839" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">up to the level to be able to make good</p>

<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:55.040" style="s2">in high complexity and high scale is</p>

<p begin="00:45:55.040" end="00:45:59.200" style="s2">or whether we ought to be thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">new institutional structures</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.200" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve been informed quite a bit in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">last year by the writings of hansey</p>

<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">between hierarchical complexity you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:20.079" style="s2">think of that as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">mental capacity and code which is our</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.079" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">institutions and operating systems and</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:26.560" style="s2">you know he&#39;ll admit when you push him</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:27.119" style="s2">and i&#39;ve pushed him some in interviews</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.560" end="00:46:29.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.119" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">hierarchical complexity can only be</p>

<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:35.599" style="s2">while code can be moved quite a bit very</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.800" end="00:46:36.640" style="s2">substantially</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.599" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">we have things like the french</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">revolution or the russian revolution</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:40.720" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.040" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">totally new codes were developed not</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:44.240" style="s2">necessarily always for the better</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:46.240" style="s2">but code is much more malleable than</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.240" end="00:46:52.240" style="s2">and so maybe in addition because i do</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.599" end="00:46:55.599" style="s2">agree we absolutely have to upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.240" end="00:46:56.319" style="s2">the education and thinking tools for</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.319" end="00:47:00.640" style="s2">but may not we also have to think</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:02.319" style="s2">carefully about new institutions</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.640" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">that take into consideration the fact</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.319" end="00:47:05.440" style="s2">that we&#39;re dealing with unprecedented</p>

<p begin="00:47:07.040" end="00:47:12.800" style="s2">i continue to believe might be an answer</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.760" end="00:47:13.599" style="s2">is so-called liquid democracy where</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">do and is aligned with me on values and</p>

<p begin="00:47:34.400" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">political realm</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:38.800" style="s2">gets concentrated towards more informed</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.800" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">and yet people who are still aligned</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">with us on values</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">and of course the other nice thing about</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:46.240" style="s2">liquid democracy is to degree you</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:47.839" style="s2">believe that one of your</p>

<p begin="00:47:47.839" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">doing a good job for you</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.280" end="00:47:52.800" style="s2">you can change your proxy at any time or</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:54.319" style="s2">you could reclaim it and just for a</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.800" end="00:47:56.720" style="s2">single issue if you want</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.319" end="00:47:57.599" style="s2">while i may you know proxy my defense</p>

<p begin="00:48:00.160" end="00:48:03.839" style="s2">choose to hold for myself the question</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">on whether we should go to war in iraq</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.839" end="00:48:07.359" style="s2">or not</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:08.240" style="s2">and i&#39;m thinking that code may be more</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.359" end="00:48:10.720" style="s2">malleable</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.240" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">than actual individual human</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.720" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">hierarchical complexity</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.680" end="00:48:18.559" style="s2">so in terms of exploring how much can we</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:19.920" style="s2">change at the level of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.559" end="00:48:21.839" style="s2">how much at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.920" end="00:48:23.599" style="s2">communication protocols for collective</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.839" end="00:48:24.640" style="s2">intelligence and how much at the level</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.599" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.640" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">actual types of um shared</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:31.440" style="s2">choice making systems that might be</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:32.960" style="s2">different than just kind of current</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">representative democracy</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.960" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about here is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:39.200" style="s2">context because we&#39;ve set the context of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">the damage to the information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.200" end="00:48:43.119" style="s2">but we&#39;re also talking now about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">increased complexity of the issues</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.119" end="00:48:46.480" style="s2">and i think we should actually just</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:48.240" style="s2">build out the understanding of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.480" end="00:48:50.079" style="s2">problem a tiny bit more</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.240" end="00:48:51.839" style="s2">because it affects the way i think about</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.079" end="00:48:54.640" style="s2">it the solution</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.839" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">is all right absolutely because you</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.640" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">brought this up at the beginning and i</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:49:00.720" style="s2">wanted to come back to it</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">so partly it has to do with scale</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.720" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">for sure which is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">the founding fathers thing here there</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:08.480" style="s2">was an idea that everybody could go to</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:11.079" style="s2">the town hall</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.480" end="00:49:12.240" style="s2">and discuss the issues that were mostly</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.079" end="00:49:15.119" style="s2">geographically</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.240" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">close to them that everyone could sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.119" end="00:49:19.040" style="s2">based reality on their own</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:20.640" style="s2">and you could have a small enough number</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.040" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">of people in the town hall that for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.640" end="00:49:23.200" style="s2">most part the people who had something</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:24.319" style="s2">to say could actually say something</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.200" end="00:49:27.440" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.319" end="00:49:30.559" style="s2">and when we moved to a place of</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.440" end="00:49:31.920" style="s2">most of the issues are globalized</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.559" end="00:49:34.559" style="s2">whether we&#39;re talking about finance or</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.920" end="00:49:37.760" style="s2">supply chains or environmental issues or</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.559" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">um you know geopolitical ones obviously</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.760" end="00:49:39.839" style="s2">that&#39;s a level of complexity where</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.200" end="00:49:41.920" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.839" end="00:49:44.800" style="s2">can&#39;t depend on their own base sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.920" end="00:49:46.480" style="s2">making and they can&#39;t process that much</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.800" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">information and second and third order</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">effects and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:52.480" style="s2">confounding effects as well and one</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:53.920" style="s2">topic i&#39;ll just enter here because we</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.480" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">haven&#39;t discussed it yet is the concept</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:49:57.760" style="s2">of hyper objects</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:50:00.240" style="s2">which is connected to but a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.760" end="00:50:03.599" style="s2">distinct from just raw complexity</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.240" end="00:50:04.480" style="s2">that we evolved to be able to apprehend</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.599" end="00:50:08.000" style="s2">and understand</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.480" end="00:50:09.359" style="s2">objects that were available to our</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.000" end="00:50:12.559" style="s2">senses</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.359" end="00:50:14.400" style="s2">and when i&#39;m talking about something</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.559" end="00:50:16.240" style="s2">like climate change i can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.400" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">climate change i can&#39;t taste it i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.240" end="00:50:21.599" style="s2">hear it i can only conceptualize it</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:22.800" style="s2">i can see a drought i can see a fire</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.599" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">there have always been droughts and</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">fires but to understand climate change i</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:28.400" style="s2">have to think about some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">statistics and complex mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.400" end="00:50:33.200" style="s2">models on the droughts and the fires</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">i also can&#39;t see world hunger i can see</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">a hungry person somewhere but i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:38.319" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">directly apprehend i can only do it</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.319" end="00:50:42.240" style="s2">conceptually which also means i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:43.599" style="s2">have the same felt visceral experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.240" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">of the things</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:49.280" style="s2">and the same is true with i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:50.000" style="s2">actually directly see or apprehend ai</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.280" end="00:50:52.960" style="s2">risk or</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.000" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">biotech risk or nanotech risk or or the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.960" end="00:50:55.760" style="s2">nature of markets</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">and so we have a world where the most</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.760" end="00:51:00.240" style="s2">influential things are mostly all not</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:03.119" style="s2">apprehendable to the senses</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.240" end="00:51:03.599" style="s2">and so we have not just the issue of can</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.119" end="00:51:05.599" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.599" end="00:51:07.359" style="s2">have a better felt sense or our</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.599" end="00:51:09.680" style="s2">intuitions are more right that our kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:12.400" style="s2">of sensibility of what&#39;s likely true</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.680" end="00:51:13.520" style="s2">as well as our kind of formal analytic</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.520" end="00:51:17.200" style="s2">can we get hyper objects but then can we</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:19.440" style="s2">get the connection of lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.200" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">hyper objects markets interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.440" end="00:51:22.079" style="s2">social media environments interacting</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">with climate and</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:28.079" style="s2">things like that and i think it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:31.520" style="s2">important to kind of state that</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.079" end="00:51:33.280" style="s2">to have a sense of how different the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.520" end="00:51:35.119" style="s2">problem space of the things that we need</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.280" end="00:51:36.720" style="s2">to understand and think about are now</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.119" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">compared to the evolutionary problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.720" end="00:51:41.280" style="s2">space most people had to think about</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">and how different the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.280" end="00:51:45.440" style="s2">collective sentence making</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:48.160" style="s2">need to be and choice make need to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.440" end="00:51:49.680" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll also step back and say</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.160" end="00:51:51.119" style="s2">even in environments where we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.680" end="00:51:53.440" style="s2">dealing with as much in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.119" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">complexity and hyper objects</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.440" end="00:51:58.000" style="s2">our sense-making was actually usually</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:51:59.440" style="s2">still adequate to solve local problems</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.000" end="00:52:02.480" style="s2">in ways that very often</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.440" end="00:52:05.200" style="s2">caused other problems somewhere else or</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.480" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">down the road and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:08.640" style="s2">this is an important part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:09.839" style="s2">understanding this is like the model</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.640" end="00:52:10.960" style="s2">that we can look at all of our problems</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.839" end="00:52:12.559" style="s2">as a result of either</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.960" end="00:52:13.760" style="s2">conflict theory or mistake theory</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.559" end="00:52:14.880" style="s2">conflict theory meaning we know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.760" end="00:52:16.240" style="s2">going to cause harm somewhere and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.880" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">doing it anyways for game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.240" end="00:52:19.359" style="s2">purposes mistake theory</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:20.880" style="s2">as you were mentioning with facebook we</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.359" end="00:52:21.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t know this was going to happen and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">it was simply an</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.760" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">unintended externality so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:28.240" style="s2">deal with both</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.599" end="00:52:30.160" style="s2">moving forward how do we remove the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.240" end="00:52:31.520" style="s2">basis of conflict theory so no one is</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.160" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">motivated to do things that will</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.520" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">knowingly</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:35.920" style="s2">harm something else and how do we also</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">deal with the mistake theory of being</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.920" end="00:52:38.960" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">anticipate externalities and internalize</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.960" end="00:52:45.680" style="s2">them into the design processes better</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:47.760" style="s2">and so the mistake theory side</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.680" end="00:52:49.599" style="s2">you can go back to we didn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.760" end="00:52:51.839" style="s2">know that the development of stone tools</p>

<p begin="00:53:25.920" end="00:53:28.960" style="s2">the solution has to be somehow bigger</p>

<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:40.880" style="s2">in a narrow way there&#39;s one or two or</p>

<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:15.359" style="s2">and i have to start thinking through</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.680" end="00:54:17.599" style="s2">second and third order effects better</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.359" end="00:54:19.440" style="s2">whether i&#39;m designing a proposition</p>

<p begin="00:54:31.440" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">environments and then how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.520" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">factor that into the design process</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">yeah all true but how the hell do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.160" end="00:54:44.079" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:44.640" style="s2">a human to actually be able to process</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.079" end="00:54:46.880" style="s2">at that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.640" end="00:54:48.480" style="s2">level and again the humans aren&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.880" end="00:54:49.520" style="s2">to get smart enough to do that none of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">us can do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.520" end="00:54:53.599" style="s2">right and so the answer has got to be as</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.079" end="00:54:55.200" style="s2">you keep pointing to some form of</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.599" end="00:54:57.599" style="s2">collective sense making</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.200" end="00:54:59.680" style="s2">and collective decision making that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.599" end="00:55:00.799" style="s2">high fidelity and in congruence with</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.680" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.799" end="00:55:04.240" style="s2">i think i mean i don&#39;t feel any sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:06.960" style="s2">that education</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.240" end="00:55:08.480" style="s2">plus a better child-rearing environment</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.960" end="00:55:10.000" style="s2">at home is going to get anybody to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.480" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">smart enough to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.000" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">that constellation of issues well so</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:17.280" style="s2">notice as you said that</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">you know you and i are probably more</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.280" end="00:55:19.359" style="s2">oriented to try to sense make the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.359" end="00:55:22.799" style="s2">average population and and have better</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.440" end="00:55:25.440" style="s2">educational resources</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.799" end="00:55:28.160" style="s2">but still can&#39;t make sense of everything</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.440" end="00:55:29.680" style="s2">but you also notice that when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.160" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">i know that you know things that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.680" end="00:55:33.119" style="s2">important that i want to know that i</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">don&#39;t and vice versa so i&#39;m actively</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.119" end="00:55:37.839" style="s2">seeking to try to understand your</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">your opinion um and so there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.839" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">an interesting balance that is important</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:43.200" style="s2">to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">is that one of the dispositions beyond</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.200" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">empiricism that orients towards</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">the capacity for collective sense making</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:51.359" style="s2">to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:53.359" style="s2">i&#39;m neither oriented for agreeability</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.359" end="00:55:55.440" style="s2">nor disagreeability</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.359" end="00:55:57.040" style="s2">with you because i&#39;m actually oriented</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.440" end="00:56:00.079" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.040" end="00:56:00.799" style="s2">respect relationally but then also</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.079" end="00:56:04.000" style="s2">respect</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.799" end="00:56:06.720" style="s2">to reality objectively so there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.000" end="00:56:07.119" style="s2">intersubjective and an object of respect</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.720" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.119" end="00:56:10.079" style="s2">my object of respect for reality is i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:11.680" style="s2">not going to agree with you if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.079" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">wrong but i&#39;m also not going to listen</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.680" end="00:56:16.079" style="s2">to you where you might be right</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:17.680" style="s2">and so i want to listen in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:19.440" style="s2">seek to understand what you understand</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.680" end="00:56:20.000" style="s2">push back where that&#39;s relevant not</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.440" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.000" end="00:56:23.200" style="s2">i have a disagreeable personality and i</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:24.640" style="s2">want to push back or have an agreeable</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.200" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">personality and i want you to agree</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.640" end="00:56:27.680" style="s2">but because i care about what is true</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:29.200" style="s2">enough and i&#39;m in good faith with you</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.680" end="00:56:31.440" style="s2">enough that we can seek</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">better understanding together so the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.440" end="00:56:35.200" style="s2">enlightenments that i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:37.359" style="s2">are not just people being able to have</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.200" end="00:56:40.799" style="s2">better objective sense making</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.359" end="00:56:42.319" style="s2">but also better intersubjective capacity</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.799" end="00:56:43.839" style="s2">that leads to higher quality</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.319" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">conversation so that collective</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.839" end="00:56:48.079" style="s2">intelligence can start to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:50.079" style="s2">so you&#39;re mentioning being able to find</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.079" end="00:56:53.520" style="s2">somebody that knows</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.079" end="00:56:54.079" style="s2">and and first let me just say before we</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">discuss</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.079" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">a perfected system we can just discuss</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:56:59.920" style="s2">how to stop some of the most egregious</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:02.799" style="s2">things about the current system</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.920" end="00:57:04.559" style="s2">current system people are radically</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.799" end="00:57:06.079" style="s2">certain about things that they have no</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.559" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">basis to be certain about</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.079" end="00:57:09.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually their false certainty</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:11.200" style="s2">that causes most of the problems if they</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.920" end="00:57:12.640" style="s2">simply acknowledge that it was too</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.200" end="00:57:14.240" style="s2">complex and they didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.640" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">they at least wouldn&#39;t be going to war</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.240" end="00:57:17.920" style="s2">over dumb stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">and to so to simply be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.920" end="00:57:21.599" style="s2">people be like i don&#39;t know yet but i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:57:24.000" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">tremendously uh yeah i believe i believe</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">that the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.839" end="00:57:31.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t know is one of the most</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.760" end="00:57:36.079" style="s2">in in human collaboration it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.720" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">interesting when you read scientific</p>

<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:47.359" style="s2">science the more frequently it appears</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:48.799" style="s2">right this is one of the things that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.359" end="00:57:49.200" style="s2">a value i really want to have come</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.799" end="00:57:51.839" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.200" end="00:57:54.400" style="s2">as people having a mature relationship</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.839" end="00:57:55.440" style="s2">to the topic of certainty and i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:57:58.240" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to</p>

<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:05.200" style="s2">because either i think the certainty</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.359" end="00:58:08.240" style="s2">gives me security or</p>

<p begin="00:58:10.960" end="00:58:16.400" style="s2">um and so uh the</p>

<p begin="00:58:19.839" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">desire for certainty that has us jumped</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.680" end="00:58:24.240" style="s2">to it before we&#39;ve done the right</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">epistemic process</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.240" end="00:58:29.280" style="s2">is dangerous but the compensation</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:31.280" style="s2">right there&#39;s a kind of postmodern trend</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.280" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">that takes any certainty is probably</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.280" end="00:58:36.400" style="s2">some kind of imperialism</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:39.280" style="s2">and only holding uncertainty is virtue</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.400" end="00:58:40.559" style="s2">also doesn&#39;t give the basis to act so</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.280" end="00:58:43.200" style="s2">what i want is to say</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.559" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">i&#39;m comfortable being certain and my</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.200" end="00:58:46.720" style="s2">certainty will never be a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:48.319" style="s2">percent but it might be 99.9</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.720" end="00:58:50.319" style="s2">depending upon how much experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.319" end="00:58:52.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve done relative to the thing the fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.319" end="00:58:53.760" style="s2">that it&#39;s never a hundred percent means</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.000" end="00:58:55.440" style="s2">that i&#39;m always open to</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.760" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">the possibility that there&#39;s data i</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:59:00.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t factor that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:59:03.440" style="s2">but i also need enough certainty to act</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.720" end="00:59:05.680" style="s2">where inaction is also consequential</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.440" end="00:59:07.359" style="s2">so factoring that action and inaction</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.680" end="00:59:08.079" style="s2">have consequence and i have an ethical</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.359" end="00:59:10.559" style="s2">binding</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.079" end="00:59:12.480" style="s2">both to the quality of my action and the</p>

<p begin="00:59:12.480" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">then i want to say well how do i get</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.920" end="00:59:17.119" style="s2">enough confidence to make the right</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2">choice for this particular thing</p>

<p begin="00:59:19.839" end="00:59:22.880" style="s2">and do i want to be comfortable with</p>

<p begin="00:59:22.880" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">and i want to be comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.400" end="00:59:27.760" style="s2">relatively higher certainty through the</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:30.160" style="s2">right epistemic process that informs</p>

<p begin="00:59:30.160" end="00:59:33.599" style="s2">absolutely and i would also say that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.240" end="00:59:34.559" style="s2">very important one that you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.599" end="00:59:37.440" style="s2">that most people</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.559" end="00:59:38.720" style="s2">do not build into their sense making the</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.440" end="00:59:41.280" style="s2">decision making</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.720" end="00:59:41.839" style="s2">is the cost of inaction you know and i</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.280" end="00:59:44.079" style="s2">had a</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.839" end="00:59:46.079" style="s2">a long and interesting and fun business</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.079" end="00:59:48.400" style="s2">career and i think i was more successful</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.079" end="00:59:50.960" style="s2">than most and one of the reasons was i</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.400" end="00:59:52.799" style="s2">very carefully calibrated about that</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.960" end="00:59:54.880" style="s2">how much information how much certainty</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.799" end="00:59:56.640" style="s2">did i need to pull the trigger</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.880" end="00:59:58.160" style="s2">you know if this was something where if</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.640" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t decide you&#39;re then you</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.160" end="01:00:02.480" style="s2">decide when you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:04.720" style="s2">40 because the alternative is worse</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.480" end="01:00:05.839" style="s2">there are many times when you&#39;re at 52</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.720" end="01:00:07.520" style="s2">you should pull the trigger because</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.839" end="01:00:09.359" style="s2">frankly the downside isn&#39;t that bad</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.520" end="01:00:11.599" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ll lose some money so what</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.359" end="01:00:13.119" style="s2">if the stakes were higher maybe it&#39;s 60</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.599" end="01:00:15.200" style="s2">percent so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.119" end="01:00:16.480" style="s2">to calibrate how much certainty you need</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.200" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">to pull the trigger</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.480" end="01:00:21.040" style="s2">is one of the great skills of decision</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:22.799" style="s2">making which is not taught</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">by anybody that i&#39;ve ever seen i</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.799" end="01:00:25.119" style="s2">fortunately was able to sort of pick it</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:27.440" style="s2">up by</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.119" end="01:00:29.599" style="s2">getting my mba with real bullets so to</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.440" end="01:00:32.000" style="s2">speak in the real business battlefields</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.599" end="01:00:34.000" style="s2">but if we made that part of our you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.000" end="01:00:36.720" style="s2">education and epistemology</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.000" end="01:00:38.480" style="s2">that by itself would be huge right and</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.720" end="01:00:40.720" style="s2">of course it would totally attack the</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.480" end="01:00:42.319" style="s2">fundamentals of american politics</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.720" end="01:00:44.160" style="s2">in which it&#39;s always the right thing to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.319" end="01:00:46.240" style="s2">do to kick the can down the road</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.160" end="01:00:48.640" style="s2">not confront it no matter what the costs</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.240" end="01:00:50.799" style="s2">are for kicking the can down the road</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.640" end="01:00:51.680" style="s2">yeah now this is a tricky thing is</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.799" end="01:00:54.880" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.680" end="01:00:56.559" style="s2">almost a a negative gradient problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.880" end="01:00:58.960" style="s2">here where the people that do</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.559" end="01:00:59.680" style="s2">less good thinking come to certainty</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.960" end="01:01:03.119" style="s2">faster</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:06.480" style="s2">and then make actions faster so</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.119" end="01:01:08.160" style="s2">if someone doesn&#39;t want to make the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.480" end="01:01:10.640" style="s2">wrong kinds of choices</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.160" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">so they want to actually do deeper sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.640" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">making first</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:16.319" style="s2">then if someone takes that too far</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:17.920" style="s2">they&#39;re just seeding the control of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.319" end="01:01:20.559" style="s2">world to people with the worst sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.920" end="01:01:23.440" style="s2">making in the most action bias</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.559" end="01:01:25.040" style="s2">and yet that doesn&#39;t we don&#39;t want a</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.440" end="01:01:26.480" style="s2">multi-polar trap where everyone just</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.040" end="01:01:27.760" style="s2">says okay i&#39;m pretty sure i&#39;m right so</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.480" end="01:01:30.960" style="s2">i&#39;m going to go for it</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.760" end="01:01:32.000" style="s2">um so this is why that balance of there</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.960" end="01:01:34.559" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.000" end="01:01:35.200" style="s2">responsibility for inaction as well as</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.559" end="01:01:36.400" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.200" end="01:01:39.040" style="s2">and different things have different</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.400" end="01:01:40.799" style="s2">consequentiality like what confidence do</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.040" end="01:01:43.119" style="s2">i need that this is going to be a better</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.799" end="01:01:45.119" style="s2">recipe to experiment with how much spice</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.119" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">i put in the food not that much because</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.119" end="01:01:48.799" style="s2">at worst i ruined the meal but how much</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:52.000" style="s2">confidence do i need</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.799" end="01:01:54.079" style="s2">that a particular application of ai</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.000" end="01:01:55.119" style="s2">is actually a good one for the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.079" end="01:01:57.680" style="s2">well it should be a</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.119" end="01:01:59.359" style="s2"> ton higher confidence based on much</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.680" end="01:02:00.799" style="s2">better processes of looking at</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.359" end="01:02:02.640" style="s2">second third order effects because the</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.799" end="01:02:05.760" style="s2">consequence is so high and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.640" end="01:02:08.079" style="s2">and the reversibility might be so low</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.760" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2">and this is where we&#39;re in a situation</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.079" end="01:02:12.720" style="s2">where there are market</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:14.720" style="s2">incentives to be first uh mover</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.720" end="01:02:16.240" style="s2">which means to move as fast as possible</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.720" end="01:02:18.160" style="s2">in some of the areas of highest</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.240" end="01:02:18.880" style="s2">consequence where we should actually be</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.160" end="01:02:20.240" style="s2">moving</p>

<p begin="01:02:23.359" end="01:02:27.359" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a problem yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.079" end="01:02:28.960" style="s2">it unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.359" end="01:02:30.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s baked into the current</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.960" end="01:02:33.440" style="s2">operating system which is</p>

<p begin="01:02:37.599" end="01:02:41.200" style="s2">make a move every quarter at least that</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.599" end="01:02:42.880" style="s2">shows they&#39;re making progress</p>

<p begin="01:02:45.119" end="01:02:49.920" style="s2">and usually the moves aren&#39;t that big</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.880" end="01:02:51.280" style="s2">you know gpt-3 which is the buzz in ai</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.920" end="01:02:52.960" style="s2">at the moment it&#39;s a pretty good sized</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.280" end="01:02:55.280" style="s2">move but it&#39;s not huge but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.960" end="01:02:55.760" style="s2">incremental and nobody stops to really</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.280" end="01:02:57.760" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.760" end="01:02:59.760" style="s2">what a whole series of incremental moves</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.760" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">over 10 years is going to result in</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.760" end="01:03:04.640" style="s2">there is no meta system to evaluate</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:05.920" style="s2">these kinds of risks and to keep people</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.640" end="01:03:08.079" style="s2">from playing the</p>

<p begin="01:03:12.079" end="01:03:16.480" style="s2">look at kind of the</p>

<p begin="01:03:21.119" end="01:03:24.160" style="s2">increasing fragmentation and descendancy</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.680" end="01:03:27.200" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.160" end="01:03:30.240" style="s2">see uh in the u.s</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.200" end="01:03:33.920" style="s2">descendancy and coherence at least</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.240" end="01:03:35.920" style="s2">so term limits make long-term planning</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.920" end="01:03:37.760" style="s2">quite difficult</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.920" end="01:03:39.599" style="s2">and we know why we like term limits was</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.760" end="01:03:42.480" style="s2">we didn&#39;t want people to</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.599" end="01:03:44.319" style="s2">to get too much power and corruption and</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.480" end="01:03:47.119" style="s2">start thinking dynastically</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.319" end="01:03:48.960" style="s2">of foreign by the people rotating but it</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.119" end="01:03:49.839" style="s2">also does create an incentive for people</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.960" end="01:03:51.599" style="s2">to do stuff</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.839" end="01:03:53.680" style="s2">where either for their re-election or</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.599" end="01:03:54.960" style="s2">simply for their new economic</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.680" end="01:03:55.599" style="s2">opportunities getting out or the way</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.960" end="01:03:57.680" style="s2">that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.599" end="01:03:59.359" style="s2">judged they&#39;re only going to be oriented</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.680" end="01:04:00.720" style="s2">to do stuff that will create positive</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.359" end="01:04:01.280" style="s2">return within the time of their term</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.720" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">limit</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.280" end="01:04:04.400" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s even a shorter time limit</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:06.319" style="s2">for directors</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.400" end="01:04:08.319" style="s2">of corporations that have quarterly</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.319" end="01:04:12.000" style="s2">decision profit cycles</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.319" end="01:04:13.839" style="s2">and so a dynastic monarchy</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.000" end="01:04:15.680" style="s2">that is thinking not only about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.839" end="01:04:17.520" style="s2">person&#39;s whole life but about their</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.680" end="01:04:19.200" style="s2">kids can actually do better long-term</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.520" end="01:04:22.000" style="s2">planning and</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.200" end="01:04:22.400" style="s2">if i have left versus right differences</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.000" end="01:04:24.160" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.400" end="01:04:25.760" style="s2">when anyone does something for four</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.160" end="01:04:26.720" style="s2">years the next four years somebody will</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.760" end="01:04:29.520" style="s2">undo it</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.720" end="01:04:31.520" style="s2">it&#39;s also and whatever the internal</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.520" end="01:04:31.760" style="s2">coordination costs of the disagreement</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.520" end="01:04:35.280" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.760" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">so high it&#39;s also very hard to unify</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.280" end="01:04:38.559" style="s2">enough to do stuff which is why the us</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:40.559" style="s2">has had a hard time fixing its</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.559" end="01:04:41.280" style="s2">infrastructure since the 50s and china</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.559" end="01:04:44.640" style="s2">has built</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.280" end="01:04:48.079" style="s2">high-speed trains all around the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.640" end="01:04:50.799" style="s2">and so for a lot of reasons we can say</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.079" end="01:04:51.680" style="s2">wow monarchy dynastic monarchy is just a</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.799" end="01:04:54.000" style="s2">better system</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.680" end="01:04:55.039" style="s2">because getting a lot of people to</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.000" end="01:04:57.599" style="s2">coordinate</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.039" end="01:04:59.680" style="s2">is really really hard and having someone</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.599" end="01:05:01.599" style="s2">that can do long-term planning</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.680" end="01:05:03.280" style="s2">uh be able to actually implement with</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.599" end="01:05:04.319" style="s2">some coherence because there&#39;s not much</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.280" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">internal descent</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.319" end="01:05:08.240" style="s2">seems like a better system and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:10.640" style="s2">system can check its own ai</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.240" end="01:05:12.319" style="s2">that system can do a lot of things</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.640" end="01:05:13.680" style="s2">whereas the system where all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.319" end="01:05:15.200" style="s2">companies are competing against each</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.680" end="01:05:16.799" style="s2">other in a quarterly way and the parties</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.200" end="01:05:19.359" style="s2">are competing against each other</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.799" end="01:05:20.400" style="s2">seems to be stuck on a multi-polar trap</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.359" end="01:05:23.599" style="s2">governed</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.400" end="01:05:24.720" style="s2">situation and so this is i actually know</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.599" end="01:05:28.000" style="s2">a lot of people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.720" end="01:05:30.319" style="s2">thought about multipolar traps a lot</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.000" end="01:05:32.319" style="s2">whose only answer is we actually return</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.319" end="01:05:34.839" style="s2">to monarchy and most of them think a</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.319" end="01:05:36.000" style="s2">global monarchy run by a benevolent</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.839" end="01:05:39.440" style="s2">aging</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:41.520" style="s2">and so i think if we</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.440" end="01:05:43.440" style="s2">right now it&#39;s pretty easy to see that</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.520" end="01:05:45.200" style="s2">if the us continues the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.440" end="01:05:46.480" style="s2">kind of left right and all the divides</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.200" end="01:05:48.960" style="s2">that it has</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.480" end="01:05:50.640" style="s2">its shaping of the world continues to</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.960" end="01:05:53.520" style="s2">decrease in relevance</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.640" end="01:05:54.720" style="s2">probably china&#39;s continues to grow and</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.520" end="01:05:57.039" style="s2">we see that</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.720" end="01:05:59.200" style="s2">not just china but like turkey and</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.039" end="01:05:59.920" style="s2">venezuela and brazil and a lot of places</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.200" end="01:06:01.920" style="s2">have moved</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.920" end="01:06:03.599" style="s2">to less participatory more autocratic</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.920" end="01:06:05.760" style="s2">style of governance i think we lose the</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.599" end="01:06:08.000" style="s2">21st century to that</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.760" end="01:06:10.079" style="s2">and while that is because it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.000" end="01:06:11.599" style="s2">effective in a bunch of ways</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.079" end="01:06:13.119" style="s2">and i think the only way to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.599" end="01:06:14.559" style="s2">have something like a republic or a</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.119" end="01:06:15.520" style="s2">participatory governance be more</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.559" end="01:06:18.160" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.520" end="01:06:20.079" style="s2">is if the many coordinating with each</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.160" end="01:06:20.960" style="s2">other actually produces higher quality</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.079" end="01:06:23.039" style="s2">results</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.960" end="01:06:24.160" style="s2">than just a few being able to control</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.039" end="01:06:25.920" style="s2">the thing and that&#39;s only going to</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.160" end="01:06:26.799" style="s2">happen if it can harvest the collective</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.920" end="01:06:28.559" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.799" end="01:06:29.920" style="s2">and there actually really is some high</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.559" end="01:06:31.359" style="s2">collective intelligence and now this</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.920" end="01:06:33.680" style="s2">comes back to your</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.359" end="01:06:34.799" style="s2">metamodern question do i think that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.680" end="01:06:36.720" style="s2">can get the</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.799" end="01:06:38.480" style="s2">hierarchical complexity or the ability</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:42.799" style="s2">of people to process information</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.480" end="01:06:44.720" style="s2">up yes even before that if i can start</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.799" end="01:06:45.680" style="s2">getting them a memetic immune system to</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.720" end="01:06:48.240" style="s2">where they aren&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.680" end="01:06:50.240" style="s2">cognitively and emotionally hijacked</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.240" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">right now it&#39;s mostly not even</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.240" end="01:06:54.000" style="s2">can they do good epistemology it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.480" end="01:06:55.039" style="s2">they&#39;re just captured by narrative</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.000" end="01:06:56.799" style="s2">warfare</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.039" end="01:06:58.799" style="s2">if i can simply get a memetic immune</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.799" end="01:07:01.440" style="s2">system where people start to notice</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.799" end="01:07:03.119" style="s2">how ruptural conjugation and lachoff</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.440" end="01:07:05.520" style="s2">framing happens yes that</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.119" end="01:07:06.640" style="s2">scientific article said something but</p>

<p begin="01:07:06.640" end="01:07:09.760" style="s2">put spin on it can they notice how the</p>

<p begin="01:07:09.760" end="01:07:13.200" style="s2">yes that&#39;s a true statistic but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.599" end="01:07:14.640" style="s2">cherry picked when you look at all the</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.200" end="01:07:16.000" style="s2">other statistics it doesn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.640" end="01:07:17.760" style="s2">that same picture at all</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.000" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">and people start noticing those kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.760" end="01:07:22.079" style="s2">info and narrative weapons</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:23.200" style="s2">and become inoculated enough that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:07:27.440" end="01:07:31.599" style="s2">that will make a huge shift so we have</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.520" end="01:07:34.400" style="s2">to factor the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.599" end="01:07:35.119" style="s2">mimetic emotional immunity and cognitive</p>

<p begin="01:07:35.119" end="01:07:39.760" style="s2">topic then better epistemology for the</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.799" end="01:07:43.119" style="s2">individuals</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.760" end="01:07:45.680" style="s2">and better orientation towards</p>

<p begin="01:07:54.079" end="01:07:58.319" style="s2">then i think we start to get emergent</p>

<p begin="01:07:58.319" end="01:08:02.480" style="s2">more sovereign and intelligent people</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.200" end="01:08:05.839" style="s2">and better conversations</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.480" end="01:08:07.680" style="s2">start to produce systems of coordination</p>

<p begin="01:08:10.480" end="01:08:14.079" style="s2">that continues to incentivize that</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.640" end="01:08:15.680" style="s2">bottom-up effect better and you get a</p>

<p begin="01:08:15.680" end="01:08:19.199" style="s2">between better systems of collective</p>

<p begin="01:08:27.199" end="01:08:32.239" style="s2">got to fight hyper normal stimulation</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.679" end="01:08:33.759" style="s2">right how does it escape that trap</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.239" end="01:08:36.159" style="s2">well that&#39;s one of the immune systems</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.759" end="01:08:39.120" style="s2">that i&#39;m talking about how do we</p>

<p begin="01:09:54.480" end="01:09:57.840" style="s2">and where do i believe things more</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.400" end="01:09:59.440" style="s2">fervently because</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.840" end="01:10:01.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a good story and i get to sound</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.440" end="01:10:03.040" style="s2">smart or i get to be part of a group</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.120" end="01:10:04.400" style="s2">or because it gives me security and how</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.040" end="01:10:06.800" style="s2">can i start to have</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.400" end="01:10:07.920" style="s2">a psychology that is more independent of</p>

<p begin="01:10:07.920" end="01:10:13.440" style="s2">so my belief system is not bolstering me</p>

<p begin="01:10:13.440" end="01:10:20.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s a kind of psychological</p>

<p begin="01:10:29.120" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">just easier for a bunch of reasons</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.280" end="01:10:35.040" style="s2">either we should start designing the</p>

<p begin="01:10:44.000" end="01:10:48.080" style="s2">have to re-drive a cultural</p>

<p begin="01:10:54.080" end="01:10:57.600" style="s2">and that might the enlightenment we want</p>

<p begin="01:11:21.840" end="01:11:26.320" style="s2">on two other topics one we talked</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.640" end="01:11:27.840" style="s2">earlier about bad faith discourse and</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.320" end="01:11:30.159" style="s2">then you alluded to the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.840" end="01:11:31.520" style="s2">you know not only is there bad faith</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.159" end="01:11:32.239" style="s2">this course but there&#39;s good faith</p>

<p begin="01:11:32.239" end="01:11:36.080" style="s2">that&#39;s just wrong and i will say that</p>

<p begin="01:13:52.880" end="01:13:57.440" style="s2">individuals can do on their own</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.880" end="01:13:58.159" style="s2">or what we could do to try to attack</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.440" end="01:14:01.520" style="s2">these issues</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.159" end="01:14:02.159" style="s2">project wise i would suggest a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.520" end="01:14:04.400" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.159" end="01:14:06.480" style="s2">and what&#39;s of course best is where</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.400" end="01:14:08.560" style="s2">project wise cycles back to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.480" end="01:14:10.880" style="s2">individual and then back to the project</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.560" end="01:14:12.800" style="s2">but go with what you think is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.880" end="01:14:15.679" style="s2">priorities</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.800" end="01:14:17.520" style="s2">i want to just say one thing first and</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.679" end="01:14:20.960" style="s2">this is a funny thing to say but</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.520" end="01:14:24.239" style="s2">um if we talk about anti-backs or q anon</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.960" end="01:14:28.000" style="s2">or any particular view like that</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.239" end="01:14:30.159" style="s2">i can really empathize with</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.000" end="01:14:32.159" style="s2">those and i think it&#39;s important that</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.159" end="01:14:36.000" style="s2">everyone can</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.159" end="01:14:38.960" style="s2">because i think most people</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.000" end="01:14:40.239" style="s2">sense that there are a lot of things</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.960" end="01:14:42.800" style="s2">wrong with the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.239" end="01:14:44.159" style="s2">and moving towards catastrophically</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.800" end="01:14:47.360" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.159" end="01:14:50.159" style="s2">that those who are in most power both</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.360" end="01:14:52.000" style="s2">uh politically and financially don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.159" end="01:14:53.040" style="s2">seem to be doing a good job with though</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.000" end="01:14:55.600" style="s2">they seem to</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.040" end="01:14:57.520" style="s2">be increasing in their own personal</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.600" end="01:15:00.800" style="s2">wealth or power or whatever else</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.520" end="01:15:02.800" style="s2">so there&#39;s a sense of corruption that</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.800" end="01:15:04.960" style="s2">most everyone senses it&#39;s just then they</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.800" end="01:15:06.400" style="s2">want to fit it into very simplistic</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.960" end="01:15:08.320" style="s2">narratives where there&#39;s good guys and</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.400" end="01:15:10.640" style="s2">bad guys and they can be on team good</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.320" end="01:15:13.120" style="s2">and that kind of thing so the right all</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.640" end="01:15:14.719" style="s2">thinks that the left&#39;s news is fake</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.120" end="01:15:16.000" style="s2">and the left thinks that the rights news</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.719" end="01:15:18.239" style="s2">is fake they each think that the other</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.000" end="01:15:20.400" style="s2">ones politicians are corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.239" end="01:15:22.000" style="s2">so the idea that politicians could be</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.400" end="01:15:25.120" style="s2">corrupt or news could be fake</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.000" end="01:15:28.480" style="s2">well that&#39;s actually true it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.120" end="01:15:30.239" style="s2">not true that it falls just along those</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.480" end="01:15:30.960" style="s2">partisan lines it&#39;s more that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.239" end="01:15:34.080" style="s2">to understand</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.960" end="01:15:35.600" style="s2">as for anyone to ascend the stack of</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.080" end="01:15:36.960" style="s2">power they have to do well at the game</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.600" end="01:15:38.239" style="s2">of power and there&#39;s a lot of things</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.960" end="01:15:39.520" style="s2">that that involves to do well at the</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.239" end="01:15:42.080" style="s2">game of power</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.520" end="01:15:43.679" style="s2">and so i think the idea that there&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.080" end="01:15:45.520" style="s2">these institutional authorities and we</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.679" end="01:15:47.040" style="s2">should just totally trust them</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.520" end="01:15:50.080" style="s2">has pretty much broken you were</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.040" end="01:15:52.560" style="s2">mentioning you know in 1965</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.080" end="01:15:53.679" style="s2">in 1965 the people who were alive paying</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.560" end="01:15:55.440" style="s2">attention to the news</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.679" end="01:15:58.080" style="s2">directly remembered world war ii in</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.440" end="01:16:02.000" style="s2">their life experience right</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.080" end="01:16:03.040" style="s2">and that had a a kind of unifying basis</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.000" end="01:16:06.400" style="s2">a patriotic</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.040" end="01:16:09.280" style="s2">um and unifying basis and an empirical</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.400" end="01:16:12.000" style="s2">basis we had to really double down on</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.280" end="01:16:13.360" style="s2">science and technology to uh be able to</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.000" end="01:16:15.040" style="s2">win the war and</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.360" end="01:16:16.960" style="s2">but then there starts to be an</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.040" end="01:16:18.400" style="s2">institutional decay where not that many</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.960" end="01:16:19.440" style="s2">people who are live paying attention to</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.400" end="01:16:22.560" style="s2">the news now</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.440" end="01:16:24.320" style="s2">or very large numbers of them weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.560" end="01:16:26.000" style="s2">around in world war ii</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.320" end="01:16:27.840" style="s2">and they don&#39;t have any real embodied</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.000" end="01:16:28.400" style="s2">sense of what breakdown in the developed</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.840" end="01:16:31.280" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.400" end="01:16:33.120" style="s2">could look like and so similarly they</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.280" end="01:16:34.880" style="s2">have much more sense of the enemy that</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.120" end="01:16:36.560" style="s2">is near than the enemy that is far and</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.880" end="01:16:38.560" style="s2">those types of things</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.560" end="01:16:41.040" style="s2">and then when we so when we look at</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.560" end="01:16:43.600" style="s2">vaccines for instance</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.040" end="01:16:45.040" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a bit of a complex topic</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.600" end="01:16:46.640" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.040" end="01:16:48.400" style="s2">if you&#39;re making something that is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.640" end="01:16:49.920" style="s2">drug that&#39;s intended to have long-term</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.400" end="01:16:51.120" style="s2">effects as opposed to most small</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.920" end="01:16:53.840" style="s2">molecule drugs that stop</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.120" end="01:16:55.280" style="s2">acting after they&#39;ve left your body</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.840" end="01:16:57.360" style="s2">could they have long-term</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.280" end="01:16:58.880" style="s2">consequences and if we&#39;ve done mostly</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.360" end="01:17:00.640" style="s2">the studies on individual</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.880" end="01:17:02.000" style="s2">vaccines and yet they&#39;re given in</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.640" end="01:17:03.679" style="s2">schedules with lots of them</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.000" end="01:17:05.360" style="s2">together do we really know what the</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.679" end="01:17:07.040" style="s2">collective effect of that much immune</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.360" end="01:17:08.159" style="s2">modulation long-term unlocks them</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.040" end="01:17:09.520" style="s2">together is</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.159" end="01:17:11.840" style="s2">and if at the same time that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.520" end="01:17:14.080" style="s2">been going up polio and whatever&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.840" end="01:17:14.320" style="s2">going down but hygiene and antibiotics</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.080" end="01:17:16.239" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.320" end="01:17:18.000" style="s2">also been happening during that time and</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.239" end="01:17:19.679" style="s2">then autoimmune disease and other things</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.000" end="01:17:21.120" style="s2">like that seem to be going up</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.679" end="01:17:22.560" style="s2">is the autoimmune disease and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.120" end="01:17:24.239" style="s2">infertility going up because of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.560" end="01:17:25.760" style="s2">vaccines or is it going up because of</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.239" end="01:17:28.159" style="s2">the glyphosate or ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.760" end="01:17:31.040" style="s2">environmental toxins or stress</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.159" end="01:17:33.199" style="s2">those are actually complex topics and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.040" end="01:17:33.679" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to say all vaccines are</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.199" end="01:17:35.840" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.679" end="01:17:37.360" style="s2">or all vaccines are good anti-vaxxers</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.840" end="01:17:39.120" style="s2">are stupid and neither of those are</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.360" end="01:17:40.239" style="s2">complex enough to actually make good</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.120" end="01:17:42.080" style="s2">sense of it</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.239" end="01:17:43.679" style="s2">but the need to take a very strong</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.080" end="01:17:45.440" style="s2">position because the</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.679" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">the other view is so bad and dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.440" end="01:17:48.880" style="s2">we have to fight it</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.800" end="01:17:50.320" style="s2">ends up being the tribalism confirmation</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.880" end="01:17:53.120" style="s2">bias and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.320" end="01:17:55.360" style="s2">and then people only have a pejorative</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.120" end="01:17:56.320" style="s2">straw man or even worse a villainized</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.360" end="01:17:58.480" style="s2">version of the other</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.320" end="01:17:59.920" style="s2">they they can&#39;t even imagine how anyone</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.480" end="01:18:01.360" style="s2">could be that stupid or bad as to</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.920" end="01:18:02.800" style="s2">believe that thing</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.360" end="01:18:04.480" style="s2">and of course you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.800" end="01:18:05.760" style="s2">participatory governance when that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.480" end="01:18:08.080" style="s2">you think about the other people you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.760" end="01:18:10.880" style="s2">supposedly part of a republic with</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.080" end="01:18:13.520" style="s2">um or part of a civilization at all with</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.880" end="01:18:15.120" style="s2">so where people start to doubt the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.520" end="01:18:17.600" style="s2">institutional authority</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.120" end="01:18:19.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something good in that but then</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.600" end="01:18:21.679" style="s2">oftentimes what happens is rather than</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.760" end="01:18:22.880" style="s2">really learn the epistemology needed to</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.679" end="01:18:24.480" style="s2">make sense of it they just</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.880" end="01:18:25.840" style="s2">jump to the new authority and usually</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.480" end="01:18:26.880" style="s2">the new authority is whoever it is</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.840" end="01:18:29.840" style="s2">that&#39;s telling them</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.880" end="01:18:31.840" style="s2">to doubt the other one and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.840" end="01:18:32.159" style="s2">inadequate they&#39;re not actually moving</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.840" end="01:18:33.760" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.159" end="01:18:35.120" style="s2">vertically into more hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.760" end="01:18:36.400" style="s2">complexity they&#39;re just shifting</p>

<p begin="01:18:36.400" end="01:18:40.000" style="s2">i just wanted to say that as preface</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.960" end="01:18:41.920" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s i think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.000" end="01:18:44.960" style="s2">preface and i&#39;ll i will confess that</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.920" end="01:18:46.640" style="s2">i&#39;m a real knee-jerker on anti-vaxxer</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.960" end="01:18:48.400" style="s2">have i done enough research to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.640" end="01:18:50.480" style="s2">absolutely sure about it no</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.400" end="01:18:52.159" style="s2">and so i will plead to a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.480" end="01:18:54.000" style="s2">tribalism on that one in fact</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.159" end="01:18:55.360" style="s2">it&#39;s the only topic which i have at</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.000" end="01:18:57.440" style="s2">least when i was running the show</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.360" end="01:18:58.640" style="s2">over in raleigh point alpha the only</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.440" end="01:19:01.920" style="s2">topic i which i</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.640" end="01:19:04.960" style="s2">banned discourse on was anti-vaxxer so</p>

<p begin="01:19:04.960" end="01:19:10.000" style="s2">um and this is tricky because let&#39;s say</p>

<p begin="01:19:10.000" end="01:19:13.040" style="s2">has been very well addressed but they</p>

<p begin="01:19:13.040" end="01:19:16.400" style="s2">do the people who&#39;ve well addressed it</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.640" end="01:19:17.920" style="s2">have to re-go through it every time</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.400" end="01:19:20.800" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a tricky topic right</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.920" end="01:19:22.800" style="s2">from the good use of time point of view</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.800" end="01:19:23.920" style="s2">so in terms of collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.800" end="01:19:26.080" style="s2">if a group has done</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.920" end="01:19:28.159" style="s2">really earnest dialectic to come to a</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.080" end="01:19:30.719" style="s2">certain confidence margin on something</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.159" end="01:19:32.000" style="s2">the path there not just the conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.719" end="01:19:33.920" style="s2">but the path there</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.000" end="01:19:35.280" style="s2">should be left in some intact way that</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.920" end="01:19:37.679" style="s2">other people can walk</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.280" end="01:19:38.320" style="s2">and then if someone has critiques that</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.679" end="01:19:41.360" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.320" end="01:19:43.199" style="s2">legitimate object level critiques of the</p>

<p begin="01:19:44.239" end="01:19:47.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s i think how science can</p>

<p begin="01:19:47.280" end="01:19:52.000" style="s2">is where we can continue to critique our</p>

<p begin="01:19:52.000" end="01:19:55.440" style="s2">and have dissent around it without</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.000" end="01:19:58.800" style="s2">having to repeat the things that have</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.440" end="01:20:00.400" style="s2">actually been done well many times</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.800" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">okay so your question what do we do</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.400" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">tomorrow at the level of the individual</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.880" end="01:20:10.480" style="s2">forgive me i&#39;m going to make a religious</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.320" end="01:20:13.199" style="s2">reference the</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.480" end="01:20:14.880" style="s2">commandment in the bible to not have any</p>

<p begin="01:20:14.880" end="01:20:18.960" style="s2">the way that i take that i take it very</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.360" end="01:20:19.760" style="s2">similarly to the first verse of the tao</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.960" end="01:20:22.000" style="s2">te ching</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.760" end="01:20:23.760" style="s2">um so i think a lot of cultures said</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.000" end="01:20:25.120" style="s2">something wisdom-wise and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.760" end="01:20:27.440" style="s2">maybe i&#39;m just reading it the way i want</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.120" end="01:20:29.199" style="s2">to read it so no false idols</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.440" end="01:20:32.080" style="s2">any model i make of reality isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.199" end="01:20:34.400" style="s2">reality it&#39;s me trying to</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.080" end="01:20:35.280" style="s2">info compress the complexity of reality</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.400" end="01:20:37.679" style="s2">into some</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.280" end="01:20:39.440" style="s2">small number of variables and operators</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.679" end="01:20:41.520" style="s2">on those variables where i can model the</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.440" end="01:20:43.520" style="s2">outcome with hopefully enough numerical</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.520" end="01:20:44.960" style="s2">accuracy that it&#39;s useful so this is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.520" end="01:20:47.360" style="s2">all models are</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.960" end="01:20:50.080" style="s2">wrong some of them are useful the moment</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.360" end="01:20:51.840" style="s2">i make a model truth</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.080" end="01:20:53.360" style="s2">now i&#39;m not in direct relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.840" end="01:20:56.880" style="s2">reality anymore i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.360" end="01:20:58.960" style="s2">relationship with the simulacra and so</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.880" end="01:21:01.120" style="s2">the idol of the models that i have of</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.960" end="01:21:02.960" style="s2">reality i want to hold them as useful</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.120" end="01:21:03.360" style="s2">and see which ones are more useful while</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.960" end="01:21:05.520" style="s2">never</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.360" end="01:21:06.639" style="s2">actually having any identity attached to</p>

<p begin="01:21:06.639" end="01:21:10.000" style="s2">never having any sense of sacredness</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.159" end="01:21:11.440" style="s2">attached to them because i know that</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.000" end="01:21:14.159" style="s2">better ones will come along</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.440" end="01:21:15.600" style="s2">and i want to be seeking those so if</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.159" end="01:21:18.880" style="s2">people can</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.600" end="01:21:20.639" style="s2">like deepen their commitment to a direct</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.880" end="01:21:22.159" style="s2">relationship with reality which</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.639" end="01:21:24.320" style="s2">binds them to a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.159" end="01:21:27.679" style="s2">uncertainty</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.320" end="01:21:30.080" style="s2">and as a result be dubious of being over</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.679" end="01:21:31.920" style="s2">devoted to any models of reality</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.080" end="01:21:35.600" style="s2">that&#39;s very helpful like as almost like</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.920" end="01:21:39.120" style="s2">a sacred oath at the foundation of it</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.600" end="01:21:40.639" style="s2">and then if that&#39;s the case that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.120" end="01:21:43.679" style="s2">will motivate them</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.639" end="01:21:46.000" style="s2">to be dubious of their own cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.679" end="01:21:47.679" style="s2">biases and emotional traps and when they</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.000" end="01:21:49.520" style="s2">feel very outraged and when they feel</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.679" end="01:21:51.679" style="s2">very certain and when they feel</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.520" end="01:21:53.760" style="s2">a very clear repulsion to a group that</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.679" end="01:21:55.280" style="s2">seems obviously bad or a very clear</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.760" end="01:21:57.120" style="s2">identity with an in-group</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.280" end="01:21:58.960" style="s2">they should just be dubious of all of</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.120" end="01:22:00.880" style="s2">that and step back and say</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.960" end="01:22:02.800" style="s2">what&#39;s the chance and what are the</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.880" end="01:22:04.400" style="s2">possibilities that i&#39;m being emotionally</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.800" end="01:22:06.639" style="s2">or cognitively hijacked and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.400" end="01:22:08.480" style="s2">seeing the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.639" end="01:22:11.520" style="s2">if people can just start to actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.480" end="01:22:14.080" style="s2">have a bias checker in themselves as</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.520" end="01:22:15.679" style="s2">a as a value as a discipline because</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.080" end="01:22:18.560" style="s2">they want to be in better</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.679" end="01:22:19.120" style="s2">connection with reality and truth and</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.560" end="01:22:21.520" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.120" end="01:22:23.280" style="s2">know that more than more than anything</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.520" end="01:22:24.480" style="s2">else it&#39;s their own misassessment of it</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.280" end="01:22:27.199" style="s2">to check</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.480" end="01:22:27.679" style="s2">that&#39;s very helpful then they can start</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.199" end="01:22:30.239" style="s2">to learn</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.679" end="01:22:31.199" style="s2">tools that will help them of like okay</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.239" end="01:22:32.800" style="s2">let me actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.199" end="01:22:34.800" style="s2">learn some of how narrative warfare</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.800" end="01:22:36.719" style="s2">works let me understand</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.800" end="01:22:38.080" style="s2">how russell conjugation is used by the</p>

<p begin="01:22:38.080" end="01:22:41.679" style="s2">or how like off framing is used in</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.840" end="01:22:42.239" style="s2">marketing and on all sides let me see</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.679" end="01:22:45.280" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.239" end="01:22:47.280" style="s2">cherry picking of data works and how</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.280" end="01:22:49.199" style="s2">the funding of science works in a way</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.280" end="01:22:50.880" style="s2">that makes the preponderance of data not</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.199" end="01:22:53.520" style="s2">necessarily fit the whole picture</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.880" end="01:22:55.199" style="s2">as i start to learn that more i start to</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.520" end="01:22:58.320" style="s2">be less manipulated</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.199" end="01:23:01.679" style="s2">by what occurs in the media environment</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.320" end="01:23:04.000" style="s2">and also simultaneously i want to seek</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.679" end="01:23:05.440" style="s2">dissenting views that seem earnest on</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.000" end="01:23:08.000" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.440" end="01:23:09.440" style="s2">so when you are mentioning that you will</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.000" end="01:23:11.120" style="s2">seek people that know more than you</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.440" end="01:23:11.920" style="s2">about a topic i will try to seek the</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.120" end="01:23:14.639" style="s2">people that i think</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.920" end="01:23:15.920" style="s2">know the most and who disagree but who</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.639" end="01:23:17.360" style="s2">seem in good faith about their</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.920" end="01:23:20.320" style="s2">disagreement because</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.360" end="01:23:21.360" style="s2">the dialectic between them i i have more</p>

<p begin="01:23:24.800" end="01:23:30.239" style="s2">and so if i can see where the ipcc has a</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.480" end="01:23:31.120" style="s2">standard model on climate change but</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.239" end="01:23:33.360" style="s2">both</p>

<p begin="01:23:35.120" end="01:23:39.280" style="s2">have done quite thoughtful analysis and</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.520" end="01:23:41.280" style="s2">come to different conclusions</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.280" end="01:23:43.040" style="s2">i want to say do i understand why each</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.280" end="01:23:44.080" style="s2">of them came to the conclusions they do</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.040" end="01:23:46.000" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.080" end="01:23:48.400" style="s2">can i facilitate a dialogue between</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.000" end="01:23:50.880" style="s2">those perspectives to try to</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.400" end="01:23:52.159" style="s2">maybe have more epistemic flexibility</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.880" end="01:23:55.280" style="s2">and come to better</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.159" end="01:23:56.719" style="s2">understanding so these are just a you</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.280" end="01:23:58.159" style="s2">know examples of a few things</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.719" end="01:24:00.000" style="s2">individuals can do on their own</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.159" end="01:24:01.199" style="s2">one of the things that looks like is</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.000" end="01:24:02.880" style="s2">just obviously</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.199" end="01:24:04.800" style="s2">remove the social media apps from your</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.880" end="01:24:07.040" style="s2">phone so you don&#39;t have a continuous</p>

<p begin="01:24:50.719" end="01:24:53.360" style="s2">a little bit let&#39;s start with social</p>

<p begin="01:25:06.320" end="01:25:10.480" style="s2">could all do</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.600" end="01:25:10.880" style="s2">is ask ourselves three times before we</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.480" end="01:25:13.280" style="s2">share</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.880" end="01:25:14.239" style="s2">something is this actually good for the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.280" end="01:25:16.320" style="s2">world to share</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.239" end="01:25:17.679" style="s2">this right because what you read is</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.320" end="01:25:20.400" style="s2">important but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.679" end="01:25:22.719" style="s2">in social media we are actors in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.400" end="01:25:25.120" style="s2">formation of the epistemic commons</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.719" end="01:25:26.080" style="s2">and when we share something or like on a</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.120" end="01:25:28.639" style="s2">reddit platform</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.080" end="01:25:29.679" style="s2">we upvote something or like something we</p>

<p begin="01:25:29.679" end="01:25:34.159" style="s2">shaping of the commons and so at that</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.760" end="01:25:34.880" style="s2">point think three times before you act</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.159" end="01:25:37.280" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.880" end="01:25:38.159" style="s2">i would suggest that&#39;s useful and now in</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.280" end="01:25:40.000" style="s2">terms of here</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.159" end="01:25:42.400" style="s2">we pivot to more institutional things i</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.000" end="01:25:44.400" style="s2">would also like to comment that okay</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.400" end="01:25:46.800" style="s2">yeah i understand that if we really want</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.400" end="01:25:49.280" style="s2">to think through climate change</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.800" end="01:25:50.159" style="s2">fully and understand you know built-in</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.280" end="01:25:52.560" style="s2">biases</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.159" end="01:25:54.000" style="s2">you know where are the error bars etc</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.560" end="01:25:56.080" style="s2">it&#39;s very good to start</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.000" end="01:25:57.840" style="s2">with love luck on one side dyson in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.080" end="01:26:00.320" style="s2">middle and a bunch of guys in between</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.840" end="01:26:02.320" style="s2">process all that data and come to some</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.320" end="01:26:03.600" style="s2">conclusion on what might be true and</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.320" end="01:26:05.679" style="s2">what the error bars actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.600" end="01:26:07.360" style="s2">are but let me tell you that&#39;s a job</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.679" end="01:26:08.080" style="s2">over the pay grade of almost every</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.360" end="01:26:10.400" style="s2">single human</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.080" end="01:26:12.800" style="s2">being and maybe if i did nothing else</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.400" end="01:26:15.040" style="s2">for two years i might be able to do that</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.800" end="01:26:16.880" style="s2">realistically i don&#39;t see very many</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.040" end="01:26:19.600" style="s2">people being able to process</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.880" end="01:26:20.719" style="s2">high scale high complexity issues in</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.600" end="01:26:24.320" style="s2">that kind of way</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.719" end="01:26:27.600" style="s2">which then pivots me to what can be done</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.320" end="01:26:30.560" style="s2">institutionally or as artifacts or in</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.600" end="01:26:32.239" style="s2">groups to accomplish the same thing so</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.560" end="01:26:35.360" style="s2">that people can consume</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.239" end="01:26:37.280" style="s2">the result of a process like that</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.360" end="01:26:38.639" style="s2">well as you know i&#39;m part of a group</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.280" end="01:26:40.400" style="s2">that&#39;s working on</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.639" end="01:26:42.960" style="s2">building a project to try to do some of</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.400" end="01:26:45.679" style="s2">this and so i can tell you the thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.960" end="01:26:47.440" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to do that compared to</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.679" end="01:26:48.320" style="s2">the scope of the entire information</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.440" end="01:26:51.520" style="s2">ecology</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.320" end="01:26:53.040" style="s2">and the algorithmic bias uh on these</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.520" end="01:26:54.320" style="s2">major platforms what we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.040" end="01:26:56.080" style="s2">actually pretty</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.320" end="01:26:57.440" style="s2">small and humble compared to everything</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.080" end="01:26:59.360" style="s2">that needs to happen but</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.440" end="01:27:01.280" style="s2">it&#39;s the highest leverage easiest to</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.360" end="01:27:03.360" style="s2">achieve things i&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.280" end="01:27:04.639" style="s2">uh as a starting place to then hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.360" end="01:27:07.760" style="s2">be able to</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.639" end="01:27:10.159" style="s2">have more stuff come so for instance</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.760" end="01:27:11.280" style="s2">let&#39;s take that particular topic the</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.159" end="01:27:13.120" style="s2">climate change one</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.280" end="01:27:14.800" style="s2">there&#39;s both how do we make sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.120" end="01:27:17.280" style="s2">realities of climate change then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.800" end="01:27:19.920" style="s2">how do we make sense of the right choice</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.280" end="01:27:22.239" style="s2">for climate change factoring the</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.920" end="01:27:23.920" style="s2">adjacent issues like u.s china issues</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.239" end="01:27:25.600" style="s2">and other geopolitical issues and market</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.920" end="01:27:29.040" style="s2">issues and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.600" end="01:27:31.440" style="s2">so one of the things that we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.040" end="01:27:32.080" style="s2">in this project that is trying to kind</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.440" end="01:27:35.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.080" end="01:27:37.600" style="s2">upgrade and fix the media ecology and uh</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.280" end="01:27:39.280" style="s2">remove the effectiveness of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.600" end="01:27:40.960" style="s2">narrative and info weapons by pointing</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.280" end="01:27:44.080" style="s2">them out so as we make</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.960" end="01:27:47.120" style="s2">the covert things overt they have</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.080" end="01:27:50.560" style="s2">uh more ability to be resisted</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.120" end="01:27:53.600" style="s2">so hosting not debates</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.560" end="01:27:55.520" style="s2">but dialectic conversations between the</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.600" end="01:27:57.679" style="s2">best thinkers on topics</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.520" end="01:28:00.000" style="s2">who are earnest who are willing to</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.679" end="01:28:01.679" style="s2">engage in a non-rhetorical authentic</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.000" end="01:28:03.360" style="s2">kind of sense-making process together</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.679" end="01:28:06.400" style="s2">and who disagree</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.360" end="01:28:09.199" style="s2">where the facilitator is both</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.400" end="01:28:11.280" style="s2">skilled in dialectical facilitation but</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.199" end="01:28:13.120" style="s2">also understands the topic well enough</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.280" end="01:28:14.400" style="s2">to be able to facilitate it between</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.120" end="01:28:16.400" style="s2">these people who understand it</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.400" end="01:28:19.760" style="s2">exceptionally well and represent the</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.400" end="01:28:21.440" style="s2">variants and views and if someone is</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.760" end="01:28:22.880" style="s2">oriented to just want to win a debate or</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.440" end="01:28:24.639" style="s2">be rhetorical we don&#39;t invite them on</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.880" end="01:28:27.280" style="s2">they&#39;d have to agree to the</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.639" end="01:28:28.960" style="s2">um kind of dialectic process and then we</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.280" end="01:28:29.199" style="s2">do things like well what do we all agree</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.960" end="01:28:31.040" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.199" end="01:28:32.800" style="s2">like what what is known what is unknown</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.040" end="01:28:35.040" style="s2">do we agree on what&#39;s known do we agree</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.800" end="01:28:36.719" style="s2">on what things are unknown and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.040" end="01:28:38.159" style="s2">do we have a different weighting on the</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.719" end="01:28:41.120" style="s2">things that we think are known</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.159" end="01:28:42.000" style="s2">or unknown but have some probability on</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.120" end="01:28:43.760" style="s2">why do we have those</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.000" end="01:28:45.679" style="s2">weightings that lead to why we have</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.760" end="01:28:48.960" style="s2">different senses of things</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.679" end="01:28:51.199" style="s2">and so can the can the listener who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.960" end="01:28:53.360" style="s2">watching this</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.199" end="01:28:56.159" style="s2">see what the how the best thinkers think</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.360" end="01:28:57.679" style="s2">about it see where the differences are</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.159" end="01:29:00.239" style="s2">see where they should have some</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.679" end="01:29:02.239" style="s2">certainty and where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.239" end="01:29:03.920" style="s2">where there&#39;s uncertainty and get up to</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.239" end="01:29:06.560" style="s2">kind of the best</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.920" end="01:29:07.280" style="s2">general sense of where the topic is at</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.560" end="01:29:09.600" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.280" end="01:29:11.600" style="s2">doing one of those right now with uh</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.600" end="01:29:13.760" style="s2">different experts on</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.600" end="01:29:16.159" style="s2">immunity looking at what is likely to</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.760" end="01:29:17.600" style="s2">occur for covet immunity long term</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.159" end="01:29:19.600" style="s2">and so topics that are both</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.600" end="01:29:22.080" style="s2">consequential and</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.600" end="01:29:24.480" style="s2">uh debated being able to facilitate a</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.080" end="01:29:26.960" style="s2">process like that that&#39;s one example</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.480" end="01:29:28.639" style="s2">and so this does like you said make it</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.960" end="01:29:29.440" style="s2">where if it&#39;s beyond the pay grade of a</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.639" end="01:29:31.199" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.440" end="01:29:32.480" style="s2">can we make an institution that is doing</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.199" end="01:29:34.400" style="s2">that that doesn&#39;t have any other</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.480" end="01:29:37.199" style="s2">institutional incentive doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.400" end="01:29:38.080" style="s2">economic uh or political or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.199" end="01:29:40.239" style="s2">kind of bias</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.080" end="01:29:42.159" style="s2">and is really seeking to simply be a</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.239" end="01:29:43.760" style="s2">steward of the information commons and</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.159" end="01:29:44.239" style="s2">is making their process transparent</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.760" end="01:29:46.480" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.239" end="01:29:47.360" style="s2">that it can be held to that and then</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.480" end="01:29:50.400" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.360" end="01:29:50.960" style="s2">so like one of the things that another</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.400" end="01:29:53.199" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.960" end="01:29:54.639" style="s2">thing that we&#39;re working on is for any</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.199" end="01:29:56.239" style="s2">topic that is highly</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.639" end="01:29:57.920" style="s2">polarized but also trending and</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.239" end="01:29:59.679" style="s2">consequential where</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.920" end="01:30:01.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that we can&#39;t solve it if</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.679" end="01:30:03.520" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a shared understanding but</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.440" end="01:30:04.000" style="s2">where the disagreement itself becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.520" end="01:30:06.639" style="s2">source</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.000" end="01:30:08.639" style="s2">of open violence in the streets which</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.639" end="01:30:10.239" style="s2">has obviously gotten worse in</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.639" end="01:30:12.239" style="s2">recently than it has been in recent</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.239" end="01:30:13.600" style="s2">history and can get much more worse</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.239" end="01:30:15.440" style="s2">moving forward if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.600" end="01:30:16.880" style="s2">um very effective at changing that</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.440" end="01:30:19.120" style="s2">trajectory</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.880" end="01:30:21.280" style="s2">so one of the things is pick a topic and</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.120" end="01:30:24.000" style="s2">we do this kind of meta news so uh</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.280" end="01:30:25.840" style="s2">an assessment of the landscape of</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.000" end="01:30:27.600" style="s2">narratives sometimes there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.840" end="01:30:29.040" style="s2">just two narratives left and right one</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.600" end="01:30:30.000" style="s2">that are dominant but sometimes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.040" end="01:30:31.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.000" end="01:30:33.040" style="s2">seven narratives that are really</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.440" end="01:30:34.159" style="s2">trending that are really fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.040" end="01:30:35.679" style="s2">different from each other</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.159" end="01:30:37.440" style="s2">so do an assessment of here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.679" end="01:30:39.040" style="s2">primary narratives in the landscape</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.440" end="01:30:41.040" style="s2">here&#39;s a number of different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.040" end="01:30:43.360" style="s2">publications or news sources</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.040" end="01:30:45.040" style="s2">that are clustered together kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.360" end="01:30:47.199" style="s2">pushing each of these</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.040" end="01:30:49.360" style="s2">and then let&#39;s actually steel men each</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.199" end="01:30:50.400" style="s2">one let&#39;s kind of make the best argument</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.360" end="01:30:53.120" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.400" end="01:30:53.760" style="s2">so that people who don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.120" end="01:30:56.159" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.760" end="01:30:58.880" style="s2">can see why some other people who do</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.159" end="01:31:01.840" style="s2">believe it are compelled by it and have</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.880" end="01:31:02.800" style="s2">a version of other people that is not</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.840" end="01:31:06.239" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.800" end="01:31:08.000" style="s2">um villainizing then</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.239" end="01:31:10.080" style="s2">and where people are starting to learn</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.000" end="01:31:11.840" style="s2">to seek other people&#39;s perspectives and</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.080" end="01:31:14.719" style="s2">learn to steelman them</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.840" end="01:31:16.000" style="s2">and then an analytic process that so</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.719" end="01:31:17.760" style="s2">that first process is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.000" end="01:31:19.679" style="s2">intersubjective the next one is</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.760" end="01:31:21.760" style="s2">objective can we break the narrative</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.679" end="01:31:23.600" style="s2">into individual propositions</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.760" end="01:31:25.520" style="s2">and can we try to see what evidence was</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.600" end="01:31:26.480" style="s2">put forward to support the propositions</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.520" end="01:31:28.000" style="s2">and then can we look at</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.480" end="01:31:30.239" style="s2">all the rest of the evidence we can find</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.000" end="01:31:32.320" style="s2">that either support or refute them</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.239" end="01:31:34.719" style="s2">and what we&#39;ll then do is find where is</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.320" end="01:31:37.600" style="s2">their identifiable signal</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.719" end="01:31:39.600" style="s2">in all of the positions and then where</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.600" end="01:31:41.040" style="s2">are there clearly falsifiable things</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.600" end="01:31:43.040" style="s2">and then where is there a bunch of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.040" end="01:31:43.600" style="s2">that has to sit as neither falsifiable</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.040" end="01:31:46.000" style="s2">nor</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.600" end="01:31:47.440" style="s2">verifiable currently is just conjecture</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.000" end="01:31:49.040" style="s2">for which we should have no confidence</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.440" end="01:31:51.840" style="s2">one way or the other</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.040" end="01:31:53.199" style="s2">and so this is this process as people go</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.840" end="01:31:55.679" style="s2">through it helps them</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.199" end="01:31:57.199" style="s2">do things like learn propositional logic</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.679" end="01:31:59.520" style="s2">learn how to break down a narrative and</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.199" end="01:32:00.880" style="s2">not reject or accept the whole thing but</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.520" end="01:32:02.560" style="s2">be able to see there&#39;s probably some</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.880" end="01:32:03.679" style="s2">signal probably some noise and a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.560" end="01:32:05.280" style="s2">conjecture</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.679" end="01:32:07.040" style="s2">and how to calibrate their confidence</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.280" end="01:32:08.639" style="s2">margins and then</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.040" end="01:32:10.560" style="s2">how to step back and say based on the</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.639" end="01:32:12.719" style="s2">things that we can identify that are</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.560" end="01:32:14.480" style="s2">true across these spaces across these</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.719" end="01:32:15.920" style="s2">narratives what can we probably say</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.480" end="01:32:18.000" style="s2">about the space as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.920" end="01:32:19.280" style="s2">which is a synthesizing process where</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.000" end="01:32:22.159" style="s2">the earlier one was a</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.280" end="01:32:24.239" style="s2">analysis process so there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.159" end="01:32:26.080" style="s2">interpersonal narrative intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.239" end="01:32:27.840" style="s2">then an analytic empirical intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.080" end="01:32:29.520" style="s2">than a synthesizing intelligence all of</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.840" end="01:32:31.840" style="s2">which are needed to make sense so</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.520" end="01:32:33.280" style="s2">if we can do that with people that get</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.840" end="01:32:34.719" style="s2">highly trained in that and it&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.280" end="01:32:36.480" style="s2">full-time job to do</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.719" end="01:32:38.719" style="s2">but then also walk people through the</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.480" end="01:32:40.320" style="s2">steps it&#39;ll help them make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.719" end="01:32:42.080" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and just</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.320" end="01:32:43.600" style="s2">understand why the conflict is there and</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.080" end="01:32:45.440" style="s2">diffuse the conflict</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.600" end="01:32:46.960" style="s2">and then also show where each of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.440" end="01:32:49.440" style="s2">different sources are</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.960" end="01:32:50.159" style="s2">employing whether it&#39;s intentional or</p>

<p begin="01:32:50.159" end="01:32:54.080" style="s2">narrative and info weapons show where</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.320" end="01:32:55.120" style="s2">they&#39;re putting spin on things of what</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.080" end="01:32:56.800" style="s2">the original thing</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.120" end="01:32:58.800" style="s2">that was true was and then the way they</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.800" end="01:33:00.639" style="s2">framed it show where they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.800" end="01:33:02.320" style="s2">statistical cherry picking and if they</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.639" end="01:33:04.320" style="s2">looked at these other statistics</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.320" end="01:33:05.760" style="s2">how it would change the overall picture</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.320" end="01:33:07.520" style="s2">so that people start noticing the</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.760" end="01:33:09.360" style="s2">narrative and info weapons and not being</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.520" end="01:33:10.719" style="s2">and they start to look for them</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.360" end="01:33:13.040" style="s2">and they look for them across the</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.719" end="01:33:13.600" style="s2">political spectrum um an ideological</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.040" end="01:33:16.400" style="s2">spectrum</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.600" end="01:33:18.560" style="s2">rather than just in a tribal way if we</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.400" end="01:33:20.000" style="s2">can do that for people but also</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.560" end="01:33:21.600" style="s2">walk them through the steps of how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.000" end="01:33:22.880" style="s2">doing it so they learn how to do it on</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.600" end="01:33:24.800" style="s2">their own if we stopped being</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.880" end="01:33:26.800" style="s2">able to do it they could keep doing it</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.800" end="01:33:28.639" style="s2">these are examples of</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.800" end="01:33:30.880" style="s2">processes that i think can help upgrade</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.639" end="01:33:33.199" style="s2">the info ecology quite a bit</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.880" end="01:33:35.600" style="s2">also when we&#39;re doing kind of the news</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.199" end="01:33:37.360" style="s2">itself just base sense making on a topic</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.600" end="01:33:38.719" style="s2">before we look at the meta news of how</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.360" end="01:33:40.239" style="s2">everybody else is sense making or</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.719" end="01:33:43.199" style="s2">representing it</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.239" end="01:33:45.440" style="s2">when we say what we&#39;re able to assess</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.199" end="01:33:47.120" style="s2">we&#39;ll also show our process of</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.440" end="01:33:49.280" style="s2">what data are we factoring and what</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.120" end="01:33:52.239" style="s2">epistemic models are we including</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.280" end="01:33:54.080" style="s2">so if someone wants to see how did we</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.239" end="01:33:55.760" style="s2">come to that how did we calculate our</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.080" end="01:33:57.920" style="s2">confidence they can see it and then they</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.760" end="01:34:00.639" style="s2">can learn the epistemic models</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.920" end="01:34:02.159" style="s2">so can we make it to where you know you</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.639" end="01:34:04.080" style="s2">and i both know that understanding</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.159" end="01:34:05.520" style="s2">tainter helps in the way we understand</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.080" end="01:34:07.600" style="s2">a lot of things in the world or</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.520" end="01:34:09.199" style="s2">understanding mcluhan or gerard or</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.600" end="01:34:10.639" style="s2">bayesian analysis</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.199" end="01:34:11.840" style="s2">things that people didn&#39;t get and</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.639" end="01:34:13.120" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to go read all the</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.840" end="01:34:16.800" style="s2">books to get them can we</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.120" end="01:34:19.199" style="s2">just compress the epistemic</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.800" end="01:34:19.920" style="s2">models into the shortest kinds of essays</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.199" end="01:34:21.679" style="s2">that then</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.920" end="01:34:23.840" style="s2">also show how to apply them and give</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.679" end="01:34:25.760" style="s2">sense making reifying power</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.840" end="01:34:26.960" style="s2">and then link them where they&#39;re useful</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.760" end="01:34:28.880" style="s2">so that people can</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.960" end="01:34:31.280" style="s2">start to increase it&#39;s almost like an</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.880" end="01:34:32.639" style="s2">optimized public education and how to</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.280" end="01:34:34.639" style="s2">make sense of the world that will</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.639" end="01:34:36.800" style="s2">empower civic engagement</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.639" end="01:34:38.800" style="s2">so these are these are some examples of</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.800" end="01:34:41.840" style="s2">basically how do we start to</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.800" end="01:34:43.520" style="s2">do a kind of broadcast where people</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.840" end="01:34:45.199" style="s2">aren&#39;t trusting it because of</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.520" end="01:34:47.040" style="s2">some authority they&#39;re trusting their</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.199" end="01:34:47.920" style="s2">own ability to make sense of reality</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.040" end="01:34:50.480" style="s2">better because we&#39;re showing the</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.920" end="01:34:53.520" style="s2">transparent process and we&#39;re increasing</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.480" end="01:34:54.159" style="s2">their epistemic capacity and not just</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.520" end="01:34:56.080" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.159" end="01:34:57.679" style="s2">sense of based reality but also making</p>

<p begin="01:34:57.679" end="01:35:01.440" style="s2">in the narrative landscape</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.440" end="01:35:03.280" style="s2">i think that this has the ability if</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.440" end="01:35:06.480" style="s2">we&#39;re successful and</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.280" end="01:35:08.000" style="s2">to start de-arming the effectiveness of</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.480" end="01:35:10.400" style="s2">the narrative and info weapons and the</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.000" end="01:35:13.199" style="s2">tribalism and the outrage certainty</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.400" end="01:35:14.639" style="s2">and increasing people&#39;s own epistemic</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.199" end="01:35:16.960" style="s2">capabilities</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.639" end="01:35:18.639" style="s2">then if that becomes a strange attractor</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.960" end="01:35:20.560" style="s2">for a group of people that are attracted</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.639" end="01:35:21.440" style="s2">to that who start to also engage in</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.560" end="01:35:23.679" style="s2">higher quality</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.440" end="01:35:24.880" style="s2">conversation you start to get a cultural</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.679" end="01:35:26.719" style="s2">attractor that could become very</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.880" end="01:35:29.760" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.719" end="01:35:30.960" style="s2">ah it sounds really good i really hope</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.760" end="01:35:32.639" style="s2">you&#39;re able to get this</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.960" end="01:35:34.320" style="s2">going and then i think then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.639" end="01:35:35.119" style="s2">second order effect and third order</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.320" end="01:35:36.880" style="s2">effect</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.119" end="01:35:39.040" style="s2">which is if these artifacts that are</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.880" end="01:35:41.600" style="s2">created are compelling</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.040" end="01:35:42.880" style="s2">and have sufficient production values</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.600" end="01:35:44.960" style="s2">that they can spread</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.880" end="01:35:47.119" style="s2">virally and memetically then they can</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.960" end="01:35:48.800" style="s2">compete in the idea marketplace and</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.119" end="01:35:52.159" style="s2">perhaps push back some</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.800" end="01:35:53.679" style="s2">less well-formed ideas yeah and i would</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.159" end="01:35:55.520" style="s2">say even more excited</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.679" end="01:35:56.960" style="s2">than viral sharing because viral sharing</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.520" end="01:36:00.480" style="s2">is mostly not thinking right</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.960" end="01:36:02.080" style="s2">it&#39;s just being memetic repeaters um and</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.480" end="01:36:04.320" style="s2">i know you and jordan have talked about</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.080" end="01:36:08.239" style="s2">this uh you know simulated thinking but</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.320" end="01:36:10.560" style="s2">for the most part people especially in</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.239" end="01:36:12.639" style="s2">say the facebook environment aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.560" end="01:36:14.960" style="s2">actually thinking they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.639" end="01:36:17.360" style="s2">looking at a thing and saying does this</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.960" end="01:36:20.239" style="s2">conforms to my current thinking ideas</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.360" end="01:36:21.520" style="s2">that i should repeat it or not and if it</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.239" end="01:36:23.440" style="s2">does then i hit</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.520" end="01:36:24.880" style="s2">you know share or whatever so most</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.440" end="01:36:26.639" style="s2">people are just acting as kind of</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.880" end="01:36:27.840" style="s2">memetic filters and propagators we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.639" end="01:36:29.679" style="s2">thinking would be</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.840" end="01:36:31.520" style="s2">is this true what are the other opinions</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.679" end="01:36:34.320" style="s2">how do i know what kind of deeper</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.520" end="01:36:37.520" style="s2">process do i do research is just the</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.320" end="01:36:39.600" style="s2">vetting is it true thinking is also</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.520" end="01:36:41.440" style="s2">not just looking externally but looking</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.600" end="01:36:43.600" style="s2">internally at</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.440" end="01:36:45.679" style="s2">what is meaningful about this how would</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.600" end="01:36:48.480" style="s2">i go about making sense of this</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.679" end="01:36:49.360" style="s2">and so while viral replication has some</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.480" end="01:36:51.199" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.360" end="01:36:52.560" style="s2">i would actually hope that a success of</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.199" end="01:36:54.719" style="s2">what we would do would be</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.560" end="01:36:56.719" style="s2">eventually the end of viral replication</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.719" end="01:36:59.280" style="s2">in that way</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.719" end="01:36:59.760" style="s2">and instead say some people who started</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.280" end="01:37:02.080" style="s2">to get</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.760" end="01:37:04.000" style="s2">much better at facilitating high quality</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.080" end="01:37:06.239" style="s2">dialogue at facilitating</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.000" end="01:37:07.760" style="s2">dialectical thinking and steel manning</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.239" end="01:37:09.360" style="s2">different positions as well as</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.760" end="01:37:11.360" style="s2">empiricism</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.360" end="01:37:12.800" style="s2">and those people become parts of</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.360" end="01:37:14.719" style="s2">everybody&#39;s friend group and just start</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.800" end="01:37:16.080" style="s2">to facilitate not just we&#39;re sharing</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.719" end="01:37:18.000" style="s2">this piece of content</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.080" end="01:37:19.520" style="s2">but we&#39;re facilitating authentically</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.000" end="01:37:21.119" style="s2">better conversation in all these other</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.520" end="01:37:22.320" style="s2">environments</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.119" end="01:37:23.840" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s good but i also</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.320" end="01:37:25.760" style="s2">think it&#39;s a little bit wishful thinking</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.840" end="01:37:28.080" style="s2">i suspect because of the issues of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.760" end="01:37:29.920" style="s2">distributions of hierarchical complexity</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.080" end="01:37:31.520" style="s2">the number of people who can really</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.920" end="01:37:34.960" style="s2">deeply think about these</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.520" end="01:37:36.320" style="s2">large-scale complex issues is small but</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.960" end="01:37:38.239" style="s2">there&#39;ll be some number that can engage</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.320" end="01:37:38.960" style="s2">in it and having more engaged in real</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.239" end="01:37:41.040" style="s2">thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.960" end="01:37:42.560" style="s2">modeling real thinking as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.040" end="01:37:44.880" style="s2">simulated thinking</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.560" end="01:37:47.119" style="s2">will also help up regulate the</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.880" end="01:37:48.639" style="s2">credibility of the artifacts for people</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.119" end="01:37:50.480" style="s2">who are going to be consumers rather</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.639" end="01:37:52.159" style="s2">than thinkers for themselves</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.480" end="01:37:54.000" style="s2">but this sounds like really exciting</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.159" end="01:37:56.639" style="s2">stuff i look forward to</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.000" end="01:37:58.480" style="s2">watching you guys progress and i think</p>
