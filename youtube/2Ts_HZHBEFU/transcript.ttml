<p begin="00:02:32.410" end="00:02:38.950" style="s2">where exactly is the imposition on</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.250" end="00:02:41.620" style="s2">people&#39;s freedoms I&#39;ve yet to see it in</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.950" end="00:02:43.600" style="s2">some way now the order to stay at home</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.620" end="00:02:45.010" style="s2">that the governor is an issue that have</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.600" end="00:02:47.650" style="s2">shut the businesses down</p>

<p begin="00:02:52.900" end="00:02:57.340" style="s2">those reopened so that when those people</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.000" end="00:02:59.980" style="s2">are fearing for their lives they have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.340" end="00:03:01.540" style="s2">quit rather than be fired or be laid off</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.980" end="00:03:02.950" style="s2">because women because then they can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:12.670" style="s2">we just have a forty or fifty percent</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.630" end="00:04:15.430" style="s2">protection rate we&#39;re actually at about</p>

<p begin="00:04:51.550" end="00:04:56.530" style="s2">hours depending upon the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.260" end="00:04:58.210" style="s2">ventilation ready the outside you know</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.579" end="00:06:57.069" style="s2">that&#39;s called embalming I mean alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.489" end="00:06:58.749" style="s2">alcohol yes alcohol is a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.069" end="00:07:01.059" style="s2">effective disinfectant you know why</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.749" end="00:07:04.599" style="s2">because it&#39;s a sterilizer and in a</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.409" end="00:07:57.429" style="s2">that the fact is we don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.419" end="00:07:59.589" style="s2">information you look at Stanford</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.429" end="00:08:02.469" style="s2">Stanford basically has been saying by</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.589" end="00:08:05.529" style="s2">their tests by their estimates that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.469" end="00:08:07.689" style="s2">could be anywhere between you know 40 or</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.529" end="00:08:09.699" style="s2">50 or 60 maybe up to 80% of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.689" end="00:08:12.129" style="s2">population has already added we had a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.699" end="00:08:13.689" style="s2">Harvard Harvard&#39;s like no there&#39;s hardly</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.129" end="00:08:16.719" style="s2">any social penetration we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.689" end="00:08:18.999" style="s2">to be in a lockdown until 2021 and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.719" end="00:08:21.189" style="s2">you know what New York just had its most</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.999" end="00:08:23.439" style="s2">recently did a random sample about 3,000</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.189" end="00:08:26.139" style="s2">people they thought about 14% of New</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.439" end="00:08:27.939" style="s2">York and maybe or 25% in New York City</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.139" end="00:08:29.349" style="s2">but then there&#39;s all kinds of people we</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.939" end="00:08:31.389" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand what the deal is</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.349" end="00:08:33.849" style="s2">that some people are suggesting that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.389" end="00:08:35.500" style="s2">there is there are different strands and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.849" end="00:08:38.139" style="s2">there was like a kind of strain and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.500" end="00:08:39.699" style="s2">came directly from China there was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.139" end="00:08:41.110" style="s2">fairly mild one and that&#39;s what gives</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.699" end="00:08:43.240" style="s2">the West Coast that&#39;s what getting to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.110" end="00:08:46.209" style="s2">Washington in California where is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.240" end="00:08:48.730" style="s2">somehow when it hit Italy or Spain it</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.209" end="00:08:51.100" style="s2">mutated it changed there was a different</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.730" end="00:08:54.100" style="s2">viral load the people who came</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.100" end="00:08:56.440" style="s2">more infectious on the well it was but</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.100" end="00:08:59.079" style="s2">it is it&#39;s a different thing there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.440" end="00:09:02.290" style="s2">it&#39;s a real different than shredders we</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.079" end="00:09:04.060" style="s2">should keep or shedders yeah so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.290" end="00:09:05.069" style="s2">even like we don&#39;t even know what that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.060" end="00:09:07.870" style="s2">difference is</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.069" end="00:09:11.500" style="s2">there&#39;s just yeah mystery and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.870" end="00:09:14.170" style="s2">misinformation and one knows and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.500" end="00:09:15.850" style="s2">answers but I mean I do I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.170" end="00:09:17.649" style="s2">it&#39;s irritating that all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.850" end="00:09:19.600" style="s2">intelligence agencies have said look</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.649" end="00:09:21.880" style="s2">this is not man-made this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.600" end="00:09:25.149" style="s2">weapon Trump continues to push the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.880" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">conspiracy yeah yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.149" end="00:09:30.630" style="s2">here&#39;s the deal you know this many years</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:33.490" style="s2">ago I had a really just a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.630" end="00:09:35.440" style="s2">invite from Dartmouth they brought me</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.490" end="00:09:38.139" style="s2">out to the immunology team there&#39;s under</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.440" end="00:09:39.880" style="s2">violent ships so Bob he contacted me</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.139" end="00:09:42.040" style="s2">through you to make important I agree I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.880" end="00:09:43.990" style="s2">was interested and we had lots of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.040" end="00:09:46.240" style="s2">discussions and then he wanted to come</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.990" end="00:09:49.170" style="s2">out to this immunology team and see if I</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.240" end="00:09:53.529" style="s2">could help them in thinking about doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.170" end="00:09:54.730" style="s2">either instructional material for them</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.529" end="00:09:56.139" style="s2">or trying to think more about how to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.730" end="00:09:58.180" style="s2">graphically designed some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.139" end="00:10:00.040" style="s2">I&#39;m teaching people about the immune</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.180" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">system you know when I was younger I</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.040" end="00:10:05.139" style="s2">thought that by I think not an arrogant</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:06.850" style="s2">disrespect for biology but I think a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.139" end="00:10:09.220" style="s2">little bit you know I served well had</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.850" end="00:10:10.839" style="s2">physics Envy was like wow the physicists</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.220" end="00:10:11.980" style="s2">they really know and you can chemists I</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.839" end="00:10:13.930" style="s2">was like wow you know the organic</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.980" end="00:10:15.639" style="s2">chemistry tricky stuff but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.930" end="00:10:17.079" style="s2">biologists don&#39;t like oh let me guess</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.639" end="00:10:19.149" style="s2">the knee bone is connected to the shin</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.079" end="00:10:21.639" style="s2">bone where desolately bones there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.149" end="00:10:23.649" style="s2">you know I learned more about physiology</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.639" end="00:10:25.240" style="s2">and I thought wow you know physiologies</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.649" end="00:10:27.880" style="s2">pretty tough like when I went and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.240" end="00:10:29.949" style="s2">learned about the immune system and not</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.880" end="00:10:33.519" style="s2">only sizzled my brain and realized this</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.949" end="00:10:36.189" style="s2">was well behind me what was I was really</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.519" end="00:10:39.610" style="s2">humbled into you know I think the immune</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.189" end="00:10:42.189" style="s2">system is infinitely more complex than</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.610" end="00:10:45.430" style="s2">any of us understand and because of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.189" end="00:10:48.130" style="s2">it&#39;s so prone to conspiracy yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.430" end="00:10:50.680" style="s2">and you just as it has no genetic makeup</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.130" end="00:10:52.779" style="s2">you have a memory and then your blood</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.680" end="00:10:55.180" style="s2">type matters in the conditions matter</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.779" end="00:10:57.370" style="s2">like the difference between cholera and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.180" end="00:10:59.800" style="s2">a virus is huge and whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.370" end="00:11:01.389" style="s2">have old blood type or a blood type of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.800" end="00:11:02.120" style="s2">man there&#39;s all these different</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.389" end="00:11:05.269" style="s2">variables</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.120" end="00:11:08.329" style="s2">it&#39;s a sea of complexity rest in your</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.269" end="00:11:13.160" style="s2">bodies yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.329" end="00:11:16.790" style="s2">no no it&#39;s yeah yeah and depending on</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.160" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">where you slice it which is depends on</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.790" end="00:11:19.910" style="s2">where you&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:22.100" style="s2">but but then you add in then you add in</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.910" end="00:11:25.370" style="s2">the evolutionary aspect of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.100" end="00:11:26.389" style="s2">you&#39;re just that stuff is just you ever</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.370" end="00:11:28.870" style="s2">seen that you&#39;ve you ever seen that</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.389" end="00:11:31.249" style="s2">movie about the way the way genes</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.870" end="00:11:32.959" style="s2">separate where they do a 3d animation</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.249" end="00:11:34.819" style="s2">have you seen that once a TED talk I</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.959" end="00:11:40.749" style="s2">think it was first done when they go a</p>

<p begin="00:12:59.569" end="00:13:03.980" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on biologically I</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.639" end="00:13:07.220" style="s2">mean it&#39;s just it&#39;s absolutely socially</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.980" end="00:13:10.129" style="s2">completely like politically incorrect on</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.129" end="00:13:15.980" style="s2">almost to the point where I know that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.579" end="00:13:17.390" style="s2">it weinstein talks about like he</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.350" end="00:21:57.610" style="s2">interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.690" end="00:21:59.500" style="s2">I think one of the things that you bring</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.610" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">out a lot what I got through actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.500" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">reading your book which is for people</p>

<p begin="00:22:04.450" end="00:22:08.889" style="s2">gonna do this but the timing issues</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.539" end="00:22:10.570" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go over your book which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.889" end="00:22:12.190" style="s2">really excited about doing but one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.570" end="00:22:13.779" style="s2">the things that you really I really got</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.190" end="00:22:18.100" style="s2">out of that was this thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.779" end="00:22:23.379" style="s2">talked about in your in your chapter</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.100" end="00:22:26.799" style="s2">about sociality like the social negation</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.379" end="00:22:28.629" style="s2">of the way that the world like the like</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.799" end="00:22:32.139" style="s2">the way that you can appropriate the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.629" end="00:22:38.019" style="s2">world or would want to and how built in</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.139" end="00:22:40.899" style="s2">past relations right start to bring</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.019" end="00:22:42.580" style="s2">confines into what you can&#39;t do what you</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.899" end="00:22:46.090" style="s2">can&#39;t appropriate and where you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.580" end="00:22:48.100" style="s2">write in that in that this this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.090" end="00:22:51.220" style="s2">like and I and I noticed that like if</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.100" end="00:22:52.990" style="s2">you really want to know because we used</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.220" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">to do this to help people kind of break</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.990" end="00:22:58.179" style="s2">out of like social shame or reveal</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:22:59.769" style="s2">social shame is just imagine what it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.179" end="00:23:03.759" style="s2">be like to go into a Starbucks and just</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.769" end="00:23:07.539" style="s2">lay on the floor right it&#39;d be you start</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.759" end="00:23:09.000" style="s2">to like you reveal the not right but</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.539" end="00:23:12.820" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.000" end="00:23:17.230" style="s2">because it isn&#39;t we relate to it by</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.820" end="00:23:19.419" style="s2">actually it&#39;s infused in standing in</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.230" end="00:23:22.899" style="s2">line at Starbucks and doing the various</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.419" end="00:23:27.399" style="s2">things that are appropriate right and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.899" end="00:23:30.250" style="s2">like this this sense about the the not</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.399" end="00:23:34.330" style="s2">like how you could get like something to</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.250" end="00:23:37.210" style="s2">appropriate or even grasp right like in</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.330" end="00:23:39.720" style="s2">terms of consciousness about what&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.210" end="00:23:43.720" style="s2">able to relate to what something is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.720" end="00:23:45.299" style="s2">is something that just I&#39;ve heard being</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.720" end="00:23:48.190" style="s2">around a lot of people in the Bay Area</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.299" end="00:23:50.139" style="s2">right who are working on a I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.190" end="00:23:51.879" style="s2">them talk about like that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.139" end="00:23:53.830" style="s2">biggest dilemmas is that you can&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.879" end="00:23:59.470" style="s2">no one&#39;s been able to figure out how you</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.830" end="00:24:02.529" style="s2">get a computation to relate to what what</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.470" end="00:24:05.379" style="s2">they&#39;re not what it&#39;s not like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.529" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">whole thing is seems to be very key to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.379" end="00:24:09.020" style="s2">your book pages terms it&#39;s very related</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:11.179" style="s2">to the logic</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.020" end="00:24:13.370" style="s2">there there are different lots of you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.179" end="00:24:15.410" style="s2">tighten to fake orders of abstraction or</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.370" end="00:24:18.980" style="s2">those have to can be like play phrase</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.410" end="00:24:21.800" style="s2">and so you know one of the ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.980" end="00:24:25.730" style="s2">learn what is in the set in what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.800" end="00:24:28.550" style="s2">in the set isn&#39;t play and you know so</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.730" end="00:24:30.050" style="s2">yeah I mean just in the terms that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.550" end="00:24:32.809" style="s2">know in the book I would say that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.050" end="00:24:35.240" style="s2">there&#39;s the body has various capacities</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.809" end="00:24:37.309" style="s2">were released in an appropriation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.240" end="00:24:39.650" style="s2">sort of like someone is a tiny hearing</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.309" end="00:24:41.750" style="s2">but this early and yeah there are filled</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.650" end="00:24:43.580" style="s2">intentions and they&#39;re empty cages so if</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.750" end="00:24:46.850" style="s2">I say to you you know let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.580" end="00:24:48.920" style="s2">Amsterdam if either of us have ever been</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.850" end="00:24:51.320" style="s2">to Amsterdam we&#39;re like okay well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.920" end="00:24:53.450" style="s2">have a sense that we&#39;ve seen pictures of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.320" end="00:24:55.309" style="s2">what we heard the words the intention is</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.450" end="00:24:58.460" style="s2">more than empty whereas if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.309" end="00:25:01.550" style="s2">been to Amsterdam afraid you have more</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.460" end="00:25:04.250" style="s2">filled intentions because you physically</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.550" end="00:25:06.860" style="s2">have released an appropriated certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.250" end="00:25:09.950" style="s2">aspects of that suite with your own</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.860" end="00:25:11.720" style="s2">sensory capacities you know so like</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.950" end="00:25:15.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve been answering at my been</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.720" end="00:25:17.420" style="s2">answered and you know like Antonia brief</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.170" end="00:25:21.710" style="s2">drives an amazing place to be is a great</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.420" end="00:25:24.020" style="s2">road or if you go to like damn 307 cool</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.710" end="00:25:29.960" style="s2">coffee shop with a three in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.020" end="00:25:32.600" style="s2">of it and to see yourself is to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.960" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2">released an appropriate it is our</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.600" end="00:25:38.860" style="s2">primary way talking about but then as</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:42.770" style="s2">you suggest that one of the things of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.860" end="00:25:45.620" style="s2">our reality is that our lives are never</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.770" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">just ours that were personal partly</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.620" end="00:25:50.390" style="s2">social through and through and so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:52.429" style="s2">release and appropriation is socially</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.390" end="00:25:54.140" style="s2">orchestrated and regulated there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.429" end="00:25:56.570" style="s2">kind of orchestration and regulation</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.140" end="00:25:58.820" style="s2">about what one does and what one doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.570" end="00:26:01.460" style="s2">do know this is an ID here&#39;s boss Bob</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.820" end="00:26:04.690" style="s2">you know it&#39;s about the de self and this</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.460" end="00:26:09.650" style="s2">construction of orderliness in the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.690" end="00:26:13.970" style="s2">and yeah I mean I think the what I say</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.650" end="00:26:15.980" style="s2">there the the dynamic of of avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.970" end="00:26:18.679" style="s2">where you know you&#39;re not welcome and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.980" end="00:26:20.330" style="s2">not bringing up certain topics with</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.679" end="00:26:22.360" style="s2">people because you know it would make</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.330" end="00:26:25.060" style="s2">them uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.360" end="00:26:29.260" style="s2">now think things that you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.060" end="00:26:32.800" style="s2">them to think yeah it&#39;s sort of orders</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.260" end="00:26:37.240" style="s2">then it&#39;s sort of similar to the chess</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.800" end="00:26:39.580" style="s2">move let me see my critique they&#39;ve let</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.240" end="00:26:42.300" style="s2">me that I try to do this robots paper</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.580" end="00:26:45.370" style="s2">which is you know it&#39;s one thing to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.300" end="00:26:48.160" style="s2">here is a chessboard and here are</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.370" end="00:26:49.090" style="s2">probability fields or what is the likely</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.160" end="00:26:51.100" style="s2">best move</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.090" end="00:26:53.950" style="s2">given the current position of the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.100" end="00:26:55.390" style="s2">and you know I can see your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.950" end="00:26:57.190" style="s2">in mind and might there&#39;s some history</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.390" end="00:26:58.870" style="s2">about your playing strategy but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.190" end="00:27:00.940" style="s2">basically a probability field with a</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.870" end="00:27:03.520" style="s2">bunch of statistics about best possible</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.940" end="00:27:06.670" style="s2">moves that&#39;s very very different than</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.520" end="00:27:08.380" style="s2">something quite simple which is I&#39;m at a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.670" end="00:27:10.150" style="s2">cocktail party and there&#39;s like five</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.380" end="00:27:12.160" style="s2">people and we&#39;re having a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.150" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">about how much I spent on a bottle of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.160" end="00:27:17.050" style="s2">wine and we&#39;re gonna ask whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.320" end="00:27:19.840" style="s2">I nice with my money or I&#39;m stingy with</p>

<p begin="00:27:19.840" end="00:27:25.000" style="s2">subjectivity we have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:27.820" style="s2">sense of some people think I&#39;m stingy</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.000" end="00:27:29.710" style="s2">and some people think that I&#39;m my scent</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.820" end="00:27:32.050" style="s2">just some people think I&#39;m about right</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.710" end="00:27:34.420" style="s2">and I have to know well this person</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.050" end="00:27:37.030" style="s2">thinks absolutely this person thinks I</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.420" end="00:27:40.300" style="s2">and I sort of deal with that any</p>

<p begin="00:27:57.070" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">can kind of say say that like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:05.140" style="s2">proposition but it&#39;s mostly like the way</p>

<p begin="00:28:05.140" end="00:28:08.050" style="s2">are constantly being closed shaped and</p>

<p begin="00:30:31.799" end="00:30:35.100" style="s2">different ways that you can appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.270" end="00:30:38.130" style="s2">of where I think you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.100" end="00:30:40.370" style="s2">it like this this great language so</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.130" end="00:30:44.850" style="s2">where things I like about this level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.370" end="00:30:47.190" style="s2">dialogue right is that is is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.850" end="00:30:47.940" style="s2">just it&#39;s not just being informed like</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.190" end="00:30:49.649" style="s2">in order to</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.940" end="00:30:53.340" style="s2">understand what you&#39;re saying in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.649" end="00:30:56.070" style="s2">book you actually have to see the thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.340" end="00:30:57.899" style="s2">and use that which you&#39;re you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.070" end="00:31:02.309" style="s2">like it there&#39;s this way where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.899" end="00:31:03.960" style="s2">fractal like - it&#39;s like you um in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.309" end="00:31:07.049" style="s2">beginning of every chapter you almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.960" end="00:31:09.990" style="s2">have these almost like like : questions</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.049" end="00:31:12.090" style="s2">right about like like about language and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.990" end="00:31:14.970" style="s2">about hearing and about seeing that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.090" end="00:31:17.549" style="s2">kind of an IgG Matic and then you go on</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.970" end="00:31:20.429" style="s2">and you don&#39;t answer them you just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.549" end="00:31:22.350" style="s2">you well you kind of do answer them but</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.429" end="00:31:24.860" style="s2">but but how you go about it is it you go</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.350" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">and you address what those questions</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.860" end="00:31:30.750" style="s2">presuppose right and you show the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:32.519" style="s2">metaphysics of those propositions and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.750" end="00:31:34.710" style="s2">then by the time that you go like you</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.519" end="00:31:36.330" style="s2">walk around through what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.710" end="00:31:39.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve considered hearing up to this</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.330" end="00:31:41.879" style="s2">point what is the the smuggled and right</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.240" end="00:31:43.860" style="s2">assumptions about materialism or you</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.879" end="00:31:45.570" style="s2">know about social constructionism and</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.860" end="00:31:48.539" style="s2">then you start to work all that out and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.570" end="00:31:49.980" style="s2">then by the end of it it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.539" end="00:31:51.870" style="s2">didn&#39;t necessarily answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.980" end="00:31:53.549" style="s2">but you have a completely new question</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.870" end="00:31:56.190" style="s2">that you could ask and you&#39;re on a new</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.549" end="00:31:58.710" style="s2">kind of place to stand on right where</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.190" end="00:32:01.169" style="s2">you realizing that that question like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.710" end="00:32:02.730" style="s2">lot of those questions presupposed so</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.169" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">many things that were invisible to us</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.730" end="00:32:09.419" style="s2">right and something about making those</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:11.250" style="s2">visible and demonstrating them and</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.419" end="00:32:16.860" style="s2">showing how the mistake actually does</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.250" end="00:32:20.190" style="s2">point to the like the limitation of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.860" end="00:32:22.440" style="s2">the question presupposes ray points to a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.190" end="00:32:24.210" style="s2">truth about the phenomena that you could</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.440" end="00:32:27.210" style="s2">address there&#39;s something about making</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.210" end="00:32:29.580" style="s2">that walk back and then kind of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.210" end="00:32:32.879" style="s2">it newly likes like things kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.580" end="00:32:38.009" style="s2">flailing open that is it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.879" end="00:32:42.179" style="s2">it I feel like I&#39;ve like that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.009" end="00:32:45.000" style="s2">thinking and reading this stuff has</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.179" end="00:32:46.860" style="s2">really kind of changes the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.000" end="00:32:49.740" style="s2">see it changes the way that you think</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.860" end="00:32:51.179" style="s2">right we just go back to what you said</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.740" end="00:32:53.700" style="s2">at the very beginning I mean I really</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.179" end="00:32:56.309" style="s2">agree that&#39;s right I think phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.700" end="00:32:59.250" style="s2">as a method is basically learning on a</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.309" end="00:33:00.840" style="s2">beginner dies it&#39;s very honest see</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.250" end="00:33:03.900" style="s2">things as if you were</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.840" end="00:33:06.630" style="s2">and non-native it&#39;s it&#39;s somehow doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.900" end="00:33:08.820" style="s2">away and coming back and taking the trip</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.630" end="00:33:11.669" style="s2">that allows things that are already</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.820" end="00:33:14.580" style="s2">familiar to seem unfamiliar enough you</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.669" end="00:33:16.860" style="s2">can sort of see them and yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.580" end="00:33:18.630" style="s2">think in some way if anyone wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.860" end="00:33:22.140" style="s2">understand my book they would be much</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.630" end="00:33:26.279" style="s2">better off to set the book down to</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.140" end="00:33:29.700" style="s2">really look at themselves and see what</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.279" end="00:33:31.650" style="s2">shows itself to ask themselves what it</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.700" end="00:33:33.779" style="s2">means to think what it needs to have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.650" end="00:33:36.390" style="s2">body but it needs to be conversation</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.779" end="00:33:38.399" style="s2">with others and and then really try to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.390" end="00:33:40.919" style="s2">focus on their experience their</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.399" end="00:33:43.820" style="s2">existence is the larger flame for their</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.919" end="00:33:46.700" style="s2">experiences with energy things and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.820" end="00:33:49.289" style="s2">knowing that I&#39;m trying to describe that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.700" end="00:33:51.289" style="s2">yeah look at the book as an attempted</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.289" end="00:33:53.909" style="s2">description of what they&#39;re directly</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.289" end="00:33:57.480" style="s2">experience you&#39;re directly experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.909" end="00:34:00.270" style="s2">and see how you can try to get a</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.480" end="00:34:03.840" style="s2">language for describing patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.270" end="00:34:06.120" style="s2">regularities well this I think is what</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.840" end="00:34:09.960" style="s2">I&#39;m saying is like in reading your book</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.120" end="00:34:11.780" style="s2">I end up back there looking out of it in</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.960" end="00:34:14.970" style="s2">order to understand what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.780" end="00:34:17.310" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s really I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.970" end="00:34:18.810" style="s2">trying to bring words to what that is I</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.310" end="00:34:21.510" style="s2">mean I think what are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.810" end="00:34:23.580" style="s2">people you know people like zigs at</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.510" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">Mohali I&#39;m slow you know there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.580" end="00:34:30.470" style="s2">stuff on athletes who learn to get in</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:32.460" style="s2">the flow and get in the zone I think we</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.470" end="00:34:34.260" style="s2">underestimate how much I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.460" end="00:34:38.300" style="s2">true it&#39;s good advice what did it be</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.260" end="00:34:41.580" style="s2">underestimate how much we&#39;re perpetually</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.300" end="00:34:45.859" style="s2">continuously forgetting about ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.580" end="00:34:48.929" style="s2">and losing ourselves in the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.859" end="00:34:50.369" style="s2">it&#39;s from one engagement to the next</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.929" end="00:34:53.099" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of there than were aware of</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.369" end="00:34:54.750" style="s2">ourselves and then sure enough we forgot</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.099" end="00:35:01.220" style="s2">that were there and were lost in</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.750" end="00:35:07.220" style="s2">whatever dispersed around us indication</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.220" end="00:35:07.220" style="s2">like what day of the week is it or what</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.849" end="00:35:14.050" style="s2">it&#39;s happening at the microcosm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:17.080" style="s2">happening in conversations it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.050" end="00:35:20.260" style="s2">but we normally recessed we&#39;re normally</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.080" end="00:35:21.460" style="s2">the absence which is the rule making for</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.260" end="00:35:24.070" style="s2">everything else</p>

<p begin="00:36:02.740" end="00:36:09.940" style="s2">talked about this where you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.090" end="00:36:14.830" style="s2">the Earth&#39;s internal negating it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.510" end="00:36:35.250" style="s2">whole thing it was this sense of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.820" end="00:36:38.380" style="s2">sense of this that I am we are the earth</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.250" end="00:36:41.440" style="s2">right doing something in that in that if</p>

<p begin="00:36:41.440" end="00:36:46.990" style="s2">a lot of your book to is is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.660" end="00:36:50.050" style="s2">conversation with you know materialism</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.430" end="00:36:59.470" style="s2">a lot about some of that stuff which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.740" end="00:37:03.570" style="s2">but it seems like how you do it is you</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.470" end="00:37:06.520" style="s2">start to restore a sense of ground right</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.570" end="00:37:08.740" style="s2">to to that and I think how you do that</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.520" end="00:37:13.570" style="s2">is through this this conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.740" end="00:37:15.160" style="s2">the earth what how is it the light I</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.570" end="00:37:17.170" style="s2">think you know for my own lights I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.160" end="00:37:22.960" style="s2">basically what happened it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.170" end="00:37:25.780" style="s2">oversimplification but was was Cyril had</p>

<p begin="00:37:30.240" end="00:37:35.850" style="s2">Ponty pulled that out in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.790" end="00:37:37.260" style="s2">well Alfred shoots Alfred shirts was a</p>

<p begin="00:37:49.770" end="00:37:54.990" style="s2">I think you can do you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.920" end="00:37:57.330" style="s2">use personal against himself to show</p>

<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:07.560" style="s2">basically that part of the sural that</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.010" end="00:38:09.960" style="s2">was grounded in the transcendental ego</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:43.800" style="s2">things in the book that isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.970" end="00:38:45.750" style="s2">said in the book but supplied in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.800" end="00:38:46.740" style="s2">book of the sort of I was really trained</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.750" end="00:38:48.869" style="s2">and this is my doctoral dissertation</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.740" end="00:38:50.670" style="s2">basically what I was trained in you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.869" end="00:38:52.740" style="s2">phenomenology hermeneutics and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.670" end="00:38:55.080" style="s2">about the inner meeting of things and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.740" end="00:38:57.869" style="s2">you know it begins with the boosters and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.080" end="00:38:59.310" style="s2">the knockers of Taylor&#39;s work you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.869" end="00:39:01.350" style="s2">where Taylor was trying to say what</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.310" end="00:39:03.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a sponsor of authenticity of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.350" end="00:39:04.800" style="s2">license to live your own life and some</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.300" end="00:39:06.869" style="s2">people are for it so people are against</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.800" end="00:39:08.520" style="s2">it it has to do positive interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.869" end="00:39:10.020" style="s2">which I want to say yeah we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.520" end="00:39:11.880" style="s2">probably leave suddenly late comers to</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.020" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">the party this thing happened at least</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.880" end="00:39:16.619" style="s2">couple hundred years ago but now if</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:19.770" style="s2">we&#39;re going to say there is a call to</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.619" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">authenticity well what exactly is this</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.770" end="00:39:25.020" style="s2">self Anniston well and so for me as i</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:29.369" style="s2">was trying to say before that there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.020" end="00:39:29.910" style="s2">at least i&#39;m embodied i&#39;m social i&#39;m so</p>

<p begin="00:39:32.100" end="00:39:37.790" style="s2">temporal and that you can understand any</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.340" end="00:39:40.109" style="s2">one of those by seen how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.790" end="00:39:43.059" style="s2">constituted by the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.109" end="00:39:45.219" style="s2">an embodiment you&#39;re gonna have to show</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.059" end="00:39:49.719" style="s2">that you come from other people and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.219" end="00:39:52.749" style="s2">you&#39;re 12 it&#39;s social your sociality run</p>

<p begin="00:40:17.200" end="00:40:22.359" style="s2">temporality will jump reality is some</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.709" end="00:40:25.140" style="s2">for at least for multicellular organism</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.359" end="00:40:27.729" style="s2">such as ourselves it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.140" end="00:40:32.559" style="s2">configuration of embodiment sociality</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.729" end="00:40:35.170" style="s2">and yeah yeah yeah that ni it felt it</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.559" end="00:40:37.989" style="s2">felt like he got really in the guts of</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.170" end="00:40:40.079" style="s2">that like that I thought really well in</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.989" end="00:40:44.559" style="s2">that sense of I think you used the term</p>

<p begin="00:40:59.109" end="00:41:02.609" style="s2">showed how like it happens in between</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.430" end="00:41:06.339" style="s2">you can&#39;t reduce it to one or the other</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.609" end="00:41:07.869" style="s2">but there&#39;s this relationship and so one</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.339" end="00:41:12.039" style="s2">of the things that that thing about the</p>
