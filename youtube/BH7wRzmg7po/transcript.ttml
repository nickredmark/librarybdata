<p begin="00:00:16.980" end="00:00:21.359" style="s2">intelligence we had a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:23.330" style="s2">way that we came together and learning</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.359" end="00:00:25.199" style="s2">about his new software and his work</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.330" end="00:00:27.689" style="s2">ladies and gentlemen like to introduce</p>

<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:41.040" style="s2">a better understanding of the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:43.469" style="s2">around them today and artificial</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:46.469" style="s2">intelligence and and computer science</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.469" end="00:00:49.230" style="s2">obviously very important issue for us</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.469" end="00:00:51.180" style="s2">moving forward into the future my guys</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.230" end="00:00:53.370" style="s2">in the limo Order are very focused on</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.180" end="00:00:55.680" style="s2">the way technology impacts the way that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.370" end="00:00:57.480" style="s2">we organize community technology impacts</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.680" end="00:00:58.649" style="s2">the way that we communicate we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.480" end="00:01:01.079" style="s2">very focused on the way technology</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.649" end="00:01:03.480" style="s2">impacts our way to even learn and have</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.079" end="00:01:05.700" style="s2">ideas or even an understanding of who we</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.480" end="00:01:08.460" style="s2">are as humans and what tribes and our</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.700" end="00:01:10.260" style="s2">social affiliations we have so this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.460" end="00:01:12.780" style="s2">something that fits right in theme with</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.260" end="00:01:15.180" style="s2">the the larger overarching themes of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.780" end="00:01:16.890" style="s2">podcasts but it is gonna be probably a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.180" end="00:01:19.170" style="s2">little bit more technical a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.890" end="00:01:20.790" style="s2">nerdier than usual which is fine with me</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.170" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">I love it and I know the audience is</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.790" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">willing to go for it too so and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:27.780" style="s2">contrast ARAG Weinstein&#39;s patil portal</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:29.939" style="s2">podcast where he says if anybody gets</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.780" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">left behind so be it forget them they</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.939" end="00:01:33.479" style="s2">don&#39;t want to dumb anything down or go</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:36.600" style="s2">into basics I think we&#39;re gonna take the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.479" end="00:01:38.040" style="s2">opposite approach here and while you are</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.600" end="00:01:40.680" style="s2">and I&#39;ll have you explain your</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.040" end="00:01:42.210" style="s2">background imminently qualified to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.680" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">discuss the finest details of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.210" end="00:01:47.369" style="s2">subject matter my goal here is to have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">conversation that is gonna be digestible</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.369" end="00:01:51.750" style="s2">and useful and informative for for most</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:53.670" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t experts but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.750" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">are bringing with them a fair amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.670" end="00:01:58.229" style="s2">intellectual firepower for understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:01.049" style="s2">and processing this stuff so with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.229" end="00:02:03.329" style="s2">in mind let&#39;s just get started I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.049" end="00:02:06.540" style="s2">were introduced through a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.329" end="00:02:08.580" style="s2">associate a few months ago and I gotta</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:09.520" style="s2">be honest when we set up to have a phone</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.580" end="00:02:11.710" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.520" end="00:02:14.290" style="s2">I just had the phone call with you and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.710" end="00:02:16.030" style="s2">then after Hertz went back and started</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.290" end="00:02:17.980" style="s2">researching your background and I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.030" end="00:02:19.420" style="s2">that I did that in that order because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.980" end="00:02:21.550" style="s2">would have been a little nervous I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.420" end="00:02:23.080" style="s2">to talk to you because you have a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.550" end="00:02:24.280" style="s2">impressive background and pedigree maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.080" end="00:02:26.370" style="s2">you could just start off by sharing</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.280" end="00:02:28.870" style="s2">people with people a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.370" end="00:02:30.610" style="s2">where he came from generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.870" end="00:02:32.200" style="s2">and you know what sort of brought you to</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.610" end="00:02:33.610" style="s2">this point so that I mean that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.200" end="00:02:36.940" style="s2">question but you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.610" end="00:02:38.620" style="s2">sure sure I guess so briefly I was you</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.940" end="00:02:40.630" style="s2">know coming up basically when the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.620" end="00:02:43.890" style="s2">personal computer revolution when AI</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.630" end="00:02:47.500" style="s2">actually had its you know a burst of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.890" end="00:02:48.790" style="s2">popularity at that time and I decided to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.500" end="00:02:51.100" style="s2">become an artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.790" end="00:02:55.510" style="s2">researcher I was a professor in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.100" end="00:02:56.410" style="s2">field for about nine years where did you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.510" end="00:02:58.540" style="s2">where did you study</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.410" end="00:03:00.010" style="s2">artificial enjoy what is that does that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.540" end="00:03:01.420" style="s2">a degree do you go to ecology be like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.010" end="00:03:03.490" style="s2">want to get an artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.420" end="00:03:05.860" style="s2">degree you know it&#39;s a time no I I did</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.490" end="00:03:07.990" style="s2">my undergrad at MIT in math just to gave</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.860" end="00:03:09.310" style="s2">me a lot of flexibility to learn lots of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.990" end="00:03:11.380" style="s2">because think about artificial</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.310" end="00:03:13.210" style="s2">intelligence is that it&#39;s you know if</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.380" end="00:03:14.440" style="s2">you just study the AI stuff out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.210" end="00:03:16.959" style="s2">computer science you&#39;re gonna be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.440" end="00:03:18.610" style="s2">narrow if you but you should it really</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.959" end="00:03:23.110" style="s2">touches on linguistics psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.610" end="00:03:25.060" style="s2">philosophy and so just the way things</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.110" end="00:03:26.740" style="s2">were at at MIT it was best to do a math</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.060" end="00:03:28.330" style="s2">major because that gave you the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.740" end="00:03:31.030" style="s2">flexibility to take a lot of these other</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.330" end="00:03:34.240" style="s2">classes as well so did that then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.030" end="00:03:39.310" style="s2">decided believe it or not that I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.240" end="00:03:41.260" style="s2">to make computers learn and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.310" end="00:03:42.760" style="s2">good place to start what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.260" end="00:03:45.580" style="s2">how do you and that&#39;s a question I</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.760" end="00:03:47.410" style="s2">really have I hear this machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.580" end="00:03:49.780" style="s2">I don&#39;t even know what it means what how</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.410" end="00:03:52.150" style="s2">do you how do you make a computer learn</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.780" end="00:03:55.410" style="s2">stuff right that&#39;s actually a really</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.150" end="00:03:58.060" style="s2">good deep question actually because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.410" end="00:04:00.250" style="s2">you know what what people call machine</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.060" end="00:04:02.770" style="s2">learning right now actually technically</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.250" end="00:04:04.150" style="s2">it is learning I mean basically the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.770" end="00:04:06.310" style="s2">computer starts out being able to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.150" end="00:04:08.860" style="s2">very little than I can do more so you</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.310" end="00:04:10.510" style="s2">can call that learning I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.860" end="00:04:13.900" style="s2">difference is the way machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.510" end="00:04:16.000" style="s2">is done today mostly is it&#39;s really deep</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.900" end="00:04:19.720" style="s2">down basically a lot of memorization and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:22.720" style="s2">pattern recognition so for example if</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.720" end="00:04:24.370" style="s2">you want to have a computer learned</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.720" end="00:04:26.230" style="s2">you know what phases look like for</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.370" end="00:04:29.260" style="s2">example recognize faces and so forth you</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.230" end="00:04:30.550" style="s2">just show it a billion faces and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.260" end="00:04:34.000" style="s2">starts to sort of maybe get some</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.550" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">patterns so so that so that like the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.000" end="00:04:38.650" style="s2">joke about the the CAPTCHA stuff being</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:40.810" style="s2">us teaching computers how to you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.650" end="00:04:42.250" style="s2">pick up you know stoplights and doors</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.810" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">and cars and stuff that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.250" end="00:04:46.750" style="s2">actually a joke or you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:48.520" style="s2">they&#39;re using that system or but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.750" end="00:04:51.190" style="s2">really like just human manual</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.520" end="00:04:54.130" style="s2">interaction to help teach the computer</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.190" end="00:04:55.870" style="s2">what it is and then also back this up</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.130" end="00:04:58.750" style="s2">for me a little bit my experience in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.870" end="00:05:01.450" style="s2">programming is with basic okay yeah good</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.750" end="00:05:04.420" style="s2">and it was very simple you know line 10</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.450" end="00:05:06.250" style="s2">and put this line 20 if then and like</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.420" end="00:05:08.650" style="s2">the computer program it so it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.250" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">write anything or remember anything so</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.650" end="00:05:13.870" style="s2">I&#39;m confused about how you teach it does</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:16.480" style="s2">it does it begin writing its own code</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.870" end="00:05:18.250" style="s2">like what happens there yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.480" end="00:05:21.150" style="s2">good question so it&#39;s funny by the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.250" end="00:05:24.580" style="s2">basic was my first language too and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.150" end="00:05:25.960" style="s2">let&#39;s see so take the caption that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.580" end="00:05:28.120" style="s2">good example so even something simple</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.960" end="00:05:29.710" style="s2">like recognizing letters and numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.120" end="00:05:32.590" style="s2">so forth</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.710" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">basically it&#39;s hard to sort of describe</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.590" end="00:05:36.010" style="s2">in a nutshell without getting technical</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:38.710" style="s2">very technical but but its nutshell what</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.010" end="00:05:41.400" style="s2">you do is you show it a bunch of letters</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.710" end="00:05:47.550" style="s2">say if you want to recognize letters and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.400" end="00:05:49.450" style="s2">then it tries to figure out sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.550" end="00:05:51.160" style="s2">actually let me let me think of it but</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.450" end="00:05:52.510" style="s2">let me think of an easier example let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.160" end="00:05:53.770" style="s2">say you wanted to text strawberries</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.510" end="00:05:54.910" style="s2">right because you and this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.770" end="00:05:57.550" style="s2">earlier problems and artificial</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.910" end="00:05:59.200" style="s2">intelligence yeah you know back decades</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.550" end="00:06:00.820" style="s2">ago because you want to sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.200" end="00:06:02.530" style="s2">strawberries from something else right</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.820" end="00:06:04.630" style="s2">because you have some automated sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.530" end="00:06:08.770" style="s2">an industrial process or agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.630" end="00:06:12.490" style="s2">process you show it a bunch of pictures</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.770" end="00:06:14.710" style="s2">of strawberries and so you know part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.490" end="00:06:16.710" style="s2">the thing you get in a picture is what</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.710" end="00:06:19.300" style="s2">colors do you see you see a lot of red</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.710" end="00:06:20.950" style="s2">then there&#39;s a lot of other things I</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.300" end="00:06:22.090" style="s2">like do you see a lot of curves because</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.950" end="00:06:24.940" style="s2">strawberries are curved rather than</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.090" end="00:06:27.100" style="s2">square and so forth so there&#39;s you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.940" end="00:06:31.930" style="s2">sets of properties that you input to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.100" end="00:06:33.700" style="s2">to the computer and then basically you</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.930" end="00:06:36.550" style="s2">see tons of these things</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.700" end="00:06:38.170" style="s2">and over time you say oh well you</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.550" end="00:06:39.190" style="s2">no four and then you tell it well these</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.170" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">are strawberries these are not</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.190" end="00:06:42.640" style="s2">strawberries and a person has to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:43.720" style="s2">sit there and say this is a strawberry</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.640" end="00:06:45.400" style="s2">that&#39;s not a strawberry</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.720" end="00:06:48.010" style="s2">then the computer figures out well you</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.400" end="00:06:49.450" style="s2">know jeez and 95% of the you know 99% of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.010" end="00:06:52.630" style="s2">the cases where there&#39;s a strawberry</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.450" end="00:06:54.100" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s red and it figures out well</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.630" end="00:06:57.730" style="s2">you know basically the sound in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.100" end="00:06:58.840" style="s2">background basically doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.730" end="00:07:00.990" style="s2">matter whether something is a strawberry</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.840" end="00:07:04.390" style="s2">not fifty percent you know if they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.990" end="00:07:07.380" style="s2">basically it&#39;s through tons of data it</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.390" end="00:07:11.170" style="s2">tries to figure out which features</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.380" end="00:07:12.970" style="s2">correlate the most with whether</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.170" end="00:07:14.530" style="s2">something is a strawberry or not or well</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.970" end="00:07:17.140" style="s2">you know whatever you&#39;re trying to learn</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.530" end="00:07:20.710" style="s2">so it&#39;s a classic way of doing machine</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.140" end="00:07:23.170" style="s2">learning and the more slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.710" end="00:07:25.060" style="s2">modern way is that there&#39;s slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.170" end="00:07:27.370" style="s2">complicated techniques for figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.060" end="00:07:30.970" style="s2">what those features are relevant which</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.370" end="00:07:33.220" style="s2">aren&#39;t and but that&#39;s really that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.970" end="00:07:35.640" style="s2">really what a huge amount of machine</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.220" end="00:07:37.690" style="s2">learning is and it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.640" end="00:07:39.700" style="s2">everybody thinks there&#39;s a lot of really</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.690" end="00:07:41.470" style="s2">magic going on where people are writing</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.700" end="00:07:43.930" style="s2">over their own programs or people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.470" end="00:07:45.130" style="s2">doing all kinds of computers are doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.930" end="00:07:46.740" style="s2">all kinds of really smart things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.130" end="00:07:49.650" style="s2">really all they are they&#39;re glorified</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.740" end="00:07:53.050" style="s2">tabulations of statistics that they use</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.650" end="00:07:55.240" style="s2">to in a lot of cases make predictions</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.050" end="00:07:57.460" style="s2">and classifications so am I getting this</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.240" end="00:07:59.590" style="s2">right that like the power of artificial</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.460" end="00:08:01.960" style="s2">intelligence is driven by human clicking</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.590" end="00:08:04.660" style="s2">on certain things yeah actually that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.960" end="00:08:06.190" style="s2">one of the biggest challenges and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.660" end="00:08:09.100" style="s2">expenses in a lot of machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.190" end="00:08:12.520" style="s2">projects is getting the data without a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.100" end="00:08:14.140" style="s2">human annotates so yeah if you need a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.520" end="00:08:17.620" style="s2">hundred thousand faces they&#39;ll train a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.140" end="00:08:19.030" style="s2">trainer a face recognition system you</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.620" end="00:08:21.430" style="s2">need to find a way to sort of label</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.030" end="00:08:23.730" style="s2">those faces label the victors that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.430" end="00:08:26.680" style="s2">sounds like a severely limiting factor</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.730" end="00:08:28.570" style="s2">it is yeah and there are startups their</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.680" end="00:08:30.730" style="s2">whole startups that sort of try to help</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.570" end="00:08:33.070" style="s2">someone automate that or make it cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.730" end="00:08:34.120" style="s2">or like have banks of people who like</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.070" end="00:08:36.100" style="s2">mechanical to I know if you&#39;re familiar</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.120" end="00:08:38.950" style="s2">with Mechanical Turk it&#39;s it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.100" end="00:08:41.290" style="s2">Amazon process it&#39;s a it&#39;s an Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.950" end="00:08:42.790" style="s2">sort of a subsidiary where they</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.290" end="00:08:45.550" style="s2">literally have people that you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.790" end="00:08:49.060" style="s2">outsource these kinds of processes to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.550" end="00:08:50.450" style="s2">and basically where you basically send</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.060" end="00:08:52.460" style="s2">them a thousand pictures also news</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.450" end="00:08:54.410" style="s2">thousand people over the world you pay</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.460" end="00:08:57.290" style="s2">them $10 you know per hour or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.410" end="00:08:59.090" style="s2">it is to label these pictures so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.290" end="00:09:01.610" style="s2">real limiting factor both an expense in</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.090" end="00:09:04.220" style="s2">time and so forth yeah there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.610" end="00:09:06.500" style="s2">really deep irony in that actually think</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.220" end="00:09:07.790" style="s2">about it this this quest to create I</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.500" end="00:09:10.820" style="s2">think what you call a human level</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.790" end="00:09:13.280" style="s2">artificial intelligence involves in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.820" end="00:09:15.290" style="s2">degrees the most manual of physical</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.280" end="00:09:17.420" style="s2">human labor possible at this point oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.290" end="00:09:19.730" style="s2">yeah that is true yeah it&#39;s like almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.420" end="00:09:23.420" style="s2">like a sweat shot for a I&#39;ve a sip like</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.730" end="00:09:26.150" style="s2">yeah that is wild and so when when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.420" end="00:09:28.280" style="s2">say that they learn stuff it is like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.150" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">file size of whatever this program is</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.280" end="00:09:32.840" style="s2">this is it continuously growing as it</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:35.060" style="s2">like learns and becomes a custom is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.840" end="00:09:37.190" style="s2">writing and expanding itself like if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.060" end="00:09:38.540" style="s2">sit there and watch it doodle and I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.190" end="00:09:40.850" style="s2">layman I don&#39;t know any of the stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.540" end="00:09:42.740" style="s2">do the lines of code increases the file</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.850" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">size get bigger or whatever as it begins</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.740" end="00:09:46.250" style="s2">to learn more and more way to think</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:47.510" style="s2">about it is think of a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.250" end="00:09:53.510" style="s2">systems is like you think of like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.510" end="00:09:55.700" style="s2">wiring diagram in electronics and and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.510" end="00:09:58.280" style="s2">usually these motor color models are</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.700" end="00:10:00.320" style="s2">fairly are fairly they&#39;re fairly static</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.280" end="00:10:03.050" style="s2">they don&#39;t change a lot so the wire you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.320" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">don&#39;t add new wires I mean in some in</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.050" end="00:10:06.590" style="s2">some advanced methods you do sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:07.640" style="s2">but but generally what everybody&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.590" end="00:10:09.530" style="s2">what you hear about you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.640" end="00:10:11.960" style="s2">basically start with a bunch of wires</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.530" end="00:10:14.000" style="s2">your diagram and basically all you</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.960" end="00:10:15.980" style="s2">really are learning is for every wire</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.000" end="00:10:17.690" style="s2">every in the diagram there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.980" end="00:10:18.980" style="s2">number of you know how much current to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.690" end="00:10:20.960" style="s2">put through there</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.980" end="00:10:22.280" style="s2">and so really all these things are</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.960" end="00:10:25.670" style="s2">really doing is based on the data</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.280" end="00:10:27.080" style="s2">adjusting the current those those</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.670" end="00:10:30.320" style="s2">numbers on the wires yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.080" end="00:10:31.880" style="s2">interesting interesting all right so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.320" end="00:10:33.020" style="s2">having visions I&#39;ve watched Silicon</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.880" end="00:10:34.730" style="s2">Valley I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.020" end="00:10:36.620" style="s2">that show a couple I have a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.730" end="00:10:38.000" style="s2">friends who are actually in the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.620" end="00:10:40.100" style="s2">the Beast and they say that this shows</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.000" end="00:10:42.410" style="s2">pretty realistic and like the characters</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.100" end="00:10:44.380" style="s2">are based on people in real life but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.410" end="00:10:46.970" style="s2">just remembering this one episode where</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.380" end="00:10:48.200" style="s2">one of the guys creates an app that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.970" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">supposed to be able to identify certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.200" end="00:10:52.340" style="s2">foods or something but it turns out all</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:55.280" style="s2">it can identify is hotdogs or sausages</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.340" end="00:10:57.800" style="s2">because it&#39;s all based on on dick pics</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.280" end="00:11:00.050" style="s2">or something like that I just this the I</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.800" end="00:11:03.290" style="s2">can&#39;t get past this extreme irony of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.050" end="00:11:04.940" style="s2">that in order to create the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.290" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">advanced piece of technology we&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.940" end="00:11:09.230" style="s2">seen it&#39;s gonna involve people in</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:12.649" style="s2">sweatshops just being like hot dog yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.230" end="00:11:14.750" style="s2">hot dog no hot dog yes hot dog no added</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.649" end="00:11:16.240" style="s2">up over how many instances over how many</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.750" end="00:11:20.209" style="s2">times for how long</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.240" end="00:11:23.930" style="s2">knowing the fal ability of human of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.209" end="00:11:26.300" style="s2">humans in general what are the odds you</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.930" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">think that we roll up massive human</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.300" end="00:11:30.949" style="s2">error into this big project because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">just starting to see just from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.949" end="00:11:35.120" style="s2">ground up all the way up it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:36.709" style="s2">there&#39;s so many opportunities for</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.120" end="00:11:38.180" style="s2">something really up to happen so</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.709" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">like for example in the limo order we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.180" end="00:11:41.269" style="s2">got you guys who are in Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:43.519" style="s2">and we just did this thing loosely</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.269" end="00:11:44.990" style="s2">called computer literacy but it was much</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.519" end="00:11:48.380" style="s2">deeper than that but it was basically to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.990" end="00:11:49.880" style="s2">understand how computers work and one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.380" end="00:11:51.319" style="s2">the big things I took away from it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.880" end="00:11:52.940" style="s2">that a computer basically just just</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.319" end="00:11:55.040" style="s2">gonna go from A to B you got a tougher</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.940" end="00:11:58.130" style="s2">go from A to B and then makes a decision</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.040" end="00:12:00.529" style="s2">it goes from B to C and it&#39;s just a just</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.130" end="00:12:03.170" style="s2">a pathway of decision makings but like</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.529" end="00:12:05.000" style="s2">we&#39;re telling it what decisions to make</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.170" end="00:12:08.000" style="s2">there seems like so many opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.000" end="00:12:09.649" style="s2">for human error and it seems like these</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.000" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">things will become compounded and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.649" end="00:12:14.449" style="s2">increase in scope and size and problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:16.190" style="s2">I mean is that a fundamental issue that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.449" end="00:12:17.959" style="s2">you guys are dealing with or is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.190" end="00:12:20.449" style="s2">something that&#39;s been solved already or</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.959" end="00:12:22.279" style="s2">or what does that mean for the future I</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.449" end="00:12:23.959" style="s2">mean I cannot get over how much human</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.279" end="00:12:26.269" style="s2">involvement is they&#39;re trying to teach a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.959" end="00:12:27.339" style="s2">computer on how to be bigger better and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.269" end="00:12:30.470" style="s2">smarter than we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.339" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an issue I mean you know one</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.470" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">example would be sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.519" end="00:12:37.430" style="s2">Facebook Google these companies taught</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:39.459" style="s2">you know they automatically filter out</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.430" end="00:12:41.870" style="s2">sort of a lot of content under platforms</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.459" end="00:12:46.040" style="s2">to detect hate speech for example would</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.870" end="00:12:47.569" style="s2">be one example and in obscenities and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.040" end="00:12:50.360" style="s2">and and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.569" end="00:12:51.949" style="s2">well I mean there are basically trained</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.360" end="00:12:53.959" style="s2">to do that by people and people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.949" end="00:12:56.300" style="s2">telling and the way that&#39;s done is you</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.959" end="00:12:58.279" style="s2">give lots of examples of text and this</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.300" end="00:13:00.139" style="s2">is hate that&#39;s not etc and so basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.279" end="00:13:03.519" style="s2">you&#39;re building in the bias of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.139" end="00:13:07.490" style="s2">person who&#39;s actually training it and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.519" end="00:13:11.630" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s more talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.490" end="00:13:13.519" style="s2">and in the field are people doing much</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.630" end="00:13:16.010" style="s2">about it I don&#39;t know tell you the truth</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.519" end="00:13:18.170" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know really</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.010" end="00:13:19.640" style="s2">what you can do about it from sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.170" end="00:13:21.230" style="s2">AI pointed from now growing point of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.640" end="00:13:23.240" style="s2">view it&#39;s tough because you you know is</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.230" end="00:13:25.640" style="s2">you rely so heavily on these people</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.240" end="00:13:26.900" style="s2">the best thing you can do is try to like</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.640" end="00:13:27.830" style="s2">instruct the people in some way you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.900" end="00:13:30.530" style="s2">to train two people to be better</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.830" end="00:13:33.980" style="s2">trainers but it&#39;s it&#39;s a problem and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.530" end="00:13:35.750" style="s2">there&#39;s no real obvious solution hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.980" end="00:13:37.460" style="s2">this is something people are working on</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.750" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s like is this in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.460" end="00:13:40.940" style="s2">literature&#39;s as I could known I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:41.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t just discover yes I&#39;m talking to</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.940" end="00:13:44.390" style="s2">you in 12 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.840" end="00:13:46.580" style="s2">oh it&#39;s something people talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.390" end="00:13:47.930" style="s2">lot you know and basically I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.580" end="00:13:50.330" style="s2">if you go like to an academic conference</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.930" end="00:13:51.830" style="s2">on on AI you&#39;re gonna see a lot of sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.330" end="00:13:53.420" style="s2">of methods for this but it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.830" end="00:13:56.390" style="s2">there&#39;s what people talk about it in</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.420" end="00:13:58.130" style="s2">terms of in the blogosphere or socially</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.390" end="00:14:02.030" style="s2">in social media and so forth and their</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.130" end="00:14:04.280" style="s2">meetups about this but uh if people see</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.030" end="00:14:05.480" style="s2">it as a problem in some ways it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.280" end="00:14:08.210" style="s2">little bit overhyped of a problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.480" end="00:14:10.910" style="s2">sometimes basically the world is biased</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.210" end="00:14:12.590" style="s2">and so basically so you it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.910" end="00:14:15.740" style="s2">surprising that AI would be a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.590" end="00:14:17.960" style="s2">biased as well in some ways and so so</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.740" end="00:14:19.790" style="s2">that&#39;s um it&#39;s a problem people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.960" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">starting to think about yeah and work on</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.790" end="00:14:28.010" style="s2">I mean jumpin jumpin really far far far</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:30.020" style="s2">down the line here ultimately when you</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.010" end="00:14:34.430" style="s2">you know you use this phrase human level</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.020" end="00:14:36.620" style="s2">artificial intelligence one day the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.430" end="00:14:39.590" style="s2">artificial intelligence they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.620" end="00:14:42.860" style="s2">be human-like and that they&#39;re even take</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.590" end="00:14:47.870" style="s2">with us our own human flaws that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.860" end="00:14:50.060" style="s2">good question so first off I do think it</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.870" end="00:14:52.460" style="s2">is possible someday for computers to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.060" end="00:14:54.410" style="s2">as smartest people I and but I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.460" end="00:14:55.730" style="s2">like all the people right now saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.410" end="00:14:57.620" style="s2">that&#39;s about to happen and we really</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.730" end="00:14:59.150" style="s2">need to worry about that I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.620" end="00:15:00.620" style="s2">kind of they&#39;re way off base that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.150" end="00:15:04.700" style="s2">basically the stuff that&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.620" end="00:15:07.130" style="s2">AI right now is nowhere close to taking</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.700" end="00:15:08.870" style="s2">us that level and and it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.130" end="00:15:10.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of new stuff happening in</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.870" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">AI but there really isn&#39;t what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.970" end="00:15:14.030" style="s2">happening is there&#39;s a lot of old stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:15.200" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t artificial intelligence that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.030" end="00:15:18.980" style="s2">is being rebranded as artificial</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.200" end="00:15:21.260" style="s2">intelligence so like all these you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.980" end="00:15:23.750" style="s2">you might remember or not five or ten</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.260" end="00:15:26.210" style="s2">years ago there was a big lot of hype</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.750" end="00:15:29.930" style="s2">about big data and you kept hearing</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.210" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">about that so all of that stuff now</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.930" end="00:15:35.089" style="s2">is being called AI and so it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.680" end="00:15:36.680" style="s2">so it&#39;s really just a lot of rebranding</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.089" end="00:15:38.960" style="s2">that even so even though the hype has</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.680" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">increased by say a thousand percent</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.960" end="00:15:44.540" style="s2">literally the actual stuff in AI has an</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:46.459" style="s2">increased by it by that much what do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.540" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">what do you attribute that to so for</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.459" end="00:15:49.910" style="s2">example there&#39;s discussions I listen to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:52.130" style="s2">Peter Thiel somebody I think that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.910" end="00:15:55.220" style="s2">had experience with I&#39;ve listened to him</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.130" end="00:15:57.560" style="s2">talk about how there hasn&#39;t been any</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.220" end="00:15:59.270" style="s2">advances in certain fields and he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.560" end="00:16:01.700" style="s2">troubled by that and in fact he&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.270" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">the argument that were in a period of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.700" end="00:16:06.740" style="s2">technological stagnation Erik Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:09.320" style="s2">has them come up again he&#39;s making sore</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.740" end="00:16:12.260" style="s2">the same argument in physics and I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.320" end="00:16:14.959" style="s2">that that&#39;s something that we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.260" end="00:16:17.779" style="s2">sort of misled by we feel like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.959" end="00:16:19.640" style="s2">living in this crazy age of innovation</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.779" end="00:16:22.070" style="s2">because you get a new iPhone every year</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.640" end="00:16:23.180" style="s2">and there&#39;s new fancy apps and updates</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.070" end="00:16:24.800" style="s2">and stuff and all that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.180" end="00:16:27.610" style="s2">interesting but in terms of leaps and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.800" end="00:16:30.800" style="s2">bounds and huge significant legs up</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.610" end="00:16:32.630" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that we the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:33.980" style="s2">acceleration in the development doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.630" end="00:16:37.810" style="s2">lead you to believe that we&#39;re gonna hit</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.980" end="00:16:40.550" style="s2">you know this human level anytime soon</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.810" end="00:16:43.310" style="s2">what do you attribute the pace of change</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.550" end="00:16:45.589" style="s2">or innovation to within your field</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.310" end="00:16:48.080" style="s2">could it be higher what&#39;s holding it</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.589" end="00:16:50.870" style="s2">back what what&#39;s the current status</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.080" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">there I think there&#39;s a lot of stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.870" end="00:16:55.430" style="s2">mean overall just generalizing just from</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:56.540" style="s2">AI but to a lot of fields I think you</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.430" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">know if you look at what&#39;s happened in</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.540" end="00:17:00.980" style="s2">science this is the first time in</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.880" end="00:17:07.100" style="s2">history where you can make a good living</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.980" end="00:17:07.850" style="s2">being a scientist and and so and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.100" end="00:17:10.189" style="s2">what&#39;s happened is to come</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.850" end="00:17:11.959" style="s2">professionalize so if you up until I</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.189" end="00:17:13.370" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the data is you know if</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.959" end="00:17:14.600" style="s2">you look at like World War weinrobe war</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.370" end="00:17:16.850" style="s2">two right right after World War two</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.600" end="00:17:20.209" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of science funding that</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.850" end="00:17:22.130" style="s2">that I was was a science funding for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.209" end="00:17:24.500" style="s2">first time started really being put into</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.130" end="00:17:26.990" style="s2">the economy from from the government and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.500" end="00:17:29.510" style="s2">so up until then up until maybe the 50s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.990" end="00:17:30.679" style="s2">in the 60s even or the 70s it was just</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.510" end="00:17:32.990" style="s2">something you did if you were nerd you</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.679" end="00:17:34.429" style="s2">were earnest about it and the people it</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.990" end="00:17:37.370" style="s2">was basically blunderers and science</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.429" end="00:17:39.020" style="s2">were organizing themselves and so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.370" end="00:17:40.220" style="s2">had some downsides but it had the upside</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.020" end="00:17:43.730" style="s2">which is that you were actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.220" end="00:17:45.590" style="s2">sort of fairly real science I</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.730" end="00:17:48.980" style="s2">as it became more professionalized as</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.590" end="00:17:52.430" style="s2">there was more money into it basically</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.980" end="00:17:54.890" style="s2">it got taken over by based professionals</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.430" end="00:17:56.840" style="s2">and a bad in a bad sense based so</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.890" end="00:17:57.890" style="s2">basically the people running the field</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.840" end="00:17:59.870" style="s2">or the people who are really good at</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.890" end="00:18:01.250" style="s2">raising funding and the skills it takes</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.870" end="00:18:02.810" style="s2">to raise funding are completely the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.250" end="00:18:07.190" style="s2">opposite skills that it takes to make</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.810" end="00:18:08.150" style="s2">scientific innovation and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.190" end="00:18:09.950" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.150" end="00:18:13.180" style="s2">institutionalized so in most</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.950" end="00:18:15.980" style="s2">institutions don&#39;t stay vital and</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.180" end="00:18:17.780" style="s2">productive for decades and decades and</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.980" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2">decades like this classic example of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.780" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">that is if you look at the the Dow the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:24.020" style="s2"> the companies in the Dow index I</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:25.700" style="s2">think maybe one or two or three I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.020" end="00:18:26.990" style="s2">know what the right number is or have</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.700" end="00:18:28.910" style="s2">been there for though for the last</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.990" end="00:18:31.220" style="s2">hundred years all the rest of them have</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.910" end="00:18:34.010" style="s2">changed but if you look at sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.220" end="00:18:35.300" style="s2">top a lot of top schools a lot of top</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.010" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">institutions they haven&#39;t changed in</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.300" end="00:18:40.100" style="s2">decades and so so I think that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:42.520" style="s2">it I think within artificial</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.100" end="00:18:47.240" style="s2">intelligence I think there is this</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.520" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">almost religion on about this machine</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.240" end="00:18:53.270" style="s2">learning and data and so forth where you</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">have to use all this data and you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.270" end="00:18:57.590" style="s2">to you can&#39;t actually see and see all</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:18:58.820" style="s2">these people doing machine learning is</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.590" end="00:19:01.760" style="s2">are telling themselves well actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.820" end="00:19:04.280" style="s2">we&#39;re not actually telling our computers</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.760" end="00:19:05.840" style="s2">our computers are just using data to</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.280" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">sort of learn stuff we&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.840" end="00:19:10.610" style="s2">programming the computers to do things</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.520" end="00:19:12.860" style="s2">and so there&#39;s just and but in reality</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.610" end="00:19:15.320" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing actually is having</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.860" end="00:19:17.300" style="s2">people train the computers using the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.320" end="00:19:19.850" style="s2">data that that&#39;s our training but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.300" end="00:19:22.130" style="s2">sort of no hot dog yeah but that</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.850" end="00:19:24.530" style="s2">religion basically is is basically I</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.130" end="00:19:26.120" style="s2">think really a damper on AI because</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.530" end="00:19:27.680" style="s2">that&#39;s really not how people think or</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.120" end="00:19:30.290" style="s2">you know people don&#39;t need a billion</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.680" end="00:19:36.020" style="s2">sort of examples of things to learn</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.290" end="00:19:38.510" style="s2">almost anything is is that sentiment</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.020" end="00:19:40.190" style="s2">widely accepted in your industry are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.510" end="00:19:42.950" style="s2">sort of a renegade voice on that matter</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.190" end="00:19:44.870" style="s2">or no it&#39;s pretty red acade yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.950" end="00:19:46.970" style="s2">there&#39;s yeah yeah there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.870" end="00:19:47.810" style="s2">that&#39;s how we like it around here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.970" end="00:19:51.140" style="s2">yeah definitely</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.810" end="00:19:53.090" style="s2">ok so what what is the what is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.140" end="00:19:55.220" style="s2">orthodoxy that you&#39;re battling against</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.090" end="00:19:57.049" style="s2">that stymieing innovation and from what</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.220" end="00:19:58.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard similar phrase</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.049" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard of de-risking de-risking of</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.940" end="00:20:01.759" style="s2">the market rate that these people want</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:03.230" style="s2">to maintain their funding in their</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.759" end="00:20:05.989" style="s2">career they&#39;re called careerists and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.230" end="00:20:07.519" style="s2">other circumstances um what is the what</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.989" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">is the dog mother you&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.519" end="00:20:12.830" style="s2">against as them as a renegade AI</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:15.429" style="s2">professional and academic yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.830" end="00:20:17.899" style="s2">couple things on the one when Dogma is</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.429" end="00:20:19.759" style="s2">basically that you should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.899" end="00:20:22.489" style="s2">measure everything very precisely and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.759" end="00:20:25.820" style="s2">quantitative quantitatively so if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.489" end="00:20:28.279" style="s2">want to advance a new AI method the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.820" end="00:20:30.139" style="s2">you do that is you show that it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.279" end="00:20:31.730" style="s2">than other AI methods on a data set</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.139" end="00:20:34.460" style="s2">that&#39;s already been accepted so for</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.730" end="00:20:36.350" style="s2">example let&#39;s say somebody there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.460" end="00:20:38.659" style="s2">recognized data set for recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.350" end="00:20:40.369" style="s2">characters right CAPTCHA type stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.659" end="00:20:43.789" style="s2">then the way you show your algorithm is</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.369" end="00:20:46.460" style="s2">better is by doing just as well on that</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.789" end="00:20:47.779" style="s2">but if you in and that&#39;s the game people</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.460" end="00:20:50.359" style="s2">like to play that&#39;s all of science</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.779" end="00:20:52.519" style="s2">basically all of engineering as well for</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.359" end="00:20:53.480" style="s2">a lot most of it but the problem for</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.519" end="00:20:55.730" style="s2">that if you wanna do something really</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.480" end="00:20:59.179" style="s2">new that actually takes the the does</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.730" end="00:21:01.220" style="s2">something much smarter than that then</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.179" end="00:21:02.840" style="s2">and there&#39;s no data set for that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.220" end="00:21:04.940" style="s2">other people are working on then</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.840" end="00:21:06.139" style="s2">basically you really can&#39;t even prove</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.940" end="00:21:08.840" style="s2">that what you&#39;re doing is good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.139" end="00:21:10.700" style="s2">really very difficult it&#39;s some sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.840" end="00:21:11.690" style="s2">you&#39;re because the game is to like beat</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.700" end="00:21:13.609" style="s2">other people and data that already</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.690" end="00:21:15.919" style="s2">exists you&#39;re kind of that data is like</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.609" end="00:21:19.700" style="s2">an anchor making you for work on really</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.919" end="00:21:22.399" style="s2">boring sort of isolated problems so it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.700" end="00:21:25.789" style="s2">exists well give an example and and your</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.399" end="00:21:27.710" style="s2">solution to that well you know my last</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.789" end="00:21:31.730" style="s2">startup had a technology for</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.710" end="00:21:34.789" style="s2">understanding natural language and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.730" end="00:21:36.169" style="s2">so the problem was the natural language</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.789" end="00:21:37.909" style="s2">understood was much more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.169" end="00:21:40.129" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of than any other data than</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.909" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">any other software could understand and</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.129" end="00:21:45.019" style="s2">so we really couldn&#39;t really measure it</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:47.059" style="s2">against existing data sets so our</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.019" end="00:21:50.739" style="s2">solution was just to build it and have</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.059" end="00:21:52.429" style="s2">it work on real-world problems and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.739" end="00:21:54.919" style="s2">hopefully that people would see the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.429" end="00:21:57.139" style="s2">value of it through that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.919" end="00:21:58.879" style="s2">that&#39;s basically one solution but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.139" end="00:22:01.100" style="s2">it&#39;s brutal like and if you want to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.879" end="00:22:03.289" style="s2">can do that once your technology is easy</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.100" end="00:22:06.559" style="s2">enough to sort of good enough to get to</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.289" end="00:22:08.330" style="s2">that level it&#39;s almost you know that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.559" end="00:22:10.190" style="s2">that&#39;s like step three step one and two</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.330" end="00:22:10.970" style="s2">are actually doing a lot of basic</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.190" end="00:22:12.559" style="s2">research and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.970" end="00:22:14.179" style="s2">in that period is very difficult because</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.559" end="00:22:16.190" style="s2">no one really wants to support you or</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.179" end="00:22:17.720" style="s2">hire you during that period right you</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.190" end="00:22:19.489" style="s2">can be a professional scientist you just</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.720" end="00:22:24.289" style="s2">can&#39;t do real professional scientist</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.489" end="00:22:26.059" style="s2">scientists exactly well that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.289" end="00:22:28.070" style="s2">yet another irony that we&#39;ve uncovered</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.059" end="00:22:29.779" style="s2">so you mentioned you mentioned your last</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.070" end="00:22:31.759" style="s2">startup and I believe me I have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.779" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">billion questions but I want to put it I</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.759" end="00:22:35.359" style="s2">want to put a narrative structure into</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:37.820" style="s2">this as well - so you mentioned in your</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.359" end="00:22:39.409" style="s2">last startup I think that I have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.820" end="00:22:41.090" style="s2">of guys myself included or very</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.409" end="00:22:43.340" style="s2">intrigued at this idea of what it means</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.090" end="00:22:45.859" style="s2">to do a startup get it funded and bring</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.340" end="00:22:46.659" style="s2">it to fruition and have it be something</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.859" end="00:22:48.739" style="s2">worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.659" end="00:22:50.509" style="s2">what was your experience what was the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.739" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">name of the company you know how where</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.509" end="00:22:54.200" style="s2">did you get started tell us a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:56.629" style="s2">about that would you sure sure yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.200" end="00:22:57.830" style="s2">was a professor at the time and we had</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.629" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">developed some natural language</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.830" end="00:23:02.389" style="s2">understanding technology and that just</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:03.859" style="s2">means you know the human the computer</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.389" end="00:23:08.239" style="s2">could understand English not sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.859" end="00:23:10.609" style="s2">basic you know so and you got to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.239" end="00:23:13.489" style="s2">point where it was I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.609" end="00:23:15.619" style="s2">useful in the real world so I found that</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.489" end="00:23:17.539" style="s2">a small little startup and I hired two</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.619" end="00:23:20.779" style="s2">or three of my students total in total</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.539" end="00:23:25.099" style="s2">and we built something it this was</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.779" end="00:23:26.629" style="s2">before Amazon echo so this was this was</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.099" end="00:23:29.149" style="s2">actually when people still didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.629" end="00:23:32.330" style="s2">a I was really a hard sell was something</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.149" end="00:23:34.429" style="s2">called the AI winter and this was really</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.330" end="00:23:36.649" style="s2">hard yeah yeah yeah definitely it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.429" end="00:23:39.769" style="s2">huge burst of enthusiasm in AI in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.649" end="00:23:43.190" style="s2">80s and then a lot of promises were made</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.769" end="00:23:47.029" style="s2">there that weren&#39;t kept and so during</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.029" end="00:23:52.399" style="s2">basically it was AI winter and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:54.109" style="s2">meant that it was a really unpopular</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.399" end="00:23:55.539" style="s2">thing to do people told me not to do AI</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.109" end="00:23:58.940" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be horrible for your career</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.539" end="00:24:01.639" style="s2">and all kinds of things like that and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.940" end="00:24:03.169" style="s2">it was brutal it was brutal and so we</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.639" end="00:24:04.580" style="s2">but it was still it was difficult</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.169" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">explaining it to investors basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.580" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">people I&#39;d show them you know a really</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:10.789" style="s2">nice demo if we say something like I</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:12.710" style="s2">don&#39;t know find me the last three emails</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.789" end="00:24:14.479" style="s2">I got from Jack that had a PDF in them</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.710" end="00:24:18.349" style="s2">and you know would go to Gmail and just</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.479" end="00:24:21.049" style="s2">find those three emails right and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.349" end="00:24:23.479" style="s2">the thing is people say why would I want</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.049" end="00:24:24.470" style="s2">that you know I really had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.479" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">trouble explaining why anybody would</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.470" end="00:24:27.289" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:31.970" style="s2">but but ultimately we were we were</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.289" end="00:24:34.490" style="s2">bought out by by Yahoo but but a year or</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.970" end="00:24:37.190" style="s2">two later than the echo comes out and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.490" end="00:24:38.809" style="s2">that was really the first real and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.190" end="00:24:41.450" style="s2">natural language processing the really</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.809" end="00:24:43.010" style="s2">first real success that we&#39;re actual</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.450" end="00:24:44.659" style="s2">consumers wanted something because Siri</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.010" end="00:24:46.940" style="s2">the first iterations of Siri you might</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.659" end="00:24:49.010" style="s2">remember that back in 2012 ish no one</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.940" end="00:24:52.250" style="s2">read it felt yeah terrible no one really</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.010" end="00:24:54.049" style="s2">wanted to use it and it was the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.250" end="00:24:55.340" style="s2">emphasize as a product for a while so</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.049" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">echo comes out changes the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.340" end="00:24:59.059" style="s2">basically everybody wants to do way I</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:02.710" style="s2">and things got easier but before that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.059" end="00:25:06.760" style="s2">was tough doing a start-up you know I</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.710" end="00:25:09.320" style="s2">woke my mind that that this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.760" end="00:25:11.210" style="s2">working towards human level artificial</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.320" end="00:25:13.399" style="s2">intelligence what&#39;s it is super exciting</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.210" end="00:25:15.350" style="s2">or sexy filled in that there was a an AI</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.399" end="00:25:17.779" style="s2">winter would what was that all about</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.350" end="00:25:19.789" style="s2">what how did that come how was their AI</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.779" end="00:25:22.549" style="s2">winter I had never even heard of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.789" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">yeah yeah back in the 80s for the most</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.549" end="00:25:28.760" style="s2">part there were a lot of investment in</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:30.080" style="s2">AI and this was mostly in the Northeast</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.760" end="00:25:31.730" style="s2">mostly in Boston</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.080" end="00:25:34.070" style="s2">probably emanating from MIT I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.730" end="00:25:35.600" style="s2">guess a lot of it was and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.070" end="00:25:37.399" style="s2">of money venture capitalists put into a</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:39.320" style="s2">artificial intelligence there was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.399" end="00:25:41.059" style="s2">of a hype in the press about it you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.320" end="00:25:46.190" style="s2">go back and look at Time magazine covers</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.059" end="00:25:47.330" style="s2">from the 80s and and it you you know and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.190" end="00:25:48.620" style="s2">you&#39;ll see basically that there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.330" end="00:25:50.450" style="s2">stories that about robots taking over</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.620" end="00:25:51.799" style="s2">the world and all the fears people have</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.450" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">now we&#39;re actually being sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.799" end="00:25:59.590" style="s2">expressed then and but basically almost</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">all of that all those companies failed</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.590" end="00:26:04.190" style="s2">and almost all of that hype sort of came</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:05.630" style="s2">to naught and so people said well you</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.190" end="00:26:08.210" style="s2">know this was you know we just got taken</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.630" end="00:26:10.309" style="s2">its overhyped and and and so for</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.210" end="00:26:13.640" style="s2">literally 10 a lot of people got burned</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.309" end="00:26:16.279" style="s2">financially and so for you know 20 ish</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.640" end="00:26:19.070" style="s2">years 25 years whatever it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.279" end="00:26:22.610" style="s2">really tough to no one really wanted the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.070" end="00:26:23.899" style="s2">fund AI and this was when actually even</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.610" end="00:26:25.880" style="s2">within the field of artificial</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.899" end="00:26:27.289" style="s2">intelligence the academic field went to</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.880" end="00:26:29.179" style="s2">this machine learning stuff because</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.289" end="00:26:30.470" style="s2">because before that people actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.179" end="00:26:33.770" style="s2">tried to make computers that could</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.470" end="00:26:35.929" style="s2">reason and think and because that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.770" end="00:26:37.760" style="s2">turn out so well they said well well you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.929" end="00:26:38.279" style="s2">know let&#39;s let&#39;s forget that let&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.760" end="00:26:39.989" style="s2">them learn</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.279" end="00:26:41.700" style="s2">their own because we can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.989" end="00:26:43.499" style="s2">researchers to make them think and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.700" end="00:26:45.809" style="s2">what they called learning was this</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.499" end="00:26:49.769" style="s2">really wrote fairly stupid sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.809" end="00:26:52.080" style="s2">data-driven kind of learning and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.769" end="00:26:54.269" style="s2">that sort of was the the failure of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.080" end="00:26:57.869" style="s2">early part of AI led to this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.269" end="00:27:00.149" style="s2">machine learning sort of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.869" end="00:27:03.659" style="s2">takeover of the field and that&#39;ll happen</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.149" end="00:27:06.989" style="s2">during that winter interesting and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.659" end="00:27:09.599" style="s2">think it was the the Amazon echo Alexa</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.989" end="00:27:11.969" style="s2">you think that was what got people back</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.599" end="00:27:14.669" style="s2">sort of wind under the the sails here</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.969" end="00:27:19.200" style="s2">for AI I mean it seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.669" end="00:27:20.940" style="s2">interesting push-pull circumstance would</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.200" end="00:27:24.119" style="s2">you find that another feel fields were</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.940" end="00:27:26.460" style="s2">like a very basic consumer product is</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.119" end="00:27:27.690" style="s2">actually gonna excite academic</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.460" end="00:27:29.309" style="s2">development and research and development</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.690" end="00:27:31.139" style="s2">in the field I guess so it makes people</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.309" end="00:27:33.659" style="s2">feel like that there&#39;s a reason for</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.139" end="00:27:35.099" style="s2">moving forward I suppose home that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.659" end="00:27:37.289" style="s2">good question you know I mean I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.099" end="00:27:38.729" style="s2">like back in a Sputnik for example that</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.289" end="00:27:40.679" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a consumer product but it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.729" end="00:27:42.779" style="s2">sort of you know something happening in</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.679" end="00:27:45.089" style="s2">the world that that that basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.779" end="00:27:46.830" style="s2">probably sort of affected how much stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.089" end="00:27:48.869" style="s2">was going on in academia run aerospace</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.830" end="00:27:50.429" style="s2">and physics and so forth and you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.869" end="00:27:51.779" style="s2">that like technology to what it to what</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.429" end="00:27:53.759" style="s2">extent is the government involved in</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.779" end="00:27:56.210" style="s2">making this stuff happen you know I had</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.759" end="00:27:58.739" style="s2">an associate who worked for DARPA and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.210" end="00:28:01.379" style="s2">was amazed to learn all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.739" end="00:28:03.149" style="s2">they were working on to what extent is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.379" end="00:28:05.159" style="s2">the government right now actively</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.149" end="00:28:07.859" style="s2">working and tried to push the field and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.159" end="00:28:09.839" style="s2">and fund specific projects and work in</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.859" end="00:28:11.820" style="s2">that way that the DARPA net did spill</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.839" end="00:28:14.789" style="s2">over into Internet here we are talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.820" end="00:28:16.679" style="s2">over my laptop is there something like</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.789" end="00:28:18.629" style="s2">that in the works right now with with</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.679" end="00:28:20.549" style="s2">the feds and and various governments</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.629" end="00:28:24.629" style="s2">around the world yeah I mean overall</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.549" end="00:28:26.099" style="s2">from the from the 50s up until today the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.629" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">the government&#39;s been funding AI</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.099" end="00:28:30.029" style="s2">research I would say you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">know the actual numbers but I would say</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.029" end="00:28:35.039" style="s2">up until the last five or 10 years it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:38.369" style="s2">probably been the majority of it and now</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.039" end="00:28:40.019" style="s2">I get I don&#39;t know raw numbers but now</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.369" end="00:28:41.879" style="s2">it seems like the center and they were</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.019" end="00:28:43.950" style="s2">funding it through sort of academic they</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.879" end="00:28:46.679" style="s2">were funding you know professors to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.950" end="00:28:50.789" style="s2">and their students and their labs to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.679" end="00:28:51.929" style="s2">AI research I guess more recently it</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.789" end="00:28:53.399" style="s2">seems like the center of gravity</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.929" end="00:28:54.600" style="s2">move more into sort of the googles and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.399" end="00:28:55.169" style="s2">the Facebook&#39;s and the large companies</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.600" end="00:28:57.389" style="s2">of the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.169" end="00:29:00.629" style="s2">so yet no government&#39;s been involved for</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.389" end="00:29:01.679" style="s2">a long time in AI go ahead well you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.629" end="00:29:03.299" style="s2">look at you could look at something like</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.679" end="00:29:06.419" style="s2">that I mean like the cruise missile</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.299" end="00:29:08.369" style="s2">right so you know it&#39;s basically a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.419" end="00:29:10.200" style="s2">simple feedback mechanism like am I am I</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.369" end="00:29:11.820" style="s2">going tomorrow to the ride too far to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.200" end="00:29:13.950" style="s2">the left right and it&#39;s sort of adjust</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.820" end="00:29:16.710" style="s2">it seems very simple and basic now but</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.950" end="00:29:18.450" style="s2">when that that went out with technology</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.710" end="00:29:21.269" style="s2">was first sort of invented it was sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.450" end="00:29:23.610" style="s2">of in his field of cybernetics which was</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.269" end="00:29:26.730" style="s2">sort of this pre AI type site field so</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.610" end="00:29:28.289" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things like another</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.730" end="00:29:31.259" style="s2">example would be in the you probably had</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.289" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">a modem back in the day where 300 baud</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.259" end="00:29:35.429" style="s2">maybe yeah there are it at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:36.629" style="s2">now at the top there you go yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.429" end="00:29:38.399" style="s2">remember that they had a hiss in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.629" end="00:29:40.350" style="s2">beginning right and that was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.399" end="00:29:41.730" style="s2">like there&#39;s a little bit of AI going on</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.350" end="00:29:45.570" style="s2">in there just for calibrate itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.730" end="00:29:47.309" style="s2">towards the acoustics of the the Y of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.570" end="00:29:50.100" style="s2">the telephone wire and so that had a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.309" end="00:29:52.619" style="s2">little bit of AI in it and so long story</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.100" end="00:29:55.529" style="s2">short there&#39;s a lot of you know stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.619" end="00:29:57.149" style="s2">through history that has evolved some</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.529" end="00:29:59.490" style="s2">some AI that&#39;s in a lot of it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.149" end="00:30:02.490" style="s2">funded by the government it&#39;s a fact fax</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.490" end="00:30:03.659" style="s2">machine is that AI G&#39;s yeah yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.490" end="00:30:06.529" style="s2">little bit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.659" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">I guess I will never look at the facts</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.529" end="00:30:12.450" style="s2">again no smart little guy</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.360" end="00:30:15.960" style="s2">what&#39;s your hissing I do remember man</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.450" end="00:30:17.999" style="s2">300 I remember we went to 2,400 9600</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.960" end="00:30:21.179" style="s2">these were heady times man when you had</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.999" end="00:30:24.090" style="s2">in 9600 and a 486 PC man you were just</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.179" end="00:30:27.029" style="s2">jamming along I remember that my first</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.090" end="00:30:29.610" style="s2">computer was a PC junior and it had I</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.029" end="00:30:31.379" style="s2">got upgraded to 640 kilobytes of memory</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.610" end="00:30:34.590" style="s2">so that&#39;s like a fraction of a megabyte</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.379" end="00:30:36.809" style="s2">and I had a disk drive just in memory</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.590" end="00:30:39.869" style="s2">and I compiled all my programs in memory</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.809" end="00:30:42.659" style="s2">and and boy I felt I&#39;ve never felt more</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.869" end="00:30:44.190" style="s2">satisfied in terms of computational</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.659" end="00:30:45.299" style="s2">power I&#39;ve never thought that that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.190" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">the only time in my life where I thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.299" end="00:30:50.220" style="s2">I don&#39;t want more computational power</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:54.690" style="s2">yeah right yeah back before we even knew</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.220" end="00:30:59.070" style="s2">what was possible um what do you so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.690" end="00:31:00.600" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting the AI seemed seems to</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.070" end="00:31:02.720" style="s2">you said there was it the winter and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.600" end="00:31:05.009" style="s2">then there&#39;s been an uptick in activity</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:05.630" style="s2">but now you&#39;re saying a lot of its just</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.009" end="00:31:08.750" style="s2">reap</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.630" end="00:31:10.610" style="s2">packaged other stuff sold his AI for</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.750" end="00:31:13.460" style="s2">investors and to make people look good</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.610" end="00:31:18.020" style="s2">and whatever but where where is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.460" end="00:31:21.620" style="s2">cutting edge right now it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.020" end="00:31:23.090" style="s2">question if you keep saying that after</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.620" end="00:31:24.200" style="s2">my questions I&#39;m gonna start to thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.090" end="00:31:28.310" style="s2">that I&#39;m getting good at this</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.200" end="00:31:30.050" style="s2">there you go there you go uh-huh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.310" end="00:31:33.350" style="s2">I would say basically if you look in</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.050" end="00:31:34.760" style="s2">history of fields depends what you like</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.350" end="00:31:35.990" style="s2">cutting edge if you mean basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.760" end="00:31:37.820" style="s2">taking the existing stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.990" end="00:31:40.490" style="s2">happening right now and making it sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.820" end="00:31:41.900" style="s2">of incrementally better then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.490" end="00:31:43.400" style="s2">happening everywhere you know that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.900" end="00:31:44.510" style="s2">happening sort of in companies it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.400" end="00:31:47.450" style="s2">happening in academia</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.510" end="00:31:48.860" style="s2">if you mean you know where is the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.450" end="00:31:51.620" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna take the next leap forward</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.860" end="00:31:53.030" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a significant leap I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.620" end="00:31:56.330" style="s2">that&#39;s hard to predict I think if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.030" end="00:31:57.920" style="s2">those things then you know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.330" end="00:31:59.930" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t be such giant leaps and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.920" end="00:32:02.470" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you know this this</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.930" end="00:32:05.470" style="s2">paradigm stuff is new about TS Coon and</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.470" end="00:32:07.820" style="s2">paradigmatic SCI there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.470" end="00:32:09.620" style="s2">philosopher called TS Kuhn who did a</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.820" end="00:32:11.630" style="s2">looked in the history of science and he</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.620" end="00:32:12.950" style="s2">said there&#39;s normal science which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.630" end="00:32:14.270" style="s2">what people do every day and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.950" end="00:32:16.130" style="s2">there&#39;s paradigm added there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.270" end="00:32:17.870" style="s2">revolutionary science which is Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.130" end="00:32:20.240" style="s2">and Newton who&#39;s like totally change up</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.870" end="00:32:22.400" style="s2">people think of stuff and I think in</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.240" end="00:32:23.570" style="s2">some ways AI</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.400" end="00:32:25.190" style="s2">so the normal science and AI is</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.570" end="00:32:26.990" style="s2">happening in academia and Industry and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.190" end="00:32:28.550" style="s2">some of its good the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.990" end="00:32:30.740" style="s2">revolutionary step that we need to go to</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.550" end="00:32:32.270" style="s2">the next level I think that&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.740" end="00:32:35.630" style="s2">always you can&#39;t predict that it always</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.270" end="00:32:37.760" style="s2">comes out of left field yeah do you but</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.630" end="00:32:41.750" style="s2">please know make your prediction sure do</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">you is it what&#39;s limiting is it like</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.750" end="00:32:47.690" style="s2">human brain power or computational power</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:49.760" style="s2">like what&#39;s the what&#39;s the road block</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.690" end="00:32:51.380" style="s2">like it would I be right in assuming</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.760" end="00:32:53.210" style="s2">that we could take like everything that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.380" end="00:32:55.070" style="s2">we have now if we had infinite energy</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.210" end="00:32:57.590" style="s2">and infinite computational power to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.070" end="00:32:59.570" style="s2">to where we want it to go or are we</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.590" end="00:33:02.200" style="s2">still we don&#39;t know even how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.570" end="00:33:05.110" style="s2">if we had infinite power and resources</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.200" end="00:33:08.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how to do even that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.110" end="00:33:10.520" style="s2">and because there used to be you know 10</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.480" end="00:33:12.290" style="s2">20 years ago these things these books</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.520" end="00:33:14.360" style="s2">you&#39;d say well you know boy if we just</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.290" end="00:33:15.830" style="s2">had 10 times more power they try to</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.360" end="00:33:17.240" style="s2">compute how much compute power was in</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.830" end="00:33:18.690" style="s2">the brain right and I&#39;d say how long is</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.240" end="00:33:20.580" style="s2">it before a computer can have that power</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.690" end="00:33:22.200" style="s2">but now with things like Amazon Web</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.580" end="00:33:24.629" style="s2">Services and Google cloud you know these</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.200" end="00:33:27.119" style="s2">these these online places we can rent</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.629" end="00:33:28.619" style="s2">servers you can you there&#39;s no excuse</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.119" end="00:33:31.049" style="s2">anymore like anybody like for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.619" end="00:33:33.570" style="s2">can rent that kind of power I can</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.049" end="00:33:34.759" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s relatively affordable for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.570" end="00:33:37.529" style="s2">lot of companies and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.759" end="00:33:39.239" style="s2">universities to have a thousand giant</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.529" end="00:33:40.889" style="s2">sort of superfast workstations going all</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.239" end="00:33:42.299" style="s2">at once which is probably more power</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.889" end="00:33:43.529" style="s2">which is at least more power than</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.299" end="00:33:46.679" style="s2">anybody ever thought we would need for</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.529" end="00:33:48.809" style="s2">AI so that&#39;s not the problem the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.679" end="00:33:52.080" style="s2">problem is it&#39;s what is what you said</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.809" end="00:33:54.929" style="s2">it&#39;s basically it&#39;s human brain that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.080" end="00:33:57.419" style="s2">somebody just needs to think of think of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.929" end="00:33:58.619" style="s2">think of how to do it I mean you know if</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.419" end="00:34:01.499" style="s2">you look at Einsteins stuff for example</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.619" end="00:34:03.779" style="s2">there were 20 30 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.499" end="00:34:05.820" style="s2">he didn&#39;t there was nothing he did that</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.779" end="00:34:07.349" style="s2">relied on new cutting-edge science it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.820" end="00:34:09.419" style="s2">just it took you know all the data he</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.349" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">used all them importance or results for</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.419" end="00:34:12.929" style="s2">decades they were known for a while it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:15.329" style="s2">just somebody needed to just sit down</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.929" end="00:34:17.639" style="s2">and think about it do you do you think</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.329" end="00:34:19.919" style="s2">that we&#39;re in the weeds of evolution on</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.639" end="00:34:22.530" style="s2">this matter so it seems slow but in</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.919" end="00:34:24.539" style="s2">historical terms if you scan up and</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.530" end="00:34:27.990" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh well then it happened in</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.539" end="00:34:29.190" style="s2">1985 and then 2005 and then 2025 people</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.990" end="00:34:31.349" style="s2">would be like oh that happened pretty</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.190" end="00:34:33.750" style="s2">quickly or is it actually really</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.349" end="00:34:35.490" style="s2">happening slowly and especially in this</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.750" end="00:34:37.409" style="s2">age of seemingly ever-increasing</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.490" end="00:34:40.500" style="s2">acceleration on all fronts all around us</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.409" end="00:34:42.089" style="s2">all the time are we just stuck in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.500" end="00:34:44.579" style="s2">weeds and it seems slow because watching</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.089" end="00:34:46.559" style="s2">the paint dry socks or or in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.579" end="00:34:48.179" style="s2">historical sense is it gonna actually be</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.559" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">something that took place quickly I</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.179" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">suppose on a cosmic timescale</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.950" end="00:34:56.700" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question I guess if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.779" end="00:34:58.319" style="s2">look at you know what was the distance</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.700" end="00:35:00.210" style="s2">between Einstein and Newton right</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.319" end="00:35:02.099" style="s2">because one way of looking at physics is</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.210" end="00:35:04.470" style="s2">that you know I you know Newton had a</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.099" end="00:35:06.359" style="s2">revolution and then Einstein sort of had</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.470" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">his next revolution I don&#39;t know was at</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.359" end="00:35:10.770" style="s2">300 years I don&#39;t know it was centuries</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:14.670" style="s2">let&#39;s put it that way and so in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.770" end="00:35:17.940" style="s2">sense things aren&#39;t going any faster</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.670" end="00:35:20.730" style="s2">than any slower than that I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.940" end="00:35:22.589" style="s2">the difference is we&#39;re used to progress</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.730" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">in so many other things accelerating you</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.589" end="00:35:25.950" style="s2">know and I don&#39;t think that the progress</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:27.119" style="s2">and maybe basic science is quite</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.950" end="00:35:28.710" style="s2">accelerated as fast</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.119" end="00:35:31.319" style="s2">yeah I just wonder if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.710" end="00:35:32.640" style="s2">systemic holding us back if if Peter</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.319" end="00:35:35.010" style="s2">Thiel and Weinstein are talked</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.640" end="00:35:37.170" style="s2">about physics and nuclear energy and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.010" end="00:35:39.960" style="s2">computing and whatnot that that is just</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.170" end="00:35:41.460" style="s2">not we&#39;re just not making the huge leaps</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.960" end="00:35:43.559" style="s2">and bounds I wonder if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.460" end="00:35:45.779" style="s2">broader based that&#39;s that&#39;s limiting</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.559" end="00:35:47.940" style="s2">limiting our progress in this field</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.779" end="00:35:49.710" style="s2">which again on the cosmic timescale is</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.940" end="00:35:51.630" style="s2">really happening in plant and I but for</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.710" end="00:35:53.160" style="s2">us as impatient it&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.630" end="00:35:54.809" style="s2">forever I definitely think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.160" end="00:35:56.369" style="s2">something systemic I think honestly the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.809" end="00:35:57.779" style="s2">problem is paradoxically there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.369" end="00:36:00.029" style="s2">much funding for it there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.779" end="00:36:02.490" style="s2">support for it because you you pile in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.029" end="00:36:03.630" style="s2">lot of money and you just get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.490" end="00:36:06.119" style="s2">people who chase money rather than</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.630" end="00:36:07.380" style="s2">actual people who are you know deep</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.119" end="00:36:08.460" style="s2">scientists who are going to do this</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.380" end="00:36:10.349" style="s2">stuff that changes the culture of</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.460" end="00:36:11.760" style="s2">everything it&#39;s different people become</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.349" end="00:36:13.980" style="s2">in charge of stuff it becomes impossible</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.760" end="00:36:15.390" style="s2">and then people are chasing money for</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.980" end="00:36:16.920" style="s2">short term there&#39;s all these short-term</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.390" end="00:36:21.089" style="s2">sort of things you can make progress on</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.920" end="00:36:24.119" style="s2">like like sorting strawberries but the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.089" end="00:36:25.829" style="s2">long term sort of goals no one really</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.119" end="00:36:27.059" style="s2">cares about that so in a lot of ways the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.829" end="00:36:31.859" style="s2">money is a wet blanket it really</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.059" end="00:36:33.510" style="s2">actually makes these worse yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.859" end="00:36:35.010" style="s2">about the times in my life where I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.510" end="00:36:36.299" style="s2">made some of the biggest leaps and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.010" end="00:36:38.579" style="s2">bounds and it wasn&#39;t because I had</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.299" end="00:36:40.349" style="s2">everything that I wanted yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.579" end="00:36:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s because I had none of the things</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.349" end="00:36:44.009" style="s2">that I wanted or needed and I had to</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.000" end="00:36:45.630" style="s2">make serious change is there anybody in</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.009" end="00:36:47.279" style="s2">the industry right now who sees things</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.630" end="00:36:49.109" style="s2">similarly to you that&#39;s working to</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.279" end="00:36:51.089" style="s2">create a space where these wet blankets</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.109" end="00:36:53.549" style="s2">aren&#39;t a problem and maybe give you the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.089" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">freedom to think outside of the box a</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.549" end="00:36:57.390" style="s2">little bit more than would be if you are</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:36:59.519" style="s2">otherwise constrained by budgets and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.390" end="00:37:01.380" style="s2">reporting and grants and research and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.519" end="00:37:03.359" style="s2">that kind of stuff that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.380" end="00:37:05.339" style="s2">question I mean I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.359" end="00:37:07.890" style="s2">I know sort of individuals who have</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.339" end="00:37:10.319" style="s2">similar views on on artificial</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.890" end="00:37:12.240" style="s2">intelligence but is there anybody with</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.319" end="00:37:14.670" style="s2">some institutional clout who&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.240" end="00:37:15.900" style="s2">make this kind of a home for that not</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.670" end="00:37:18.529" style="s2">that I know of I mean there are people</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.900" end="00:37:21.720" style="s2">so a very common pattern is you&#39;ll get a</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.529" end="00:37:23.309" style="s2">billionaire Steve Allen was one who</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.720" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">they&#39;ll fund and they I said it&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.309" end="00:37:27.660" style="s2">an AI Center and no they&#39;ll put a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:28.920" style="s2">money in a fund any I Center but then</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.660" end="00:37:30.990" style="s2">the first thing they do is they go out</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.920" end="00:37:33.089" style="s2">and they hire someone who&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.990" end="00:37:34.829" style="s2">already well recognized leader in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.089" end="00:37:37.049" style="s2">field and really what they come and do</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.829" end="00:37:40.049" style="s2">is they just come and you just really do</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.049" end="00:37:41.640" style="s2">normal science they just show up they do</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.049" end="00:37:43.650" style="s2">what everybody else is doing they do it</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.640" end="00:37:46.170" style="s2">better than everybody else or better</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.650" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">than average but but but it but</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.170" end="00:37:49.860" style="s2">their mo is that they just go get the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:51.450" style="s2">best person in the field they you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.860" end="00:37:53.370" style="s2">who&#39;s recognized in the field and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.450" end="00:37:55.560" style="s2">what you really want up doing just doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.370" end="00:37:59.010" style="s2">more the same right in one of their</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.560" end="00:38:03.410" style="s2">papers of yours that I&#39;ve read which one</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.010" end="00:38:03.410" style="s2">that you sent me as being for lay people</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.370" end="00:38:10.170" style="s2">I pretty sure I got out of there that</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.280" end="00:38:12.030" style="s2">one of the issues that you&#39;ve raised is</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.170" end="00:38:14.880" style="s2">that the scientific method isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.030" end="00:38:16.980" style="s2">appropriate for AI research did I get</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.880" end="00:38:19.080" style="s2">that right if so could you expand on</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.980" end="00:38:21.810" style="s2">that tell me what the flaw is because</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.080" end="00:38:23.670" style="s2">although you know not everybody in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.810" end="00:38:25.110" style="s2">audience may be a scientist but we all</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.670" end="00:38:27.240" style="s2">learn the scientific method we</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.110" end="00:38:30.810" style="s2">understand question hypothesis test fail</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.240" end="00:38:32.460" style="s2">whatever move forward can you did I get</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.810" end="00:38:36.780" style="s2">that right from your from your piece and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.460" end="00:38:39.060" style="s2">if so what is a new scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.780" end="00:38:42.210" style="s2">model of research or exploration that</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.060" end="00:38:46.110" style="s2">you see is necessary in your field yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.210" end="00:38:47.880" style="s2">no that is correct you know that like</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.110" end="00:38:49.590" style="s2">you said the scientific method the sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.880" end="00:38:52.830" style="s2">of the caricature of it is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.590" end="00:38:54.990" style="s2">basically somebody forms a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.830" end="00:38:57.630" style="s2">they have an experiment that tests the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.990" end="00:38:59.820" style="s2">hypothesis and they collect some data</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.630" end="00:39:02.400" style="s2">and they you know and they see basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.820" end="00:39:04.380" style="s2">whether that causes confirmed or not and</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.400" end="00:39:08.280" style="s2">the way this sort of plays out on</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.380" end="00:39:10.320" style="s2">artificial intelligence is that people</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.280" end="00:39:12.570" style="s2">love to see you know scientific papers</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.320" end="00:39:15.450" style="s2">that have nice charts with improvements</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.570" end="00:39:18.060" style="s2">and numbers in them and so forth and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.450" end="00:39:22.020" style="s2">you know getting back to the strawberry</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.060" end="00:39:24.690" style="s2">sorter basically what I can do is I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.020" end="00:39:27.630" style="s2">create a strawberry sorter and I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.690" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">show it as 75% accuracy and then I come</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.630" end="00:39:32.970" style="s2">across try berry sorter and it has 78</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:33.600" style="s2">percent accuracy and that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.970" end="00:39:36.390" style="s2">result</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.600" end="00:39:37.770" style="s2">it makes my career and I spend the rest</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.390" end="00:39:39.360" style="s2">of my life sort of getting students</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.770" end="00:39:42.180" style="s2">using that method described just on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.360" end="00:39:45.480" style="s2">we do oranges and and we push 78 percent</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.180" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">to 81 percent and and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.480" end="00:39:49.350" style="s2">intoxicating to sort of institutional</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.520" end="00:39:51.360" style="s2">sort of normal engineers and scientists</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.350" end="00:39:53.190" style="s2">because they constantly have some goal</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.360" end="00:39:56.850" style="s2">they can measure it it seems kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.190" end="00:39:59.859" style="s2">objective and but at least this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.850" end="00:40:02.230" style="s2">short-term sort of focus on</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.859" end="00:40:05.650" style="s2">you know relatively incremental</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.230" end="00:40:07.390" style="s2">irrelevant sort of gains and if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.650" end="00:40:10.420" style="s2">really wanted to do something that say</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.390" end="00:40:12.069" style="s2">couldn&#39;t sort of just sort strawberries</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.420" end="00:40:14.440" style="s2">but actually say have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.069" end="00:40:16.869" style="s2">about you know what which strawberries</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.440" end="00:40:18.460" style="s2">are better than others and how would you</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.869" end="00:40:20.140" style="s2">make a strawberry milkshake or something</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.460" end="00:40:22.420" style="s2">like this to be you know a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.140" end="00:40:25.809" style="s2">you know eccentric about it</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.420" end="00:40:27.160" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t even that that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.809" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">big project it would take several years</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.160" end="00:40:31.390" style="s2">to do that and these other guys every</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:33.789" style="s2">six months they&#39;re making a strawberry</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.390" end="00:40:35.400" style="s2">sword or half a percent faster a half a</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.789" end="00:40:37.599" style="s2">percent or half a percent more accurate</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.400" end="00:40:39.160" style="s2">and so they&#39;re they&#39;re they look they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.599" end="00:40:40.119" style="s2">looking productive because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.160" end="00:40:42.009" style="s2">looking like what scientists are</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.119" end="00:40:43.329" style="s2">supposed to look like whereas you wind</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.009" end="00:40:45.160" style="s2">up in a corner seem like you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.329" end="00:40:46.329" style="s2">some some loser basically users I really</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.160" end="00:40:48.339" style="s2">do anything that that&#39;s really gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.329" end="00:40:51.730" style="s2">mount to anything so it&#39;s that that that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.339" end="00:40:53.140" style="s2">sort of that&#39;s really one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.730" end="00:40:54.880" style="s2">earth at that sort of view of what</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.140" end="00:40:56.200" style="s2">science is and and and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.880" end="00:40:58.059" style="s2">confidence people get from like short</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.200" end="00:41:01.180" style="s2">term metrics and incremental results I</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.059" end="00:41:03.339" style="s2">do think is a major sort of impediment</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.180" end="00:41:05.319" style="s2">to science that&#39;s a to to development in</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.339" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">AI and it would have been in physics too</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.319" end="00:41:10.749" style="s2">by the way I mean basically Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:13.809" style="s2">didn&#39;t do any experiments he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.749" end="00:41:16.210" style="s2">really do collect a lot of fine-grained</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.809" end="00:41:18.549" style="s2">data or anything like that he just did a</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.210" end="00:41:21.160" style="s2">lot of deep thinking and so and came up</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.549" end="00:41:23.829" style="s2">with revolutionary theories so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.160" end="00:41:25.779" style="s2">basically I think why the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.829" end="00:41:29.769" style="s2">method in a nutshell sort of hurts</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.779" end="00:41:33.489" style="s2">things I think the solution in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.769" end="00:41:39.460" style="s2">is what people ought to do is try to</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.489" end="00:41:43.390" style="s2">actually build machines just to just</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.460" end="00:41:48.369" style="s2">find little microcosms I call them so so</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.390" end="00:41:50.109" style="s2">what would be an example of this and a</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.369" end="00:41:52.799" style="s2">little example is like what if you could</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.109" end="00:41:55.390" style="s2">build like a two-year-old somebody so</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.799" end="00:41:57.690" style="s2">and if you think a two-year-old can</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.390" end="00:42:00.430" style="s2">speak some very simple you know language</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.690" end="00:42:03.720" style="s2">they can learn a lot they can solve</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.430" end="00:42:09.369" style="s2">little problems and so forth and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.720" end="00:42:11.440" style="s2">build a simulate a two-year-old and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.369" end="00:42:13.460" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s much harder than</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.440" end="00:42:15.530" style="s2">anybody thinks if but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.460" end="00:42:16.819" style="s2">to pick little pick something that would</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.530" end="00:42:19.130" style="s2">I call microcosm sort of something</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.819" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a small example of what you</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.130" end="00:42:21.770" style="s2">really want a two-year-old has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:25.339" style="s2">what we wanted an adult intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.770" end="00:42:27.950" style="s2">just in it&#39;s sort of a seed forms and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.339" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">trying to trying to like projects like</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.950" end="00:42:33.559" style="s2">that would be good and but then even</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:35.510" style="s2">within that there&#39;s a lot of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.559" end="00:42:36.950" style="s2">ways of screwing it up so you can say</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.510" end="00:42:38.750" style="s2">alright building a two-year-old a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.950" end="00:42:40.069" style="s2">people say well let&#39;s build a robot that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.750" end="00:42:42.680" style="s2">moves around in the world and basically</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.069" end="00:42:45.530" style="s2">you can walk like a two-year-old and</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.680" end="00:42:47.720" style="s2">they&#39;ll spend millions of dollars and on</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.530" end="00:42:49.849" style="s2">sort of irrelevant details about exactly</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.720" end="00:42:51.559" style="s2">how they walk and how you know building</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.849" end="00:42:53.150" style="s2">a robot and so it&#39;s you really need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.559" end="00:42:54.710" style="s2">be smart about what exactly about a</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.150" end="00:42:57.319" style="s2">two-year-old is it that you that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.710" end="00:43:01.099" style="s2">of different than sort of a two-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.319" end="00:43:03.050" style="s2">sort of dog and try to build that out</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.099" end="00:43:06.010" style="s2">and build a simulation that does that so</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.050" end="00:43:10.760" style="s2">basically binds build simulated really</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.010" end="00:43:11.839" style="s2">small intelligences and grow from there</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.760" end="00:43:14.210" style="s2">and the other thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.839" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">two-year-old example is very common in</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.210" end="00:43:17.809" style="s2">AI is to baled not in integrated systems</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:19.309" style="s2">so what you&#39;ll do is you&#39;ll build a</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.809" end="00:43:21.829" style="s2">strawberry sorter or you&#39;ll build</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.309" end="00:43:24.470" style="s2">something that detects phases but if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.829" end="00:43:26.119" style="s2">think of human sort of intelligence it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.470" end="00:43:27.890" style="s2">super integrated so like in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.119" end="00:43:30.740" style="s2">conversation for example right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.890" end="00:43:32.270" style="s2">recognizing you know your your your your</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.740" end="00:43:33.950" style="s2">gestures your your your facial</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.270" end="00:43:36.079" style="s2">expressions using my vision I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.950" end="00:43:38.089" style="s2">recognizing your voice using sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.079" end="00:43:39.470" style="s2">speech recognition and I&#39;m gonna try to</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.089" end="00:43:41.420" style="s2">understand what you&#39;re saying using</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.470" end="00:43:43.309" style="s2">reasoning and memory and knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.420" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">so forth and it&#39;s all happening</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.309" end="00:43:50.089" style="s2">literally it&#39;s integrated set in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:50.960" style="s2">sub-second sort of timeframe and so so</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.089" end="00:43:52.280" style="s2">you look at the two-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.960" end="00:43:54.020" style="s2">two-year-old can look and do all those</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.280" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">things and learn recognize faces and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.020" end="00:43:56.900" style="s2">forth so that&#39;s the other thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:43:58.910" style="s2">I would just don&#39;t just build</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.900" end="00:44:00.770" style="s2">two-year-old sort of speech recognition</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.910" end="00:44:01.819" style="s2">capability but actually build a</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.770" end="00:44:04.579" style="s2">two-year-old I can understand speech</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.819" end="00:44:05.930" style="s2">second that can um you know make plans I</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.579" end="00:44:07.970" style="s2">could solve problems and they can</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.930" end="00:44:10.460" style="s2">recognize sort of faces and do those all</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.970" end="00:44:11.750" style="s2">at once that&#39;s something that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.460" end="00:44:15.349" style="s2">encouraged in the field that I would</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.750" end="00:44:17.329" style="s2">encourage as well do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.349" end="00:44:19.130" style="s2">that&#39;s a where&#39;s the best place for that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.329" end="00:44:20.510" style="s2">to happen to me as you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.130" end="00:44:22.940" style="s2">this this sounds like tenured</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.510" end="00:44:24.140" style="s2">professorship academia yeah it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.940" end="00:44:26.240" style="s2">like that might be the best place to</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.140" end="00:44:26.630" style="s2">happen it sounds to me like the worst</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.240" end="00:44:28.910" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.630" end="00:44:31.460" style="s2">that to happen would be place like Yahoo</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.910" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">or something for example like you ended</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.460" end="00:44:38.140" style="s2">up at Yahoo after you sold your your</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:46.009" style="s2">startup did you find that to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.140" end="00:44:49.910" style="s2">intellect bash any company I generally</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.009" end="00:44:52.009" style="s2">say in general that yeah it&#39;s tough to</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.910" end="00:44:54.200" style="s2">do in main industry generally because</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.009" end="00:44:56.299" style="s2">basically there&#39;s a lot of focus on on</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.200" end="00:44:57.619" style="s2">immediately short term results right it</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.299" end="00:44:58.819" style="s2">honestly there&#39;s a history if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.619" end="00:45:00.650" style="s2">bunch of PhDs and you put them in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.819" end="00:45:01.970" style="s2">corner say don&#39;t show me results for</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.650" end="00:45:03.559" style="s2">five years they&#39;re not going to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.970" end="00:45:07.279" style="s2">anything for five mean that&#39;s just human</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.559" end="00:45:08.990" style="s2">human nature for years and six months in</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.279" end="00:45:11.390" style="s2">they&#39;re like alright what are we really</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.990" end="00:45:14.359" style="s2">doing here yeah yeah that that&#39;s human</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.390" end="00:45:15.769" style="s2">nature which which again it just brings</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.359" end="00:45:17.329" style="s2">me back to some of the original stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.769" end="00:45:18.769" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about it&#39;s like we are</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.329" end="00:45:20.299" style="s2">humans building this thing that we want</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.769" end="00:45:21.799" style="s2">to call human level artificial</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.299" end="00:45:23.480" style="s2">intelligence I&#39;m pretty damn sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.799" end="00:45:25.940" style="s2">gonna look you might end up looking like</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.480" end="00:45:28.549" style="s2">a human with all of its flaws I I put</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.940" end="00:45:29.869" style="s2">out a question on a tweet I said hey I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.549" end="00:45:31.730" style="s2">talking to an AI expert what would you</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.869" end="00:45:34.339" style="s2">ask one of the questions I get back was</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.730" end="00:45:38.210" style="s2">very interesting actually it was do you</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.339" end="00:45:42.319" style="s2">is there value in neuro a typical humans</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.210" end="00:45:45.950" style="s2">and if so will they&#39;ll be value in neuro</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.319" end="00:45:47.809" style="s2">a typical AI right like should we create</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.950" end="00:45:50.240" style="s2">artificial intelligence that reflects</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.809" end="00:45:53.410" style="s2">the span of our neuro capabilities and</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.240" end="00:45:55.849" style="s2">we build should we build like autistic</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.410" end="00:45:57.230" style="s2">artificial intelligence machines I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.849" end="00:45:59.660" style="s2">these are these are something like</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.230" end="00:46:01.940" style="s2">fascinating questions actually yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.660" end="00:46:03.170" style="s2">are and in some sense all artificial</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.940" end="00:46:04.569" style="s2">intelligent machines today are autistic</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.170" end="00:46:06.470" style="s2">they&#39;re really good at doing one thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.569" end="00:46:09.140" style="s2">and nothing else so they&#39;re hyper</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.470" end="00:46:11.930" style="s2">autistic but yeah and in relating back</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.140" end="00:46:16.190" style="s2">to your first question about you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.930" end="00:46:17.420" style="s2">about AI and are but not our biases but</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.190" end="00:46:19.250" style="s2">it will it have our motivations and our</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.420" end="00:46:21.859" style="s2">flaws and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.250" end="00:46:24.309" style="s2">I think a couple of things there first</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.859" end="00:46:26.990" style="s2">off the reason we have a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.309" end="00:46:30.559" style="s2">flies is because of evolution basically</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.990" end="00:46:31.910" style="s2">that that right be basically you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.559" end="00:46:35.299" style="s2">we&#39;re all here because our ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.910" end="00:46:36.740" style="s2">sort of killed a genocide over the next</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.299" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">into the people in the next Valley right</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.740" end="00:46:39.710" style="s2">all you know we&#39;re all you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:40.820" style="s2">all really we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.710" end="00:46:44.869" style="s2">the Center for war criminals in some</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.820" end="00:46:49.640" style="s2">sets and so you know there&#39;s no reason</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.869" end="00:46:50.990" style="s2">why an AI if an AI is designed it</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.640" end="00:46:53.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily need to have those</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.990" end="00:46:54.920" style="s2">problems so I worry much more about I</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.180" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">think it&#39;s possible to have a relative</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.920" end="00:47:00.290" style="s2">to design a benign AI the more you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:03.109" style="s2">the real threat to me is people in</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.290" end="00:47:04.520" style="s2">charge of a eyes so you gotta have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.109" end="00:47:05.480" style="s2">nuclear weapon that&#39;s benign it just</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.520" end="00:47:06.800" style="s2">sits there all day it doesn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.480" end="00:47:08.630" style="s2">anything it&#39;s really the you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.800" end="00:47:11.810" style="s2">person bombing someone with it is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.630" end="00:47:12.290" style="s2">problem right and so guns don&#39;t kill</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.810" end="00:47:15.500" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.290" end="00:47:17.240" style="s2">exactly yeah it&#39;s people who and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.500" end="00:47:18.770" style="s2">that same argument for AI doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.240" end="00:47:21.710" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to kill people it&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.770" end="00:47:24.760" style="s2">who are gonna kill people using AI and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.710" end="00:47:27.410" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s that I did but um I</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.760" end="00:47:29.000" style="s2">don&#39;t interrupt you here but like this</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.410" end="00:47:31.849" style="s2">is one thing I kept coming back to as I</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.000" end="00:47:34.099" style="s2">was reading your work was if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.849" end="00:47:37.760" style="s2">trying to model human level and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.099" end="00:47:38.990" style="s2">artificial intelligence and but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.760" end="00:47:41.839" style="s2">talked to so many evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.990" end="00:47:44.839" style="s2">psychologists recently that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:48.349" style="s2">convinced that we&#39;re only adapted to</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.839" end="00:47:52.510" style="s2">adapt right like the our brain exists so</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.349" end="00:47:57.070" style="s2">that we can stay alive and reproduce and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.510" end="00:48:00.310" style="s2">if we imbue and artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.070" end="00:48:04.430" style="s2">with those same two characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.310" end="00:48:06.619" style="s2">staying alive and reproducing that</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.430" end="00:48:08.690" style="s2">sounds terrifying to me right like I</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.619" end="00:48:11.589" style="s2">don&#39;t want them to be human because</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.690" end="00:48:14.450" style="s2">humans do things that aren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.589" end="00:48:16.490" style="s2">morally right are economically right</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.450" end="00:48:18.680" style="s2">seemingly irrational because all we</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.490" end="00:48:21.589" style="s2">really are is finely tuned instruments</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.680" end="00:48:24.890" style="s2">on how to adapt and how to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.589" end="00:48:26.869" style="s2">exist is that I mean if we were to</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.890" end="00:48:29.180" style="s2">create an actual human intelligence then</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.869" end="00:48:32.089" style="s2">that it would be its goal - right to</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.180" end="00:48:34.580" style="s2">just reproduce and to exist at all cost</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.089" end="00:48:37.550" style="s2">basically I don&#39;t think you need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.580" end="00:48:39.890" style="s2">actually I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.550" end="00:48:42.970" style="s2">I think you can create sort of something</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.890" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">that&#39;s super smart as smart as we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.970" end="00:48:48.109" style="s2">can do a lot all the things we can do</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:51.050" style="s2">but has no desire to kill people or has</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.109" end="00:48:52.130" style="s2">no desire to to do anything bad we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.050" end="00:48:54.590" style="s2">about to exist</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.130" end="00:48:57.290" style="s2">even that I mean I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.590" end="00:48:58.610" style="s2">mean they&#39;re plenty humans who who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.290" end="00:49:00.230" style="s2">have a desire to exist right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.610" end="00:49:02.300" style="s2">everyday just a suicide right I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.230" end="00:49:05.090" style="s2">mean it&#39;s kind of morbid but but uh but</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.300" end="00:49:06.740" style="s2">uh no IIIi think that&#39;s the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.090" end="00:49:09.910" style="s2">exist is like an outgrowth of our</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.740" end="00:49:12.200" style="s2">evolution and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.910" end="00:49:14.390" style="s2">necessary I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.200" end="00:49:17.270" style="s2">is there a point in time in which to say</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.390" end="00:49:19.910" style="s2">I stuff gets programmed and set up to</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.270" end="00:49:21.770" style="s2">evolve on its own and if so would that</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.910" end="00:49:24.410" style="s2">not be a circumstance in which it would</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.770" end="00:49:26.150" style="s2">find its optimization in evolution</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.410" end="00:49:28.130" style="s2">rather than its optimization towards a</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.150" end="00:49:30.110" style="s2">specific goal definitely yeah I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.130" end="00:49:32.540" style="s2">not saying I&#39;m saying it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.110" end="00:49:34.340" style="s2">sort of make AI that&#39;s benign but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.540" end="00:49:37.330" style="s2">definitely right it&#39;s it&#39;s also possible</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.340" end="00:49:41.270" style="s2">to breed a super sort of intense</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.330" end="00:49:43.820" style="s2">competitive AI as well if you want yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.270" end="00:49:45.980" style="s2">and I guess the the risk is that not all</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.820" end="00:49:48.500" style="s2">the actors in this marketplace are going</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.980" end="00:49:50.450" style="s2">to be rational or have the same desired</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.500" end="00:49:53.030" style="s2">outcome as people working in a science</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.450" end="00:49:55.160" style="s2">lab or at MIT or whatever you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.030" end="00:49:57.500" style="s2">acceleration is people want to see that</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.160" end="00:49:59.240" style="s2">in the world Nile Nile is without the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.500" end="00:50:01.250" style="s2">Constitution for suicide but would</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.240" end="00:50:04.400" style="s2">rather do mass homicide you know things</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.250" end="00:50:06.140" style="s2">like that that that to me seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.400" end="00:50:08.540" style="s2">like one of the more troubling issues</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.140" end="00:50:10.580" style="s2">and I just keep thinking about if they</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.540" end="00:50:12.350" style="s2">act like humans were we need them</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.580" end="00:50:14.060" style="s2">to be better than humans we need them to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.350" end="00:50:17.690" style="s2">be simpler than humans and we need it to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.060" end="00:50:20.090" style="s2">be more constrained and and with a goal</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.690" end="00:50:21.890" style="s2">of doing its goal rather than but again</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.090" end="00:50:24.140" style="s2">I come back I hear this Paperclip</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.890" end="00:50:25.940" style="s2">example you know like we for people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.140" end="00:50:27.860" style="s2">don&#39;t know where you set up in an AI</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.940" end="00:50:30.100" style="s2">whose job it is is to make the most</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.860" end="00:50:32.660" style="s2">amount of paperclips possible and</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.100" end="00:50:34.520" style="s2">instead of just like making the factory</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.660" end="00:50:35.990" style="s2">run as well as it can is somehow figures</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.520" end="00:50:37.790" style="s2">how to take over the whole world to make</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.990" end="00:50:40.610" style="s2">as many paper clips as you possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.790" end="00:50:43.850" style="s2">it seems like the opportunity for a</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.610" end="00:50:46.940" style="s2">fuckup along those lines given how much</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.850" end="00:50:49.430" style="s2">how inclined we are to make mistakes as</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.940" end="00:50:51.710" style="s2">humans this is this seemed probable</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.430" end="00:50:53.660" style="s2">probabilistic does it seem somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.710" end="00:50:57.210" style="s2">inevitable perhaps that we would err</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.660" end="00:51:00.810" style="s2">like just the actual error rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.210" end="00:51:03.570" style="s2">I&#39;m not a malicious one I agree yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.810" end="00:51:06.830" style="s2">I&#39;m not I totally agree that that it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.570" end="00:51:09.210" style="s2">possible to have flaws like that and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.830" end="00:51:11.490" style="s2">yeah so just because yeah definitely I</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.210" end="00:51:12.780" style="s2">don&#39;t think computers just I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.490" end="00:51:14.460" style="s2">there&#39;s anything inherent to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.780" end="00:51:16.350" style="s2">being conscious or intelligent that</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.460" end="00:51:18.210" style="s2">makes you malicious but I definitely do</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.350" end="00:51:20.400" style="s2">believe that someone can make them be</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.210" end="00:51:22.170" style="s2">malicious and that there are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.400" end="00:51:23.880" style="s2">unintended consequences sometimes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.170" end="00:51:25.170" style="s2">like you said if you tell a computer hey</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.880" end="00:51:27.720" style="s2">you know build the best paperclip</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.170" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">Factory then sure let me just kill all</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.720" end="00:51:32.820" style="s2">of you know Louisiana and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:35.010" style="s2">and make paper clips out of the raw</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.820" end="00:51:37.260" style="s2">materials or something like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.010" end="00:51:40.410" style="s2">definitely something that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.260" end="00:51:43.710" style="s2">something should worry about frankly</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.410" end="00:51:45.750" style="s2">though I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s I mean I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.710" end="00:51:47.970" style="s2">worry much more about that&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.750" end="00:51:50.340" style="s2">happen anytime soon in our field I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.970" end="00:51:52.020" style="s2">done nuclear proliferation of a bio</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.340" end="00:51:54.810" style="s2">warfare those are much serious more</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.020" end="00:51:57.120" style="s2">serious yeah risks yeah I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.810" end="00:51:59.280" style="s2">the bio stuff and and genetic stuff team</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.120" end="00:52:02.360" style="s2">seems to be making progress enough that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.280" end="00:52:05.390" style="s2">those types of ethical and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.360" end="00:52:08.550" style="s2">existential worries seem to be much more</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.390" end="00:52:10.260" style="s2">relevant in those industries than here</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.550" end="00:52:11.670" style="s2">where we can&#39;t even get the computer to</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.260" end="00:52:13.650" style="s2">tell me if that&#39;s a stoplight or</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.670" end="00:52:16.290" style="s2">not at this point so we&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.650" end="00:52:20.390" style="s2">still some time away from that I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.290" end="00:52:25.320" style="s2">to just take a total detour and talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.390" end="00:52:26.940" style="s2">about reality first sure so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.320" end="00:52:29.960" style="s2">creating these machines whose job it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.940" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">to observe reality around them right</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.960" end="00:52:36.180" style="s2">where what does that tell us about this</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:37.980" style="s2">reality itself like is the existence of</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.180" end="00:52:39.450" style="s2">the computer and we get ten of them and</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.980" end="00:52:41.160" style="s2">we all set them in the same room and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.450" end="00:52:42.210" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to scan up the room and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.160" end="00:52:44.280" style="s2">tell us everything that&#39;s in there</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.210" end="00:52:46.260" style="s2">whatnot are they all gonna see it all</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.280" end="00:52:48.930" style="s2">the same way are they gonna see things</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.260" end="00:52:51.360" style="s2">that we&#39;re not seeing it is there gonna</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.930" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">be a unified version of what reality is</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.360" end="00:52:55.320" style="s2">because it&#39;s a machine deducing it from</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:56.850" style="s2">us versus all of us with our own biases</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.320" end="00:52:58.920" style="s2">and our own distractions and everything</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.850" end="00:53:02.250" style="s2">that we carry with us what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.920" end="00:53:04.620" style="s2">for like our understanding of a concrete</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.250" end="00:53:06.270" style="s2">objective reality we&#39;re like this pen in</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.620" end="00:53:07.980" style="s2">my hand this is it this is all there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.270" end="00:53:10.170" style="s2">to it but you know I can&#39;t see there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.980" end="00:53:12.930" style="s2">like bacteria all over it whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.170" end="00:53:14.490" style="s2">like what are what are what are machines</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.930" end="00:53:17.220" style="s2">gonna tell us about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.490" end="00:53:18.690" style="s2">reality that we don&#39;t already know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.220" end="00:53:22.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.690" end="00:53:24.540" style="s2">I think a very simple first stab at that</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.920" end="00:53:26.010" style="s2">which isn&#39;t so interesting but but but</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.540" end="00:53:27.930" style="s2">sort of might be a decent example is</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.010" end="00:53:29.370" style="s2">that in the earliest days of computer</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.930" end="00:53:31.830" style="s2">vision you know making you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.370" end="00:53:35.760" style="s2">computers recognize the environment</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.830" end="00:53:39.000" style="s2">around them using light signals people</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.760" end="00:53:41.550" style="s2">were shocked at basically what looks the</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.000" end="00:53:43.470" style="s2">same that you and me from looks totally</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.550" end="00:53:45.660" style="s2">different from from like if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.470" end="00:53:46.890" style="s2">me from this angle but I know where no</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.660" end="00:53:51.270" style="s2">one can see this but and then I turned</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.890" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">45 degrees or I changed it lighting a</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.270" end="00:53:55.320" style="s2">little bit but people don&#39;t realize is</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:56.940" style="s2">oh it looks are the same thing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.320" end="00:53:58.530" style="s2">looked very similar to us if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.940" end="00:54:00.240" style="s2">actually flew the computer are vastly</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.530" end="00:54:02.130" style="s2">different little things like shadows and</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.240" end="00:54:04.950" style="s2">shading and the hues of the light</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.130" end="00:54:08.310" style="s2">shining on them are vastly different and</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.950" end="00:54:09.990" style="s2">and it&#39;s just our brain sort of some can</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.310" end="00:54:11.400" style="s2">cancel all that out and just see the</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.990" end="00:54:14.430" style="s2">essential stuff and it makes him see</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.400" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">that be the same so that was one example</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.430" end="00:54:20.190" style="s2">where the history of the field were</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:22.800" style="s2">looking at something through the prism</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.190" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">of a computer made us see things that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.800" end="00:54:27.510" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have seen in our own and so and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:32.850" style="s2">see differences that we wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.510" end="00:54:35.280" style="s2">seen on our own now the bigger so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.850" end="00:54:37.080" style="s2">think I think actually again for someone</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.280" end="00:54:38.700" style="s2">who&#39;s intellectually earnest not doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.080" end="00:54:40.410" style="s2">have an agenda I think you know seeing</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.700" end="00:54:43.260" style="s2">stuff through again through the prism of</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.410" end="00:54:44.520" style="s2">a computer can really make you more</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.260" end="00:54:45.630" style="s2">objective because computers are</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.520" end="00:54:47.550" style="s2">objective I mean they don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.630" end="00:54:50.490" style="s2">have an agenda and and computers</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.550" end="00:54:52.590" style="s2">basically are very dumb and and so they</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.490" end="00:54:53.550" style="s2">they belabor everything and they make</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.590" end="00:54:56.220" style="s2">you sort of realize what your</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.550" end="00:54:57.780" style="s2">assumptions are so there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.220" end="00:55:00.090" style="s2">assumptions behind your conversation</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.780" end="00:55:02.130" style="s2">here everything we say I&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.090" end="00:55:04.080" style="s2">another very some example if I say</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.130" end="00:55:05.580" style="s2">something like the Brady Bunch</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.080" end="00:55:06.900" style="s2">so the Brady Bunch by the way is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.580" end="00:55:09.480" style="s2">family of what it was eight or nine</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.900" end="00:55:12.210" style="s2">people for those who don&#39;t like have any</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.480" end="00:55:14.550" style="s2">good education of our culture are as old</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.210" end="00:55:16.700" style="s2">as we are yeah exactly the uneducated</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.550" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">masses</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.700" end="00:55:20.720" style="s2">basically you know the Brady Bunch went</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:24.559" style="s2">for a ride in their Corolla right</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.720" end="00:55:26.599" style="s2">tweedle crawl a small car and so if if</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.559" end="00:55:27.470" style="s2">so if I just say that that&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.599" end="00:55:29.119" style="s2">gonna say hey wait</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.470" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">basically how&#39;s that possible the ten</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.119" end="00:55:34.400" style="s2">people can fit into a Corolla right and</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:37.280" style="s2">you&#39;ll instantly think of that like</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.400" end="00:55:38.540" style="s2">literally in less than a second and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.280" end="00:55:41.480" style="s2">if you think about that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.540" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">background knowledge about about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.480" end="00:55:46.160" style="s2">people of their size the cars how they</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:48.230" style="s2">do the physics of whether they can all</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.160" end="00:55:50.480" style="s2">fit in something and we&#39;re able to sort</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.230" end="00:55:52.130" style="s2">of Martin in in constantly in our</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.480" end="00:55:53.390" style="s2">conversations we have all this</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.130" end="00:55:56.270" style="s2">background knowledge and assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.390" end="00:55:58.609" style="s2">that were sort of marshalling to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.270" end="00:56:00.079" style="s2">make sense of what&#39;s going on and when</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.609" end="00:56:02.720" style="s2">you try to make a computer understand a</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.079" end="00:56:05.660" style="s2">sentence like that you find it actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.720" end="00:56:07.369" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any of that and in and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.660" end="00:56:09.920" style="s2">makes you realize for the first time all</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.369" end="00:56:12.530" style="s2">the assumptions you had and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.920" end="00:56:14.270" style="s2">and and I think a predecessor of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.530" end="00:56:16.369" style="s2">was the before computers you know making</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.270" end="00:56:18.799" style="s2">proofs like in math and science and</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.369" end="00:56:20.780" style="s2">logic was another example of that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.799" end="00:56:22.369" style="s2">basically proofs our computer like in</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.780" end="00:56:24.079" style="s2">their stupidity they&#39;re just steps one</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.369" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">step to the other I think when you try</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.079" end="00:56:28.970" style="s2">to like see the world through that prism</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:30.380" style="s2">it&#39;s limiting in some ways but in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.970" end="00:56:33.650" style="s2">other ways it sort of brings up all of</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.380" end="00:56:35.960" style="s2">these biases you had all these</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.650" end="00:56:37.970" style="s2">assumptions you had and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.960" end="00:56:39.349" style="s2">tremendous I think in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.970" end="00:56:41.480" style="s2">making you more enlightened to make you</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.349" end="00:56:43.160" style="s2">more a sort of insightful about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.480" end="00:56:45.200" style="s2">world so I think you know in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.160" end="00:56:46.369" style="s2">AI and if you look at if you do it well</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.200" end="00:56:48.290" style="s2">or do you do what sort of earnestly</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.369" end="00:56:51.559" style="s2">could be great for people actually make</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.290" end="00:56:52.819" style="s2">us understand the world better do you</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.559" end="00:56:55.520" style="s2">think that do you think that that will</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.819" end="00:56:57.109" style="s2">lead us to like do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.520" end="00:57:00.230" style="s2">there&#39;s one common reality that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.109" end="00:57:02.119" style="s2">all miss observing or is there multitude</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.230" end="00:57:04.880" style="s2">of realities that we&#39;re all experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.119" end="00:57:06.290" style="s2">independently I think there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.880" end="00:57:12.049" style="s2">reality but there&#39;s different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.290" end="00:57:14.059" style="s2">thinking about it and and so and</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.049" end="00:57:16.790" style="s2">different so I what&#39;s a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.059" end="00:57:18.020" style="s2">that is I can&#39;t think of a great example</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.790" end="00:57:22.790" style="s2">off topic I had but you know you see</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.020" end="00:57:24.710" style="s2">basically somebody sees somebody kid</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.790" end="00:57:25.940" style="s2">fall over right maybe the parents sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.710" end="00:57:28.160" style="s2">of see thinks of the pain the kids</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.940" end="00:57:30.410" style="s2">having maybe a physicist thinks of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.160" end="00:57:33.099" style="s2">you know the actual physics of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.410" end="00:57:35.359" style="s2">and the gyroscopic forces and so quick</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.099" end="00:57:37.130" style="s2">but so there&#39;s there&#39;s different sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:38.180" style="s2">aspects of realities from ways of</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.130" end="00:57:40.010" style="s2">looking at the different models of</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.180" end="00:57:42.170" style="s2">reality but I think deep down there</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.010" end="00:57:44.510" style="s2">actually is something that we can sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.170" end="00:57:46.670" style="s2">of there is a reality that that actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.510" end="00:57:50.539" style="s2">is there that sort of our mental models</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.670" end="00:57:53.030" style="s2">don&#39;t really affect in any way but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.539" end="00:57:54.410" style="s2">a lot of work to actually even like when</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.030" end="00:57:55.940" style="s2">people are really smart and a really</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.410" end="00:57:57.980" style="s2">earnest and they&#39;re really dedicated and</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.940" end="00:58:00.140" style="s2">energetic about it it&#39;s hard enough to</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.980" end="00:58:01.730" style="s2">sort of be right about that but then on</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.140" end="00:58:04.250" style="s2">top of that you add sort of laziness and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.730" end="00:58:05.030" style="s2">and sort of agendas and sort of emotions</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.250" end="00:58:07.730" style="s2">and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.030" end="00:58:09.470" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to get at that it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.730" end="00:58:11.660" style="s2">actually be accurate about that and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.470" end="00:58:13.549" style="s2">think yeah there is a proper use of sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.660" end="00:58:16.730" style="s2">of not just computers but just generally</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.549" end="00:58:18.859" style="s2">sort of more formal rigorous methods of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.730" end="00:58:20.960" style="s2">looking at the world that can help us</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.859" end="00:58:23.960" style="s2">sort of get more on agreement on stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.960" end="00:58:25.670" style="s2">but it sort of depends on people sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.960" end="00:58:27.740" style="s2">having this sort of motive to see it I</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.670" end="00:58:29.150" style="s2">think the problems with people having</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.740" end="00:58:30.799" style="s2">different perspectives I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.150" end="00:58:31.700" style="s2">they&#39;re driven I mean there is different</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.799" end="00:58:34.280" style="s2">people can look at the world in</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.700" end="00:58:36.020" style="s2">different ways and different backgrounds</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.280" end="00:58:37.760" style="s2">and and and sort of different sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.020" end="00:58:39.880" style="s2">personalities and different sort of ways</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.760" end="00:58:43.220" style="s2">of thinking can affect that but I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.880" end="00:58:44.299" style="s2">95% the problems we have about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.220" end="00:58:46.970" style="s2">people having different ways of looking</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.299" end="00:58:48.740" style="s2">at the world aren&#39;t driven by anything</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.970" end="00:58:50.390" style="s2">that&#39;s inherent it&#39;s driven by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.740" end="00:58:52.430" style="s2">that people just are being sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.390" end="00:58:53.869" style="s2">distorted by their by their emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.430" end="00:58:56.119" style="s2">by their agendas and so forth I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.869" end="00:58:59.089" style="s2">that I think if you if you really put</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.119" end="00:59:00.380" style="s2">people who are seriously legitimately</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.089" end="00:59:03.650" style="s2">earnest they&#39;re not afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.380" end="00:59:07.819" style="s2">confronting facts that that they&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.650" end="00:59:10.339" style="s2">are scary to them or unpopular I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.819" end="00:59:13.190" style="s2">and are willing to take conclusions to</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.339" end="00:59:14.390" style="s2">where they lead and have the mental</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.190" end="00:59:15.380" style="s2">energy intelligence to do that I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.390" end="00:59:16.670" style="s2">you put all those people together and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.380" end="00:59:18.559" style="s2">are really earnest about it I think you</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.670" end="00:59:21.230" style="s2">can get a lot more agreement I think the</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.559" end="00:59:23.809" style="s2">problem is that almost nobody has all</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.230" end="00:59:25.730" style="s2">those all those characteristics yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.809" end="00:59:28.130" style="s2">was gonna ask you how can you help me</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.730" end="00:59:30.079" style="s2">devise like a boot camp to get people up</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.130" end="00:59:31.279" style="s2">to that level so that they can so that</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.079" end="00:59:34.069" style="s2">they can&#39;t engage with these</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.279" end="00:59:36.079" style="s2">conversations and that capacity very</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.069" end="00:59:37.849" style="s2">tough right it&#39;s tough and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.079" end="00:59:40.609" style="s2">mean I think that&#39;s that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.849" end="00:59:42.440" style="s2">so like everybody expects sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.609" end="00:59:43.310" style="s2">know technology and in a classroom for</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.510" end="00:59:58.040" style="s2">books and pen and paper it really but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.600" end="00:59:59.720" style="s2">think that&#39;s the question I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.040" end="01:00:03.350" style="s2">the what you just described if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.720" end="01:00:06.260" style="s2">needs to figure that out and that would</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.350" end="01:00:07.850" style="s2">be the thing is let&#39;s say somebody did</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.260" end="01:00:10.610" style="s2">figure that out my question is who would</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.850" end="01:00:12.350" style="s2">actually want that I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.610" end="01:00:13.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know how many people really you</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.350" end="01:00:15.050" style="s2">say did you want to be rational do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.760" end="01:00:17.720" style="s2">want to be insightful do you want to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.050" end="01:00:19.160" style="s2">objective sure right but actually when</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.720" end="01:00:21.590" style="s2">they see what that means how many people</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.160" end="01:00:23.780" style="s2">would really want that another example</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.590" end="01:00:26.060" style="s2">would be think of like let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.780" end="01:00:27.590" style="s2">let&#39;s say you invented some class that</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.060" end="01:00:29.990" style="s2">was really good at this and made kids</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.590" end="01:00:32.600" style="s2">super enlightened rational objective</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.990" end="01:00:34.520" style="s2">whatever you want to put it and then you</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.600" end="01:00:37.610" style="s2">eat and you shut up shop next to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.520" end="01:00:39.680" style="s2">an SAT prep course right like no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.610" end="01:00:40.640" style="s2">gonna take their kids to this thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.680" end="01:00:42.620" style="s2">they&#39;re all gonna take their kids of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.640" end="01:00:44.120" style="s2">SAT prep course so I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.620" end="01:00:46.400" style="s2">dump on the idea I think it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.120" end="01:00:47.960" style="s2">important idea is the main I think I</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.400" end="01:00:48.890" style="s2">really do I believe that I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.960" end="01:00:50.900" style="s2">really one of the most important</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.890" end="01:00:52.700" style="s2">problems in history and civilization</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.900" end="01:00:56.000" style="s2">like not just now in the past and in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.700" end="01:00:57.560" style="s2">future but that&#39;s the challenge it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.000" end="01:01:00.490" style="s2">getting people to want it I think if</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.560" end="01:01:03.620" style="s2">people want something it happens well</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.490" end="01:01:06.350" style="s2">I&#39;m not known for taking on easy tasks</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.620" end="01:01:07.730" style="s2">so funny you should say that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.350" end="01:01:09.350" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been really that that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.730" end="01:01:14.000" style="s2">one of the goals of the liminal order</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.350" end="01:01:17.150" style="s2">actually is to is to how do you find how</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.000" end="01:01:20.020" style="s2">do you create yourself to become in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.150" end="01:01:22.460" style="s2">state in which you can pass you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.020" end="01:01:25.640" style="s2">interpret information discern what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.460" end="01:01:27.740" style="s2">valuable make a choice and a commitment</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.640" end="01:01:31.010" style="s2">and embody your ideals as it relates to</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.740" end="01:01:32.690" style="s2">that information and in my conversations</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.010" end="01:01:34.610" style="s2">with guys like Jordan Greenhalgh who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.690" end="01:01:36.530" style="s2">now going by Jordan Hall he&#39;s a you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.610" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">a tech guy turned philosopher who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.530" end="01:01:41.930" style="s2">really thinking about this issue quite a</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:46.850" style="s2">bit and and thinking about sense making</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.930" end="01:01:48.290" style="s2">and cohesion national cohesion and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.850" end="01:01:50.150" style="s2">know you combine that with the stories</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.290" end="01:01:52.160" style="s2">and and the narratives and the power of</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.150" end="01:01:53.660" style="s2">our shared imagined orders and whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.160" end="01:01:55.010" style="s2">and you can see how social media has</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.660" end="01:01:56.630" style="s2">really all that up and made</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.010" end="01:02:00.170" style="s2">much much worse and that we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.630" end="01:02:01.910" style="s2">we don&#39;t have Rosie it&#39;s the postman</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.170" end="01:02:04.280" style="s2">you&#39;re fine</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.910" end="01:02:06.140" style="s2">Rosie no my dog well maybe we&#39;ll add</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.280" end="01:02:08.930" style="s2">that out later but maybe not so we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.140" end="01:02:11.420" style="s2">a we&#39;ve we&#39;ve lost the shared narratives</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.930" end="01:02:13.670" style="s2">that held us all together and social</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.420" end="01:02:15.980" style="s2">media has really punctuated us and tueur</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.670" end="01:02:18.440" style="s2">blasted us into a million pieces instead</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.980" end="01:02:20.060" style="s2">of one single coherent unit and one of</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.440" end="01:02:21.890" style="s2">the things that Jordans come up with and</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.060" end="01:02:23.300" style="s2">I and and this is not brand new</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.890" end="01:02:24.050" style="s2">information it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of ancient</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.300" end="01:02:26.150" style="s2">wisdoms</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.050" end="01:02:28.040" style="s2">you know his idea is that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.150" end="01:02:29.870" style="s2">become the most finely tuned version of</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.040" end="01:02:31.700" style="s2">yourself as possible right and so that</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.870" end="01:02:33.470" style="s2">means making sure that you&#39;re physically</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.700" end="01:02:35.750" style="s2">sound making sure that you&#39;re mentally</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.470" end="01:02:38.570" style="s2">clear for me and for my guys that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.750" end="01:02:39.890" style="s2">like that&#39;s for like meditating and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.570" end="01:02:42.380" style="s2">for effort through exercise and</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.890" end="01:02:44.240" style="s2">community service and effort and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.380" end="01:02:45.830" style="s2">and realizing that you have to be of</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:48.140" style="s2">service and commitment to other people</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.830" end="01:02:51.680" style="s2">and so if you start to stack these</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.140" end="01:02:53.420" style="s2">things up it begins to create this sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.680" end="01:02:55.250" style="s2">of personal sovereignty which is allows</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.420" end="01:02:56.630" style="s2">you to sort of detach from some of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.250" end="01:03:00.230" style="s2">chaos that&#39;s out there and detach from</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.630" end="01:03:03.980" style="s2">the agendas and develop an earnestness</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.230" end="01:03:05.260" style="s2">and a courage to address some of these</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.980" end="01:03:09.170" style="s2">issues and have difficult conversations</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.260" end="01:03:10.850" style="s2">and and to accept competing ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.170" end="01:03:13.070" style="s2">and have people push back against you</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.850" end="01:03:15.230" style="s2">and not take it personal and to and to</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.070" end="01:03:17.570" style="s2">really just engage in the pursuit of of</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.230" end="01:03:20.000" style="s2">intellectual progress and and dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.570" end="01:03:23.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.000" end="01:03:23.900" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing you and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.000" end="01:03:25.220" style="s2">are doing right now and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.900" end="01:03:26.720" style="s2">we&#39;re doing in the luminal order and</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.220" end="01:03:29.450" style="s2">that&#39;s what I hope for from all our</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.720" end="01:03:30.800" style="s2">guests is to be able to sort of put some</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.450" end="01:03:32.210" style="s2">that stuff aside and to really think</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.800" end="01:03:34.310" style="s2">about it Menke Majan how much more</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.210" end="01:03:36.320" style="s2">popular I would be if all I did all day</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.310" end="01:03:37.970" style="s2">was throw out red meat and Trump this</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.320" end="01:03:39.740" style="s2">and then and you know and just throw out</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.970" end="01:03:41.180" style="s2">political sausage for people to fry I</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.740" end="01:03:43.700" style="s2">mean that would be that would bore me to</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.180" end="01:03:45.500" style="s2">death absolutely and so we&#39;re going for</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.700" end="01:03:47.140" style="s2">nuance and we&#39;re going for actual</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.500" end="01:03:51.020" style="s2">commitment and we&#39;re going for</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.140" end="01:03:52.160" style="s2">embodiment and courage and being able to</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.020" end="01:03:53.630" style="s2">think about some of these things with</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.160" end="01:03:57.350" style="s2">courage I think is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.630" end="01:04:00.170" style="s2">totally missing out there so when you</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.350" end="01:04:02.120" style="s2">say the kids won&#39;t your parents won&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:04:06.890" end="01:04:10.029" style="s2">world and start to sense</p>

<p begin="01:04:24.549" end="01:04:28.269" style="s2">you&#39;re saying you need to update sort of</p>

<p begin="01:05:13.359" end="01:05:17.229" style="s2">has turned us into little technological</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.160" end="01:05:19.479" style="s2">slaves and ones and zeroes the Rick and</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.229" end="01:05:20.890" style="s2">Morty scenario I mean some of it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.479" end="01:05:22.569" style="s2">really far-fetched but then there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.890" end="01:05:25.569" style="s2">like actual fundamental arguments that</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.569" end="01:05:27.849" style="s2">seeming are seemingly very convincing as</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.569" end="01:05:31.569" style="s2">well too so I imagine you&#39;ve given this</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.849" end="01:05:32.949" style="s2">some thought I have and you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.569" end="01:05:34.329" style="s2">to me the question I think about a lot</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.949" end="01:05:37.209" style="s2">of them I mean lots of other people do</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.329" end="01:05:41.650" style="s2">is you know I mean why is there no sign</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.209" end="01:05:43.119" style="s2">of life anywhere else and and lots of</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.650" end="01:05:44.920" style="s2">theories about that you know we could be</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.119" end="01:05:47.319" style="s2">the first we could be some experiment it</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.920" end="01:05:49.359" style="s2">could be that actually this is some</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.319" end="01:05:50.859" style="s2">transitory you know there&#39;s there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.359" end="01:05:53.049" style="s2">being like a dog and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.859" end="01:05:54.400" style="s2">basically being sort of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.049" end="01:05:56.289" style="s2">something that happens after us that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.400" end="01:05:57.789" style="s2">superhuman that&#39;s sort of non-physical</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.289" end="01:05:59.829" style="s2">that we don&#39;t even know how to observe</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.789" end="01:06:03.549" style="s2">right maybe we&#39;re in this I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.829" end="01:06:05.049" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of theories but um I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.549" end="01:06:06.400" style="s2">know what I don&#39;t know what to make of</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.049" end="01:06:09.279" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know what I can do about</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.400" end="01:06:13.509" style="s2">that and yeah are we some simulation I</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.279" end="01:06:14.799" style="s2">think it&#39;s possible I guess my edit and</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.509" end="01:06:17.499" style="s2">I do again I think about these things</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.799" end="01:06:18.939" style="s2">that but I then I wonder like what how</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.499" end="01:06:21.069" style="s2">does it really affect me how can I</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.939" end="01:06:21.380" style="s2">actually what can I do about it and it</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.069" end="01:06:24.590" style="s2">was very</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.380" end="01:06:25.790" style="s2">I can actually no it&#39;s just it is fun it</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.590" end="01:06:27.320" style="s2">is yeah it&#39;s a night it&#39;s an it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.790" end="01:06:28.310" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is it&#39;s fun yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.320" end="01:06:30.200" style="s2">like watching a football game or</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.310" end="01:06:32.150" style="s2">something like that it&#39;s a doll indulge</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.200" end="01:06:34.580" style="s2">me for a minute oh don&#39;t use what you</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.150" end="01:06:36.980" style="s2">want yeah but on the fun side of this I</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.580" end="01:06:38.780" style="s2">mean okay so one of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.980" end="01:06:42.350" style="s2">things that I heard that got me thinking</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.780" end="01:06:44.480" style="s2">was like we&#39;re on a path however long</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.350" end="01:06:46.370" style="s2">that path may take the computational</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.480" end="01:06:48.050" style="s2">power and the energy within the universe</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.370" end="01:06:49.790" style="s2">at some point should be sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.050" end="01:06:51.920" style="s2">enough that they could create someone</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.790" end="01:06:53.720" style="s2">could create a simulation that would be</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.920" end="01:06:56.270" style="s2">rich enough to confuse the human mind</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.720" end="01:06:58.400" style="s2">and if that we&#39;re on that path and that</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.270" end="01:07:00.080" style="s2">path could take thousand years or 10,000</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.400" end="01:07:01.640" style="s2">or hundred thousand years from now that</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.080" end="01:07:03.950" style="s2">the odds of us being the first one on</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.640" end="01:07:05.720" style="s2">that path are so impressively small that</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.950" end="01:07:08.150" style="s2">problems speaking from probability that</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.720" end="01:07:09.500" style="s2">we&#39;re not the first iteration to come</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.150" end="01:07:13.220" style="s2">through here does that hold any weight</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.500" end="01:07:15.110" style="s2">for you yeah I mean that&#39;s s5u as well</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.220" end="01:07:16.730" style="s2">like it&#39;s almost inconceivable that were</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.110" end="01:07:20.180" style="s2">the first ones I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.730" end="01:07:23.120" style="s2">puzzle to me and the only the only</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.180" end="01:07:24.650" style="s2">theories I have or one is you know again</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.120" end="01:07:26.150" style="s2">these aren&#39;t I think none of these are</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.650" end="01:07:28.640" style="s2">really my idea but one is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.150" end="01:07:30.530" style="s2">something like all civilizations just</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.640" end="01:07:33.110" style="s2">inherently self-destruct right at some</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.530" end="01:07:34.430" style="s2">level that&#39;s one theory the other theory</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.110" end="01:07:36.350" style="s2">is that they all reach some form of</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.430" end="01:07:37.460" style="s2">enlightenment where you know where the</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.350" end="01:07:39.230" style="s2">thing to do is you sit around like</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.460" end="01:07:40.700" style="s2">meditate in a cave all day and so they</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.230" end="01:07:41.930" style="s2">which I don&#39;t believe either I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.700" end="01:07:44.390" style="s2">think that&#39;s really what&#39;s then the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.930" end="01:07:48.010" style="s2">other thing is I&#39;m starting to feel that</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.390" end="01:07:51.980" style="s2">way what is way movie being detached and</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.010" end="01:07:54.140" style="s2">but the other way is you know maybe like</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.980" end="01:07:56.750" style="s2">somehow like oh we are they all sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.140" end="01:07:58.220" style="s2">like upload our brains into some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.750" end="01:07:59.480" style="s2">like ether of some sort that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.220" end="01:08:01.100" style="s2">even really know about or it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.480" end="01:08:03.770" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for at the wrong sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.100" end="01:08:06.560" style="s2">spectrum of electromagnetic frequency to</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.770" end="01:08:08.450" style="s2">see where people are so those are those</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.560" end="01:08:10.970" style="s2">are all theories of what it could be</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.450" end="01:08:13.040" style="s2">going on but yeah I don&#39;t know what else</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.970" end="01:08:14.600" style="s2">to say it&#39;s it&#39;s just shocking to me</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.040" end="01:08:16.970" style="s2">that there&#39;s no other signs of life</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.600" end="01:08:18.800" style="s2">anywhere yeah that&#39;s the one that gets</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.970" end="01:08:20.420" style="s2">me and you know you go through the Fermi</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.800" end="01:08:21.740" style="s2">paradox and whatever but I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.420" end="01:08:23.180" style="s2">just so big there&#39;s so many places</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.740" end="01:08:25.150" style="s2">there&#39;s so much possibility source</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.180" end="01:08:27.110" style="s2">opportunity that you would think</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.150" end="01:08:28.310" style="s2">statistically speaking it would be</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.110" end="01:08:30.140" style="s2">probable for us to have at least</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.310" end="01:08:32.300" style="s2">detected anything out there whatsoever</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.140" end="01:08:34.160" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t seem like there is I mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.300" end="01:08:35.170" style="s2">have you heard we heard there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.160" end="01:08:37.060" style="s2">like credible you</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.170" end="01:08:38.529" style="s2">for reports I mean I haven&#39;t done too</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.060" end="01:08:40.960" style="s2">much into that is that anything that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.529" end="01:08:45.520" style="s2">you pay attention to at all you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.960" end="01:08:48.400" style="s2">like as an amusement I guess I guess it</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.520" end="01:08:49.569" style="s2">seems like probably some airforce secret</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.400" end="01:08:52.140" style="s2">Air Force project is probably a better</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.569" end="01:08:54.520" style="s2">explanation for a lot of those things I</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.140" end="01:08:55.929" style="s2">think one other thing to think about</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.520" end="01:08:58.690" style="s2">actually just think about our own</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.929" end="01:09:01.299" style="s2">history as humans is that that um you</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.690" end="01:09:02.500" style="s2">know basically technology really I mean</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.299" end="01:09:04.810" style="s2">are sort of modern industrial</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.500" end="01:09:08.710" style="s2">technological sort of society it</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.810" end="01:09:10.839" style="s2">happened once and involved once and and</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.710" end="01:09:13.359" style="s2">there were and people had happen sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.839" end="01:09:15.250" style="s2">in Western Europe and and is really</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.359" end="01:09:16.750" style="s2">where it started and people don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.250" end="01:09:18.100" style="s2">realize this but a lot of people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.750" end="01:09:20.020" style="s2">but really Western Europe is like a</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.100" end="01:09:22.480" style="s2">backwater right like basically from a</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.020" end="01:09:24.850" style="s2">history no civilization started a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.480" end="01:09:26.770" style="s2">other elsewhere and so there is this</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.850" end="01:09:28.540" style="s2">sort of thing and even human industry</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.770" end="01:09:31.210" style="s2">where there&#39;s plenty of precedent of</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.540" end="01:09:32.440" style="s2">people having the mental capability to</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.210" end="01:09:34.449" style="s2">sort of do everything we&#39;re doing now</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.440" end="01:09:35.500" style="s2">but they haven&#39;t many other cults from</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.449" end="01:09:37.660" style="s2">there the time to do what they the</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.500" end="01:09:40.390" style="s2">resources to do it</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.660" end="01:09:42.429" style="s2">so then you have to ask yourself maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.390" end="01:09:44.290" style="s2">there&#39;s really something maybe it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.429" end="01:09:46.330" style="s2">rare than it looks right but but any</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.290" end="01:09:47.830" style="s2">other hand you know again there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.330" end="01:09:49.929" style="s2">another billion sort of stars out there</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.830" end="01:09:52.719" style="s2">whatever it is and planets not there so</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.929" end="01:09:53.799" style="s2">that yeah but anyway that&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.719" end="01:09:55.210" style="s2">theories that there&#39;s really something</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.799" end="01:09:56.440" style="s2">magically rare about what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.210" end="01:09:58.300" style="s2">that that it&#39;s more rare than we would</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.440" end="01:10:01.060" style="s2">take it would be well and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.300" end="01:10:03.460" style="s2">where I&#39;m starting to come down the more</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.060" end="01:10:07.890" style="s2">I think about the math and the science</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.460" end="01:10:10.090" style="s2">and the just nature of infinity it and</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.890" end="01:10:12.790" style="s2">space and everything that&#39;s out there it</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.090" end="01:10:15.969" style="s2">really did it seems to me and I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.790" end="01:10:17.800" style="s2">raised half Jewish half Catholic but I</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.969" end="01:10:20.440" style="s2">left all that in childhood I&#39;ve not been</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.800" end="01:10:22.780" style="s2">a practicing religious person as an</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.440" end="01:10:25.660" style="s2">adult but I gotta say that the more I</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.780" end="01:10:30.670" style="s2">learn about stuff the more I am inclined</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.660" end="01:10:33.340" style="s2">to take a to receive an answer that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.670" end="01:10:35.110" style="s2">like beyond science something super</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.340" end="01:10:36.610" style="s2">special oh there&#39;s a word that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.110" end="01:10:39.550" style="s2">mystical or something there&#39;s a word</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.610" end="01:10:40.870" style="s2">that I&#39;m missing here yeah but it seems</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.550" end="01:10:42.190" style="s2">to me there&#39;s so many questions upon</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.870" end="01:10:44.199" style="s2">questions upon questions and you take</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.190" end="01:10:45.489" style="s2">down deeper deeper deeper and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.199" end="01:10:47.070" style="s2">still just more questions it gets just</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.489" end="01:10:50.190" style="s2">more complicated and whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.070" end="01:10:52.679" style="s2">and it seems to me you know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.190" end="01:10:54.210" style="s2">I become more and more open to accepting</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.679" end="01:10:56.670" style="s2">the presence of some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.210" end="01:10:59.070" style="s2">supernatural something or other you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.670" end="01:11:02.280" style="s2">I&#39;m not ready to put a face on it or</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.070" end="01:11:03.540" style="s2">anything but it does seem to me that it</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.280" end="01:11:06.630" style="s2">would it would answer a lot of questions</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.540" end="01:11:08.909" style="s2">and I think that that is basically been</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.630" end="01:11:10.530" style="s2">the primary goal over time really you</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.909" end="01:11:12.420" style="s2">know we&#39;re not the first generation of</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.530" end="01:11:13.860" style="s2">humans to wake up and look up at the sky</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.420" end="01:11:15.750" style="s2">and be like I wonder what&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.860" end="01:11:17.639" style="s2">we&#39;ve all had these we&#39;ve all had these</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.750" end="01:11:21.060" style="s2">questions and we&#39;ve all felt the urge to</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.639" end="01:11:23.159" style="s2">have them answered and so having an</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.060" end="01:11:24.929" style="s2">answer that worked as a blanket answer</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.159" end="01:11:26.460" style="s2">for things I think I can really see the</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.929" end="01:11:28.739" style="s2">productive value and that muscle</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.460" end="01:11:30.889" style="s2">starting to see the sort of emotional</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.739" end="01:11:33.420" style="s2">spiritual value and that as well too</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.889" end="01:11:35.989" style="s2">which is why some of these conversations</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.420" end="01:11:39.000" style="s2">about reality perception and reality</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.989" end="01:11:41.670" style="s2">simulation stuff creating a new human</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.000" end="01:11:43.619" style="s2">mind out of VO sand and glass and heat</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.670" end="01:11:45.659" style="s2">and whatever all these things are tied</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.619" end="01:11:47.310" style="s2">together yeah which makes it so</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.659" end="01:11:49.739" style="s2">absolutely fascinating such an</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.310" end="01:11:51.690" style="s2">interesting field I know you said you</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.739" end="01:11:53.219" style="s2">entered AI in the wintertime or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.690" end="01:11:56.639" style="s2">but it seems like you&#39;re in the end of</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.219" end="01:11:59.190" style="s2">really fascinating exciting realm of our</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.639" end="01:12:00.510" style="s2">existence today I mean what what brings</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.190" end="01:12:02.760" style="s2">it all together quite like that</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.510" end="01:12:06.329" style="s2">it&#39;s very pretty fascinating to me it is</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.760" end="01:12:09.329" style="s2">yeah I mean a question for you is have</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.329" end="01:12:11.040" style="s2">you noticed that um again my V so there</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.329" end="01:12:13.199" style="s2">are these deep questions why are we here</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.040" end="01:12:14.579" style="s2">what caused everything and and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.199" end="01:12:16.050" style="s2">remember when I was my first you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.579" end="01:12:17.099" style="s2">you go to college there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.050" end="01:12:19.980" style="s2">other kids thinking about the same</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.099" end="01:12:21.599" style="s2">things I get a sense now I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.980" end="01:12:23.159" style="s2">young kids now both when I was a</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.599" end="01:12:25.500" style="s2">professor but also sort of just in</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.159" end="01:12:26.849" style="s2">normal life now I don&#39;t get a sense that</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.500" end="01:12:29.400" style="s2">they&#39;re asking the same questions I mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.849" end="01:12:31.079" style="s2">I almost feel like like the curiosity</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.400" end="01:12:33.480" style="s2">about the deeper questions is actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.079" end="01:12:35.460" style="s2">waned I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s you found</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.480" end="01:12:36.929" style="s2">that as well or not I mean one theory is</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.460" end="01:12:38.250" style="s2">there&#39;s so much to social media just</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.929" end="01:12:39.360" style="s2">constant simulation you don&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.250" end="01:12:41.070" style="s2">time to think about these things that</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.360" end="01:12:42.989" style="s2">you&#39;re just it&#39;s like a brave new world</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.070" end="01:12:45.030" style="s2">or something like that where your cost</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.989" end="01:12:45.980" style="s2">like so your constant cap so occupy you</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.030" end="01:12:48.840" style="s2">never think about the deep questions</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.980" end="01:12:53.010" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s definitely information</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.840" end="01:12:55.170" style="s2">overload and there there&#39;s new religion</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.010" end="01:12:57.670" style="s2">now too though so there&#39;s new moral</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.170" end="01:12:59.739" style="s2">codes and new religions that are</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.670" end="01:13:02.140" style="s2">secular secular religions that have</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.739" end="01:13:03.550" style="s2">popped up that are driving our</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.140" end="01:13:05.290" style="s2">institutions in our education system</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.550" end="01:13:08.440" style="s2">that don&#39;t even make space for those</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.290" end="01:13:11.530" style="s2">kinds of conversations I think maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.440" end="01:13:13.480" style="s2">lack of a questioning in that regard</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.530" end="01:13:15.520" style="s2">could come from feeling like you already</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.480" end="01:13:19.050" style="s2">have the answer and the answer is zero</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.520" end="01:13:21.699" style="s2">blank dark nothing nihilistic totally</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.050" end="01:13:23.500" style="s2">spiritualist just total random</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.699" end="01:13:25.840" style="s2">matter and a random place in a ragam</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.500" end="01:13:27.550" style="s2">time and there&#39;s no answer that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.840" end="01:13:29.800" style="s2">interesting actually yeah that basically</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.550" end="01:13:31.270" style="s2">that that we&#39;re becoming sort of almost</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.800" end="01:13:32.920" style="s2">like this there&#39;s almost like this</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.270" end="01:13:35.290" style="s2">doctrine it&#39;s being imposed on everybody</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.920" end="01:13:37.390" style="s2">it&#39;s just not what it used to be and it</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.290" end="01:13:39.820" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really have really space for</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.390" end="01:13:41.320" style="s2">these kinds of questions and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.820" end="01:13:44.320" style="s2">because it could it&#39;s presented as that</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.320" end="01:13:45.850" style="s2">is the answer right right yeah here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.320" end="01:13:48.130" style="s2">the answer and they did and they I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.850" end="01:13:50.860" style="s2">from what my senses on campus and</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.130" end="01:13:54.010" style="s2">talking to people studying curricula and</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.860" end="01:13:56.170" style="s2">things is that it&#39;s not presented in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.010" end="01:13:59.140" style="s2">way that kruta invites exploration</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.170" end="01:14:01.239" style="s2">either especially there&#39;s the new</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.140" end="01:14:02.860" style="s2">secular religions intersectionality</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.239" end="01:14:05.110" style="s2">critical theory things like that these</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.860" end="01:14:08.080" style="s2">things are being presented as just fact</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.110" end="01:14:09.969" style="s2">question asked question answered just</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.080" end="01:14:11.469" style="s2">move forward we have to be activists we</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.969" end="01:14:13.390" style="s2">have to take care we have to make change</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.469" end="01:14:16.120" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no question for that</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.390" end="01:14:18.160" style="s2">type of you know I&#39;m gonna say</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.120" end="01:14:21.010" style="s2">navel-gazing that&#39;s pejorative so you</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.160" end="01:14:22.630" style="s2">know just dreaming imagining I mean dude</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.010" end="01:14:25.030" style="s2">how much time did I spend just like</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.630" end="01:14:26.890" style="s2">sticking poking a stick in the mud when</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.030" end="01:14:28.060" style="s2">I was a kid yeah oh I&#39;m just playing and</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.890" end="01:14:29.130" style="s2">just where does your mind go and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.060" end="01:14:31.420" style="s2">things you think about I mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.130" end="01:14:33.969" style="s2">daydreaming used to be something that</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.420" end="01:14:35.650" style="s2">they people look down on daydreaming but</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.969" end="01:14:37.270" style="s2">man daydreaming is where I get most of</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.650" end="01:14:39.580" style="s2">my good work done you know it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.270" end="01:14:41.860" style="s2">can be totally lost in my own head and</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.580" end="01:14:43.390" style="s2">and working even though it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.860" end="01:14:44.590" style="s2">I&#39;m just kind of staring off into space</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.390" end="01:14:46.480" style="s2">and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.590" end="01:14:49.210" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m as a victim of this today as</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.480" end="01:14:51.280" style="s2">anybody I that phone that phone is</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.210" end="01:14:54.429" style="s2"> got me I&#39;m like a heroin junkie</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.280" end="01:14:56.949" style="s2">a iphone and I have to set really strict</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.429" end="01:14:59.650" style="s2">parameters in its usage and day time and</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.949" end="01:15:01.300" style="s2">and limits and stuff because I I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.650" end="01:15:03.820" style="s2">get deep work done when I have to when</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.300" end="01:15:05.260" style="s2">I&#39;m like doing social media and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.820" end="01:15:08.650" style="s2">part of my job and I love it I love</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.260" end="01:15:10.300" style="s2">doing it but it just it starts a cascade</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.650" end="01:15:13.930" style="s2">of thought and action</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.300" end="01:15:15.910" style="s2">ward that that is really hard to break</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.930" end="01:15:17.890" style="s2">out of you know if I start off my</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.910" end="01:15:20.170" style="s2">morning doing social media and I have</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.890" end="01:15:21.550" style="s2">some tweets like take off then I can</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.170" end="01:15:23.440" style="s2">lose another two hours just watching</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.550" end="01:15:24.820" style="s2">like thousands of notifications come in</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.440" end="01:15:26.260" style="s2">when really all I wanted to do is set</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.820" end="01:15:27.970" style="s2">off a couple of tweets and then get back</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.260" end="01:15:30.430" style="s2">to writing or reading or prepping for an</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.970" end="01:15:32.170" style="s2">interview or something so like for me</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.430" end="01:15:34.510" style="s2">personally as an adult I&#39;ve had to find</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.170" end="01:15:37.180" style="s2">ways to create space in order to allow</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.510" end="01:15:38.740" style="s2">my mind to go and as a writer luckily I</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.180" end="01:15:40.810" style="s2">have a system for that too you know and</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.740" end="01:15:42.400" style="s2">as I write people say you got to think</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.810" end="01:15:44.440" style="s2">before you write I know no man I write</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.400" end="01:15:46.840" style="s2">so I can think and that&#39;s when I start</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.440" end="01:15:48.970" style="s2">to see things come together but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.840" end="01:15:50.830" style="s2">see us really like creating those spaces</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.970" end="01:15:53.200" style="s2">for our children and for our youth today</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.830" end="01:15:55.900" style="s2">and and it&#39;s it&#39;s this transition period</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.200" end="01:15:57.940" style="s2">you and I are approximately the same age</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.900" end="01:16:01.600" style="s2">you can see yourself Gen X oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.940" end="01:16:04.450" style="s2">exactly yeah Gen X okay so we&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.600" end="01:16:07.420" style="s2">this transition time where we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.450" end="01:16:08.710" style="s2">making these mistakes you know like here</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.420" end="01:16:10.720" style="s2">give your kid a phone when</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.710" end="01:16:13.180" style="s2">they&#39;re 10 no it&#39;s probably a pretty bad</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.720" end="01:16:14.530" style="s2">idea or a number of different mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.180" end="01:16:16.840" style="s2">is like how to manage your privacy</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.530" end="01:16:18.760" style="s2">online or how to just not be an idiot on</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.840" end="01:16:20.530" style="s2">social media these are all things I had</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.760" end="01:16:22.090" style="s2">no idea stuff I was doing I was 14</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.530" end="01:16:22.480" style="s2">online was still gonna be out there</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.090" end="01:16:26.860" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.480" end="01:16:29.980" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;re learning through trial and</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.860" end="01:16:31.600" style="s2">error through humans which is and what</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.980" end="01:16:33.280" style="s2">you wait a bummer and what you said</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.600" end="01:16:36.400" style="s2">about sort of like your kid he had time</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.280" end="01:16:38.230" style="s2">to just poke a stick in the mud and you</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.400" end="01:16:39.610" style="s2">can&#39;t do that anymore and you have a se</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.230" end="01:16:41.800" style="s2">out here in Silicon Valley you see all</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.610" end="01:16:43.570" style="s2">these parents taking their kids they go</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.800" end="01:16:44.830" style="s2">to these world-class schools and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.570" end="01:16:48.610" style="s2">afterwards they go to these tutoring</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.830" end="01:16:50.550" style="s2">centers and and so these kids are so</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.610" end="01:16:52.330" style="s2">over program and they&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.550" end="01:16:53.920" style="s2">scheduled although I&#39;m not the first</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.330" end="01:16:55.420" style="s2">person to say this but basically that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.920" end="01:16:57.970" style="s2">all they&#39;re doing and they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.420" end="01:16:59.500" style="s2">turning the end it&#39;s good in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.970" end="01:17:01.120" style="s2">but it&#39;s also making them fragile in</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.500" end="01:17:03.700" style="s2">other ways and and they don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.120" end="01:17:06.130" style="s2">think well and they don&#39;t even have time</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.700" end="01:17:08.020" style="s2">to think for themselves and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.130" end="01:17:09.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a scary thing where you get sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.020" end="01:17:11.980" style="s2">this elite we&#39;re breeding we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.190" end="01:17:13.540" style="s2">basically it&#39;s super sort of intense and</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.980" end="01:17:17.160" style="s2">concentrated and focused in certain ways</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.540" end="01:17:19.330" style="s2">but also completely sort of incapable of</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.160" end="01:17:20.380" style="s2">thinking about or having curiosity about</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.330" end="01:17:22.750" style="s2">sort of what they&#39;re doing and why</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.380" end="01:17:24.090" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it and it&#39;s not really a</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.750" end="01:17:25.739" style="s2">sauna</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.090" end="01:17:27.989" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a really good experimental</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.739" end="01:17:31.020" style="s2">thing no it&#39;s not and we&#39;re beginning to</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.989" end="01:17:32.699" style="s2">see those first kind of those people</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.020" end="01:17:35.520" style="s2">raised like that in professional</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.699" end="01:17:37.830" style="s2">industry now so like journalism for</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.520" end="01:17:39.810" style="s2">example you know how many journalists</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.830" end="01:17:41.810" style="s2">are between ages of 25 and 35 and who</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.810" end="01:17:44.820" style="s2">grew up in this whole same environment</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.810" end="01:17:46.980" style="s2">where you don&#39;t have any moment to</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.820" end="01:17:49.830" style="s2">reflect you&#39;re taking everything at</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.980" end="01:17:52.560" style="s2">everything is given as Dogma you really</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.830" end="01:17:54.780" style="s2">aren&#39;t being critical you&#39;ve had no time</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.560" end="01:17:57.150" style="s2">to self explore other than those like</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.780" end="01:17:58.980" style="s2">four weeks you took and in Spain after</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.150" end="01:18:00.989" style="s2">your study abroad semester or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.980" end="01:18:03.389" style="s2">drinking with other kids from Australia</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.989" end="01:18:05.909" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t really count and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.389" end="01:18:09.060" style="s2">seeing I think sort of that my op myopic</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.909" end="01:18:10.590" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m thinking in journalism and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.060" end="01:18:12.659" style="s2">into our discourse and then it just</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.590" end="01:18:14.639" style="s2">that&#39;s why in my book I called the</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.659" end="01:18:16.800" style="s2">college campuses ground ground zero</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.639" end="01:18:18.630" style="s2">patient zero because that&#39;s where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.800" end="01:18:20.340" style="s2">where it&#39;s all starting and then it just</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.630" end="01:18:21.690" style="s2">Criss crosses the country infiltrates</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.340" end="01:18:23.159" style="s2">our institutions and then the</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.690" end="01:18:25.980" style="s2">institutions these days seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.159" end="01:18:28.250" style="s2">bending to adopt to the needs of the new</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.980" end="01:18:30.810" style="s2">people rather than the old days like</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.250" end="01:18:32.820" style="s2">forcing the new entrants to adopt to the</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.810" end="01:18:35.159" style="s2">institutional standards and norms which</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.820" end="01:18:37.500" style="s2">I think is also very troubling</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.159" end="01:18:42.630" style="s2">in fact I hadn&#39;t put this together now</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.500" end="01:18:44.159" style="s2">but yeah the the cult of the child which</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.630" end="01:18:47.520" style="s2">has evolved over the last few decades</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.159" end="01:18:50.849" style="s2">here where the parents put the needs and</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.520" end="01:18:53.099" style="s2">wants of the children first reads an</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.849" end="01:18:54.570" style="s2">institutional structure an organization</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.099" end="01:18:55.980" style="s2">in which the leadership of those</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.570" end="01:18:57.780" style="s2">organizations are gonna want to put</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.980" end="01:19:00.119" style="s2">those the needs of those child&#39;s and new</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.780" end="01:19:02.400" style="s2">entrants first to and then there begin</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.119" end="01:19:03.900" style="s2">to lose track of what their mission was</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.400" end="01:19:06.719" style="s2">what their shareholder you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.900" end="01:19:08.670" style="s2">responsibilities are it cetera and so</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.719" end="01:19:10.199" style="s2">everybody gets distracted and though</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.670" end="01:19:13.050" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the kids sort of running the</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.199" end="01:19:14.369" style="s2">insane asylum even though we rose them</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.050" end="01:19:16.260" style="s2">raised them to be crazy in the first</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.369" end="01:19:17.580" style="s2">place man</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.260" end="01:19:19.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot in there but I&#39;m doing my</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.580" end="01:19:21.389" style="s2">best to not have that happen with my</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.199" end="01:19:21.869" style="s2">kids I mean we have family dinner every</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.389" end="01:19:24.900" style="s2">night</p>

<p begin="01:19:24.900" end="01:19:28.980" style="s2">the table they sit there no devices know</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.480" end="01:19:30.869" style="s2">anything they sit there they ask</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.980" end="01:19:32.849" style="s2">questions we probe we talk about all</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.869" end="01:19:34.949" style="s2">kinds of and now my daughter&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="01:19:46.079" end="01:19:50.159" style="s2">really fun to see her process all that</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.090" end="01:19:52.139" style="s2">stuff I can&#39;t wait to talk to her</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.159" end="01:19:53.699" style="s2">tonight about what happened in Iowa last</p>

<p begin="01:20:00.389" end="01:20:04.979" style="s2">this point but um it&#39;s been an hour and</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.269" end="01:20:06.360" style="s2">20 minutes and I wanted to just wrap up</p>

<p begin="01:20:20.130" end="01:20:24.659" style="s2">for Samsung I believe for a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.959" end="01:20:27.510" style="s2">as well as right and then and now you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.659" end="01:20:29.400" style="s2">transitioned into something new once you</p>

<p begin="01:20:38.099" end="01:20:42.090" style="s2">just expression software&#39;s eating the</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.389" end="01:20:44.249" style="s2">world and what that really means is that</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.090" end="01:20:47.340" style="s2">the entire economy the into all of</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.249" end="01:20:50.459" style="s2">society at some level is being fueled by</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.340" end="01:20:51.749" style="s2">software depends on software so you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.459" end="01:20:53.820" style="s2">example be you know the taxi industry</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.749" end="01:20:56.400" style="s2">now is like uber and so there&#39;s software</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.820" end="01:20:58.559" style="s2">underlying that may or beam be sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.400" end="01:21:02.070" style="s2">in the hospitality industry and I could</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.559" end="01:21:04.590" style="s2">go on everything at dating new even dog</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.070" end="01:21:07.289" style="s2">walking I didn&#39;t think of that but I</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.590" end="01:21:08.760" style="s2">believe it really it really is sued you</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.289" end="01:21:10.709" style="s2">can there&#39;s an app now where wherever</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.760" end="01:21:12.570" style="s2">you are if you&#39;re a dog walker you just</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.709" end="01:21:14.369" style="s2">pull it up and there&#39;s like five people</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.570" end="01:21:16.469" style="s2">within 50 feet of you that need their</p>

<p begin="01:21:31.469" end="01:21:34.909" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a really good idea yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.059" end="01:21:37.289" style="s2">I&#39;m surprised it hasn&#39;t happened already</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.909" end="01:21:40.559" style="s2">so that&#39;s a good Kickstarter project but</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.289" end="01:21:42.030" style="s2">but but um so software&#39;s taking over the</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.559" end="01:21:43.920" style="s2">world and and it&#39;s the software&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.030" end="01:21:47.099" style="s2">required everywhere but really the</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.920" end="01:21:47.500" style="s2">supply of software developers is limited</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.099" end="01:21:49.420" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.500" end="01:21:50.800" style="s2">that you know you contrary to what</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.420" end="01:21:52.780" style="s2">people say everybody just can&#39;t learn</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.800" end="01:21:54.430" style="s2">the code actually it&#39;s a very sort of</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.780" end="01:21:56.170" style="s2">small amount of people who are really</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.430" end="01:21:58.110" style="s2">good at being able to become good good</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.170" end="01:22:00.190" style="s2">coders and so what you see is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.110" end="01:22:03.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a shortage of programmers the</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.190" end="01:22:04.180" style="s2">salaries are going super high which is</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.010" end="01:22:06.490" style="s2">good if you&#39;re a programmer but what it</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.180" end="01:22:08.890" style="s2">means is for most projects is that they</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.490" end="01:22:11.050" style="s2">can&#39;t happen because the software for</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.890" end="01:22:12.340" style="s2">what they want to do is actually doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.050" end="01:22:14.290" style="s2">exist and we talked about that a little</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.340" end="01:22:15.820" style="s2">bit in sort of relationship a liminal</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.290" end="01:22:21.340" style="s2">order but it&#39;s everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.820" end="01:22:22.780" style="s2">and so so or company and so one other -</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.340" end="01:22:25.900" style="s2">wait that&#39;s one other way of talking</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.780" end="01:22:28.870" style="s2">about it is if you follow with economics</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.900" end="01:22:30.580" style="s2">at all or the stock market historically</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.870" end="01:22:33.970" style="s2">when the price of oil or energy goes up</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.580" end="01:22:35.590" style="s2">the economy does poorly because</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.970" end="01:22:37.360" style="s2">basically profits go down because the</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.590" end="01:22:40.540" style="s2">cost of making everything sort of</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.360" end="01:22:41.800" style="s2">increases and because there&#39;s no profit</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.540" end="01:22:42.850" style="s2">there&#39;s no investment new things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.800" end="01:22:44.770" style="s2">happen it&#39;s horrible</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.850" end="01:22:46.690" style="s2">I think software&#39;s like that - that</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.770" end="01:22:49.030" style="s2">basically basically the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.690" end="01:22:51.910" style="s2">software smokes is to produce is a huge</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.030" end="01:22:54.730" style="s2">sort of wet blanket on the entire human</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.910" end="01:22:57.190" style="s2">progress literally so our startups goal</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.730" end="01:22:59.200" style="s2">is to make software orders of magnitude</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.190" end="01:23:02.080" style="s2">easier to produce and so we have a</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.200" end="01:23:06.640" style="s2">technology that makes does that it for a</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.080" end="01:23:08.260" style="s2">certain array of software we we can make</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.640" end="01:23:11.410" style="s2">it a thousand times easier to produce</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.260" end="01:23:13.120" style="s2">and and that&#39;s nice for the reasons I</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.410" end="01:23:14.350" style="s2">just described but I also think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.120" end="01:23:15.610" style="s2">nice for maybe some of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.350" end="01:23:17.410" style="s2">that you know your community&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.610" end="01:23:18.880" style="s2">interested in as well which is that if</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.410" end="01:23:21.130" style="s2">you look at a lot of the dysfunction on</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.880" end="01:23:25.090" style="s2">the web today I think a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.130" end="01:23:26.500" style="s2">driven by this so you know you have four</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.090" end="01:23:28.240" style="s2">or five platforms that are really</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.500" end="01:23:30.970" style="s2">controlling the vast majority what</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.240" end="01:23:35.260" style="s2">people see or think and and and and</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.970" end="01:23:37.030" style="s2">attend to and and the reason you have</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.260" end="01:23:38.680" style="s2">that to some extent a lot of reasons but</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.030" end="01:23:40.420" style="s2">one of them is is that it&#39;s so expensive</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.680" end="01:23:43.150" style="s2">to create these platforms that no one</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.420" end="01:23:44.800" style="s2">can create an alternative that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.150" end="01:23:46.240" style="s2">unhappy with how sort of Facebook or</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.800" end="01:23:47.530" style="s2">Twitter or anybody&#39;s doing stuff to</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.240" end="01:23:51.640" style="s2">create your own version of these things</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.530" end="01:23:53.830" style="s2">is super expensive and and so if you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.640" end="01:23:56.080" style="s2">make software virtually free to create</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.830" end="01:23:59.010" style="s2">then you could have alternatives to a</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.080" end="01:23:59.010" style="s2">lot of these things and</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.300" end="01:24:03.590" style="s2">and everything will and I think in a lot</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.670" end="01:24:05.780" style="s2">of ways there&#39;ll be a lot more diversity</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.590" end="01:24:07.520" style="s2">and sort of in our tech platforms a lot</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.780" end="01:24:09.830" style="s2">more be more customized what people want</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.520" end="01:24:11.270" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of driven by top-down and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.830" end="01:24:13.430" style="s2">think that the final angle on this is</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.270" end="01:24:15.260" style="s2">that software super expensive to produce</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.430" end="01:24:17.560" style="s2">you know literally Facebook and Google</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.260" end="01:24:20.570" style="s2">spend billions of dollars on developers</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.560" end="01:24:23.870" style="s2">but at the same time people want it to</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.570" end="01:24:25.430" style="s2">be free and so the way you the way you</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.870" end="01:24:28.190" style="s2">reconcile that is you charge for</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.430" end="01:24:30.950" style="s2">advertising and that sort of gives you</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.190" end="01:24:33.380" style="s2">an economic incentive to to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.950" end="01:24:35.930" style="s2">hoard data and control people&#39;s data and</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.380" end="01:24:37.850" style="s2">and limit their experience a certain way</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.930" end="01:24:41.600" style="s2">so you can serve ads on their software</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.850" end="01:24:42.740" style="s2">so basically the so again a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.600" end="01:24:44.740" style="s2">things that we don&#39;t really think of</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.740" end="01:24:47.630" style="s2">having to do with sort of economics or</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.740" end="01:24:49.940" style="s2">or programming skills or programming</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.630" end="01:24:52.220" style="s2">development actually our problems that</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.940" end="01:24:54.260" style="s2">at least part of their cause is how</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.220" end="01:24:55.820" style="s2">expensive it is to create software so</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.260" end="01:24:57.770" style="s2">that&#39;s in a nutshell what we&#39;re doing I</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.820" end="01:24:59.030" style="s2">guess short term I mean we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.770" end="01:25:01.970" style="s2">build sort of people have your own</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.030" end="01:25:03.620" style="s2">social network or your own you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.970" end="01:25:06.440" style="s2">collaboration type software you want to</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.620" end="01:25:08.480" style="s2">create let us know or reach out to us</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.440" end="01:25:10.820" style="s2">we&#39;re happy to sort of see if you if we</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.480" end="01:25:13.010" style="s2">can help you in some way and that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.820" end="01:25:15.590" style="s2">called dry IO dried out IO that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.010" end="01:25:19.220" style="s2">and you just search for that you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.590" end="01:25:21.110" style="s2">us send so button so what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.220" end="01:25:23.120" style="s2">is that the high cost of software</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.110" end="01:25:24.800" style="s2">development is basically a drag on human</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.120" end="01:25:26.270" style="s2">development at this point in time right</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.800" end="01:25:30.470" style="s2">exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.270" end="01:25:32.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s enabled huge monopolies to take</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.470" end="01:25:35.300" style="s2">over our communication platforms or</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.960" end="01:25:38.030" style="s2">create and then control them collect</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.300" end="01:25:40.760" style="s2">data on us sell it to the highest bidder</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.030" end="01:25:43.370" style="s2">and use us basically in pawns for both</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.760" end="01:25:45.110" style="s2">their political agendas and in their</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.370" end="01:25:47.120" style="s2">money-making agendas and whatnot so</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.110" end="01:25:49.670" style="s2">basically we feel like we&#39;re free but</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.120" end="01:25:51.470" style="s2">we&#39;re also kind of trapped and and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.670" end="01:25:53.380" style="s2">in part attribute that to the high cost</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.470" end="01:25:57.110" style="s2">this was basically like a huge high</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.380" end="01:25:59.510" style="s2">barrier to entry in this market so that</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.110" end="01:26:01.160" style="s2">it keeps people out and allows these</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.510" end="01:26:02.930" style="s2">companies to make whatever decisions</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.160" end="01:26:04.970" style="s2">they want to make everybody can just</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.930" end="01:26:08.000" style="s2">scream and cry about it me for example I</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.970" end="01:26:09.290" style="s2">got banned I got banned from Twitter for</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.000" end="01:26:12.860" style="s2">using the word</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.290" end="01:26:15.230" style="s2">retard which I also then laughably saw</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.860" end="01:26:17.480" style="s2">in your piece you use the word retard</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.230" end="01:26:19.160" style="s2">but you use it in exactly the same way I</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.480" end="01:26:20.840" style="s2">used it which is to say that it was like</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.160" end="01:26:22.940" style="s2">limiting function and their limiting</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.840" end="01:26:24.830" style="s2">factor in this person&#39;s development now</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.940" end="01:26:27.140" style="s2">or in this case software development and</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.830" end="01:26:29.540" style="s2">I got banned for 12 hours from that so I</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.140" end="01:26:32.150" style="s2">know that I&#39;m like so precariously at</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.540" end="01:26:34.580" style="s2">the mercy yeah they could just on a whim</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.150" end="01:26:36.470" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m already on shadow bandless I</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.580" end="01:26:37.820" style="s2">can already see and feel the algorithmic</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.470" end="01:26:40.040" style="s2">soar manipulation</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.820" end="01:26:41.720" style="s2">there&#39;s also manual manipulation that</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.040" end="01:26:42.890" style="s2">goes on within Twitter we know that to</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.720" end="01:26:44.930" style="s2">be true</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.890" end="01:26:47.630" style="s2">and so you know I&#39;m constantly battling</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.930" end="01:26:49.850" style="s2">an uphill uphill mix my metaphors uphill</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.630" end="01:26:50.240" style="s2">wind in my face you know tailwhip I</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.850" end="01:26:52.130" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.240" end="01:26:54.770" style="s2">I&#39;m definitely father dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.130" end="01:26:57.710" style="s2">issues and and so I&#39;m sort of at their</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.770" end="01:26:59.390" style="s2">mercy but what you&#39;re saying is you have</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.710" end="01:27:00.980" style="s2">devised and I would love to know a</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.390" end="01:27:04.730" style="s2">little bit more of the how on this</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.980" end="01:27:08.570" style="s2">because it sounds like like a fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.730" end="01:27:10.670" style="s2">right like how were you able to create a</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.570" end="01:27:13.790" style="s2">system that can help people create an</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.670" end="01:27:15.530" style="s2">array of software you say that is going</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.790" end="01:27:17.810" style="s2">to they&#39;re gonna be able to build it and</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.530" end="01:27:21.260" style="s2">customize it and play it at a much</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.810" end="01:27:23.780" style="s2">faster rate one that would be on par of</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.260" end="01:27:25.610" style="s2">taking did you give me this example</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.780" end="01:27:27.590" style="s2">before but of taking the price of oil</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.610" end="01:27:30.200" style="s2">from ten thousand down to ten dollars</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.590" end="01:27:33.230" style="s2">and would really pump up all of our</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.200" end="01:27:36.110" style="s2">outcomes here like a do I haven&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.230" end="01:27:37.580" style="s2">right and be how do you how do you do</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.110" end="01:27:38.230" style="s2">that sorry yeah that&#39;s correct that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.580" end="01:27:40.790" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.230" end="01:27:42.560" style="s2">so there&#39;s two ways of thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.790" end="01:27:43.820" style="s2">how we do it I mean sort of one is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.560" end="01:27:45.920" style="s2">very high-level way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.820" end="01:27:48.320" style="s2">but uh you know you could look at sort</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.920" end="01:27:49.850" style="s2">of what does a computer programmer do</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.320" end="01:27:52.280" style="s2">right they basically have a normal</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.850" end="01:27:54.230" style="s2">person who&#39;s not a programmer say you</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.280" end="01:27:55.640" style="s2">know I want my software to do XYZ and</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.230" end="01:27:57.830" style="s2">they say that say in English right a</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.640" end="01:28:02.090" style="s2">natural human language and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.830" end="01:28:03.980" style="s2">the computer which you know has a</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.090" end="01:28:05.930" style="s2">computer language where you need to tell</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.980" end="01:28:07.580" style="s2">it to do stuff and so what really what</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.930" end="01:28:09.380" style="s2">the programmer does in some sense is</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.580" end="01:28:11.780" style="s2">translate from human language to</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.380" end="01:28:13.910" style="s2">computer language and it turns out</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.780" end="01:28:15.890" style="s2">that&#39;s something that sort of you and I</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.910" end="01:28:18.920" style="s2">can talk about I can describe an app for</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.890" end="01:28:22.100" style="s2">you in ten minutes it would take that</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.920" end="01:28:23.090" style="s2">same app it took to actually implement</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.100" end="01:28:25.400" style="s2">that up in a computer</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.090" end="01:28:26.960" style="s2">can take literally tens or hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.400" end="01:28:29.090" style="s2">thousands of pages of code it can take</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.960" end="01:28:32.659" style="s2">literally person months of effort to do</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.090" end="01:28:35.809" style="s2">and so if you could automate that</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.659" end="01:28:38.599" style="s2">translation process then you can make</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.809" end="01:28:40.760" style="s2">programming faster and so that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.599" end="01:28:42.590" style="s2">we&#39;re not there yet that would be the</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.760" end="01:28:44.150" style="s2">ideal I just talked to the I just talked</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.590" end="01:28:45.770" style="s2">for 10 minutes and suddenly my software</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.150" end="01:28:47.119" style="s2">is created but we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.770" end="01:28:49.550" style="s2">created sort of a way of describing</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.119" end="01:28:51.050" style="s2">software that&#39;s sort of a lot simpler</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.550" end="01:28:52.340" style="s2">closer about humans think of software</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.050" end="01:28:54.500" style="s2">than how computers think of software</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.340" end="01:28:58.750" style="s2">that lets you sort of describe your</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.500" end="01:29:00.949" style="s2">software very simply and that actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.750" end="01:29:03.710" style="s2">and we have a way of converting that</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.949" end="01:29:05.630" style="s2">into actually running software and that</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.710" end="01:29:07.699" style="s2">makes things faster I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.630" end="01:29:10.309" style="s2">last part that&#39;s that&#39;s the secret sauce</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.699" end="01:29:13.159" style="s2">we have a way of converting that into</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.309" end="01:29:16.159" style="s2">ways that machines can understand does</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.159" end="01:29:17.960" style="s2">this does this draw I presumably on you</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.159" end="01:29:19.909" style="s2">know the work that you&#39;ve started at MIT</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.960" end="01:29:22.190" style="s2">and then worked on that where were you</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.909" end="01:29:24.050" style="s2">at Rensselaer or things right and then</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.190" end="01:29:27.020" style="s2">is this is this part of your career</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.050" end="01:29:29.179" style="s2">trajectory or is this a off branch is</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.020" end="01:29:30.949" style="s2">this a u-turn what is this now it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.179" end="01:29:32.510" style="s2">of my career trajectory I guess I</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.949" end="01:29:34.699" style="s2">developed this theory called the</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.510" end="01:29:37.699" style="s2">cognitive substrate and the basic idea</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.699" end="01:29:39.800" style="s2">there is if if you look at you know what</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.699" end="01:29:41.630" style="s2">we evolved say 50 or 200,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.800" end="01:29:43.340" style="s2">as humans right that&#39;s when we the last</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.630" end="01:29:47.389" style="s2">sort of major step in human evolution</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.340" end="01:29:49.309" style="s2">where we came Homo sapiens sapiens there</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.389" end="01:29:50.989" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been much that&#39;s changed since</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.309" end="01:29:52.849" style="s2">then evolution is much slower than that</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.989" end="01:29:55.190" style="s2">so we have and if you look at what we</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.849" end="01:29:57.280" style="s2">were doing 200,000 years ago we were</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.190" end="01:29:58.909" style="s2">basically running around being you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.280" end="01:30:02.480" style="s2">manipulating the physical world</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.909" end="01:30:05.030" style="s2">organizing in small groups and our</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.480" end="01:30:06.170" style="s2">brains evolved for that so our brains</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.030" end="01:30:08.869" style="s2">are not evolved to think about</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.170" end="01:30:10.909" style="s2">Parliament&#39;s or elections or stock</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.869" end="01:30:12.199" style="s2">markets or option prices or all the</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.909" end="01:30:14.929" style="s2">things we think of our computers or</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.199" end="01:30:17.260" style="s2">anything that we think of most of</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.929" end="01:30:19.940" style="s2">anything we think about now so whatever</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.260" end="01:30:22.309" style="s2">so all these sort of billions of things</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.940" end="01:30:24.670" style="s2">people think about now really must be</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.309" end="01:30:27.980" style="s2">sort of running on machinery that was</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.670" end="01:30:30.380" style="s2">built for a small number of things that</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.980" end="01:30:33.110" style="s2">we cared about one or two hundred</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.380" end="01:30:35.059" style="s2">thousand years ago and so figuring out</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.110" end="01:30:36.590" style="s2">what&#39;s that core sort of operating</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.059" end="01:30:37.460" style="s2">system or what&#39;s the core sort of</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.590" end="01:30:38.989" style="s2">substrate</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.460" end="01:30:41.570" style="s2">mechanisms that sort of enable</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.989" end="01:30:43.400" style="s2">everything else to sort of happen is</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.570" end="01:30:45.080" style="s2">sort of what my whole career has been</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.400" end="01:30:48.800" style="s2">about sort of identifying what the score</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.080" end="01:30:50.239" style="s2">is and then implementing it and so in</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.800" end="01:30:52.850" style="s2">the sense what we&#39;re doing right now is</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.239" end="01:30:56.300" style="s2">identifying that core for computer</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.850" end="01:30:57.650" style="s2">programming for software and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.300" end="01:30:58.910" style="s2">finding a way to implement that so</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.650" end="01:31:06.950" style="s2">people can leverage that to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.910" end="01:31:08.330" style="s2">write their own software okay let me</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.950" end="01:31:11.690" style="s2">make it a little bit more concrete</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.330" end="01:31:13.190" style="s2">so look yeah to find for me one of my</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.690" end="01:31:15.950" style="s2">questions I had pleased to find</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.190" end="01:31:17.690" style="s2">cognitive substrate I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.950" end="01:31:19.370" style="s2">would I would like that and then you</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.690" end="01:31:20.330" style="s2">know any other further example that you</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.370" end="01:31:23.390" style="s2">have I mean you explained it very well</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.330" end="01:31:26.239" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s a profound thought you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.390" end="01:31:28.160" style="s2">been working on this for your career I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.239" end="01:31:30.800" style="s2">trying to process it right now school so</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.160" end="01:31:32.540" style="s2">work with me absolutely so so you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.800" end="01:31:34.460" style="s2">you 200,000 years ago you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.540" end="01:31:37.219" style="s2">wherever people have evolved to 1,000</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.460" end="01:31:39.680" style="s2">years ago and you know what are you</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.219" end="01:31:41.620" style="s2">doing let&#39;s say when you&#39;re a big part</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.680" end="01:31:44.360" style="s2">of your brain say was a fall for</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.620" end="01:31:47.330" style="s2">tracking some animal because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.360" end="01:31:51.290" style="s2">hunting it right and so that involves</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.330" end="01:31:54.440" style="s2">having really good capabilities for you</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.290" end="01:31:56.960" style="s2">know cause this sort of sort of memory</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.440" end="01:31:58.310" style="s2">of where something was for being able to</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.960" end="01:32:01.430" style="s2">predict where it&#39;s going to be in you</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.310" end="01:32:02.930" style="s2">know the next minute it involves</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.430" end="01:32:04.580" style="s2">basically being able to recognize</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.930" end="01:32:06.890" style="s2">objects and separate them from their</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.580" end="01:32:09.500" style="s2">background it involves some knowledge of</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.890" end="01:32:12.620" style="s2">time like if this happened before that</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.500" end="01:32:15.440" style="s2">it involves cause and effect like if I I</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.620" end="01:32:17.510" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I if I hit something with</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.440" end="01:32:19.030" style="s2">a spear it&#39;s gonna it&#39;s gonna select</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.510" end="01:32:21.650" style="s2">fall down and therefore I could eat it</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.030" end="01:32:23.750" style="s2">so there are these primitive mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.650" end="01:32:28.130" style="s2">cause and effect time categorizations</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.750" end="01:32:30.200" style="s2">and other ones so categorizing where</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.130" end="01:32:33.410" style="s2">things are what things are and how they</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.200" end="01:32:35.810" style="s2">behave and so there are all those sort</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.410" end="01:32:37.610" style="s2">of mental mechanisms we have for those</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.810" end="01:32:40.460" style="s2">things and I&#39;d say there&#39;s 10 or 20 of</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.610" end="01:32:42.170" style="s2">those whatever they are and the the</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.460" end="01:32:44.330" style="s2">trick is those evolved just for those</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.170" end="01:32:46.250" style="s2">narrow circumstances but whatever we do</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.330" end="01:32:48.920" style="s2">now to think about stock options or</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.250" end="01:32:50.510" style="s2">Parliament&#39;s or or whatever are using</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.920" end="01:32:54.020" style="s2">just those same 10 mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.510" end="01:32:56.660" style="s2">I&#39;m great okay yeah I got that okay so</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.020" end="01:32:59.239" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re woefully ill-equipped to</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.660" end="01:33:01.550" style="s2">deal with the complexity of the world</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.239" end="01:33:02.900" style="s2">around us today yeah yeah and the other</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.550" end="01:33:04.489" style="s2">way of looking at is we kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.900" end="01:33:08.210" style="s2">stuff the world we have around us into</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.489" end="01:33:09.739" style="s2">that sort of paradigm so one example is</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.210" end="01:33:13.610" style="s2">this like here&#39;s a here&#39;s an example</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.739" end="01:33:16.280" style="s2">like let&#39;s say I&#39;m on a bank or some</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.610" end="01:33:18.050" style="s2">sort and I&#39;m taking money and I&#39;m giving</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.280" end="01:33:21.500" style="s2">it from company a to Company B right so</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.050" end="01:33:24.890" style="s2">I&#39;m taking you know let&#39;s say GM is</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.500" end="01:33:27.380" style="s2">paying who makes tires I forget</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.890" end="01:33:29.120" style="s2">Firestone exactly they&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.380" end="01:33:33.050" style="s2">Firestone save a hundred million dollars</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.120" end="01:33:35.450" style="s2">to buy some money well it turns out that</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.050" end="01:33:37.640" style="s2">in our so we think of that money is</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.450" end="01:33:39.320" style="s2">moving from point A to point B and we</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.640" end="01:33:40.820" style="s2">use the same part even though that money</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.320" end="01:33:42.920" style="s2">really is just all electronically might</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.820" end="01:33:45.110" style="s2">even be it&#39;s nowhere it&#39;s like in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.920" end="01:33:47.090" style="s2">cloud somewhere it&#39;s it&#39;s in some</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.110" end="01:33:49.370" style="s2">database somewhere the way we think</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.090" end="01:33:51.320" style="s2">about it in our head is like X moving</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.370" end="01:33:53.900" style="s2">from physical location it&#39;s like moving</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.320" end="01:33:56.510" style="s2">sort of a basketball from court a to</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.900" end="01:33:59.270" style="s2">court B right it&#39;s that we so that&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.510" end="01:34:01.340" style="s2">use those kinds of same mechanisms to to</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.270" end="01:34:04.730" style="s2">to think about sort of more abstract</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.340" end="01:34:06.710" style="s2">things that&#39;s yeah and now and how is</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.730" end="01:34:10.010" style="s2">that applying to your work here with dry</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.710" end="01:34:12.530" style="s2">eye oh sure so so it turns out that</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.010" end="01:34:14.720" style="s2">there&#39;s like five or ten things that you</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.530" end="01:34:16.700" style="s2">could look at and say those are core</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.720" end="01:34:17.750" style="s2">processes that happen in all software so</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.700" end="01:34:20.660" style="s2">one simple example would be</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.750" end="01:34:23.390" style="s2">categorization so if you think of for</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.660" end="01:34:25.220" style="s2">example email you had folders and email</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.390" end="01:34:26.900" style="s2">right so you that it&#39;s really or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.220" end="01:34:28.940" style="s2">really a way of categorizing your emails</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.900" end="01:34:31.550" style="s2">right if you look at something like</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.940" end="01:34:33.170" style="s2">slack you know which is a chat a channel</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.550" end="01:34:34.130" style="s2">a chat system I know you guys use</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.170" end="01:34:36.040" style="s2">something else but you know but I think</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.130" end="01:34:38.810" style="s2">most people are familiar with slack</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.040" end="01:34:40.340" style="s2">basically there&#39;s channels and you can</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.810" end="01:34:43.880" style="s2">look at channels is another way of just</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.340" end="01:34:46.220" style="s2">categorizing you know it&#39;s categorizing</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.880" end="01:34:48.440" style="s2">your messages if I have a channel on in</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.220" end="01:34:50.450" style="s2">my in my ski club and I have a channel</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.440" end="01:34:51.860" style="s2">on skis another channel on slopes or</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.450" end="01:34:53.750" style="s2">something like that I you know that</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.860" end="01:34:57.980" style="s2">they&#39;re categorizing your messages if</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.750" end="01:34:59.450" style="s2">you look at something like folders in</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.980" end="01:34:59.930" style="s2">sort of your operating system on your</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.450" end="01:35:03.140" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.930" end="01:35:04.280" style="s2">those are ways of categorizing files so</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.140" end="01:35:07.460" style="s2">this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.280" end="01:35:09.080" style="s2">at aghori a folder shows up actually</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.460" end="01:35:11.990" style="s2">everywhere and in all and almost all</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.080" end="01:35:13.730" style="s2">kinds of in done self-driving cars but</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.990" end="01:35:15.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s like huge amount of software we</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.730" end="01:35:17.720" style="s2">get this notion of categorization and</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.200" end="01:35:20.450" style="s2">shows up in different ways another</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.720" end="01:35:22.070" style="s2">example of that is search right so you</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.450" end="01:35:25.250" style="s2">could look at basically your email inbox</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.070" end="01:35:27.470" style="s2">is just sort of sort of like a search</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.250" end="01:35:30.740" style="s2">result for showing me like you know show</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.470" end="01:35:34.160" style="s2">me all my emails sorted by time right</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.740" end="01:35:36.140" style="s2">you could look at your facebook stream</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.160" end="01:35:38.630" style="s2">as sort of another search result like</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.140" end="01:35:42.740" style="s2">show me all Facebook posts posted by my</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.630" end="01:35:44.090" style="s2">friends sorted by time said and I could</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.740" end="01:35:45.740" style="s2">go on about other piece of software like</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.090" end="01:35:47.810" style="s2">that so there&#39;s these core ideas like</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.740" end="01:35:49.700" style="s2">search categorization and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.810" end="01:35:51.410" style="s2">handful of other ones like that that</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.700" end="01:35:55.490" style="s2">actually underlie all of software</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.410" end="01:35:57.410" style="s2">another one is permissioning so back in</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.490" end="01:35:59.120" style="s2">nature you know a big thing is who who</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.410" end="01:36:00.410" style="s2">who controlled what fruit who was</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.120" end="01:36:02.930" style="s2">married to whom you know who was mating</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.410" end="01:36:05.930" style="s2">with whom and who controlled what piece</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.930" end="01:36:07.580" style="s2">of land so in data and software that</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.930" end="01:36:10.190" style="s2">kind of access is an important thing</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.580" end="01:36:11.570" style="s2">that happens a lot too so email for</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.190" end="01:36:13.430" style="s2">example Facebook&#39;s like another good</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.570" end="01:36:15.740" style="s2">example so classically in facebook you</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.430" end="01:36:18.530" style="s2">can see a message you have access to it</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.740" end="01:36:20.780" style="s2">basically if you posted it or if a</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.530" end="01:36:23.300" style="s2">friend of you&#39;re supposed to it in</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.780" end="01:36:26.510" style="s2">Twitter anybody could see any message at</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.300" end="01:36:29.930" style="s2">least on a private on a public feed in</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.510" end="01:36:32.140" style="s2">an email you can see a message only if</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.930" end="01:36:35.780" style="s2">you sent it your asunder a receiver in</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.140" end="01:36:37.640" style="s2">and slack you can see a message only if</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.780" end="01:36:39.620" style="s2">you remember the channel it was in so</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.640" end="01:36:41.720" style="s2">there&#39;s these sort of I can describe</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.620" end="01:36:43.420" style="s2">them in one or two sentences these sort</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.720" end="01:36:46.550" style="s2">of what I would call permission rules</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.420" end="01:36:48.470" style="s2">and it turns out to implement them takes</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.550" end="01:36:50.300" style="s2">can take hundreds of thousands of pages</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.470" end="01:36:52.520" style="s2">of code but I can describe them one or</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.300" end="01:36:55.310" style="s2">two sentences and @na it in the apply to</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.520" end="01:36:58.190" style="s2">all software so so basically it turns</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.310" end="01:36:59.750" style="s2">out if a if I if I if I if you give me</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.190" end="01:37:01.010" style="s2">sort of your data model like what what</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.750" end="01:37:03.290" style="s2">objects do you care about you give me</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.010" end="01:37:07.130" style="s2">permission rules you give me some some</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.290" end="01:37:09.020" style="s2">views of how you want to see it then a</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.130" end="01:37:10.610" style="s2">small number of things like that are</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.020" end="01:37:15.860" style="s2">enough to characterize what all software</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.610" end="01:37:17.350" style="s2">does so yeah but are you are you let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.860" end="01:37:20.980" style="s2">say today if you want to develop</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.350" end="01:37:23.530" style="s2">you know Product X it takes $100,000 are</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.980" end="01:37:25.150" style="s2">you taking like 99 thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.530" end="01:37:27.070" style="s2">worth of work and just doing it all your</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.150" end="01:37:29.020" style="s2">damn self and making and having your</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.070" end="01:37:31.420" style="s2">client do a thousand a thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.020" end="01:37:34.150" style="s2">worth of work or are you actually making</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.420" end="01:37:36.100" style="s2">it so that you only have to do a</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.150" end="01:37:37.450" style="s2">thousand dollars worth of work and the</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.100" end="01:37:38.950" style="s2">client only has to do a thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.450" end="01:37:40.420" style="s2">worth of work and all of a sudden it</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.950" end="01:37:42.790" style="s2">only costs two thousand seven hundred</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.420" end="01:37:45.220" style="s2">thousand do you do you understand are</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.790" end="01:37:48.220" style="s2">you just taking on more responsibilities</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.220" end="01:37:50.320" style="s2">on the front end or are whereas the</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.220" end="01:37:53.280" style="s2">total amount of Labor is still the same</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.320" end="01:37:55.240" style="s2">or is your year process you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.280" end="01:37:58.270" style="s2">reducing the amount of Labor required</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.240" end="01:38:00.670" style="s2">overall yeah the amount of labor is</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.270" end="01:38:02.230" style="s2">reduced overall absolutely the name so</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.670" end="01:38:04.810" style="s2">the name of our company is a dried out I</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.230" end="01:38:06.820" style="s2">oh and and dry stands for don&#39;t repeat</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.810" end="01:38:09.250" style="s2">yourself which is a very common sort of</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.820" end="01:38:11.410" style="s2">expression for programmers and it turns</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.250" end="01:38:12.070" style="s2">out that everybody is always rebuilding</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.410" end="01:38:14.740" style="s2">the same things</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.070" end="01:38:15.880" style="s2">so this permissions stuff everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.740" end="01:38:19.540" style="s2">building their own version of it the</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.880" end="01:38:22.660" style="s2">search stuff the the folder stuff and so</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.540" end="01:38:23.770" style="s2">it you know is so it&#39;d be great if you</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.660" end="01:38:25.630" style="s2">could just build it into one platform</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.770" end="01:38:27.970" style="s2">and everybody could use it the reason</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.630" end="01:38:29.260" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t happened so far is because</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.970" end="01:38:31.300" style="s2">it&#39;s different for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.260" end="01:38:33.850" style="s2">and so adapting it to everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.300" end="01:38:35.320" style="s2">specific needs has been no one&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.850" end="01:38:37.960" style="s2">know how to do that sort of quickly it</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.320" end="01:38:39.910" style="s2">we found a way to do it quickly</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.960" end="01:38:41.830" style="s2">oh that&#39;s that sounds like the very</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.910" end="01:38:43.410" style="s2">important part that&#39;s the part you</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.830" end="01:38:46.570" style="s2">should probably keep under lock and key</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.410" end="01:38:47.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s a sounds really fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.570" end="01:38:50.200" style="s2">to me based on everything that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.800" end="01:38:52.480" style="s2">talked about I mean if we could reduce</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.200" end="01:38:54.730" style="s2">some of the barriers to entry into these</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.480" end="01:38:56.280" style="s2">markets reduce the friction involved in</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.730" end="01:39:01.270" style="s2">trying to get something new produced</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.280" end="01:39:02.770" style="s2">reduce the the inter platform headaches</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.270" end="01:39:05.140" style="s2">and nonsense that I have to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.770" end="01:39:06.820" style="s2">sometimes I could see how that would</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.140" end="01:39:09.040" style="s2">open up greater efficiencies for more</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.820" end="01:39:11.410" style="s2">communication and more innovation hella</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.040" end="01:39:13.120" style="s2">could even open up greater avenues for</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.410" end="01:39:15.310" style="s2">empathy and human understanding for</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.120" end="01:39:17.770" style="s2">other people so personally from the</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.310" end="01:39:19.630" style="s2">perspective of the liminal order that</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.770" end="01:39:22.660" style="s2">sounds all very super interesting to us</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.630" end="01:39:25.630" style="s2">and I can&#39;t wait to see how you guys</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.660" end="01:39:27.520" style="s2">move along like where would you consider</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.630" end="01:39:29.210" style="s2">you got yourselves in the in the process</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.520" end="01:39:32.750" style="s2">in terms of creating a new</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.210" end="01:39:34.760" style="s2">company we have a prototype and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.750" end="01:39:36.290" style="s2">gradually in the position now we&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.760" end="01:39:38.210" style="s2">cusp of moving if to something from a</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.290" end="01:39:40.400" style="s2">prototype to something people can use so</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.210" end="01:39:42.140" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to look for early users</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.400" end="01:39:44.060" style="s2">basically early people who have a</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.140" end="01:39:46.100" style="s2">community say like yours who might want</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.060" end="01:39:49.520" style="s2">to use develop special software for it</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.100" end="01:39:51.410" style="s2">and and you know very common use cases</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.520" end="01:39:53.240" style="s2">would be you have your own social</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.410" end="01:40:00.140" style="s2">network you want to build your own sort</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.240" end="01:40:02.150" style="s2">of messaging platform your own forums so</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.140" end="01:40:04.520" style="s2">anything like that we&#39;re happy to sort</p>
