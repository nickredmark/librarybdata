<p begin="00:00:04.110" end="00:00:09.660" style="s2">something about wanting to go deep about</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.940" end="00:00:13.259" style="s2">something or high about something some</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.660" end="00:00:15.509" style="s2">kind of meta conversation or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.259" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">know IIIi didn&#39;t understand what you</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.509" end="00:00:24.930" style="s2">mean I want to talk about I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">about as a starting point I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.930" end="00:00:32.969" style="s2">about this notion so I&#39;ve been reading</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:36.750" style="s2">it oh yes therefore again me not to read</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.969" end="00:00:38.579" style="s2">I don&#39;t know whether or not the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.750" end="00:00:42.030" style="s2">recommended or not it&#39;s this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.579" end="00:00:43.320" style="s2">intense shooting so tripper it&#39;s a he</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.030" end="00:00:45.300" style="s2">was definitely a tripper and he</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.320" end="00:00:47.610" style="s2">definitely does circumcircle ambulate</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.300" end="00:00:51.149" style="s2">right it goes around and around</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.610" end="00:00:53.340" style="s2">something right and it does something</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.149" end="00:00:57.090" style="s2">does kind of like start to pop up after</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.340" end="00:00:59.219" style="s2">a while but it&#39;s tough gone um but I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.090" end="00:01:03.420" style="s2">thinking about like just this whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.219" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">thing about the this notion that he has</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.420" end="00:01:12.869" style="s2">of like that the cell exists across four</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:15.680" style="s2">dimensions and then speaks to you with</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.869" end="00:01:18.049" style="s2">your conscience and your intuition but</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.680" end="00:01:22.290" style="s2">which kind of presupposes some</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.049" end="00:01:25.049" style="s2">directionality or an ideal which get set</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.290" end="00:01:26.520" style="s2">the thing about the and again it gets</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:28.409" style="s2">the thing about the eyes and how the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:30.840" style="s2">eyes move and that they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.409" end="00:01:35.159" style="s2">forward-facing and the whole thing about</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.840" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">language and hitting the mark but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.159" end="00:01:41.220" style="s2">like the question I have is like what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:46.259" style="s2">that that what is it that that knows to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.220" end="00:01:51.390" style="s2">do that I talked about that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.259" end="00:02:04.170" style="s2">pretty cool well over are we recording</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.390" end="00:02:06.860" style="s2">yeah sure yes we are okay cool well so</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.170" end="00:02:06.860" style="s2">what are you thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.550" end="00:02:21.480" style="s2">it&#39;s let&#39;s see let&#39;s see if I can lay it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.230" end="00:02:23.920" style="s2">lay it out a little bit about about a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.480" end="00:02:25.030" style="s2">bunch of different things basically I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.920" end="00:02:28.090" style="s2">been thinking about a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.030" end="00:02:30.570" style="s2">things but meit&#39;s a lot of my thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.090" end="00:02:35.050" style="s2">have just been kind of circling around</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.570" end="00:02:39.790" style="s2">again and again this this notion or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.050" end="00:02:42.220" style="s2">idea of the individual and especially it</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.790" end="00:02:45.100" style="s2">it&#39;s actually in listening code Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.220" end="00:02:48.550" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s talks especially the last two</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.100" end="00:02:49.989" style="s2">or three have just been awesome I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.550" end="00:02:52.300" style="s2">that I think they&#39;ve been in like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.989" end="00:02:55.989" style="s2">totally different like a very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.300" end="00:03:01.500" style="s2">different level but I like the way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.989" end="00:03:06.130" style="s2">he elucidates Young&#39;s notion of the self</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.500" end="00:03:07.870" style="s2">it makes so much sense and I it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.130" end="00:03:11.260" style="s2">actually having me inspired to go back</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.870" end="00:03:20.890" style="s2">and read and turn to tackle this one</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.260" end="00:03:25.299" style="s2">just look at yeah I am this list but</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.890" end="00:03:28.470" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s saying when the way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.299" end="00:03:32.500" style="s2">Peterson describes the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.470" end="00:03:35.260" style="s2">underlying assumptions of your own have</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.500" end="00:03:37.780" style="s2">it does have it does it does help me in</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.260" end="00:03:41.560" style="s2">a reading reading the more complex stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.780" end="00:03:43.090" style="s2">that he writes like this but the see if</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.560" end="00:03:45.310" style="s2">I can put I can lay it out as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.090" end="00:03:48.130" style="s2">understand it it&#39;s like the yummie and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.310" end="00:03:51.239" style="s2">idea or young&#39;s idea of the self is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.130" end="00:03:52.390" style="s2">it existed it is existent four</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.239" end="00:03:58.269" style="s2">dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.390" end="00:04:04.090" style="s2">and part of the South is in the present</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.269" end="00:04:07.980" style="s2">moment and that that the the South as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.090" end="00:04:11.980" style="s2">whole right you could say like the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.980" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">is you could say it&#39;s in the future and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.980" end="00:04:20.750" style="s2">beckons to us in the present via our</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:23.810" style="s2">conscience and our interest that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.750" end="00:04:26.570" style="s2">like what is it that it&#39;s calls your</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.810" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">attention forward and seizes your</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.570" end="00:04:35.150" style="s2">interest and that basically the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.960" end="00:04:38.210" style="s2">development of character or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.150" end="00:04:42.920" style="s2">individuation process is from Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.210" end="00:04:45.230" style="s2">kind of motion is to continually make</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.920" end="00:04:52.760" style="s2">choices and decisions and follow your</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.230" end="00:04:55.790" style="s2">interest and over time make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.760" end="00:04:58.130" style="s2">in your life and you begin to build</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.790" end="00:05:01.010" style="s2">character and morality and make ethical</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.130" end="00:05:04.340" style="s2">choices but the ethics and the morality</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.010" end="00:05:07.340" style="s2">or the conscience or what draws your</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.340" end="00:05:10.610" style="s2">interest to it is in some sense who you</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.340" end="00:05:13.160" style="s2">would be if all like you can say is is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.610" end="00:05:15.610" style="s2">if all of your switches were turned on</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.160" end="00:05:18.290" style="s2">and all of your software or realized</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.610" end="00:05:20.450" style="s2">that that&#39;s somehow and this is like</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.290" end="00:05:23.870" style="s2">fascinating to me is that somehow being</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.450" end="00:05:27.050" style="s2">a self this idea of being a self or an</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.870" end="00:05:31.970" style="s2">individual that there is this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.050" end="00:05:35.600" style="s2">does call us forward right we know to</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.970" end="00:05:36.830" style="s2">pay attention to certain things as</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">important and other things that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.830" end="00:05:42.200" style="s2">important and I think that to a large</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:43.640" style="s2">degree a lot of that stuff is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.200" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">the content of that is given by a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.640" end="00:05:50.229" style="s2">culture but that we know how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">that we know to attend to something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.229" end="00:05:57.040" style="s2">we know to value one thing over over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:59.810" style="s2">over the next seems to be much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.040" end="00:06:01.580" style="s2">and much older than just something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.810" end="00:06:03.470" style="s2">you can kind of acquire like software</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.580" end="00:06:06.530" style="s2">through culture seem to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.470" end="00:06:09.620" style="s2">bottom-up and I think that Jung&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.530" end="00:06:12.229" style="s2">was that is it the more that you can get</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.620" end="00:06:20.270" style="s2">in touch with that greater self right</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.229" end="00:06:22.580" style="s2">the more the more individualized will</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.270" end="00:06:24.470" style="s2">become right the more that you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.580" end="00:06:27.500" style="s2">listen to your conscience and listen to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.470" end="00:06:30.110" style="s2">the things that bug you and give your</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.500" end="00:06:32.370" style="s2">give your attention over to things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.110" end="00:06:34.830" style="s2">interest you in sees and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.370" end="00:06:36.419" style="s2">easier attention it the more that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.830" end="00:06:38.940" style="s2">can do that in other words the more you</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.419" end="00:06:41.070" style="s2">can be yourself the more yourself will</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.940" end="00:06:44.790" style="s2">manifest or the more the whole of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.070" end="00:06:46.350" style="s2">suckle will make itself known so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.790" end="00:06:51.810" style="s2">started it see what you thought about</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.350" end="00:07:00.750" style="s2">that okay so to prompt you say a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.810" end="00:07:03.270" style="s2">bit more the individual and the self so</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.750" end="00:07:08.550" style="s2">what I sort of heard you say is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.270" end="00:07:10.710" style="s2">that the more the self audience towards</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.550" end="00:07:13.620" style="s2">the ideal the more it becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.710" end="00:07:15.090" style="s2">individual so I&#39;m curious like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.620" end="00:07:21.389" style="s2">the difference between an individual and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.090" end="00:07:27.960" style="s2">the self so um what I think you and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.389" end="00:07:34.470" style="s2">would say is it the South is is the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.960" end="00:07:38.130" style="s2">south is is much older than you is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.470" end="00:07:40.620" style="s2">it has a deep structure and then one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.130" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">the ways that you can notice or or</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.620" end="00:07:45.900" style="s2">notice the evidence of that structure I</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:47.520" style="s2">think he would say first is biological I</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.900" end="00:07:49.590" style="s2">think the way he would put it is it like</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.520" end="00:07:51.930" style="s2">it arises through biology there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.590" end="00:07:54.810" style="s2">these basic kind of tensions I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.930" end="00:07:57.090" style="s2">even know if I can quite you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.810" end="00:07:59.220" style="s2">pretty deep to come to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.090" end="00:08:01.710" style="s2">but but basically you know through play</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.220" end="00:08:05.669" style="s2">biology and then when we begin to use</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.710" end="00:08:11.910" style="s2">language that the the basic structures</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.669" end="00:08:14.340" style="s2">of language you can say arise from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.910" end="00:08:18.000" style="s2">collective unconscious or from like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.340" end="00:08:20.250" style="s2">deeper and deeper fundamental biology</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.000" end="00:08:23.940" style="s2">and that you can see evidence of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.250" end="00:08:27.960" style="s2">through myth and folklore and through</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.940" end="00:08:31.459" style="s2">stories that you know for example you</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.960" end="00:08:34.409" style="s2">know the resurrection is like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.459" end="00:08:36.390" style="s2">that&#39;s the motif but like a mythic motif</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.409" end="00:08:39.419" style="s2">that clegg exists across almost all</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.390" end="00:08:42.329" style="s2">religion this notion of sacrifice right</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.419" end="00:08:44.339" style="s2">and like you have to die to something</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.329" end="00:08:45.990" style="s2">you have to die to something greater</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.199" end="00:11:09.629" style="s2">that back and forth dance is if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.159" end="00:11:12.449" style="s2">think about it what we&#39;re doing</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.129" end="00:11:37.109" style="s2">then can abstract itself out and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.009" end="00:11:39.179" style="s2">ply itself back to its own abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.109" end="00:11:42.809" style="s2">and then and relate to that called</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.779" end="00:11:49.949" style="s2">then rehearse things over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:52.679" style="s2">over and over and over again that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.949" end="00:11:55.289" style="s2">movement of rehearsing things what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.679" end="00:11:58.499" style="s2">movement to do something that they gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.289" end="00:12:01.529" style="s2">us to something greater or to move</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.759" end="00:12:17.189" style="s2">process that whole movement ism is you</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.059" end="00:12:20.179" style="s2">working out moral and ethical dilemmas</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.189" end="00:12:22.919" style="s2">that aren&#39;t exactly obvious but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.179" end="00:12:24.989" style="s2">but that particular attention I think is</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.919" end="00:12:26.789" style="s2">is what you&#39;re just kind of talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.989" end="00:12:29.249" style="s2">about with it and that when you give</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.789" end="00:12:32.789" style="s2">yourself to that the more that you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.249" end="00:12:35.279" style="s2">give yourself to the ideal or recognize</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.789" end="00:12:38.399" style="s2">the ideal within your own consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.279" end="00:12:42.799" style="s2">within your own urges right in what</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.399" end="00:12:42.799" style="s2">messes with you and what interests you</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.429" end="00:12:48.539" style="s2">that over time that your life starts to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.889" end="00:12:51.629" style="s2">become you get this sense of your life</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.539" end="00:12:53.009" style="s2">being kind of lived or connected to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.629" end="00:12:55.829" style="s2">something much greater than yourself</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.009" end="00:13:02.249" style="s2">which gives a lot of meaning whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.829" end="00:13:05.699" style="s2">you are that&#39;s my understanding ever and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.249" end="00:13:07.829" style="s2">again to explore so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.699" end="00:13:11.470" style="s2">you started off is like that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.829" end="00:13:19.840" style="s2">that right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.470" end="00:13:22.600" style="s2">Wow and what is it that does that so so</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.840" end="00:13:27.040" style="s2">again to inquire a little deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.600" end="00:13:33.040" style="s2">into what you&#39;re saying so the self you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:37.480" style="s2">could say is a set of constraints</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.040" end="00:13:41.650" style="s2">desires urges archetypes that has a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.480" end="00:13:45.490" style="s2">sense of this higher deeper further more</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.650" end="00:13:49.240" style="s2">true more beautiful thing called an</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.490" end="00:13:51.190" style="s2">ideal or an ideal self but it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.240" end="00:13:55.590" style="s2">there&#39;s something in the self that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.190" end="00:13:58.540" style="s2">recognizes better yeah more beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.590" end="00:14:01.330" style="s2">right and in moving towards that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.540" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">confronted with the series of ethical</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.330" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">moral dilemmas you might also say</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.270" end="00:14:09.820" style="s2">metaphysical dilemma this</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.720" end="00:14:13.810" style="s2">epistemological dilemmas political</p>

<p begin="00:14:18.340" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">to achieve a greater expression of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.470" end="00:14:34.650" style="s2">ideal the self uses these archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:38.550" style="s2">uses thought in mind in order to</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.650" end="00:14:43.840" style="s2">envision a set of possibilities worlds</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.550" end="00:14:46.600" style="s2">choices in a simmer Acula some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.840" end="00:14:48.310" style="s2">mental world or projection and then it</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.600" end="00:14:50.710" style="s2">then plays with this projection to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.310" end="00:14:53.950" style="s2">figure out and try to guess what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.710" end="00:14:56.500" style="s2">to happen in the actual world yep and</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.950" end="00:15:00.070" style="s2">choose a path that leads towards more</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.500" end="00:15:03.970" style="s2">and more beauty yeah higher ethical more</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.070" end="00:15:07.240" style="s2">moving towards ideal totally and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.970" end="00:15:09.510" style="s2">that one can add one more thing in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.240" end="00:15:12.310" style="s2">that connection between the ideal and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.510" end="00:15:14.020" style="s2">the ego if you will right the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.310" end="00:15:18.400" style="s2">phenomenological self that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.020" end="00:15:22.550" style="s2">experiencing right now and the ideal is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.400" end="00:15:28.790" style="s2">the connecting point is imagination</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.550" end="00:15:31.270" style="s2">and I this is a really interesting this</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.790" end="00:15:34.430" style="s2">is a really interesting idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.270" end="00:15:37.490" style="s2">one that I think that I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.430" end="00:15:40.520" style="s2">only talks about where is we say and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.490" end="00:15:42.650" style="s2">know we know this because it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.520" end="00:15:45.890" style="s2">when your imagination moves it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.650" end="00:15:47.390" style="s2">you&#39;re at the edge of like where</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.890" end="00:15:49.370" style="s2">something just starts to come into</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.390" end="00:15:52.310" style="s2">articulation or just starts to come to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.370" end="00:15:56.090" style="s2">the form from from but it&#39;s not totally</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.310" end="00:15:59.570" style="s2">revealed that&#39;s why I think space is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.090" end="00:16:03.590" style="s2">place that universally human imagination</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.570" end="00:16:05.210" style="s2">just go sports right outer space like</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.590" end="00:16:07.070" style="s2">when we have a sense that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.210" end="00:16:08.030" style="s2">something we don&#39;t know what we know</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.070" end="00:16:10.700" style="s2">where it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.030" end="00:16:13.310" style="s2">or we have some form of it the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.700" end="00:16:15.950" style="s2">imagination just moves in to meet it</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.310" end="00:16:18.500" style="s2">right so like any kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.950" end="00:16:22.600" style="s2">traditionally any kind of open space or</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.500" end="00:16:25.730" style="s2">half or barely articulated something</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.600" end="00:16:28.040" style="s2">when it&#39;s in the drift imagination moves</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.730" end="00:16:30.020" style="s2">towards that incompletion and it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.040" end="00:16:32.540" style="s2">meeting point is you could say is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.020" end="00:16:35.840" style="s2">it is the place where the self makes</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.540" end="00:16:37.820" style="s2">itself if you will and therefore you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.840" end="00:16:38.540" style="s2">collectively look at history and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.820" end="00:16:40.430" style="s2">fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.540" end="00:16:42.440" style="s2">you can induce you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.430" end="00:16:44.240" style="s2">million ways to read history like one</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.440" end="00:16:45.950" style="s2">way would be to read it as a serious</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.240" end="00:16:49.610" style="s2">facts that happened over through time</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.950" end="00:16:54.080" style="s2">but you could also be take this idea you</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.610" end="00:16:57.850" style="s2">can also look at history as the state of</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.080" end="00:16:57.850" style="s2">the imagination collectively</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.330" end="00:17:04.250" style="s2">what as history moves itself forward</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.980" end="00:17:05.690" style="s2">into the future it if that meeting point</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.250" end="00:17:08.300" style="s2">is weird look if the future is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.690" end="00:17:11.390" style="s2">unknown and and the present is known and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.300" end="00:17:14.750" style="s2">you&#39;re moving towards and expanding and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.390" end="00:17:17.750" style="s2">growing well its actions they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.750" end="00:17:20.330" style="s2">be based on what it imagines is coming</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.750" end="00:17:22.640" style="s2">and that that imagination has a</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.330" end="00:17:25.160" style="s2">structure so you can all you can almost</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.640" end="00:17:26.930" style="s2">look at history as the collective</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.160" end="00:17:30.500" style="s2">imagination the movement of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.930" end="00:17:31.880" style="s2">imagination over time right which i</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.500" end="00:17:34.580" style="s2">think is it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.880" end="00:17:35.960" style="s2">fascinating idea when you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.580" end="00:17:40.520" style="s2">like looking at it as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.960" end="00:17:43.669" style="s2">revelation of the deeper structures are</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.520" end="00:17:46.399" style="s2">the way that imagination moves which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.669" end="00:17:49.149" style="s2">you know points to these kind of deeper</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.399" end="00:17:54.890" style="s2">structures that you weren&#39;t authorized</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.149" end="00:17:57.320" style="s2">yeah this peg alien notion this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.890" end="00:18:03.590" style="s2">German idealistic that you could say God</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.320" end="00:18:05.809" style="s2">is working out the ideas of the self of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.590" end="00:18:09.080" style="s2">what&#39;s possible for Humanity through the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.809" end="00:18:12.740" style="s2">collective imagination of humanity being</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.080" end="00:18:16.760" style="s2">transferred and transformed into actual</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.740" end="00:18:19.309" style="s2">infrastructure and societies yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.760" end="00:18:21.610" style="s2">absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.309" end="00:18:24.380" style="s2">Wilbur talks about the four quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.610" end="00:18:26.210" style="s2">where you&#39;ve got your internal thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.380" end="00:18:28.909" style="s2">like what is the individual thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.210" end="00:18:33.500" style="s2">then what&#39;s the group thinking what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.909" end="00:18:35.770" style="s2">the individual say biology right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.500" end="00:18:43.399" style="s2">what is the infrastructure of society</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.770" end="00:18:46.370" style="s2">right yes all right and by playing with</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.399" end="00:18:49.940" style="s2">this it&#39;s like the the individual pushes</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.370" end="00:18:55.580" style="s2">things forward in navigates this dance</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.940" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">of imagination from who they are what</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.580" end="00:18:59.529" style="s2">they understand themselves to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:05.270" style="s2">ideal of what they think they could be</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.529" end="00:19:09.559" style="s2">this somehow Talos towards which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.270" end="00:19:13.130" style="s2">called the great experience is more</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.559" end="00:19:15.799" style="s2">beautiful somehow yes all right</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.130" end="00:19:19.669" style="s2">their imagination in the face of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.799" end="00:19:21.409" style="s2">thing first of all articulates what is</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.669" end="00:19:24.230" style="s2">it what would it mean for it to be more</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.409" end="00:19:26.380" style="s2">beautiful and creates visions of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.230" end="00:19:28.610" style="s2">that is and then creates imagined</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.380" end="00:19:32.779" style="s2">imagination visions of how we could get</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.610" end="00:19:36.370" style="s2">from here to there and then judges those</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.779" end="00:19:39.320" style="s2">imaginations is good bad better worse</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.370" end="00:19:41.659" style="s2">according to the vision and so it has it</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.320" end="00:19:44.210" style="s2">refines the vision it refines the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.659" end="00:19:45.830" style="s2">imagination which allows it to create a</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.210" end="00:19:48.430" style="s2">better vision which allows it to refine</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.830" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">its vision more</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.430" end="00:19:54.230" style="s2">you could say we communicate that with</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:56.270" style="s2">others building communities those</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.230" end="00:20:01.490" style="s2">communities build actual social</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.270" end="00:20:03.590" style="s2">structures that drive that yeah / and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.490" end="00:20:05.180" style="s2">that changes the kinds of environments</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.590" end="00:20:06.620" style="s2">that people grow up in and therefore the</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.180" end="00:20:09.340" style="s2">kinds of original patterns they could</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.620" end="00:20:16.840" style="s2">make until they actually start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.340" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">yes don&#39;t like so many fun places to go</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.840" end="00:20:23.750" style="s2">absolutely and I think that that one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:25.970" style="s2">the things maybe this will inform where</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.750" end="00:20:28.970" style="s2">to go but I just thought of my dad used</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.970" end="00:20:30.950" style="s2">to say to me when I was a kid he used to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.970" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">boggle my mind a few questions you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.950" end="00:20:41.080" style="s2">no surprise consider how it grew up that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:47.920" style="s2">the thermos keeps the Hot Stuff hot in</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.080" end="00:20:47.920" style="s2">the cold so cold but how does it know I</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.760" end="00:20:54.050" style="s2">was thinking about that that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.810" end="00:20:56.540" style="s2">kind of s where a lot for me a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.050" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">imagination awfully often moves towards</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.540" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">is this this thing about there&#39;s that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:03.170" style="s2">value like there&#39;s what we value and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:05.240" style="s2">then there&#39;s like lots of arguments that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.170" end="00:21:10.340" style="s2">we can get in a debate about what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.240" end="00:21:16.160" style="s2">better or worse but that we&#39;re inclined</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.340" end="00:21:20.780" style="s2">to know that how do we know right how do</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.160" end="00:21:22.430" style="s2">we know to do that a good a good kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.780" end="00:21:25.310" style="s2">grounding example of that too is what we</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.430" end="00:21:27.890" style="s2">were talking about earlier today of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.310" end="00:21:31.310" style="s2">example of the guy who recorded every</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.890" end="00:21:34.780" style="s2">sound that his son or son or daughter</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.310" end="00:21:36.980" style="s2">made as as they learned to speak and he</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.780" end="00:21:39.650" style="s2">he was able to notice the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.980" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">underneath it and that phase that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.650" end="00:21:44.780" style="s2">know when you babble it&#39;s obvious it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:47.360" style="s2">all the basic funnel all the sounds of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.780" end="00:21:50.930" style="s2">every single human language and he said</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.360" end="00:21:54.980" style="s2">that like the process of articulating</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.930" end="00:21:56.630" style="s2">coming to terms right were these the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.980" end="00:21:58.760" style="s2">fundamental structures of language which</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.630" end="00:22:00.420" style="s2">the the baby would go back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.760" end="00:22:03.980" style="s2">back and forth and then it would</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.420" end="00:22:08.100" style="s2">continually hone in on until the goddess</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.980" end="00:22:09.870" style="s2">right that even good like before you</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.100" end="00:22:12.450" style="s2">know you no one taught them don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.870" end="00:22:14.520" style="s2">teaches somebody how to learn language</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.450" end="00:22:16.230" style="s2">when you grow up you just learn language</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.520" end="00:22:18.179" style="s2">but the look that I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.230" end="00:22:21.350" style="s2">fascinating that we just know to do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.179" end="00:22:26.309" style="s2">but there&#39;s this sense of that there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.350" end="00:22:29.549" style="s2">like there is a there is a a center or</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.309" end="00:22:31.260" style="s2">there is a name and that we know to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.549" end="00:22:33.210" style="s2">orient around that and when we know to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.260" end="00:22:37.770" style="s2">perceive and feel into it and guide our</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.210" end="00:22:39.799" style="s2">actions in terms of that aim is like all</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.770" end="00:22:42.710" style="s2">the way down to like when were babies</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.799" end="00:22:46.169" style="s2">learning how to speak we&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.710" end="00:22:48.210" style="s2">the mad thing that that knows to do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.169" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">and whatever it&#39;s calling it forward is</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.210" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">that is the thing I would like you to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.510" end="00:23:02.669" style="s2">yeah and and I think I think I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.640" end="00:23:07.020" style="s2">this I think like what is what why is</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.669" end="00:23:12.270" style="s2">that thing that way like why does the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.020" end="00:23:14.280" style="s2">universe exist in such a way that we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.270" end="00:23:17.730" style="s2">have a conversation about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.280" end="00:23:19.049" style="s2">the universe exists right because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.730" end="00:23:20.940" style="s2">particular kind of universe in which we</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.049" end="00:23:25.890" style="s2">can have these cumbersome kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.940" end="00:23:28.020" style="s2">conversations all right I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.890" end="00:23:32.910" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard about the anthropic</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.020" end="00:23:34.860" style="s2">principle there&#39;s the north and the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.910" end="00:23:36.750" style="s2">weekend throught that principle and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.860" end="00:23:38.820" style="s2">strong in topic principle and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.750" end="00:23:42.929" style="s2">completely ridiculous anthropic</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.820" end="00:23:47.669" style="s2">principle so this is just the basic idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.929" end="00:23:49.049" style="s2">is you know why is it that we exist and</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.669" end="00:23:50.850" style="s2">one way of thinking about it is that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.049" end="00:23:52.679" style="s2">just happen to live of all the potential</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.850" end="00:23:56.820" style="s2">universes we just happen to live in one</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.679" end="00:23:58.350" style="s2">in which we can exist all right you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.820" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">look at that from a weak perspective</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.350" end="00:24:04.440" style="s2">which is yeah it just so happens that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:06.770" style="s2">exist in that well we can say well for</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.440" end="00:24:09.630" style="s2">the universe to exist</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.770" end="00:24:12.860" style="s2">right it&#39;s actually designed such that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.630" end="00:24:12.860" style="s2">we can exist in it</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.100" end="00:24:17.940" style="s2">yeah totally it&#39;s so fine-tuned if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.320" end="00:24:19.409" style="s2">change go down to the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.940" end="00:24:21.679" style="s2">constants if you change any of them a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.409" end="00:24:24.330" style="s2">little bit like the universe space</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.679" end="00:24:26.520" style="s2">expands too quickly so that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.330" end="00:24:29.159" style="s2">condense and things or it contracts too</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.520" end="00:24:33.809" style="s2">quickly so that it doesn&#39;t expand into</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.159" end="00:24:36.870" style="s2">things and this human organic life form</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.809" end="00:24:39.480" style="s2">that is sufficiently complex that it can</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.870" end="00:24:42.750" style="s2">become intelligent only exists in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.480" end="00:24:45.539" style="s2">particular universe yeah right and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.750" end="00:24:50.760" style="s2">could be to the point that Stephen</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.539" end="00:24:53.520" style="s2">Hawking once intimated that like it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.760" end="00:24:57.240" style="s2">is in fact consciousness and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.520" end="00:24:59.970" style="s2">intelligence that that the universe</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.240" end="00:25:01.620" style="s2">sorts for so there&#39;s an infinity of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.970" end="00:25:03.330" style="s2">potential universes and the one that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.620" end="00:25:07.890" style="s2">comes into existence is the one that has</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.330" end="00:25:10.020" style="s2">that well I wish I had not described as</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.890" end="00:25:15.450" style="s2">the compute completely ridiculous and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.020" end="00:25:16.620" style="s2">profit principle or crap right right but</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.450" end="00:25:21.990" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the universe</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.620" end="00:25:24.200" style="s2">that causes human beings to be born in</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.990" end="00:25:25.470" style="s2">such way that they truly non-language</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.200" end="00:25:28.559" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.470" end="00:25:32.690" style="s2">they have the capacity to make you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.559" end="00:25:36.299" style="s2">say every sound in every known language</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.690" end="00:25:39.480" style="s2">right right they have the capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.299" end="00:25:41.940" style="s2">all of those things as babies yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.480" end="00:25:43.770" style="s2">and then they&#39;re surrounded in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.940" end="00:25:48.600" style="s2">environment of language in which only</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.770" end="00:25:52.260" style="s2">some of those sounds are used so they</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.600" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">kind of tried them all right they try</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.260" end="00:25:57.870" style="s2">them all and then over time and from a</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:26:00.539" style="s2">biological perspective they actually the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.870" end="00:26:07.970" style="s2">ones that exist in their environment in</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.539" end="00:26:11.220" style="s2">which they get rewarded for those</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.970" end="00:26:13.230" style="s2">neurological pathways grow and the ones</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.220" end="00:26:17.130" style="s2">that they don&#39;t use actually die off</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.230" end="00:26:21.090" style="s2">they actually prune off the parts of</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.130" end="00:26:23.100" style="s2">their brain the the motor pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.090" end="00:26:24.380" style="s2">can make those sounds actually get</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.100" end="00:26:28.400" style="s2">pruned off</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.380" end="00:26:30.200" style="s2">hmm ready you true in on it you say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.400" end="00:26:34.730" style="s2">like how do you like it throughs in on</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.200" end="00:26:36.500" style="s2">the perfect phoneme the perfect perfect</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.730" end="00:26:40.010" style="s2">in what sense like what is the it that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.500" end="00:26:43.820" style="s2">it&#39;s zeroing in on it&#39;s whatever happens</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.010" end="00:26:46.250" style="s2">to be in their environment right totally</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.820" end="00:26:48.590" style="s2">and they prune off the rest and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.250" end="00:26:50.510" style="s2">they become expert in making the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.590" end="00:26:52.490" style="s2">particular sounds of the language of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.510" end="00:26:54.110" style="s2">their particular culture yeah so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.490" end="00:26:55.550" style="s2">got this interesting thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.110" end="00:26:57.350" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s all these possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.550" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2">each one of them has its own potential</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.350" end="00:27:07.130" style="s2">legitimacy and the baby truths in on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:10.790" style="s2">one that&#39;s going to work in their</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.130" end="00:27:13.250" style="s2">environment right Hey all right so on</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.790" end="00:27:15.730" style="s2">the one hand the fact that that happened</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.250" end="00:27:18.860" style="s2">it&#39;s like what is it that causes that</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.730" end="00:27:20.900" style="s2">it&#39;s we&#39;re in that kind of universe and</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.860" end="00:27:23.900" style="s2">I don&#39;t have much like the rest of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.900" end="00:27:25.880" style="s2">pretty much beyond my paygrade like how</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.900" end="00:27:28.400" style="s2">specifically does that happen you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.880" end="00:27:30.680" style="s2">we&#39;re getting more and more senses more</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.400" end="00:27:34.250" style="s2">and more understanding of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.680" end="00:27:36.440" style="s2">biology can I ask you a question when</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.250" end="00:27:37.940" style="s2">you say like when you say I like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.440" end="00:27:42.470" style="s2">term by the way it&#39;s the unlike but</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.940" end="00:27:47.210" style="s2">above and beyond my paygrade what is</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.470" end="00:27:52.420" style="s2">your relationship to beyond your your</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.210" end="00:27:54.620" style="s2">paygrade like do you have what is it I</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.420" end="00:27:57.680" style="s2">mean I could imagine could be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.620" end="00:27:59.570" style="s2">complex answer but like is it when it</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.680" end="00:28:02.840" style="s2">when it hits like the edge of what you</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.570" end="00:28:05.000" style="s2">know that you can know for sure do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.840" end="00:28:07.400" style="s2">have like what&#39;s your relationship to it</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.000" end="00:28:12.290" style="s2">is it do you go like okay well I just</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.400" end="00:28:14.870" style="s2">don&#39;t think about it or or do you like</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.290" end="00:28:16.720" style="s2">to speculate or what&#39;s your relationship</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.870" end="00:28:19.450" style="s2">to beyond your your paygrade</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:23.570" style="s2">do it is there a simple answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.450" end="00:28:26.270" style="s2">relatively simple okay great so I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.570" end="00:28:29.720" style="s2">you you think you offered a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.270" end="00:28:32.330" style="s2">range of possibilities I do you just say</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.720" end="00:28:35.420" style="s2">I can&#39;t get any worth I can&#39;t know for</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.330" end="00:28:38.040" style="s2">certain and therefore I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.420" end="00:28:42.180" style="s2">about it or do I like to spec</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.040" end="00:28:43.200" style="s2">about it right and if we&#39;re to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.180" end="00:28:46.200" style="s2">back to what you&#39;re talking about okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.200" end="00:28:49.710" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got this imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.200" end="00:28:56.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the world that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.710" end="00:28:59.070" style="s2">ego the known right versus the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.880" end="00:29:00.690" style="s2">of chaos and Peterson&#39;s language right</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.070" end="00:29:03.630" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the knowledge that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.690" end="00:29:04.920" style="s2">already got the comfort of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.630" end="00:29:06.930" style="s2">structures that you already have in</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.920" end="00:29:10.680" style="s2">place and then you&#39;ve got the unknown of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.930" end="00:29:12.090" style="s2">chaos right but there&#39;s something in</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.680" end="00:29:14.010" style="s2">that relationship between the known and</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.090" end="00:29:15.570" style="s2">the unknown that you can see better and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.010" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">that you&#39;re driven towards better that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.570" end="00:29:22.280" style="s2">there&#39;s this inherent Talos towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:24.930" style="s2">beauty with goodness and the triad or</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.280" end="00:29:28.740" style="s2">knowledge and justice if you add in all</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.930" end="00:29:34.650" style="s2">five you&#39;ve got these you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.740" end="00:29:41.190" style="s2">there towards which you are oriented yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.650" end="00:29:43.170" style="s2">right this built-in Talos somehow right</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.190" end="00:29:45.690" style="s2">and in the face of you&#39;ve got structure</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.170" end="00:29:46.950" style="s2">the known and then chaos the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.690" end="00:29:49.500" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.950" end="00:29:55.620" style="s2">there were we dance an imagination</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.500" end="00:30:02.760" style="s2">towards that Talos that beauty justice</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.620" end="00:30:05.840" style="s2">goodness knowledge truth we we moving</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.760" end="00:30:08.010" style="s2">towards that is fundamentally fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:10.260" style="s2">it gives us a sense of meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.010" end="00:30:14.850" style="s2">purpose and direction and depth in</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.260" end="00:30:19.710" style="s2">progress and movement right that when</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.850" end="00:30:23.940" style="s2">that&#39;s fulfilled like our conscience</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.710" end="00:30:25.410" style="s2">says yes that more and when we&#39;re off</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.940" end="00:30:29.700" style="s2">track for that our consciousness goes</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.410" end="00:30:38.400" style="s2">Eric like thrown through the like so</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.700" end="00:30:40.200" style="s2">that that dance is in place so given</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.400" end="00:30:43.470" style="s2">that you could say that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.200" end="00:30:46.410" style="s2">questions that I cannot be certain about</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.470" end="00:30:48.390" style="s2">like I go oh let me examine that</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.410" end="00:30:50.660" style="s2">question me personally let me examine</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.390" end="00:30:50.660" style="s2">that question</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.360" end="00:30:56.169" style="s2">given everything that I know I have</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.770" end="00:30:59.380" style="s2">absolutely no means of answering that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.169" end="00:31:03.010" style="s2">question with with anything other than</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.380" end="00:31:05.230" style="s2">speculation it just simply is enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.010" end="00:31:08.230" style="s2">data to answer that question right</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.230" end="00:31:09.990" style="s2">totally there for anything I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.230" end="00:31:12.880" style="s2">about it is me just talking out my ass</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.990" end="00:31:16.270" style="s2">right okay so what do I do in the face</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.880" end="00:31:17.679" style="s2">of that yes yes right this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.270" end="00:31:20.340" style="s2">the question I hear you asking is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.679" end="00:31:23.320" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.340" end="00:31:34.029" style="s2">so if I think that the speculation</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.320" end="00:31:36.070" style="s2">itself is fun and the dance of it will</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.029" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">leave some kind of structures that will</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.070" end="00:31:43.390" style="s2">allow me to create with labor right the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:45.669" style="s2">the classic example is fine fine Minh</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.390" end="00:31:50.020" style="s2">was in the lunchroom when he was</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.669" end="00:31:52.360" style="s2">watching kids spin their plates and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.020" end="00:31:54.010" style="s2">know you spin the plate nikoline and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.360" end="00:31:57.970" style="s2">went oh wow so he just figured out the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.010" end="00:32:00.610" style="s2">math on how to describe that cuz it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.970" end="00:32:02.049" style="s2">fun it was fun for him it was it was a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.610" end="00:32:02.549" style="s2">challenge for him he&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.049" end="00:32:06.520" style="s2">pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.549" end="00:32:08.470" style="s2">great but it also knows that by solving</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.520" end="00:32:11.409" style="s2">those kinds of problems he&#39;s leaving a</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.470" end="00:32:12.789" style="s2">set of tracks in his mind that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.409" end="00:32:14.830" style="s2">probably going to be useful for</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.789" end="00:32:18.820" style="s2">somewhere else so he follows his</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.830" end="00:32:21.130" style="s2">curiosity boom there it is where the I</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.820" end="00:32:23.740" style="s2">with the understanding there&#39;s some kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.130" end="00:32:25.570" style="s2">of track that&#39;s gonna be laid that can</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.740" end="00:32:27.820" style="s2">be useful and he later used that to</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.570" end="00:32:29.770" style="s2">understand some characteristic o of</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.820" end="00:32:33.159" style="s2">electrons which you know is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.770" end="00:32:38.169" style="s2">great leaps there were comments like he</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.159" end="00:32:40.870" style="s2">took this wild speculation and used it</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.169" end="00:32:45.429" style="s2">in another place so when I say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.870" end="00:32:46.899" style="s2">above my pay grade I mean I can&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.429" end="00:32:52.559" style="s2">about it with any certainty in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.899" end="00:32:58.690" style="s2">can&#39;t even talk about it with any really</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.559" end="00:33:00.399" style="s2">better than another answer answer right</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.690" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">there&#39;s a if there&#39;s like an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.399" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">spectrum of answers that are equally</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:07.899" style="s2">implausible yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:11.559" style="s2">even if I can say okay I can rule out a</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.899" end="00:33:15.429" style="s2">whole series of answers the space of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.559" end="00:33:17.470" style="s2">potential answers is so large and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.429" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">ability to differentiate between good</p>

<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:22.750" style="s2">potential answers I just don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.279" end="00:33:24.520" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be productive for a practical</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.750" end="00:33:29.740" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve got better things to do with</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.520" end="00:33:31.419" style="s2">my mind so and the actual speculation on</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.740" end="00:33:35.830" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s gonna leave me</p>

<p begin="00:33:36.760" end="00:33:43.299" style="s2">then I mean there there are times I</p>

<p begin="00:33:43.299" end="00:33:47.620" style="s2">you take where you just follow the track</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.429" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">wherever it leads and it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.620" end="00:33:54.370" style="s2">fascinating in and of its own right and</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:56.770" style="s2">it leaves no useful tracks yeah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.370" end="00:33:59.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a thinking dead-end that doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.220" end="00:34:52.060" style="s2">that causes it to be in that particular</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.929" end="00:34:54.070" style="s2">way is in a realm</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.060" end="00:34:58.390" style="s2">you know Kant talked about it as the as</p>

<p begin="00:35:04.599" end="00:35:12.790" style="s2">against Conte right the pointing to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.050" end="00:35:14.980" style="s2">thing that we cannot know about it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.790" end="00:35:16.330" style="s2">fundamentally unknowable question as far</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.980" end="00:35:16.940" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned that&#39;s beyond my</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.940" end="00:35:21.799" style="s2">right and there&#39;s really nothing I just</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.510" end="00:35:26.150" style="s2">you know not that I haven&#39;t spent a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.799" end="00:35:27.740" style="s2">of time thinking about it I just never</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.150" end="00:35:33.380" style="s2">thought and I&#39;ve just never thought</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.740" end="00:35:36.530" style="s2">anything that was valuable enough to</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.380" end="00:35:38.299" style="s2">share right there spent enough time with</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.530" end="00:35:40.670" style="s2">it that it&#39;s just like okay just that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.299" end="00:35:42.890" style="s2">just beyond my paygrade right listen</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.670" end="00:35:47.510" style="s2">this mechanism isn&#39;t gonna get me</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.890" end="00:35:49.160" style="s2">anywhere anyway so wild little I like</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.510" end="00:35:51.740" style="s2">what you said about the tracks being</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.160" end="00:35:53.660" style="s2">laid down just I don&#39;t know what I liked</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.740" end="00:35:57.170" style="s2">about it was as you&#39;re talking I just</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.660" end="00:36:00.559" style="s2">got the sense of like oh yeah there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.170" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">this way in which something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.559" end="00:36:05.180" style="s2">something like if you can go up to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:09.260" style="s2">mystery right and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.180" end="00:36:12.740" style="s2">speculate however or imagine or wonder</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.260" end="00:36:15.380" style="s2">or be cute like let your curiosity go</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.740" end="00:36:16.819" style="s2">that sometimes and it sounds like what</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.380" end="00:36:19.069" style="s2">I&#39;m hearing you say is like that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.819" end="00:36:23.559" style="s2">an you have an intuitive sense that if</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.069" end="00:36:27.289" style="s2">doing this is exercising capacities</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.559" end="00:36:29.450" style="s2">right in itself it&#39;s already valuable</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.289" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">for you right that like it lays down</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.450" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">tracks maybe not in a direct usable way</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:38.390" style="s2">that you can see in that moment but</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:40.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense that it that it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.390" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">you know what they say about like</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.940" end="00:36:46.150" style="s2">meditation that like was at the end was</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:49.730" style="s2">it a good meditation or a bad meditation</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.150" end="00:36:52.819" style="s2">well that&#39;s the wrong question right</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.730" end="00:36:57.079" style="s2">that you meditated that you practice is</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.819" end="00:37:01.520" style="s2">the is that is the point of it is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.079" end="00:37:05.150" style="s2">exercise of of actually meditating what</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.520" end="00:37:07.579" style="s2">we&#39;ll so let&#39;s use that example as a way</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.150" end="00:37:08.869" style="s2">of defining what I said yes no</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.579" end="00:37:13.400" style="s2">absolutely not there&#39;s good and bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.869" end="00:37:18.770" style="s2">meditation it&#39;s ridiculous what what you</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.400" end="00:37:23.599" style="s2">want a trophy cuz you meditated like</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.770" end="00:37:25.190" style="s2">well I did it therefore it&#39;s valuable I</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.599" end="00:37:26.690" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that that&#39;s how the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.190" end="00:37:29.359" style="s2">universe works I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.690" end="00:37:30.500" style="s2">that God is giving you points for being</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.359" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">obedient</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.500" end="00:37:37.790" style="s2">and the only thing that you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:39.470" style="s2">to do like like you can waste time so</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.790" end="00:37:43.190" style="s2">the other part of this thing is in</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.470" end="00:37:45.590" style="s2">imagining yeah there&#39;s a Talos towards</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.190" end="00:37:48.560" style="s2">which we&#39;re moving and I&#39;ll say one more</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.590" end="00:37:50.810" style="s2">thing about that CS Lewis thing goes</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.560" end="00:37:54.590" style="s2">abolition a man might have been mere</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.810" end="00:37:57.980" style="s2">christianity mere christianity starts</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.590" end="00:38:02.150" style="s2">off and he talks about the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.980" end="00:38:04.190" style="s2">have moral judgments but we think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.150" end="00:38:06.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a more beautiful more just a</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.190" end="00:38:14.690" style="s2">more ethical a more knowledge a more</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.260" end="00:38:19.490" style="s2">true like we think so something about</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.690" end="00:38:28.250" style="s2">the universe has that kind of thought</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.490" end="00:38:30.290" style="s2">exists so God must have that right the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.250" end="00:38:32.180" style="s2">God that created the universe in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.290" end="00:38:34.910" style="s2">universe is an expression of God and we</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.180" end="00:38:37.910" style="s2">are part of that yeah like the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.910" end="00:38:41.810" style="s2">that exists says something about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.910" end="00:38:46.700" style="s2">nature of the universe right it&#39;s built</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.810" end="00:38:48.710" style="s2">in yeah yeah built in we didn&#39;t create</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.700" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t design that like we</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.710" end="00:38:53.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t go I want to zoom in on the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:55.010" style="s2">phoneme that allows me to speak the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.240" end="00:39:01.840" style="s2">language so that I can survive in my</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.010" end="00:39:04.520" style="s2">culture it&#39;s perhaps built-in yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.840" end="00:39:06.260" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got this thing that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.520" end="00:39:08.300" style="s2">imagination and imagination is</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.260" end="00:39:11.210" style="s2">constantly trying scenarios to see what</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.300" end="00:39:13.310" style="s2">is more true and what is more false like</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.210" end="00:39:16.340" style="s2">your true in your trajectory towards</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.310" end="00:39:17.840" style="s2">that Talos and some things are towards</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.340" end="00:39:24.100" style="s2">and some things are away some things are</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.840" end="00:39:30.050" style="s2">better and some things are worse right</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.100" end="00:39:31.910" style="s2">right by what standard do you judge</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.050" end="00:39:33.800" style="s2">better or worse was it a good meditation</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.910" end="00:39:37.310" style="s2">or bad meditation yes we can say that</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.800" end="00:39:38.270" style="s2">that was it&#39;s the wrong question asked</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.310" end="00:39:41.480" style="s2">that really all you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.270" end="00:39:43.550" style="s2">meditate because here&#39;s the because</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.480" end="00:39:44.450" style="s2">here&#39;s the good bad better worse towards</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.550" end="00:39:48.520" style="s2">the tailless away from</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.450" end="00:39:50.870" style="s2">because as long as you are meditating</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.520" end="00:39:52.130" style="s2">you&#39;re putting yourself in the space</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.870" end="00:39:56.930" style="s2">where you can start to notice the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.130" end="00:39:59.510" style="s2">patterns of what&#39;s more true and less</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.930" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">true in the process of meditating you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.510" end="00:40:03.230" style="s2">refining your mind you&#39;re laying down</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:05.510" style="s2">the tracks even if you&#39;re not coming up</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.230" end="00:40:09.440" style="s2">with the answer correct and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.510" end="00:40:15.080" style="s2">meditate consider that a wind even if it</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.440" end="00:40:16.610" style="s2">was shitty meditation right right but</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.080" end="00:40:19.580" style="s2">the thing is that you can do shitty</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.610" end="00:40:24.880" style="s2">meditation like you can actually go in</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.580" end="00:40:28.940" style="s2">to meditate and meditate poorly and</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.880" end="00:40:32.480" style="s2">create more tracks going in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.940" end="00:40:36.290" style="s2">direction and build bad habits that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.480" end="00:40:37.700" style="s2">later have to deconstruct great so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.290" end="00:40:40.190" style="s2">there&#39;s good meditation and there&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.700" end="00:40:41.780" style="s2">meditation I think we&#39;re totally right</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.190" end="00:40:44.120" style="s2">this meditation is the one that actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.780" end="00:40:46.940" style="s2">clears out your mind so that you can see</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.120" end="00:40:48.770" style="s2">more of the talos so that you can tune</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.940" end="00:40:53.660" style="s2">into more of your conscience so that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.770" end="00:40:57.470" style="s2">can like okay great so now I&#39;m gonna tie</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.660" end="00:41:00.050" style="s2">that back in with the phonemes of all</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.470" end="00:41:02.530" style="s2">the potential ways of being human of all</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.050" end="00:41:06.320" style="s2">the potential ways of using your voice</p>

<p begin="00:41:06.320" end="00:41:17.480" style="s2">true to your culture and you literally</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.190" end="00:41:20.660" style="s2">prune out the motor skills and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.480" end="00:41:23.510" style="s2">listening skills to notice them which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.660" end="00:41:25.310" style="s2">you know which is why it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.510" end="00:41:27.350" style="s2">difficult for some people raised in</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.310" end="00:41:31.550" style="s2">certain languages to learn how to speak</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.350" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">the other languages read it like one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.550" end="00:41:39.020" style="s2">the one of the increasingly problematic</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.640" end="00:41:44.360" style="s2">prunings that we do in English is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.020" end="00:41:48.760" style="s2">we don&#39;t recognize tone we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.360" end="00:41:51.110" style="s2">focused on the consonants and the vowels</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.760" end="00:41:54.010" style="s2">recognizing them but not the shift in</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.110" end="00:41:58.160" style="s2">the vowel over the course of a word</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.010" end="00:42:01.039" style="s2">right so in Chinese you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.160" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">four different tones you can write where</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.039" end="00:42:07.220" style="s2">you&#39;re going the same tone and then odd</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:09.770" style="s2">down and then up and then all up and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.220" end="00:42:10.400" style="s2">down all right so when you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.770" end="00:42:13.130" style="s2">on dying</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.400" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">like I can&#39;t do it I haven&#39;t learned</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.130" end="00:42:16.900" style="s2">that but I&#39;ve learned enough to know</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:19.609" style="s2">that I can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.900" end="00:42:22.180" style="s2">right I&#39;ve learned enough to know that a</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.609" end="00:42:27.760" style="s2">native Chinese speaker can say the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.180" end="00:42:32.390" style="s2">took the same vowel consonant</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.760" end="00:42:35.660" style="s2">combination varying the tone and I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.390" end="00:42:37.880" style="s2">with my best absolute hearing I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.660" end="00:42:40.849" style="s2">sometimes maybe sort of hear the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.880" end="00:42:42.170" style="s2">difference for different things that</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.849" end="00:42:43.849" style="s2">they&#39;re doing and I can&#39;t even tell the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.170" end="00:42:47.210" style="s2">difference right</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.849" end="00:42:49.160" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s use that as a metaphor for</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.210" end="00:42:54.380" style="s2">human beings getting brought up into a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.160" end="00:42:56.270" style="s2">culture and losing access to chaos you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.380" end="00:42:58.609" style="s2">know right now we&#39;re in a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.270" end="00:43:00.140" style="s2">interesting time socially from my</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.609" end="00:43:04.279" style="s2">perspective and Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.140" end="00:43:08.390" style="s2">speaking about this a lot where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.279" end="00:43:10.250" style="s2">this idea of privilege first there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.390" end="00:43:15.260" style="s2">this idea of institutional racism</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.250" end="00:43:18.260" style="s2">institutional sexism which is okay in</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.260" end="00:43:22.339" style="s2">our culture the dominant culture the one</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.260" end="00:43:23.839" style="s2">that everyone who wants to speak the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.339" end="00:43:29.270" style="s2">language in a way that they can be</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.839" end="00:43:31.789" style="s2">understood right disappears the phonemes</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.270" end="00:43:35.319" style="s2">disappears the ways of speaking prunes</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.789" end="00:43:39.349" style="s2">them from their mind so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.319" end="00:43:40.819" style="s2">fit the cultural pattern to the green</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.349" end="00:43:47.720" style="s2">that you don&#39;t fit that cultural pattern</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.819" end="00:43:51.799" style="s2">you are seen as broken less than not</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.720" end="00:43:54.680" style="s2">good all right and we could say the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.799" end="00:43:56.900" style="s2">domina is a the leading idea in our</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.680" end="00:44:01.549" style="s2">culture right now is that white male</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.900" end="00:44:05.779" style="s2">heterosexual right you know let&#39;s stick</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.549" end="00:44:07.640" style="s2">with that for now but that is the true</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.779" end="00:44:11.390" style="s2">phenome that everybody is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.640" end="00:44:15.170" style="s2">adjust their language towards right</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.390" end="00:44:21.650" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t then when you speak</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.170" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like you have an accent huh right</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.650" end="00:44:26.300" style="s2">right and so we could say we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:29.390" style="s2">through our culture and we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.300" end="00:44:34.040" style="s2">a-ha we want to expand the possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.390" end="00:44:36.080" style="s2">of what is canonical and language right</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.040" end="00:44:37.730" style="s2">so that what if you&#39;re not white what if</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.080" end="00:44:41.390" style="s2">you&#39;re not male what if you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.730" end="00:44:43.400" style="s2">heterosexual or cysts like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.390" end="00:44:46.700" style="s2">create space for those things when the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.400" end="00:44:48.980" style="s2">culture has trained people to move in on</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.700" end="00:44:53.540" style="s2">the particular pronunciation the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.980" end="00:44:56.390" style="s2">particular expression of self yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.540" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">locked it&#39;s locked in and is canonical</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.390" end="00:45:05.480" style="s2">of the the dominant lineage yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:08.060" style="s2">and and how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.480" end="00:45:10.990" style="s2">communicate that well one way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.060" end="00:45:14.450" style="s2">it is to say the dominant lineage is</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.990" end="00:45:16.450" style="s2">privileged and all of the other ways of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.450" end="00:45:22.150" style="s2">thinking about it or pronounce</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.450" end="00:45:24.830" style="s2">pronouncing the self are marginalized</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.150" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">and so what we need to do is attack the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.830" end="00:45:32.890" style="s2">dominant position for being dominant and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:35.270" style="s2">bring the marginalized voices and</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.890" end="00:45:39.470" style="s2">legitimize than marginalized voices and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.270" end="00:45:41.990" style="s2">say hello yes yes that sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.470" end="00:45:44.330" style="s2">good thing however now let&#39;s come back</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.990" end="00:45:49.210" style="s2">to you there&#39;s the entire set of</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.330" end="00:45:51.950" style="s2">possibilities for human language and</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.210" end="00:45:54.320" style="s2">there&#39;s one canonical ones that people</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.950" end="00:45:55.580" style="s2">learn to speak and if they don&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.320" end="00:45:58.150" style="s2">it they&#39;re considered to have some kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.580" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">of language to be less than in some way</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.150" end="00:46:05.870" style="s2">but what about better and worse right</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:08.210" style="s2">that&#39;s like not part of that like being</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.870" end="00:46:10.190" style="s2">able to speak different words different</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.210" end="00:46:13.120" style="s2">languages being able to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.190" end="00:46:17.330" style="s2">yourself in multiple things is is better</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.120" end="00:46:18.500" style="s2">than not and the way that we bring the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.330" end="00:46:20.030" style="s2">marginalized voices into the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.500" end="00:46:22.510" style="s2">conversation there are better and worse</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.030" end="00:46:25.180" style="s2">ways of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.510" end="00:46:26.910" style="s2">all right say Jordan Peterson is saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.180" end="00:46:29.200" style="s2">the way that you guys are going about</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.910" end="00:46:33.190" style="s2">bringing these conversations into the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.200" end="00:46:40.060" style="s2">picture into the conversation by</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.190" end="00:46:43.990" style="s2">destroying the canonical the canonical</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.060" end="00:46:46.210" style="s2">is canonical for a reason that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.990" end="00:46:48.010" style="s2">our culture&#39;s through these tens of</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.210" end="00:46:51.250" style="s2">thousands of years in terms of creating</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.010" end="00:46:52.720" style="s2">an ideal have brought it into this</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.250" end="00:46:54.490" style="s2">canonical thing and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.720" end="00:47:01.840" style="s2">built the entire culture around is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.490" end="00:47:03.670" style="s2">Canon the way that you expand that Canon</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.840" end="00:47:05.560" style="s2">the way that you bring the marginalized</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.670" end="00:47:07.510" style="s2">voices in your Canon the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.560" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">create space for marginalized voices to</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.510" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">be in the Canon you have to do that with</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:11.830" style="s2">some sense of grace otherwise you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:15.369" style="s2">just going to destroy the cannon and</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.830" end="00:47:17.680" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna end up with chaos right is</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.369" end="00:47:20.440" style="s2">it would you say is it is it fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.680" end="00:47:23.680" style="s2">that that in trying to destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.440" end="00:47:28.530" style="s2">cannon right that that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.680" end="00:47:32.619" style="s2">taking the worst part of that cannon and</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.530" end="00:47:35.619" style="s2">and then and not knowing that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.619" end="00:47:37.690" style="s2">necessarily and the tap kids that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.619" end="00:47:39.430" style="s2">basically kind of like isn&#39;t isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.690" end="00:47:42.340" style="s2">would it be fair to say that that like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.430" end="00:47:45.810" style="s2">lot of a lot of the social justice stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.340" end="00:47:48.190" style="s2">and the the riots and the protests are</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.810" end="00:47:52.600" style="s2">about kind of in a certain sense are</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.190" end="00:47:54.660" style="s2">like trying to in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.600" end="00:47:57.790" style="s2">destroy something</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.660" end="00:48:01.570" style="s2">it isn&#39;t that kind of like using its own</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.790" end="00:48:05.859" style="s2">logic unknowingly wouldn&#39;t you say Oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.570" end="00:48:08.290" style="s2">certainly yes yes certainly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.859" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">certainly there&#39;s a and there&#39;s an irony</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.290" end="00:48:12.580" style="s2">in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:15.100" style="s2">yeah right it&#39;s it&#39;s the the classic</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.580" end="00:48:17.140" style="s2">example is that you know people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.100" end="00:48:20.980" style="s2">using their iPhones to say down with</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.140" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">capitalism right there&#39;s an irony in it</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.980" end="00:48:26.290" style="s2">like you&#39;re using capitalism to just to</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:28.390" style="s2">destroy itself you wouldn&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.290" end="00:48:33.820" style="s2">do the things you want to do without it</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.390" end="00:48:35.530" style="s2">but you&#39;re gonna destroy it mm-hmm so to</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.820" end="00:48:36.250" style="s2">take the worst of something and to</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.530" end="00:48:38.860" style="s2">attack the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.250" end="00:48:42.220" style="s2">first of something without recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.860" end="00:48:44.080" style="s2">its value this is Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.220" end="00:48:51.280" style="s2">thing like he says there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.080" end="00:48:54.700" style="s2">gratitude right the that the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.280" end="00:48:58.300" style="s2">we all live like even the poor amongst</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.700" end="00:49:01.480" style="s2">us pretty much live better than 16th</p>

<p begin="00:49:01.480" end="00:49:12.130" style="s2">like they didn&#39;t have running water they</p>

<p begin="00:49:19.300" end="00:49:25.300" style="s2">even think of we just take for granted</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.830" end="00:49:31.210" style="s2">and then we look at the one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.300" end="00:49:32.200" style="s2">not there yet mm-hmm and then shoot the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.210" end="00:49:34.510" style="s2">whole thing and then shoot the whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.200" end="00:49:36.340" style="s2">thing not recognizing that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.510" end="00:49:38.740" style="s2">society is built on that one thing and</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.340" end="00:49:41.110" style="s2">if you take that thing down it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.740" end="00:49:43.180" style="s2">gonna lead to better it&#39;s going to lead</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.110" end="00:49:45.790" style="s2">to a crumbling and chaos and in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.180" end="00:49:51.580" style="s2">current chaos we&#39;re going to regress to</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.790" end="00:49:54.990" style="s2">lower levels yeah yeah we&#39;re attacking</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.580" end="00:49:58.600" style="s2">the worst part of something beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.990" end="00:50:02.770" style="s2">without recognizing it&#39;s beautiful we</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.600" end="00:50:05.500" style="s2">are in in the classic metaphor we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.770" end="00:50:08.020" style="s2">cutting off the branch on which we are</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.500" end="00:50:11.890" style="s2">perched we&#39;re selling off the branch on</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.020" end="00:50:15.300" style="s2">which we&#39;re perched right right yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.890" end="00:50:17.650" style="s2">tree has some unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.300" end="00:50:19.990" style="s2">characteristics there are some dead</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.650" end="00:50:22.420" style="s2">leaves there are some poisonous berries</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.990" end="00:50:23.620" style="s2">like there or whatever it is and so what</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.420" end="00:50:26.650" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do is we&#39;re gonna chop off</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.620" end="00:50:28.900" style="s2">the tree at its roots not realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.650" end="00:50:32.230" style="s2">the whole thing is going to crumble if</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.900" end="00:50:35.410" style="s2">we do that hmm I&#39;d say that&#39;s Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.230" end="00:50:38.890" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s main critique it&#39;s like yes</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.410" end="00:50:40.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a tyrannical father and yes no</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.890" end="00:50:43.990" style="s2">matter how you look at it there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.770" end="00:50:48.390" style="s2">some part of the father the existing</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.990" end="00:50:53.089" style="s2">culture which is tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.390" end="00:50:53.089" style="s2">right no matter how good did you get it</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.720" end="00:51:00.390" style="s2">you&#39;ll just refine your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.130" end="00:51:05.430" style="s2">until you can find something wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.390" end="00:51:07.170" style="s2">that right I say that that&#39;s asymptotic</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.430" end="00:51:08.369" style="s2">but that&#39;s just the nature of things the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.170" end="00:51:10.019" style="s2">more you clean the room the more you</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.369" end="00:51:12.599" style="s2">notice where it&#39;s still still dirty</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.019" end="00:51:14.160" style="s2">we&#39;re in it the more you accelerate the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.599" end="00:51:16.980" style="s2">vehicle the more you reckon you come</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.160" end="00:51:19.140" style="s2">across this limitations you can fix the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.980" end="00:51:21.599" style="s2">engine it goes faster sure and it starts</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.140" end="00:51:23.400" style="s2">to wobble at a certain speed so you fix</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.599" end="00:51:24.869" style="s2">the alignment so you can go faster but</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.400" end="00:51:26.970" style="s2">then the brakes don&#39;t work at the faster</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.869" end="00:51:28.769" style="s2">speed and the faster you go you keep</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.970" end="00:51:30.569" style="s2">coming across the limitations and I say</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.769" end="00:51:34.499" style="s2">that&#39;s asymptotic it just always happens</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.569" end="00:51:38.480" style="s2">the morning so if you&#39;re going to attack</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.499" end="00:51:40.769" style="s2">a culture you&#39;re gonna attack a language</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.480" end="00:51:44.670" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna attack the canonical</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.769" end="00:51:47.309" style="s2">version of something for its limitations</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.670" end="00:51:52.319" style="s2">for its faults without recognizing the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.309" end="00:51:55.039" style="s2">value that it brings you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.319" end="00:51:56.910" style="s2">cutting off the perch on which year</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.910" end="00:52:04.529" style="s2">you&#39;re perched and so this imagination</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.430" end="00:52:07.880" style="s2">thing this individual the self that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.529" end="00:52:10.859" style="s2">recognizing how does it use imagination</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.880" end="00:52:12.839" style="s2">to refine its vision and therefore who</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.859" end="00:52:15.749" style="s2">it can be what it&#39;s moving towards and</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.839" end="00:52:18.589" style="s2">how it builds the self how it builds the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.749" end="00:52:22.170" style="s2">story the character of who I think I am</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.589" end="00:52:23.970" style="s2">moving towards this ideal given that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.170" end="00:52:25.950" style="s2">inheriting a certain set of phonemes</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.970" end="00:52:31.079" style="s2">like my culture has taught me to be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.950" end="00:52:33.900" style="s2">certain way and that&#39;s a set of</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.079" end="00:52:37.230" style="s2">limitations but also possibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.900" end="00:52:38.789" style="s2">I&#39;d say in Jordan Peterson says like</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.230" end="00:52:42.890" style="s2">well let&#39;s look at all the possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.789" end="00:52:47.039" style="s2">that creates like we have more wealth</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.890" end="00:52:49.200" style="s2">than anyone in human history people</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.039" end="00:52:52.019" style="s2">could not even imagine the levels of</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.200" end="00:52:53.940" style="s2">wealth that we have right go back a</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.019" end="00:52:56.670" style="s2">thousand years five hundred years even</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.940" end="00:53:01.619" style="s2">300 years to imagine the level of wealth</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.670" end="00:53:02.340" style="s2">that we have they would be like we are</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.619" end="00:53:06.420" style="s2">Richard</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.340" end="00:53:07.850" style="s2">all the dreams of avarice but we just</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.420" end="00:53:11.970" style="s2">look at and go yeah yeah whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.850" end="00:53:14.460" style="s2">that&#39;s just the given now let&#39;s find out</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.970" end="00:53:16.560" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong and we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.460" end="00:53:19.260" style="s2">sacrifice all the structures that hold</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.560" end="00:53:21.180" style="s2">this thing in place yeah in order to</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.260" end="00:53:24.470" style="s2">critique it that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.180" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">completely out of balance with that and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.470" end="00:53:33.990" style="s2">the self yeah totally individual in</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:36.210" style="s2">order for the individual to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.990" end="00:53:37.740" style="s2">in order for this to work better I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.210" end="00:53:40.590" style="s2">know why it&#39;s that way but in order for</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.740" end="00:53:43.050" style="s2">it to work better in order for us to</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.590" end="00:53:43.800" style="s2">move more towards the ideal and in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.050" end="00:53:46.170" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.800" end="00:53:47.730" style="s2">imagine a self that we can then embody</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.170" end="00:53:48.650" style="s2">and get better and better and better and</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.730" end="00:53:52.410" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.650" end="00:53:54.870" style="s2">yeah like a fundamental piece is to</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.410" end="00:53:58.230" style="s2">acknowledge all of the goodness which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.870" end="00:54:00.000" style="s2">there acknowledge the tree in which we</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.230" end="00:54:01.710" style="s2">are perched the branch on which were</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.000" end="00:54:03.420" style="s2">perched the goodness that we are the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.710" end="00:54:08.190" style="s2">skills that we&#39;ve developed the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.420" end="00:54:11.580" style="s2">capacities that we have at least as much</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.190" end="00:54:16.140" style="s2">if not more than finding fault with what</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.580" end="00:54:22.170" style="s2">we have yet to do with the problems we</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.140" end="00:54:23.880" style="s2">have yet to fix in terms of the self and</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.170" end="00:54:28.760" style="s2">the individual what is an individual</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.880" end="00:54:30.840" style="s2">that we want to be right grades totally</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.760" end="00:54:32.820" style="s2">fundamentally one of gratitude of</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.840" end="00:54:39.690" style="s2">acknowledgement which is why I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.820" end="00:54:42.750" style="s2">encircling it&#39;s acknowledging the person</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.690" end="00:54:44.580" style="s2">as they are relating them right as they</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.750" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">are which is the fundament that allows</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.580" end="00:54:50.280" style="s2">us to go into the realms of potential</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:53.130" style="s2">shame to have people look at themselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.280" end="00:54:55.950" style="s2">and recognize their limitations we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.130" end="00:54:57.630" style="s2">just focus on the limitations first we</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.950" end="00:54:59.370" style="s2">make sure that they get seen and gotten</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.630" end="00:55:03.600" style="s2">and acknowledged for who they are and</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.370" end="00:55:05.220" style="s2">that creates the space in which working</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.600" end="00:55:07.290" style="s2">on the next limitation is seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.220" end="00:55:10.790" style="s2">growth rather than something that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.290" end="00:55:13.440" style="s2">need to cut down further in order to</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.790" end="00:55:15.150" style="s2">remake the system from whole cloth which</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.440" end="00:55:16.200" style="s2">is never going to happen because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.150" end="00:55:17.310" style="s2">too damn complex</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.200" end="00:55:20.190" style="s2">it&#39;s like trying to create a language</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.310" end="00:55:22.079" style="s2">from scratch and they think what would I</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.190" end="00:55:26.099" style="s2">think I think that that whole thing we</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.079" end="00:55:28.980" style="s2">just described or like first acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.099" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">right acknowledge everything that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.980" end="00:55:35.490" style="s2">are and the uniqueness that you are and</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:38.070" style="s2">and first and then that&#39;s important so</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.490" end="00:55:41.250" style="s2">that when we look at the limitations it</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.070" end="00:55:44.010" style="s2">is built its it implicitly has a sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.250" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">of a becoming of a unfolding of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.010" end="00:55:51.150" style="s2">fidelity that pelos of a going towards</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:56:00.720" style="s2">um and SAP that sounds a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.150" end="00:56:02.369" style="s2">compassion yes to me yeah so funny I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.720" end="00:56:05.849" style="s2">thinking that really reminds me of ein</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.369" end="00:56:08.820" style="s2">rands keep context she says can&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.849" end="00:56:11.820" style="s2">keep context yeah yeah like you have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.820" end="00:56:13.670" style="s2">keep context like what is the context</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.820" end="00:56:18.089" style="s2">that allows you to notice the problem</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.670" end="00:56:19.920" style="s2">yeah yeah what is the mountain on which</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.089" end="00:56:21.210" style="s2">you&#39;re standing that allows you to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.920" end="00:56:25.079" style="s2">the problem I don&#39;t did you see the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.210" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">deconstruction of the deconstruction</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.079" end="00:56:29.760" style="s2">Wilfred Laurie</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:32.150" style="s2">okay so Jordans latest saying I think he</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.760" end="00:56:34.530" style="s2">heard about this morning here yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.150" end="00:56:37.230" style="s2">he&#39;s talking with couple professors from</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.530" end="00:56:39.089" style="s2">Milford Laurie and the professors like I</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.230" end="00:56:41.460" style="s2">can&#39;t believe that people think that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.089" end="00:56:43.020" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do rationality that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.460" end="00:56:47.700" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do logic and evidence they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.020" end="00:56:49.589" style="s2">actually questioning that right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.700" end="00:56:51.300" style="s2">like they&#39;re chopping off the tree in</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.589" end="00:56:54.150" style="s2">which we in this postmodern move it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.300" end="00:56:57.710" style="s2">like we&#39;re gonna question the standards</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.150" end="00:57:01.650" style="s2">of logic and evidence and objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.710" end="00:57:04.530" style="s2">mm-hmm well yes those are useful things</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.650" end="00:57:08.630" style="s2">to question but from where you going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.530" end="00:57:14.730" style="s2">question them you have to keep context</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.630" end="00:57:18.950" style="s2">mm-hmm right like what methodology are</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.730" end="00:57:18.950" style="s2">you going to use to question methodology</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.540" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">yes right as I you know I ran it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.020" end="00:57:29.260" style="s2">performative contradiction just post</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:31.700" style="s2">modern performer contradiction it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.260" end="00:57:35.680" style="s2">to say that something&#39;s invalid you</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.700" end="00:57:38.210" style="s2">can&#39;t say that logic is invalid because</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.680" end="00:57:44.960" style="s2">in order to say something&#39;s invalid</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.210" end="00:57:46.850" style="s2">you&#39;re invoking logic right it it cuts</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.960" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">itself off she calls that a stolen</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.850" end="00:57:53.840" style="s2">concept right or a performative</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:55.970" style="s2">contradiction yeah that you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.840" end="00:57:58.240" style="s2">something which you can only say if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.970" end="00:58:01.460" style="s2">assume the thing that you&#39;re critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.240" end="00:58:03.020" style="s2">mmhmm yeah yeah in order to say the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.460" end="00:58:06.290" style="s2">logic isn&#39;t valid you have to assume</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.020" end="00:58:10.160" style="s2">logic right in order to critically</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.290" end="00:58:15.590" style="s2">examine rationality you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.160" end="00:58:17.750" style="s2">rationality yeah in order to to discount</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.590" end="00:58:19.610" style="s2">reality you have to presuppose it to</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.750" end="00:58:21.710" style="s2">discount it yes you have to presuppose</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.610" end="00:58:24.590" style="s2">the reality exists such that you can say</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.710" end="00:58:27.170" style="s2">compare it with something to say that it</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.590" end="00:58:31.310" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exists right it&#39;s so it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.170" end="00:58:36.130" style="s2">perform you have to keep context now in</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.310" end="00:58:38.600" style="s2">human being we can call that compassion</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.130" end="00:58:42.800" style="s2">because we have to acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.600" end="00:58:44.360" style="s2">context of the person yeah to understand</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.800" end="00:58:46.010" style="s2">their behavior and understand how their</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.360" end="00:58:49.280" style="s2">behavior serves them or doesn&#39;t serve</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.010" end="00:58:50.840" style="s2">them relative like their talos you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.280" end="00:58:53.000" style="s2">got this imagination of what could serve</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.840" end="00:58:56.540" style="s2">them or not serve them and to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.000" end="00:58:59.510" style="s2">that relative to where they&#39;re at great</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.540" end="00:59:00.710" style="s2">all right there&#39;s an infant like you</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.510" end="00:59:04.220" style="s2">know I like to say that we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.710" end="00:59:07.220" style="s2">state of infinite failure compared to</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.220" end="00:59:08.840" style="s2">who we could be we suck Yeah right in</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.220" end="00:59:10.250" style="s2">five years from now or a year from now</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.840" end="00:59:11.420" style="s2">or ten years from now we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.250" end="00:59:13.130" style="s2">gotten so much better</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.420" end="00:59:14.390" style="s2">at the things that were really good at</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.130" end="00:59:17.500" style="s2">now that we&#39;re gonna look back and go oh</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.390" end="00:59:19.490" style="s2">god that was really embarrassing I</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.500" end="00:59:22.370" style="s2">thought I was so good at that</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.490" end="00:59:24.410" style="s2">and although I was relative to most</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.370" end="00:59:26.330" style="s2">people and although I was relative to</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.410" end="00:59:28.040" style="s2">who I was before given that I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.330" end="00:59:29.750" style="s2">five years more development in this I</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.040" end="00:59:32.270" style="s2">look back on it and I sucked</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.750" end="00:59:34.220" style="s2">totally and that&#39;s always the case</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.270" end="00:59:35.900" style="s2">there&#39;s always a better</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.220" end="00:59:40.910" style="s2">that you can move towards that when you</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.900" end="00:59:43.480" style="s2">look back who you are sucks we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.910" end="00:59:48.410" style="s2">state of infinite failure on all things</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.480" end="00:59:50.780" style="s2">compared to who we could be right so</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.410" end="00:59:52.310" style="s2">yeah okay yes we&#39;re failing great but</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.780" end="00:59:54.800" style="s2">that&#39;s not what&#39;s important what matters</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.310" end="00:59:58.810" style="s2">is what are we creating and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.800" end="01:00:03.430" style="s2">next thing we can do we could always</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.810" end="01:00:03.430" style="s2">point out to someone how they&#39;re failing</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.580" end="01:00:13.280" style="s2">always but unless that&#39;s gonna serve</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.220" end="01:00:16.760" style="s2">them yeah to actually get better unless</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.280" end="01:00:18.440" style="s2">it unless it&#39;s on that edge of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.760" end="01:00:20.420" style="s2">one I sort of know and you were talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.440" end="01:00:24.890" style="s2">about this earlier it&#39;s like I kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.420" end="01:00:27.200" style="s2">know it but not quite here&#39;s an unknown</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.890" end="01:00:29.930" style="s2">but I have a sense for the unknown I</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.200" end="01:00:31.820" style="s2">have a sense that it is unknown and by</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.930" end="01:00:33.740" style="s2">moving into that space I can use my</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.820" end="01:00:36.140" style="s2">imagination to make sense of the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.740" end="01:00:38.480" style="s2">to try out different possibilities to</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.140" end="01:00:41.270" style="s2">imagine different things and then figure</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.480" end="01:00:43.070" style="s2">out which one is better and then test it</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.270" end="01:00:44.630" style="s2">and find out does it work or not I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.070" end="01:00:46.599" style="s2">come up with a solution does it work I</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.630" end="01:00:50.030" style="s2">can get better and better and better but</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.599" end="01:00:51.589" style="s2">you&#39;ve gotta keep context you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.030" end="01:00:54.619" style="s2">stay compassionate to where the person</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.589" end="01:00:57.650" style="s2">is so that you can point out something</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.619" end="01:01:00.530" style="s2">that they can actually grow into rather</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.650" end="01:01:03.440" style="s2">than just condemning them as bad right</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.530" end="01:01:07.490" style="s2">how does that serve other than to get</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.440" end="01:01:11.510" style="s2">power over them and is that really what</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.490" end="01:01:13.849" style="s2">we want is really what we want power is</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.510" end="01:01:17.810" style="s2">that really like the post-modern you</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.849" end="01:01:19.070" style="s2">know again peterson says in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.810" end="01:01:22.820" style="s2">postmodern thing it&#39;s all just</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.070" end="01:01:25.130" style="s2">discourses about power right the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.820" end="01:01:27.050" style="s2">standards that we use rationality logic</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.130" end="01:01:29.420" style="s2">those are all just mailed patriarchal</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.050" end="01:01:37.940" style="s2">forms that we use in order to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.420" end="01:01:40.099" style="s2">power really right are we gonna cut off</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.940" end="01:01:45.890" style="s2">the whole tree because we don&#39;t like one</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.099" end="01:01:47.180" style="s2">of the leaves we&#39;ve got to keep context</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.890" end="01:01:49.099" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to be compassionate</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.180" end="01:01:51.650" style="s2">two people that were speaking with to</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.099" end="01:01:55.460" style="s2">the culture that we&#39;re living right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.650" end="01:01:57.349" style="s2">totally and what you&#39;re saying is what I</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.460" end="01:01:59.030" style="s2">hear you sing as you&#39;re talking I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.349" end="01:02:00.829" style="s2">trading that the word dignity keeps</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.030" end="01:02:02.960" style="s2">going through my mind about like what is</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.829" end="01:02:07.520" style="s2">it to honor some dignity and I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.960" end="01:02:10.670" style="s2">what I&#39;m hearing you say is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.520" end="01:02:14.869" style="s2">essentially it&#39;s acknowledging in some</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.670" end="01:02:16.490" style="s2">way or holding context right or or what</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.869" end="01:02:18.619" style="s2">is what did you say and repeats and</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.490" end="01:02:21.619" style="s2">contests keep in context right</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.619" end="01:02:23.420" style="s2">keeping awareness of the context of what</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.619" end="01:02:27.470" style="s2">kind of being you&#39;re actually relating</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.420" end="01:02:29.660" style="s2">to which is that primarily the thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.470" end="01:02:32.690" style="s2">that even has them make mistakes and</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.660" end="01:02:36.740" style="s2">gives it as a mistake right is this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.690" end="01:02:40.670" style="s2">this draw towards better is is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.740" end="01:02:42.859" style="s2">there&#39;s a North Star in which has me</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.670" end="01:02:44.960" style="s2">even take a scent in the first place let</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.859" end="01:02:48.559" style="s2">alone stumble and do all the things that</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.960" end="01:02:51.650" style="s2">I do that that impulse that fundaments</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.559" end="01:02:54.829" style="s2">is core to being human and it&#39;s fun is</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.650" end="01:02:57.020" style="s2">ultimately good and what I&#39;m hearing you</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.829" end="01:03:01.220" style="s2">say is like compassion is really holding</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.020" end="01:03:02.690" style="s2">that context as primary which then since</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.220" end="01:03:06.109" style="s2">its primary it will give every way that</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.690" end="01:03:09.740" style="s2">you relate above it so the question I</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.109" end="01:03:14.619" style="s2">have okay it&#39;s what is it that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.740" end="01:03:17.359" style="s2">on right now or what is it that goes on</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.619" end="01:03:24.290" style="s2">that where it would make sense to not do</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.359" end="01:03:28.190" style="s2">that like to like for example make these</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.290" end="01:03:30.200" style="s2">kind of broad general sweet like notions</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.190" end="01:03:34.880" style="s2">about like all logic is the patriarchy</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.200" end="01:03:37.069" style="s2">it&#39;s like biocentrism in and all of</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.880" end="01:03:39.920" style="s2">these kind of like like completely</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.069" end="01:03:44.150" style="s2">nominal izing wiping things and just</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.920" end="01:03:47.359" style="s2">basically assuming bad dropping context</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.150" end="01:03:51.049" style="s2">not being contraction &#39;t yeah yeah not</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.359" end="01:03:54.530" style="s2">honoring the tree right that has given</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.049" end="01:03:56.359" style="s2">birth to the branch right that has given</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.530" end="01:03:59.119" style="s2">birth to the leaf that you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.359" end="01:04:00.300" style="s2">challenge with right you know what</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.119" end="01:04:03.150" style="s2">causes that</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.300" end="01:04:07.080" style="s2">well what is it like yeah what is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.150" end="01:04:09.630" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a broad question but like</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.080" end="01:04:13.920" style="s2">what is the impulse to do the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.630" end="01:04:15.870" style="s2">right we say good if the one&#39;s good and</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.920" end="01:04:18.060" style="s2">the other ones bad or the ones good and</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.870" end="01:04:20.580" style="s2">evil that particular fight that urge</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.060" end="01:04:22.860" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of pleasure there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.580" end="01:04:24.540" style="s2">some kind of resentment or revenge thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.860" end="01:04:29.160" style="s2">or something that seems like it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.540" end="01:04:31.140" style="s2">on it seems to be motivating a lot of a</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.160" end="01:04:33.500" style="s2">lot of what I&#39;m hearing about I mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.140" end="01:04:37.320" style="s2">just you know I live in Berkeley and</p>

<p begin="01:04:37.320" end="01:04:41.400" style="s2">protest going on who is for the most</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.510" end="01:04:43.620" style="s2">part he was a look I think he&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.400" end="01:04:48.480" style="s2">bit middle to the little bit to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.620" end="01:04:50.430" style="s2">right and that they had been at Berkeley</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.480" end="01:04:53.160" style="s2">had him on as a speaker there was this</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.430" end="01:04:54.870" style="s2">huge protest and I remember I had a</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.160" end="01:04:57.240" style="s2">meeting and there&#39;s so many helicopters</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.870" end="01:04:59.610" style="s2">circling around that literally we had to</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.240" end="01:05:01.770" style="s2">speak up during the meeting and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.610" end="01:05:05.580" style="s2">strangest thing is that the next morning</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.770" end="01:05:06.450" style="s2">when I walked outside on the church</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.580" end="01:05:08.820" style="s2">across the street</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.450" end="01:05:10.620" style="s2">I&#39;m on both churches on all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.820" end="01:05:12.960" style="s2">buildings up and down the block was the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.620" end="01:05:17.510" style="s2">hammer and sickle sign was spray-painted</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.960" end="01:05:21.660" style="s2">everywhere it was the strangest most</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.510" end="01:05:26.100" style="s2">eerie feeling and I really got the sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.660" end="01:05:27.450" style="s2">of when I saw that oh it&#39;s like two</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.100" end="01:05:30.240" style="s2">things with your mind the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.450" end="01:05:34.530" style="s2">was like really we we want to try that</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.240" end="01:05:37.980" style="s2">again like 130 million people were</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.530" end="01:05:41.460" style="s2">slaughtered by those governments right</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.980" end="01:05:44.280" style="s2">first of all do we want like do we want</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.460" end="01:05:48.000" style="s2">to keep trying that and the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.280" end="01:05:50.130" style="s2">that I was like okay so given that I got</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.000" end="01:05:51.540" style="s2">the sense that like I really didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.130" end="01:05:54.300" style="s2">the sense that the people who were</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.540" end="01:05:57.030" style="s2">spray-painting that even had a clue of</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.300" end="01:05:58.890" style="s2">what they were spray-painting like I</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.030" end="01:06:00.960" style="s2">think it was a little bit more I just</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.890" end="01:06:02.940" style="s2">got the sense of like I I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.960" end="01:06:05.700" style="s2">guessing but I don&#39;t have consensus</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.940" end="01:06:08.910" style="s2">whether they&#39;re thinking like I&#39;m for</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.700" end="01:06:10.980" style="s2">communism based out of the like really</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.910" end="01:06:12.690" style="s2">looking at what communism is and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.980" end="01:06:12.970" style="s2">really believe in it enough examine it</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.690" end="01:06:15.670" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.970" end="01:06:17.080" style="s2">for I&#39;m sure those people probably</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.670" end="01:06:19.510" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t spray-paint the hammer and</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.080" end="01:06:21.520" style="s2">sickle on the on the wall maybe they</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.510" end="01:06:23.859" style="s2">would but just I had that sense that</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.520" end="01:06:27.070" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of bigger thing kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.859" end="01:06:31.359" style="s2">of underneath people that are doing</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.070" end="01:06:34.960" style="s2">these kinds of crazy things I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.359" end="01:06:39.550" style="s2">wondering what your what is that thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.960" end="01:06:46.680" style="s2">that what is that thing that that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.550" end="01:06:46.680" style="s2">motivating this like what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.780" end="01:06:58.790" style="s2">this is what the leg is to consider the</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.980" end="01:07:01.770" style="s2">question may be said watching your face</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.790" end="01:07:07.200" style="s2">sooner possibly may be going on so</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.770" end="01:07:09.150" style="s2">there&#39;s what it&#39;s like to consider the</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.200" end="01:07:13.950" style="s2">question is it&#39;s not so much about the</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.150" end="01:07:16.740" style="s2">question it&#39;s about what how the</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.950" end="01:07:21.720" style="s2">question fits into our context into our</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.740" end="01:07:25.500" style="s2">societal issues right because how I</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.720" end="01:07:29.280" style="s2">answer the question isn&#39;t I&#39;m just not</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.500" end="01:07:33.030" style="s2">I&#39;m not answering it for me and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.280" end="01:07:40.560" style="s2">just answering it for you I&#39;m answering</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.030" end="01:07:46.830" style="s2">it for those who wish to preserve the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.560" end="01:07:48.720" style="s2">tree while also enhancing the tree those</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.830" end="01:07:55.220" style="s2">who are doing the hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.720" end="01:08:00.990" style="s2">according to Jordan Peters when you are</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.220" end="01:08:05.570" style="s2">honoring the healthy father in search of</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.990" end="01:08:10.080" style="s2">the healthy mother rather than battling</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.570" end="01:08:12.600" style="s2">the healthy father putting all father</p>

<p begin="01:08:12.600" end="01:08:18.980" style="s2">into goddess mother right the people who</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.400" end="01:08:22.970" style="s2">are really trying to move that forward</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.980" end="01:08:26.700" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m speaking to them as well</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.970" end="01:08:29.820" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s a very very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.700" end="01:08:37.200" style="s2">question to answer because it&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.820" end="01:08:39.050" style="s2">ugly answer and in the context of</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.200" end="01:08:45.240" style="s2">compassion that we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.050" end="01:08:46.740" style="s2">mm-hmm the the answer of why that</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.240" end="01:08:51.890" style="s2">happens what is the process by which</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.740" end="01:08:55.350" style="s2">that happens it&#39;s both ugly and</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.890" end="01:08:59.630" style="s2">compassionate like to understand what</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.350" end="01:09:03.100" style="s2">what causes someone to spray paint a</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.630" end="01:09:12.199" style="s2">symbol of communism</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.100" end="01:09:14.870" style="s2">on buildings like what causes like what</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.199" end="01:09:21.679" style="s2">is what are they sinking that they think</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.870" end="01:09:23.210" style="s2">that that is the right thing to do right</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.679" end="01:09:27.529" style="s2">when the compassion is that they think</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.210" end="01:09:29.750" style="s2">it&#39;s the right thing to do like to</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.529" end="01:09:38.299" style="s2">recognize they think that they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.750" end="01:09:41.359" style="s2">heroic but what kind of thinking has you</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.299" end="01:09:44.839" style="s2">think that that is being heroic people</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.359" end="01:09:52.839" style="s2">who are destroying ATMs and breaking in</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.839" end="01:09:59.920" style="s2">windows people who want to smash</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.839" end="01:09:59.920" style="s2">capitalism and literally smash it right</p>

<p begin="01:10:51.050" end="01:10:55.060" style="s2">justifies that kind of thinking where</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.790" end="01:11:04.370" style="s2">you think that by destroying</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.060" end="01:11:08.630" style="s2">infrastructure by doing graffiti of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.370" end="01:11:12.590" style="s2">communist symbol that that is the</p>

<p begin="01:12:46.550" end="01:12:51.199" style="s2">becoming relatively wealthy we&#39;d still</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.710" end="01:12:52.130" style="s2">consider a complete poverty today like</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.199" end="01:12:54.860" style="s2">according to our standards but</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.130" end="01:12:56.960" style="s2">relatively wealthy compared to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.860" end="01:12:58.820" style="s2">else and you have two reasons two ways</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.960" end="01:13:01.880" style="s2">of explaining why they&#39;re wealthy and</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.820" end="01:13:02.599" style="s2">you&#39;re not one is wow they must be doing</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.880" end="01:13:04.489" style="s2">something right</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.599" end="01:13:06.349" style="s2">what can I learn from them in order to</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.489" end="01:13:07.670" style="s2">be able to build the kind of wealth that</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.349" end="01:13:15.219" style="s2">they can build so that I can have that</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.670" end="01:13:18.559" style="s2">kind of life or you can say they are bad</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.219" end="01:13:26.480" style="s2">they&#39;ve gotten it unfairly and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.559" end="01:13:26.870" style="s2">I feel resentment for their success and</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.480" end="01:13:28.610" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.870" end="01:13:31.400" style="s2">someone comes along and taps into that</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.610" end="01:13:33.520" style="s2">resentment and says yeah you know that</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.400" end="01:13:39.190" style="s2">resentment exactly</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.520" end="01:13:39.190" style="s2">you should be resentful let&#39;s get them</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.120" end="01:13:48.580" style="s2">all right so what is it that drives it</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.870" end="01:13:52.870" style="s2">it&#39;s resentment right right</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.580" end="01:13:56.480" style="s2">it&#39;s resentment you know a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.870" end="01:13:58.070" style="s2">huh but like it&#39;s thinking that you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.480" end="01:14:00.440" style="s2">victim and therefore you can self</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.070" end="01:14:03.020" style="s2">righteously attack other people right</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.440" end="01:14:05.510" style="s2">and that&#39;s in what you&#39;re bringing to</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.020" end="01:14:09.380" style="s2">light here is what I&#39;m recalling is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.510" end="01:14:12.500" style="s2">that one of them I think the most tested</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.380" end="01:14:14.630" style="s2">on multiple levels of multiple cultures</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.500" end="01:14:16.720" style="s2">mulcher in almost every single case the</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.630" end="01:14:21.140" style="s2">difference between absolute poverty and</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.720" end="01:14:22.730" style="s2">relative poverty where it&#39;s and you made</p>

<p begin="01:14:22.730" end="01:14:27.500" style="s2">keeps it up here a little bit like that</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.080" end="01:14:30.170" style="s2">fat angler wherever there&#39;s a rich into</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.500" end="01:14:32.750" style="s2">poor or there&#39;s extremes as well you</p>

<p begin="01:14:32.750" end="01:14:42.620" style="s2">extreme right is to the degree that the</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.240" end="01:14:43.670" style="s2">poverty the poor and at violence</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.620" end="01:14:45.590" style="s2">wherever that&#39;s happening there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.670" end="01:14:48.170" style="s2">violence the more that&#39;s happening the</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.590" end="01:14:50.810" style="s2">more extreme it is the more violence</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.170" end="01:14:57.340" style="s2">since it happens when everyone harshly</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.810" end="01:14:58.460" style="s2">treat them yeah yes yes but however</p>

<p begin="01:15:33.080" end="01:15:36.530" style="s2">right people gather around those skills</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.030" end="01:15:37.550" style="s2">and they attack one another for the</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.530" end="01:15:39.010" style="s2">thing that they have and the other</p>

<p begin="01:15:52.750" end="01:16:06.880" style="s2">more relatively they&#39;re rich and if</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.320" end="01:16:15.400" style="s2">resentment is in your character if you</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.880" end="01:16:19.440" style="s2">have cultivated resentment you will take</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.400" end="01:16:24.610" style="s2">any difference as an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.440" end="01:16:27.400" style="s2">project yourself righteousness right so</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.610" end="01:16:30.700" style="s2">it is true that the more extreme the gap</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.400" end="01:16:36.030" style="s2">the more the more easy the symbolism is</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.700" end="01:16:36.030" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t matter yeah right again</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.680" end="01:16:44.320" style="s2">if you go into any group resentment</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.190" end="01:16:46.120" style="s2">raises its head right and this is part</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.320" end="01:16:48.730" style="s2">of the compassion of human beings is</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.120" end="01:16:51.340" style="s2">that where we I talk about shame and</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.730" end="01:16:53.020" style="s2">guilt right there&#39;s the personal there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.340" end="01:16:57.910" style="s2">what does this say about me what&#39;s my</p>

<p begin="01:17:02.800" end="01:17:09.510" style="s2">as my life worse right now these two</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.710" end="01:17:12.610" style="s2">things that you got shame and shame is</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.510" end="01:17:16.570" style="s2">horrible when like your identity is at</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.610" end="01:17:18.160" style="s2">stake who you think you are hmm</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.570" end="01:17:21.990" style="s2">when that&#39;s at stake you try to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.160" end="01:17:25.870" style="s2">something to counteract that well and</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.990" end="01:17:27.190" style="s2">that leads to resentment well like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.870" end="01:17:28.960" style="s2">like oh I have to be better than that</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.190" end="01:17:31.180" style="s2">person so I constantly have to find</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.960" end="01:17:32.220" style="s2">other people wrong so that I can feel</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.180" end="01:17:35.260" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.220" end="01:17:38.470" style="s2">mmm-hmm to try to swage this feeling of</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.260" end="01:17:40.090" style="s2">shame mm-hmm yeah right or I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.470" end="01:17:42.310" style="s2">constantly trying to prove myself that I</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.090" end="01:17:44.710" style="s2">actually am better I get better grades</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.310" end="01:17:48.940" style="s2">I&#39;m dance better I sing better I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.710" end="01:17:50.800" style="s2">popular I&#39;m whatever it is and I grab</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.940" end="01:17:52.550" style="s2">that as a way of differentiating myself</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.800" end="01:17:54.560" style="s2">and make myself better</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.550" end="01:17:57.320" style="s2">well to the degree that I&#39;m feeling</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.560" end="01:17:58.940" style="s2">shame I&#39;m gonna build resentment and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.320" end="01:18:01.880" style="s2">gonna attack others so that I can feel</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.940" end="01:18:03.470" style="s2">better than them huh right to the degree</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.880" end="01:18:04.820" style="s2">that I let go of the shame and this is</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.470" end="01:18:07.400" style="s2">the personal development the</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.820" end="01:18:10.010" style="s2">transformation to that you let go of</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.400" end="01:18:11.390" style="s2">shame and circling we we see someone and</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.010" end="01:18:17.720" style="s2">we say yeah that&#39;s who you are that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.390" end="01:18:19.610" style="s2">okay really yeah Wow I&#39;m free well what</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.720" end="01:18:21.650" style="s2">do I want to do now I want to do</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.610" end="01:18:23.690" style="s2">something better and they move from</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.650" end="01:18:27.080" style="s2">shame into guilt into just making their</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.690" end="01:18:31.520" style="s2">lives better looking for more wealth</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.080" end="01:18:35.090" style="s2">more happiness more meaning prosperity</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.520" end="01:18:38.240" style="s2">pleasure and purpose so it is true that</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.090" end="01:18:40.550" style="s2">the more extreme it is the easier it is</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.240" end="01:18:42.260" style="s2">for people to call on the symbols to</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.550" end="01:18:46.850" style="s2">leverage resentment to build political</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.260" end="01:18:48.350" style="s2">will yeah but almost all politics is</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.850" end="01:18:51.170" style="s2">just about leveraging people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.350" end="01:18:53.390" style="s2">resentment to create an other to create</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.170" end="01:18:55.250" style="s2">an enemy so that you can create enough</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.390" end="01:18:58.010" style="s2">solidarity that you can leverage them</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.250" end="01:18:59.810" style="s2">for power and I think that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.010" end="01:19:05.720" style="s2">going on much more than the extremes and</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.810" end="01:19:07.460" style="s2">wealth yeah totally totally is I really</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.720" end="01:19:09.590" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s about well it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.460" end="01:19:12.020" style="s2">not about inequality yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.590" end="01:19:15.200" style="s2">that&#39;s really not what it&#39;s about yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.020" end="01:19:17.270" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s just the thing that we use</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.200" end="01:19:18.550" style="s2">to leverage resentment and by the way</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.270" end="01:19:21.890" style="s2">the other thing about social justice</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.550" end="01:19:24.680" style="s2">like you could say Marxism was really</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.890" end="01:19:27.890" style="s2">focused on wealth and money on capital</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.680" end="01:19:29.750" style="s2">how much money do you have right but</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.890" end="01:19:33.010" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t enough to divide people so</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.750" end="01:19:34.820" style="s2">we&#39;ve started well know how much how</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.010" end="01:19:38.300" style="s2">what&#39;s your race</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.820" end="01:19:39.850" style="s2">what&#39;s your sex what&#39;s your sexual</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.300" end="01:19:46.060" style="s2">orientation</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.850" end="01:19:46.060" style="s2">what&#39;s your culture right we just keep</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.330" end="01:19:50.930" style="s2">heightening the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.590" end="01:19:52.790" style="s2">things such that we can find inequity</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.930" end="01:19:54.490" style="s2">such that we can feel resentful such</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.790" end="01:19:58.310" style="s2">that it justifies our self-righteousness</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.490" end="01:20:02.270" style="s2">right and and people are just getting</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.310" end="01:20:06.350" style="s2">flex in my perspectives totally people</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.270" end="01:20:09.110" style="s2">are we feel shame they see yourself down</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.350" end="01:20:11.540" style="s2">yeah and so they look for something to</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.110" end="01:20:13.520" style="s2">blame for that right and then people</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.540" end="01:20:16.820" style="s2">come along and give them a plausible</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.520" end="01:20:19.130" style="s2">reason right the Communists came to the</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.820" end="01:20:21.350" style="s2">kulaks tapped into the resentment and</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.130" end="01:20:22.760" style="s2">and they killed and imprisoned people</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.350" end="01:20:27.650" style="s2">and sent them away and they took their</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.760" end="01:20:30.380" style="s2">stuff but that&#39;s fundamentally based and</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.650" end="01:20:35.900" style="s2">resentment and I think that that like</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.380" end="01:20:36.650" style="s2">that fractal perspective explains what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.900" end="01:20:38.960" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.650" end="01:20:42.680" style="s2">so it&#39;s an ugly explanation about why</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.960" end="01:20:46.210" style="s2">people would paint why is it then ben</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.680" end="01:20:49.570" style="s2">shapiro obviously a firebrand</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.210" end="01:20:51.770" style="s2">provocative speaker i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.570" end="01:20:55.010" style="s2">variant protects the money would yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.770" end="01:20:56.930" style="s2">cuz yeah it happened with milo as well</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.010" end="01:20:58.670" style="s2">but they didn&#39;t actually have the event</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.930" end="01:21:05.600" style="s2">and so they weren&#39;t all the helicopters</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.670" end="01:21:07.250" style="s2">and stuff where right he&#39;s provocative</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.600" end="01:21:10.460" style="s2">he&#39;s conservative but he&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.250" end="01:21:12.380" style="s2">pretty reasonable guy mmm-hmm right</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.460" end="01:21:20.620" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of reasons to disagree with</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.380" end="01:21:23.540" style="s2">him but to call him evil no that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.620" end="01:21:27.860" style="s2">that&#39;s like who are you talking about</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.540" end="01:21:32.690" style="s2">yeah yeah and so to spray hammers and</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.860" end="01:21:35.420" style="s2">sickles that&#39;s an expression of</p>

<p begin="01:23:48.370" end="01:23:56.380" style="s2">interesting because I think it lies</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.520" end="01:23:59.350" style="s2">somewhere in that in the strange way</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.380" end="01:24:01.350" style="s2">it&#39;s like it seems to be it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.350" end="01:24:03.880" style="s2">that there&#39;s something like resentment</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.350" end="01:24:06.820" style="s2">resentment in this way is almost like a</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.880" end="01:24:10.510" style="s2">dyslexic it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s courage</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.820" end="01:24:14.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a a dyslexic courage right</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.510" end="01:24:17.710" style="s2">it&#39;s like courage worn inside out right</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.760" end="01:24:20.970" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s like to take on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.710" end="01:24:22.690" style="s2">burden of being right which is immense</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.970" end="01:24:25.030" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna make it out alive</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.690" end="01:24:28.810" style="s2">already one of the first things you</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.030" end="01:24:30.040" style="s2">learn right it&#39;s hard there&#39;s all kinds</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.810" end="01:24:32.749" style="s2">of tragedies that are gonna happen</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.040" end="01:24:34.999" style="s2">guaranteed right</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.749" end="01:24:37.760" style="s2">well what is it response what is like</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.999" end="01:24:39.650" style="s2">pragmatically what&#39;s the what&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.760" end="01:24:41.420" style="s2">to set yourself up such that you can</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.650" end="01:24:44.059" style="s2">make the most out of that</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.420" end="01:24:45.559" style="s2">it&#39;s what&#39;s parent what&#39;s that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.059" end="01:24:50.780" style="s2">interesting about that is do the harder</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.559" end="01:24:52.699" style="s2">thing right like like the not harder</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.780" end="01:24:57.019" style="s2">thing in this case is to go out like in</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.699" end="01:24:59.239" style="s2">like protest and unlike spray paint it</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.019" end="01:25:00.889" style="s2">seems to me spray paint you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.239" end="01:25:04.940" style="s2">communist signs all over the place</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.889" end="01:25:07.969" style="s2">um that&#39;s more of kind of like the</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.940" end="01:25:09.769" style="s2">easier route to take like the more</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.969" end="01:25:11.630" style="s2">disruptive route it&#39;ll make things worse</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.769" end="01:25:13.699" style="s2">but there&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like it just</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.630" end="01:25:15.170" style="s2">seems to me that that and they think</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.699" end="01:25:22.219" style="s2">this is what you was kind of talking</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.170" end="01:25:23.269" style="s2">about a bit was was that if you listen</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.219" end="01:25:25.579" style="s2">to your conscience</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.269" end="01:25:28.039" style="s2">it will it will direct you towards the</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.579" end="01:25:29.389" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s the most you know it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.039" end="01:25:32.389" style="s2">it&#39;ll direct you towards the thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.389" end="01:25:34.519" style="s2">that&#39;s most true you up to usually the</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.389" end="01:25:35.300" style="s2">thing that you don&#39;t want to do but that</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.519" end="01:25:37.869" style="s2">if you did it</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.300" end="01:25:41.570" style="s2">if he sacrifice the current pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.869" end="01:25:44.090" style="s2">ultimately it&#39;ll you&#39;ll be rewarded and</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.570" end="01:25:45.800" style="s2">that&#39;s true biologically right like when</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.090" end="01:25:47.599" style="s2">we do something on earth I think you</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.800" end="01:25:50.420" style="s2">taught me this right like um at first</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.599" end="01:25:52.429" style="s2">ever since you said this you have your</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.420" end="01:25:54.829" style="s2">to-do lists every time you do something</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.429" end="01:25:56.150" style="s2">that is uncomfortable or hard and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.829" end="01:25:59.479" style="s2">check it off you get a little dopamine</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.150" end="01:26:03.849" style="s2">hits like I think that that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.479" end="01:26:06.619" style="s2">interesting that like our biology is</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.849" end="01:26:09.829" style="s2">rewards us for doing something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.619" end="01:26:11.749" style="s2">actually more difficult than easy in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.829" end="01:26:14.210" style="s2">long run that we can actually start to</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.749" end="01:26:18.019" style="s2">be attracted to attracted to the thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.210" end="01:26:20.420" style="s2">that&#39;s most hard and so my sense of it I</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.019" end="01:26:22.460" style="s2">don&#39;t think that you know you can be</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.420" end="01:26:24.440" style="s2">courageous and like towards the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.460" end="01:26:29.179" style="s2">end so I don&#39;t think courage is like an</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.440" end="01:26:32.840" style="s2">end in itself but it seems to me that it</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.179" end="01:26:37.309" style="s2">seems to me that like the opposite of</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.840" end="01:26:40.190" style="s2">acting eventually resentfully is is the</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.309" end="01:26:42.769" style="s2">opposite of that or the counter move or</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.190" end="01:26:45.850" style="s2">that would be something like moving</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.769" end="01:26:48.340" style="s2">toward and understanding what I&#39;m Lisa</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.850" end="01:26:50.290" style="s2">about from its own position those kinds</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.340" end="01:26:54.160" style="s2">of things like the things that like</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.290" end="01:26:58.660" style="s2">where I seek to understand rather than</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.160" end="01:27:00.970" style="s2">being understood I seek to know versus</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.660" end="01:27:04.390" style="s2">being known that father father was to</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.970" end="01:27:10.060" style="s2">see prayer know Saint Francis the st.</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.390" end="01:27:13.450" style="s2">Francis birth okay but that seems like</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.060" end="01:27:16.510" style="s2">something you choose to be too so the</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.450" end="01:27:18.040" style="s2">word that I use that sums that sums it</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.510" end="01:27:21.910" style="s2">up is responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.040" end="01:27:26.260" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s to take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.910" end="01:27:29.020" style="s2">what you are doing and what you are</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.260" end="01:27:33.370" style="s2">creative it&#39;s to say that that which is</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.020" end="01:27:35.860" style="s2">happening is an expression of you right</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.370" end="01:27:37.720" style="s2">right verse it&#39;s - it&#39;s to be a cause</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.860" end="01:27:42.630" style="s2">versus to be in effect you can say</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.720" end="01:27:42.630" style="s2">fundamentally if the world is it fault</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.790" end="01:27:52.360" style="s2">right then you&#39;re a victim and</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.980" end="01:27:54.940" style="s2">victimhood leads to self-righteousness</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.360" end="01:27:56.830" style="s2">when you declare yourself to be a victim</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.940" end="01:27:59.350" style="s2">that means that there&#39;s a perpetrator</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.830" end="01:28:03.850" style="s2">and you become self-righteous against</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.350" end="01:28:07.480" style="s2">that perpetrator yeah right and that</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.850" end="01:28:09.280" style="s2">leads to the whole cycle yes now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.480" end="01:28:14.130" style="s2">now you become a self-righteous asshole</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.280" end="01:28:16.570" style="s2">you paint hammers and sickles on</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.130" end="01:28:18.010" style="s2">buildings where you paint a swastika on</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.570" end="01:28:21.670" style="s2">buildings same thing</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.010" end="01:28:23.800" style="s2">currently st. curly so now you are the</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.670" end="01:28:27.190" style="s2">victim and so you were self righteously</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.800" end="01:28:29.670" style="s2">declaring attacking the perpetrator of</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.190" end="01:28:31.000" style="s2">patriarchy capitalism whatever it is and</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.670" end="01:28:33.970" style="s2">attacking it</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.000" end="01:28:36.190" style="s2">but without and here&#39;s the main thing if</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.970" end="01:28:37.060" style="s2">you&#39;re taking it as a victim from self</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.190" end="01:28:39.430" style="s2">righteousness</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.060" end="01:28:40.660" style="s2">but without a higher ideal that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.430" end="01:28:43.960" style="s2">presenting something else that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.660" end="01:28:46.330" style="s2">moving towards well the ideal is to take</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.960" end="01:28:48.970" style="s2">down the existing it&#39;s to cut down the</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.330" end="01:28:49.990" style="s2">tree we&#39;re gonna destroy private</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.970" end="01:28:51.460" style="s2">property we&#39;re gonna take down</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.990" end="01:28:54.190" style="s2">patriarchy we&#39;re gonna take down</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.460" end="01:28:58.340" style="s2">capitalist we&#39;re going to take down the</p>
