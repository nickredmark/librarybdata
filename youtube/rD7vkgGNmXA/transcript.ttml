<p begin="00:00:01.250" end="00:00:10.110" style="s2">right so hello Marilyn and thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.429" end="00:00:14.009" style="s2">making time for us to have this</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.110" end="00:00:16.529" style="s2">conversation I would love to start by</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.009" end="00:00:19.800" style="s2">you telling a little bit about your</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.529" end="00:00:22.080" style="s2">journey of how I know you now live at</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.800" end="00:00:23.310" style="s2">Finland where I&#39;m working with in Hong</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.080" end="00:00:25.939" style="s2">College where we have a connection</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:31.579" style="s2">because I used to work there before and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.939" end="00:00:34.320" style="s2">you moved there and and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.579" end="00:00:35.880" style="s2">rather than me introducing you I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.320" end="00:00:39.480" style="s2">for you to tell a little bit your story</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.880" end="00:00:41.489" style="s2">how did you get interested in in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.480" end="00:00:44.520" style="s2">whole integral framework and what made</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.489" end="00:00:48.780" style="s2">you feel that cities is where you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.520" end="00:00:50.850" style="s2">to give your focus to to the Integra</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.780" end="00:00:52.770" style="s2">story okay thank you</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.850" end="00:00:56.340" style="s2">Daniel and it&#39;s a wonderful way to begin</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.770" end="00:00:59.969" style="s2">this year and this decade of 2020 with</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.340" end="00:01:03.329" style="s2">you I have a interesting background</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.969" end="00:01:06.869" style="s2">around the integral framework that sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.329" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">of grew naturally my career started with</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:10.860" style="s2">developing individuals and then I</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:13.860" style="s2">started working with leaders and teams</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.860" end="00:01:16.409" style="s2">and organizations and sectors and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.860" end="00:01:19.619" style="s2">communities and there was a point at</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.409" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">which I had the experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.619" end="00:01:26.220" style="s2">invited to look at the city and I at</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:28.409" style="s2">first I would call since I live in</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.220" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">pintor and an experience this experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.409" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">almost still a small boy saying this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">where your next step is and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:41.220" style="s2">well I don&#39;t do cities my husband builds</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:43.799" style="s2">them he was a building contractor no so</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.220" end="00:01:46.100" style="s2">I thought about it for a long time I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.799" end="00:01:50.579" style="s2">realized my whole career was about</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.100" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">looking at and somehow catalyzing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.579" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">development of human systems so I said</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:01:56.729" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll look at the city as a human</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:02:00.450" style="s2">system that&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.729" end="00:02:03.479" style="s2">and I then began to realize that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.450" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">fractal patterns that I had discovered</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:08.610" style="s2">in working at smaller scales of human</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">systems also we&#39;re all contained in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.610" end="00:02:13.230" style="s2">city and the city itself as a human</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:15.360" style="s2">system is a large</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.230" end="00:02:18.319" style="s2">fractal pattern that at first I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:21.959" style="s2">say it&#39;s the human system writ large and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:24.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not just about a single human but</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.959" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">it&#39;s about how do we live together so</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.900" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">the patterns in the city represent the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:33.660" style="s2">systems and relationships that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">learned as humans enable us to live</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.660" end="00:02:38.430" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:41.190" style="s2">of course over our histories we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.430" end="00:02:44.099" style="s2">been more than successful and have</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.190" end="00:02:46.440" style="s2">expanded and encroached in the context</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.099" end="00:02:49.110" style="s2">in which we live in in our environments</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.440" end="00:02:52.650" style="s2">which you&#39;re so much an expert about and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.110" end="00:02:56.430" style="s2">I realized that in order for cities to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.650" end="00:02:59.190" style="s2">be ah a fractal they must in some way</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.430" end="00:03:02.849" style="s2">start to integrate reintegrate with</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.190" end="00:03:06.840" style="s2">their ecology with their environments so</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.849" end="00:03:09.660" style="s2">at about the time where I was looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.840" end="00:03:12.750" style="s2">this I had just graduated with going</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.660" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">back to school um and I did a doctorate</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.750" end="00:03:16.859" style="s2">in learning and leadership and self</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:18.900" style="s2">organizing communities it was an online</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.859" end="00:03:20.280" style="s2">community I was working with Margaret</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.900" end="00:03:24.419" style="s2">Wheatley&#39;s work and the Peconic</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.280" end="00:03:27.690" style="s2">community of conversations and what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.419" end="00:03:31.079" style="s2">helped me to do was to see exactly how I</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.690" end="00:03:33.450" style="s2">could find the fractal patterns by</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.079" end="00:03:35.940" style="s2">listening to language by listening to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.450" end="00:03:39.209" style="s2">conversation and waking up to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.940" end="00:03:41.609" style="s2">consciousness and culture as being very</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.209" end="00:03:44.519" style="s2">important to being able to see the city</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.609" end="00:03:46.919" style="s2">as a whole and when I discovered can</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.519" end="00:03:49.260" style="s2">Wilbur&#39;s work in the integral model I</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.919" end="00:03:52.739" style="s2">saw okay we&#39;ve got consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.260" end="00:03:54.870" style="s2">culture that go with the technology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.739" end="00:03:56.519" style="s2">the systems of the city with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.870" end="00:03:59.579" style="s2">behaviors and the systems and together</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.519" end="00:04:05.099" style="s2">these makes a very nice complimentary</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.579" end="00:04:07.560" style="s2">for and so the for whatever calls that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.099" end="00:04:11.690" style="s2">the Tetra arising of these realities</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.560" end="00:04:16.049" style="s2">helped me to be able to see the city as</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.690" end="00:04:18.840" style="s2">first of all whole and then I was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.049" end="00:04:21.269" style="s2">interested in retaining that it be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.840" end="00:04:24.030" style="s2">living system and that it be</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.269" end="00:04:26.610" style="s2">evolutionary so that I recognized the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.030" end="00:04:28.590" style="s2">city was very dynamic so</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.610" end="00:04:30.840" style="s2">those were sort of my quote early</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.590" end="00:04:33.750" style="s2">beginnings of looking at the city</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.840" end="00:04:35.780" style="s2">through an integral lens and holding it</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.750" end="00:04:39.659" style="s2">and respecting it as a living</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.780" end="00:04:41.400" style="s2">evolutionary system yeah I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.659" end="00:04:50.610" style="s2">so much that I would love to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.400" end="00:04:54.120" style="s2">what you just said one of what you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.610" end="00:04:56.610" style="s2">called the fractal integration the guy</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.120" end="00:05:00.659" style="s2">was one of the really begins insights</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.610" end="00:05:02.490" style="s2">for me when I was studying like after</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.659" end="00:05:04.259" style="s2">after being a true maja college doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.490" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">the Masters in holistic science and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.259" end="00:05:09.379" style="s2">during that time through contact with</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:12.300" style="s2">people like David oh and John Todd and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.379" end="00:05:14.849" style="s2">Nancy Jack Todd realizing that the power</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.300" end="00:05:17.129" style="s2">of design and particularly the role of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.849" end="00:05:24.120" style="s2">human intention in creating the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.129" end="00:05:25.710" style="s2">and kind of made me realize that we we</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.120" end="00:05:28.020" style="s2">really need to pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.710" end="00:05:29.819" style="s2">upstream end of design and to some some</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.020" end="00:05:32.310" style="s2">extent that&#39;s what I see you do with</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.819" end="00:05:36.750" style="s2">this this integral approach to the city</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.310" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">to to bring in the bridge between how we</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.750" end="00:05:43.229" style="s2">bring forth the system through how we</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:45.479" style="s2">see the world and how then what we bring</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.229" end="00:05:47.129" style="s2">forth also influences how we see the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.479" end="00:05:49.620" style="s2">world so this this this kind of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.129" end="00:05:53.009" style="s2">loop between your design and worldview</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.620" end="00:05:55.830" style="s2">that is so often ignored and then we</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.009" end="00:05:57.689" style="s2">were surprised that we keep creating</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.830" end="00:06:01.439" style="s2">systems that are actually degenerative</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.689" end="00:06:04.439" style="s2">and not these self-propagating evolving</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.439" end="00:06:07.469" style="s2">systems that fall into sync with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.439" end="00:06:11.270" style="s2">larger nested nosov wholeness nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.469" end="00:06:17.639" style="s2">life as a planetary process transforming</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.270" end="00:06:22.710" style="s2">yeah oh yeah yeah totally because after</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.639" end="00:06:24.539" style="s2">I went through this stage of discovering</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.710" end="00:06:27.960" style="s2">I had something I could say about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.539" end="00:06:30.569" style="s2">city then I was working in my small city</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.960" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">in British Columbia Abbotsford in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.569" end="00:06:35.339" style="s2">and they asked me I was part of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:37.229" style="s2">board of the Abbotsford Community</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.339" end="00:06:38.969" style="s2">Foundation and they said well we we want</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.229" end="00:06:40.440" style="s2">to sort of reexamine well how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.969" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">grants this year but what do we</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.440" end="00:06:44.670" style="s2">really know about our city and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:46.740" style="s2">realized after I finished doing my</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.670" end="00:06:49.490" style="s2">doctoral work I had answered the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.740" end="00:06:53.130" style="s2">questions of how to understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.490" end="00:06:54.630" style="s2">complexity and look at at community in</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.130" end="00:06:56.120" style="s2">very different ways but I really didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.630" end="00:06:58.650" style="s2">know how to take the message home and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.120" end="00:07:01.140" style="s2">once they asked that question I said oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.650" end="00:07:02.760" style="s2">I think I might be able to help you</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.140" end="00:07:05.120" style="s2">answer that question what we know about</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.760" end="00:07:09.450" style="s2">our city and then I started to create</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.120" end="00:07:11.540" style="s2">new ways of finding the data that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.450" end="00:07:14.910" style="s2">could express to them in graphic form</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.540" end="00:07:18.810" style="s2">about the value systems in the city</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.910" end="00:07:21.450" style="s2">about how the city was part of a context</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.810" end="00:07:25.470" style="s2">how the city itself had multiple</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.450" end="00:07:29.160" style="s2">intelligences and so when I finished</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.470" end="00:07:32.790" style="s2">this work then the first books started</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.160" end="00:07:36.570" style="s2">to emerge from me and in that first book</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.790" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">I really identified that the city had</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.570" end="00:07:42.120" style="s2">multiple intelligences and as you say</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:44.910" style="s2">the intelligences weren&#39;t just internal</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.120" end="00:07:47.630" style="s2">but the first step I called it Kahn</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.910" end="00:07:50.760" style="s2">texting intelligences and they were</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.630" end="00:07:53.100" style="s2">intelligences for knowing the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.760" end="00:07:55.380" style="s2">a setting of the city they were about</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.100" end="00:07:58.800" style="s2">emergence and knowing that we were on an</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.380" end="00:08:01.050" style="s2">evolutionary path that they had also an</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.800" end="00:08:03.330" style="s2">integral this this co-arising of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.050" end="00:08:06.090" style="s2">consciousness culture behaviors and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.330" end="00:08:08.610" style="s2">systems and that they were living so</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.090" end="00:08:11.400" style="s2">many people forget there are generations</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.610" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">and cities and now it isn&#39;t just three</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.400" end="00:08:16.320" style="s2">generations we can have - we might in</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:18.480" style="s2">some places be pushing those seven</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.320" end="00:08:21.960" style="s2">generations that are contained in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.480" end="00:08:24.510" style="s2">city I also looked at the intelligences</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.960" end="00:08:28.220" style="s2">of the individual inner and outer and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.510" end="00:08:31.729" style="s2">the collective the cultural and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.220" end="00:08:35.400" style="s2">social and then a set of strategic</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.729" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">intelligences the first one I put there</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.400" end="00:08:43.020" style="s2">was the one of inquiry now not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:46.890" style="s2">how can we inquire together about what</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.020" end="00:08:48.540" style="s2">it is that we want to know and just</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.890" end="00:08:50.970" style="s2">briefly that that&#39;s really so at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.540" end="00:08:53.610" style="s2">center of when I realized what is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.970" end="00:08:54.170" style="s2">process that would create regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.610" end="00:08:56.630" style="s2">cultures</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.170" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">that eye expressions off place in place</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.630" end="00:09:04.370" style="s2">where you have that dynamic again where</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:07.250" style="s2">we are one at the same time this is like</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.370" end="00:09:09.410" style="s2">emergent properties of the system in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.250" end="00:09:11.329" style="s2">place in our city in our buyer region</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.410" end="00:09:15.740" style="s2">and at the same time were creative</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.329" end="00:09:18.350" style="s2">agents in it that is is really like how</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.740" end="00:09:22.579" style="s2">do we actively as regenerative cultures</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.350" end="00:09:25.850" style="s2">create cultures that um that adapt to</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.579" end="00:09:28.370" style="s2">place an express place as a like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.850" end="00:09:32.060" style="s2">whole bio cultural uniqueness of where</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.370" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">you live but for me that that is at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.060" end="00:09:39.470" style="s2">core of creating regenerative cultures</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:41.630" style="s2">and yeah that just came up when you said</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.470" end="00:09:45.980" style="s2">that and that&#39;s another place that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.630" end="00:09:50.529" style="s2">would resonate because the inquiry these</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.980" end="00:09:54.949" style="s2">intelligences I I went on afterwards and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.529" end="00:09:56.570" style="s2">so once we start to use inquiry then</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.949" end="00:09:58.670" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to use a whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.570" end="00:10:00.680" style="s2">systems to know one another better to</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.670" end="00:10:04.370" style="s2">develop the relationships to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.680" end="00:10:07.550" style="s2">one another and I did a lot of learning</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.370" end="00:10:09.649" style="s2">in it um prototyping in Abbotsford and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.550" end="00:10:11.480" style="s2">then as people started to learn about my</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.649" end="00:10:13.970" style="s2">work they invited me to come to their</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.480" end="00:10:18.019" style="s2">places and I&#39;ll always I would start</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.970" end="00:10:20.810" style="s2">with well let let us bring together what</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.019" end="00:10:23.829" style="s2">I call the four voices of the city so</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.810" end="00:10:27.110" style="s2">the four voices would sit in inquiry and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.829" end="00:10:29.180" style="s2">we would listen to what we know about</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.110" end="00:10:31.490" style="s2">each other what&#39;s working around here</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.180" end="00:10:34.339" style="s2">what&#39;s not working around here and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.490" end="00:10:37.490" style="s2">do we imagine for the future so we would</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.339" end="00:10:39.500" style="s2">call forth what people were holding in</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.490" end="00:10:41.690" style="s2">their hearts but not necessarily sharing</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.500" end="00:10:45.260" style="s2">with each other and by listening to each</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.690" end="00:10:46.940" style="s2">other&#39;s stories people Woods who had</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.260" end="00:10:49.339" style="s2">known each other for 20 years that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.940" end="00:10:53.569" style="s2">never knew that about you and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.339" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">sudden there was a heart opening as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.569" end="00:10:59.630" style="s2">as an opening of the intellect and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:02.089" style="s2">started to see how we made the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.630" end="00:11:04.220" style="s2">particular culture that makes up our our</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.089" end="00:11:07.820" style="s2">different cities how did you how did you</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.220" end="00:11:10.280" style="s2">in this process how did you slow down</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.820" end="00:11:12.500" style="s2">process enough that as you were asking</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.280" end="00:11:15.020" style="s2">people to tell stories about that place</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.500" end="00:11:17.060" style="s2">and what works what doesn&#39;t work I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.020" end="00:11:19.490" style="s2">just thinking he could so easily spiral</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.060" end="00:11:23.060" style="s2">into some kind of political discussion</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.490" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">or a conflict of opinions so there must</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.060" end="00:11:28.010" style="s2">be a skillful way of saying no no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:31.450" style="s2">harvesting perspectives out of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.010" end="00:11:34.550" style="s2">collective beehive that is our community</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.450" end="00:11:37.220" style="s2">yeah Oh a really good example is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.550" end="00:11:37.850" style="s2">city I worked with in Oklahoma in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.220" end="00:11:40.580" style="s2">States</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.850" end="00:11:44.690" style="s2">Durant so they asked me to come and work</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.580" end="00:11:46.340" style="s2">with their community because some key</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.690" end="00:11:47.710" style="s2">leaders had actually been doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.340" end="00:11:49.790" style="s2">leadership development and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.710" end="00:11:51.530" style="s2">organizational development and then they</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.790" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">looked at each other and said what would</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.530" end="00:11:55.370" style="s2">happen if we did this for the community</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.360" end="00:11:59.210" style="s2">so when they asked me I said well I have</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.370" end="00:12:03.860" style="s2">to come and and see if your community</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.210" end="00:12:05.930" style="s2">has the energy for an inquiry and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.860" end="00:12:08.450" style="s2">what I look for I said would you please</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.930" end="00:12:12.320" style="s2">convene for me the four voices of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.450" end="00:12:15.230" style="s2">city the citizens the civic managers the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.320" end="00:12:17.240" style="s2">business innovators and the third sector</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.230" end="00:12:19.490" style="s2">or the civil society so we had about</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.240" end="00:12:22.490" style="s2">three or four people from each of those</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.490" end="00:12:25.070" style="s2">voices and our first circle was just</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.490" end="00:12:28.310" style="s2">those three questions what&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.070" end="00:12:30.680" style="s2">around here what&#39;s not working what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.310" end="00:12:33.050" style="s2">imagine for the future and describe a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.680" end="00:12:36.650" style="s2">story that that connects you emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.050" end="00:12:39.020" style="s2">to the city out of that we realized</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.650" end="00:12:41.390" style="s2">there was energy there was energy for</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.020" end="00:12:43.730" style="s2">change energy for moving forward and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.390" end="00:12:47.030" style="s2">then we created they said to me okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.730" end="00:12:49.490" style="s2">let&#39;s then give us a proposal for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.030" end="00:12:52.250" style="s2">long-term change process and I gave him</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.490" end="00:12:55.900" style="s2">a proposal for ten years but just not</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.250" end="00:13:00.320" style="s2">normal to have a proposal for so long</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.900" end="00:13:04.400" style="s2">but the first number of years really</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.320" end="00:13:06.860" style="s2">were about convening series of dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.400" end="00:13:10.730" style="s2">circles not only with the four voices</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.860" end="00:13:13.970" style="s2">but around key themes so we brought</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.730" end="00:13:17.240" style="s2">together themes around the economy and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.970" end="00:13:20.390" style="s2">education we brought together themes</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.240" end="00:13:21.649" style="s2">around health and community we brought</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.390" end="00:13:28.519" style="s2">together themes</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.649" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">around culture and well-being so all of</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.519" end="00:13:35.720" style="s2">these three that there said there were</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.040" end="00:13:38.089" style="s2">three sets of themes but each circle had</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.720" end="00:13:41.059" style="s2">a different way of being assembled first</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.089" end="00:13:44.509" style="s2">we brought together thought leaders then</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.059" end="00:13:48.259" style="s2">we actually published what we discovered</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.509" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">and we published it in the community</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.259" end="00:13:54.379" style="s2">newspaper and on the website then we</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:56.839" style="s2">took it forward to the citizens and said</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.379" end="00:13:58.670" style="s2">here&#39;s here&#39;s what our thought leaders</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.839" end="00:14:01.069" style="s2">have said about it like what have you</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.670" end="00:14:03.679" style="s2">got to say about it in small circles</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.069" end="00:14:06.459" style="s2">where they gave their own authentic</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.679" end="00:14:08.839" style="s2">feedback it wasn&#39;t just you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.459" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">parroting what they thought others had</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.839" end="00:14:15.829" style="s2">said we we reassure that and then we</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:17.540" style="s2">brought it to the policymakers and so we</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.829" end="00:14:19.129" style="s2">said to the policy makers here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.540" end="00:14:21.379" style="s2">our thought leaders and our citizens</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.129" end="00:14:25.029" style="s2">have said about education and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.379" end="00:14:27.800" style="s2">economy what would prevent you from</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.029" end="00:14:30.949" style="s2">helping us to actually implement these</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.800" end="00:14:33.730" style="s2">ideas and the policy makers were usually</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.949" end="00:14:37.569" style="s2">the ones that were the most surprised</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.730" end="00:14:41.929" style="s2">because so many policy makers work in</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.569" end="00:14:44.899" style="s2">very circumstances where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.929" end="00:14:47.449" style="s2">adversarial you know parliamentarians in</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.899" end="00:14:49.819" style="s2">particular but also all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.449" end="00:14:52.819" style="s2">bureaucracies work in very adversarial</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.819" end="00:14:56.089" style="s2">situations and they would be held safe</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.819" end="00:14:59.029" style="s2">to express their own authentic views</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.089" end="00:15:01.069" style="s2">when we found the this combination of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.029" end="00:15:04.879" style="s2">the thought leaders and the citizens and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.069" end="00:15:07.999" style="s2">the policy makers after publishing them</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.879" end="00:15:10.999" style="s2">and then reconvening another set around</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.999" end="00:15:14.240" style="s2">other themes over that that took us</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.999" end="00:15:18.319" style="s2">three years this took us it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.240" end="00:15:21.709" style="s2">instant and when I told us in this case</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.319" end="00:15:26.990" style="s2">is it you and the client in the city</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.709" end="00:15:30.649" style="s2">like how did you get the engagement yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.990" end="00:15:32.299" style="s2">so so when I&#39;m when remember I said the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.649" end="00:15:35.070" style="s2">invitation came from two leaders so they</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.299" end="00:15:37.860" style="s2">were obviously expressing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.070" end="00:15:39.750" style="s2">energy and I wanted to see where else</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.860" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">was the energy in the city and so did</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.750" end="00:15:44.100" style="s2">they because they knew that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:46.680" style="s2">couldn&#39;t carry it just on their own they</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.100" end="00:15:48.870" style="s2">wanted the involvement of the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.680" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">their their citizens in the city and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.870" end="00:15:56.600" style="s2">rest of the businesses and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:58.920" style="s2">four voices and so we basically made</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.600" end="00:16:03.270" style="s2">propulsive invitations to the thought</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.920" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">leaders and an open invitation to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.270" end="00:16:08.250" style="s2">public and then go back to the propose</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:10.710" style="s2">of invitations to the policy makers so</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.250" end="00:16:14.100" style="s2">in that way we kept kind of breathing in</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.710" end="00:16:16.860" style="s2">and breathing out but always finding the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.100" end="00:16:20.010" style="s2">energy for change and then they started</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.860" end="00:16:23.100" style="s2">to notice it and it started to grow one</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.010" end="00:16:26.850" style="s2">thing duranta that was very it turned</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.100" end="00:16:28.470" style="s2">out to be an extremely good strategy was</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.850" end="00:16:30.840" style="s2">they created something called imagine</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.470" end="00:16:33.120" style="s2">Durant and had a board and the board</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.840" end="00:16:36.390" style="s2">consisted of the three or four voices as</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.120" end="00:16:37.740" style="s2">well and in the time that I was there at</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.390" end="00:16:41.340" style="s2">the end of four years we had gone</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.740" end="00:16:44.790" style="s2">through four go through three city</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.340" end="00:16:47.160" style="s2">managers and three mayor&#39;s so if we had</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.790" end="00:16:49.500" style="s2">depended only on being in City Hall I</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.160" end="00:16:53.100" style="s2">doubt if the process had continued</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.500" end="00:16:54.630" style="s2">because it originated outside City Hall</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.100" end="00:16:58.380" style="s2">but it always invited them in and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.630" end="00:17:00.920" style="s2">included them but it was because we had</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.380" end="00:17:04.680" style="s2">before voices and the momentum was built</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.920" end="00:17:06.360" style="s2">naturally who find them because with</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.680" end="00:17:08.070" style="s2">processes like I mean this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.360" end="00:17:10.709" style="s2">wonderful to hear because it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.070" end="00:17:14.100" style="s2">me it&#39;s it describes this living the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.709" end="00:17:16.320" style="s2">questions that is at the core of Rhian</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.100" end="00:17:19.620" style="s2">habit in place in in a way that we we</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.320" end="00:17:23.189" style="s2">might have a future but I in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.620" end="00:17:27.750" style="s2">experience but often stops processes</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.189" end="00:17:31.230" style="s2">like that from really getting going</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.750" end="00:17:33.330" style="s2">is that something needs to resource the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.230" end="00:17:34.850" style="s2">initial catalysts the people who who are</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.330" end="00:17:37.410" style="s2">even just having the idea we should</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.850" end="00:17:39.990" style="s2">constantly bring everybody together how</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.410" end="00:17:41.880" style="s2">like we&#39;re gonna call a meeting maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.990" end="00:17:43.620" style="s2">should talk to Marilyn and bring her</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.880" end="00:17:45.660" style="s2">wisdom into this story like somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.620" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">needed to resource that and how was that</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.660" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">resource because that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:52.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t spot yeah well the resourcing at</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:55.500" style="s2">the beginning was interesting as I</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.410" end="00:17:58.140" style="s2">mentioned it was the president of one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.500" end="00:18:01.110" style="s2">the largest community banks in the city</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.140" end="00:18:02.820" style="s2">and the chief of the Choctaw Nation they</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.110" end="00:18:05.460" style="s2">had both been doing personal leadership</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.820" end="00:18:08.310" style="s2">development they had both really done</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.460" end="00:18:10.590" style="s2">the work and noticed their own change in</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.310" end="00:18:12.990" style="s2">themselves and because of that they took</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.590" end="00:18:14.630" style="s2">it to organizational development and</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.990" end="00:18:16.590" style="s2">they both been working with an</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.630" end="00:18:19.650" style="s2">organization you might have heard of in</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.590" end="00:18:22.020" style="s2">Texas called Stegen out of Dallas who</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.650" end="00:18:24.090" style="s2">who does all of this leadership and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.020" end="00:18:27.120" style="s2">organizational development work using an</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.090" end="00:18:30.120" style="s2">integral frame and when they asked about</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:31.860" style="s2">who does this work in community you</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.120" end="00:18:33.540" style="s2">probably know Barrett Brown was one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.860" end="00:18:35.490" style="s2">the faculty and he said oh well you</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.540" end="00:18:37.770" style="s2">should check with Maryland Hamilton she</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.490" end="00:18:40.370" style="s2">has she&#39;s actually you know started to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.770" end="00:18:43.860" style="s2">do that work so they called me up and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.370" end="00:18:46.140" style="s2">and asked me to come I was very</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.860" end="00:18:48.480" style="s2">skeptical at the beginning because I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.140" end="00:18:50.280" style="s2">well aware that doing the work at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.480" end="00:18:52.620" style="s2">community and city level would be much</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.280" end="00:18:54.540" style="s2">messier much less controllable than</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.620" end="00:18:55.680" style="s2">either leadership or organizational</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.540" end="00:19:00.170" style="s2">development because everybody&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.680" end="00:19:04.440" style="s2">volunteer everybody but they chose to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.170" end="00:19:07.050" style="s2">bring in their their first board and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.440" end="00:19:09.660" style="s2">they started to resource it by asking</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.050" end="00:19:12.780" style="s2">for the four voices all to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.660" end="00:19:15.240" style="s2">time money and effort and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.780" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">how we move forward but always around</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.240" end="00:19:22.680" style="s2">energy it wasn&#39;t like thou shalt there</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:25.140" style="s2">was no no it was looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.680" end="00:19:27.720" style="s2">positive response and resonance and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.140" end="00:19:29.490" style="s2">building on that and amplifying it that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.720" end="00:19:31.620" style="s2">that&#39;s a lesson I learned from Margaret</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.490" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">Wheatley early on you know if you want</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.620" end="00:19:35.400" style="s2">to improve the health of the system</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:38.370" style="s2">connect it to more of itself find the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.400" end="00:19:40.230" style="s2">energy and amplify it so that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.370" end="00:19:41.730" style="s2">always do is I go looking for the energy</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.230" end="00:19:43.350" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t have to come from City</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.730" end="00:19:45.450" style="s2">Hall in this way it can come from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.350" end="00:19:47.910" style="s2">citizens it could come from I could come</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.450" end="00:19:50.220" style="s2">from business it could come from and in</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.910" end="00:19:53.240" style="s2">this case there was a businessperson and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.220" end="00:19:56.550" style="s2">a cultural theater you know the whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.240" end="00:19:58.320" style="s2">nation of the Choctaw Nation was was</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.550" end="00:19:59.660" style="s2">really they were they were instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.320" end="00:20:03.260" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.660" end="00:20:07.190" style="s2">being co-catalyst and what would you say</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.260" end="00:20:09.350" style="s2">there because that that energy work that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.190" end="00:20:11.660" style="s2">of systemic energy work you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.350" end="00:20:14.810" style="s2">referring to particularly in this day</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.660" end="00:20:17.330" style="s2">and age where where it seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.810" end="00:20:19.430" style="s2">tendency towards polarization and people</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.330" end="00:20:21.560" style="s2">stop listening to each other because</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.430" end="00:20:23.870" style="s2">they just create their little categories</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.560" end="00:20:25.490" style="s2">and then the minute they hear a certain</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.870" end="00:20:27.830" style="s2">meme they just put somebody into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.490" end="00:20:31.460" style="s2">category and stop listening to that</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.830" end="00:20:34.870" style="s2">person and so it&#39;s so easy for those</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.460" end="00:20:37.850" style="s2">kind of public dialogues and inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.870" end="00:20:40.700" style="s2">processes to do to have flashpoints</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.850" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">where people stop moving forward for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.700" end="00:20:45.470" style="s2">sake of the whole for the care of</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.640" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">creating a healthier system and start</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.470" end="00:20:51.110" style="s2">going into conflict how do you how do</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:55.160" style="s2">you work that like how you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.110" end="00:20:56.930" style="s2">guide energies so they stay generative</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.160" end="00:21:00.440" style="s2">and regenerative rather than</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.930" end="00:21:03.110" style="s2">degenerative and destructive oh that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.440" end="00:21:05.630" style="s2">good question and I think that part of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.110" end="00:21:09.860" style="s2">the answer would come from I never work</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.630" end="00:21:12.140" style="s2">on my own so I called together a team</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.860" end="00:21:14.420" style="s2">and in this case once I found that there</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.140" end="00:21:16.850" style="s2">was energy and Durrant then I called</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.420" end="00:21:19.910" style="s2">together the first team to come and help</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.850" end="00:21:23.630" style="s2">me hold that very first sound dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.910" end="00:21:27.500" style="s2">with with thought leaders and then we</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.630" end="00:21:30.350" style="s2">looked to find local leaders so we were</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.500" end="00:21:33.830" style="s2">wanting to always make sure what we were</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.350" end="00:21:38.440" style="s2">doing was growing local capacity so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.830" end="00:21:41.360" style="s2">capacity and we were able to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.440" end="00:21:43.370" style="s2">they started to generate started to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.360" end="00:21:47.180" style="s2">become quite confident interestingly the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.370" end="00:21:49.430" style="s2">first executive director of the imagined</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.180" end="00:21:52.490" style="s2">rent had never done any of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.430" end="00:21:55.520" style="s2">work and when we hired her she had been</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.490" end="00:21:58.280" style="s2">doing smoking cessation smoking</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.520" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">cessation work for a bureaucracy but so</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.280" end="00:22:01.220" style="s2">we knew she was working with health and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:04.130" style="s2">we knew she could work with some pretty</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.220" end="00:22:06.620" style="s2">tough characters in the room because she</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.130" end="00:22:09.710" style="s2">was in an area that smoking was still</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.620" end="00:22:12.570" style="s2">very popular and but she&#39;d never done</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.710" end="00:22:16.289" style="s2">any of this her first year she was in</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.570" end="00:22:18.299" style="s2">just sort of like almost fear and terror</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.289" end="00:22:21.299" style="s2">could we carry this off could she just</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.299" end="00:22:23.039" style="s2">would follow the design that we had for</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.299" end="00:22:24.990" style="s2">this and by the end of the first year</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:27.120" style="s2">she could do it all she could manage it</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.990" end="00:22:31.230" style="s2">all she could call in the small group</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.120" end="00:22:35.700" style="s2">facilitators and we started to find that</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.230" end="00:22:38.700" style="s2">for the initial meetings that were I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.700" end="00:22:40.830" style="s2">looking for as many local and American</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.700" end="00:22:44.100" style="s2">especially um facilitators to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.830" end="00:22:46.049" style="s2">co-facilitate with me so it was evident</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.100" end="00:22:49.289" style="s2">to people we were growing our own</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.049" end="00:22:53.460" style="s2">capacities and I think that what</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.289" end="00:22:56.820" style="s2">prevented us from polarizing was we were</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.460" end="00:22:58.889" style="s2">always asking another question I learned</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.820" end="00:23:01.379" style="s2">from Margaret Wheatley and that was who</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.889" end="00:23:05.490" style="s2">else should be here who else should be</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.379" end="00:23:07.830" style="s2">here because it isn&#39;t just us so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.490" end="00:23:10.649" style="s2">would look for always pushing the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.830" end="00:23:15.899" style="s2">envelope of younger generations older</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.649" end="00:23:18.450" style="s2">generations genders interests just as</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.899" end="00:23:21.000" style="s2">much diversity as possible so we always</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.450" end="00:23:23.639" style="s2">built diverse diversity into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.000" end="00:23:26.370" style="s2">equation and if it didn&#39;t show up we</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.639" end="00:23:28.950" style="s2">proposal II went after it this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.370" end="00:23:31.350" style="s2">fascinating to me exactly just last week</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.950" end="00:23:35.940" style="s2">I had a conversation with Bill Reid from</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.350" end="00:23:40.879" style="s2">Regenesis group and so much what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.940" end="00:23:44.909" style="s2">just described is really central to what</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.879" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">working in a place sourced regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.909" end="00:23:51.149" style="s2">practice with the community is all about</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:53.990" style="s2">- really like building capacity you</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.149" end="00:23:56.490" style="s2">mentioned is really at the heart or even</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.990" end="00:23:59.100" style="s2">in with Bill I had this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.490" end="00:24:03.379" style="s2">that that the first place is personal</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.100" end="00:24:05.970" style="s2">development which is both of oneself -</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.379" end="00:24:08.759" style="s2">to learn how to collaborate how to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.970" end="00:24:11.490" style="s2">invite more people in how to hold these</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.759" end="00:24:13.529" style="s2">processes but then to also the next</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.490" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">stage out is build the capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.529" end="00:24:19.049" style="s2">team to do this work together and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:21.059" style="s2">and that&#39;s really where most of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.049" end="00:24:23.790" style="s2">magic happens because then you create a</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.059" end="00:24:27.690" style="s2">self-perpetuating like UBF</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.790" end="00:24:30.030" style="s2">yeah yeah after them you you opposed an</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.690" end="00:24:31.950" style="s2">idea impose an idea of this would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.030" end="00:24:34.590" style="s2">healthier in the city so let&#39;s do this</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.950" end="00:24:36.870" style="s2">but it&#39;s a much slower process much</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.590" end="00:24:39.720" style="s2">slower and but it&#39;s an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.870" end="00:24:43.770" style="s2">process that enables the system to heal</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.720" end="00:24:46.050" style="s2">itself and to evolve it sounds for me</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.770" end="00:24:48.210" style="s2">but I just listening to you is so</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.050" end="00:24:49.530" style="s2">interesting to see how is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.210" end="00:24:52.770" style="s2">community out there learning</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.530" end="00:24:55.740" style="s2">regenerative practice yes but then</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.770" end="00:24:58.230" style="s2">there&#39;s all this wealth in the community</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.740" end="00:25:00.570" style="s2">you are very connected with the wider</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.230" end="00:25:04.320" style="s2">integral community that that have also</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.570" end="00:25:07.080" style="s2">done this kind of systemic work and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.320" end="00:25:10.230" style="s2">just wondering how do we increase</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.080" end="00:25:13.830" style="s2">learning to build bridges between these</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.230" end="00:25:15.630" style="s2">communities in ways that that really</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.830" end="00:25:18.780" style="s2">serve both of them and and serve the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.630" end="00:25:20.750" style="s2">world so that the higher purpose yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.780" end="00:25:25.440" style="s2">now you&#39;re coming into sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.750" end="00:25:27.120" style="s2">flash-forward ten years I will just give</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.440" end="00:25:29.930" style="s2">you a little completion around Durham</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.120" end="00:25:32.670" style="s2">because ah so at the end of four years</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.930" end="00:25:34.620" style="s2">we actually did the rest of those</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.670" end="00:25:37.530" style="s2">intelligences which included putting</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.620" end="00:25:40.110" style="s2">together a strategic mesh worked plan we</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.530" end="00:25:42.090" style="s2">were navigating ten twenty thirty years</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.110" end="00:25:44.220" style="s2">forward we knew what our purpose they</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.090" end="00:25:47.790" style="s2">discovered their purpose they were able</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.220" end="00:25:50.160" style="s2">to articulate their values and they knew</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.790" end="00:25:52.500" style="s2">they had to evolve at their own speed</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.160" end="00:25:54.780" style="s2">and that was something I told them all</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.500" end="00:25:56.820" style="s2">along I said I could not predict for</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.780" end="00:25:58.980" style="s2">them how fast this would be because it</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.820" end="00:26:01.670" style="s2">would depend on how fast their uptake</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.980" end="00:26:04.110" style="s2">was how fast they could share together</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.670" end="00:26:06.240" style="s2">so at the end of four years though</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.110" end="00:26:08.430" style="s2">because they had this and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.240" end="00:26:10.530" style="s2">things they were uncharacteristically</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.430" end="00:26:12.240" style="s2">good at I say uncharacteristically</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.530" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">because a lot of these systems are not</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.240" end="00:26:17.940" style="s2">good strategic implementation they were</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:20.700" style="s2">quite good at that and so they said ah</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.940" end="00:26:22.260" style="s2">we think we can take this on now and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.700" end="00:26:25.680" style="s2">we&#39;re going to go for it because we know</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.260" end="00:26:27.390" style="s2">those sort of goals and who isn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.680" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">to be involved in what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.390" end="00:26:30.920" style="s2">set for our first year or five year</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.240" end="00:26:33.570" style="s2">tenure</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.920" end="00:26:36.180" style="s2">intentions and they had it all mapped</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.570" end="00:26:37.180" style="s2">out but with enough wiggle room that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.180" end="00:26:39.370" style="s2">they knew that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.180" end="00:26:41.500" style="s2">could go with with the flow or go with</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.370" end="00:26:45.910" style="s2">with shifts that can&#39;t met that would</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.500" end="00:26:47.470" style="s2">happen so I was I I felt like we had</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.910" end="00:26:49.630" style="s2">achieved what they had wanted and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.470" end="00:26:53.170" style="s2">had the capacity to generate their own</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.630" end="00:26:56.140" style="s2">internal capacity because of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.170" end="00:26:58.360" style="s2">experience and you know in other parts</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.140" end="00:27:00.940" style="s2">of my life I would continue to write and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.360" end="00:27:04.660" style="s2">talk about the integral moment and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.940" end="00:27:07.630" style="s2">integral worldview one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.660" end="00:27:09.610" style="s2">became aware of was there&#39;s just so much</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.630" end="00:27:11.500" style="s2">capacity for building capacity in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.610" end="00:27:15.400" style="s2">integral movement could be coaching</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.500" end="00:27:18.160" style="s2">could be facilitation your own work</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.400" end="00:27:20.440" style="s2">around regeneration and countering Shawn</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.160" end="00:27:23.730" style="s2">Espeon Hargens and you know looking at</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.440" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">integral ecology or Mark decay around</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.730" end="00:27:30.370" style="s2">integral sustainable design I just</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:35.730" style="s2">thought wow these this is really so</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.370" end="00:27:39.880" style="s2">interesting that we are able now to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.730" end="00:27:41.590" style="s2">offer our services in ways that we could</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.880" end="00:27:44.890" style="s2">accelerate change in the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.590" end="00:27:46.750" style="s2">theoretically but we tend to be spread</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.890" end="00:27:48.580" style="s2">out all over the place not just in</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.750" end="00:27:51.280" style="s2">different cities but all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.580" end="00:27:54.130" style="s2">and so my fantasy has been what would</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.280" end="00:27:57.670" style="s2">happen if we brought the leaders of all</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.130" end="00:28:01.240" style="s2">these integral specialties together and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.670" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">imagined that we were in one city and of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.240" end="00:28:07.090" style="s2">course in this period of time the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:11.130" style="s2">challenge around climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.090" end="00:28:14.350" style="s2">other volatile uncertain complex and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.130" end="00:28:18.250" style="s2">ambiguous aspects of our VUCA world have</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.350" end="00:28:20.440" style="s2">arisen of all the wicked problems and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.250" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">more than ever I&#39;ve entertained this</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.440" end="00:28:27.820" style="s2">fantasy and I&#39;ve tried inviting others</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:30.490" style="s2">at at conferences to convene that kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.820" end="00:28:34.750" style="s2">of conversation and there&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.490" end="00:28:37.570" style="s2">resistance I can&#39;t give you an answer</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.750" end="00:28:40.240" style="s2">why but it&#39;s been very frustrating to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.570" end="00:28:43.300" style="s2">because on the one hand I&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.240" end="00:28:44.740" style="s2">to take integral perspectives to a world</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.300" end="00:28:46.480" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t know anything about that</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.740" end="00:28:48.220" style="s2">way of looking at the world and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.480" end="00:28:50.490" style="s2">when I come into the integral movement</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.220" end="00:28:54.750" style="s2">there seems not to be an awareness</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.490" end="00:28:57.570" style="s2">in particular around the city as a scale</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.750" end="00:28:59.670" style="s2">as a scale of human systems because one</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.570" end="00:29:03.240" style="s2">thing I&#39;ve noticed is integral tends to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.670" end="00:29:06.990" style="s2">specialize at the individual development</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.240" end="00:29:10.230" style="s2">or leadership or the organization&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.990" end="00:29:13.470" style="s2">then it&#39;ll go to nations and the globe</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.230" end="00:29:16.260" style="s2">and I keep saying but there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.470" end="00:29:19.170" style="s2">scale in between organizations and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.260" end="00:29:22.710" style="s2">nations you can say it like there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.170" end="00:29:25.230" style="s2">one question that I don&#39;t want to not</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.710" end="00:29:27.000" style="s2">ask which is how do you see the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.230" end="00:29:29.270" style="s2">relationship between the city and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.000" end="00:29:32.340" style="s2">region because for me what I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.270" end="00:29:34.140" style="s2">by being at the lower scale aspect</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.340" end="00:29:36.300" style="s2">spending time at finding on working with</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.140" end="00:29:41.300" style="s2">transition towns looking at the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.300" end="00:29:44.190" style="s2">almost intentional experiment types of</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.300" end="00:29:46.920" style="s2">can we create a sustainable regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.190" end="00:29:52.170" style="s2">system that really heals people and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.920" end="00:29:54.630" style="s2">place I I kind of got to see that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.170" end="00:29:57.330" style="s2">small community scale is too small to</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.630" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">have the systemic integration to create</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.330" end="00:30:03.000" style="s2">the win-win-win with the environment</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:05.790" style="s2">so really em the by a regional scale the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.000" end="00:30:10.830" style="s2">watershed scale within which for me the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.790" end="00:30:13.020" style="s2">city sits and is is to my mind where we</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.830" end="00:30:15.570" style="s2">can redesign the human presence on earth</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.020" end="00:30:18.360" style="s2">but of course because now so many of us</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.570" end="00:30:21.390" style="s2">live in cities for me the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.360" end="00:30:24.840" style="s2">of energizing by original development</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.390" end="00:30:28.170" style="s2">and contextualizing urban city</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.840" end="00:30:31.140" style="s2">development in that way is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.170" end="00:30:34.010" style="s2">key challenges for the next decade and i</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.140" end="00:30:37.890" style="s2">would love to hear your take on on</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.010" end="00:30:39.800" style="s2">region yeah actually I see them</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.890" end="00:30:43.260" style="s2">completely as you just described and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.800" end="00:30:44.190" style="s2">it&#39;s probably um something like a Susan</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.260" end="00:30:47.100" style="s2">Tom do for me</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.190" end="00:30:49.380" style="s2">I you know develop these ideas living in</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.100" end="00:30:52.440" style="s2">British Columbia which is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.380" end="00:30:56.670" style="s2">Cascadia watershed and I was totally</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.440" end="00:30:58.530" style="s2">influenced in the 70s and 80s and 90s by</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.670" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">the discourse that was going on around</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.530" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">that whole set of watersheds</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:06.429" style="s2">and influenced by the First Nations ways</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:09.130" style="s2">of actually dividing up their</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.429" end="00:31:12.580" style="s2">territories which was by watershed so</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.130" end="00:31:14.500" style="s2">it&#39;s actually implied in my work and</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.580" end="00:31:17.710" style="s2">explicitly written in the book that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.500" end="00:31:20.620" style="s2">looks that you have to engage with with</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.710" end="00:31:22.990" style="s2">the ecoregions and more than ever now I</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.620" end="00:31:26.890" style="s2">feel that is the only way we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.990" end="00:31:30.610" style="s2">be able to bring coherence to the city</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.890" end="00:31:33.850" style="s2">is if there is a deep reconnection with</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.610" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">the ecoregion I was just speaking at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.850" end="00:31:39.580" style="s2">eco city world summit in didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:43.679" style="s2">Vancouver with them with Bill Rees who</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.580" end="00:31:47.500" style="s2">was you know the co-author of the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.679" end="00:31:49.000" style="s2">eco footprint and that also I was there</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.500" end="00:31:51.700" style="s2">at the very first workshop they ever</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.000" end="00:31:53.529" style="s2">gave and so that impressed me deeply and</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.700" end="00:31:56.409" style="s2">I have never thought of cities outside</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.529" end="00:32:00.669" style="s2">the context of the ecoregions so</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.409" end="00:32:11.399" style="s2">reminder Bill breeze was Martin much is</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.669" end="00:32:14.620" style="s2">what a bacchanalian s supervisor yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.399" end="00:32:16.690" style="s2">yeah and then the other person went</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.620" end="00:32:19.029" style="s2">there was you know Richard register who</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.690" end="00:32:22.179" style="s2">was there the person who originally you</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.029" end="00:32:24.730" style="s2">know coined the term eco city so I feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.179" end="00:32:26.860" style="s2">that they&#39;re absolutely inextricably</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.730" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">linked I don&#39;t actually separate the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.860" end="00:32:32.169" style="s2">city from the region have you have you</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:33.549" style="s2">in your own because what I was I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.169" end="00:32:35.440" style="s2">this is this is very sometimes my</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.549" end="00:32:39.940" style="s2">academic background shows a bit that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.440" end="00:32:41.830" style="s2">actually love going up swimmingly in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.940" end="00:32:44.890" style="s2">history of all of this because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.830" end="00:32:49.169" style="s2">sometimes so much wisdom to to discover</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.890" end="00:32:51.940" style="s2">and and for me um one of the the real</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.169" end="00:32:55.929" style="s2">founding fathers of this impulse that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.940" end="00:32:57.130" style="s2">see both of us still working in is is</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.929" end="00:33:00.039" style="s2">Patrick Geddes</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.130" end="00:33:02.710" style="s2">um and then Patrick Geddes is linked to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.039" end="00:33:06.370" style="s2">young Christian smokes and and holism</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.710" end="00:33:10.780" style="s2">and and how Geddes is this interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.370" end="00:33:12.940" style="s2">person who is a biologist who is at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.780" end="00:33:16.020" style="s2">same time accredited for being the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.940" end="00:33:18.600" style="s2">founding father of town planning</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.020" end="00:33:20.270" style="s2">also very at the core of this the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.600" end="00:33:25.860" style="s2">founding of the discipline of sociology</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.270" end="00:33:28.290" style="s2">and so he envisioned the the Edinburgh</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.860" end="00:33:31.860" style="s2">Festival and he brought people like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.290" end="00:33:35.040" style="s2">play and inhaler the the guy who coined</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.860" end="00:33:37.200" style="s2">the term ecology together in Edinburgh</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.040" end="00:33:39.510" style="s2">to bring this synthesis of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:42.540" style="s2">this map making of the the wider picture</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.510" end="00:33:45.330" style="s2">and then wrote this wonderful book that</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.540" end="00:33:50.010" style="s2">very few people read because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.330" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">three volumes and it&#39;s called life</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.010" end="00:33:55.980" style="s2">towards a general biology and which he</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:59.070" style="s2">co-authored with with a professor at</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.980" end="00:34:01.260" style="s2">Aberdeen University and for me he had</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.070" end="00:34:03.270" style="s2">this vision that that we&#39;re still trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.260" end="00:34:05.880" style="s2">to bring into the world the world has</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.270" end="00:34:08.669" style="s2">taken up a lot more since then but it</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.880" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">was 120 years ahead of his time</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.669" end="00:34:16.350" style="s2">yeah I agree totally and I do see us as</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:19.800" style="s2">as his children I was introduced to</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.350" end="00:34:21.570" style="s2">Patrick Geddes by a city planner who I</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.800" end="00:34:25.640" style="s2">met in Canada who&#39;s Scottish she was now</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.570" end="00:34:29.990" style="s2">in fact and is a fanatically devoted</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.640" end="00:34:33.300" style="s2">Patrick Geddes and so once I came and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.990" end="00:34:38.550" style="s2">yeah walked up and down the Royal Mile</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.300" end="00:34:40.560" style="s2">and appreciated all of Olive Geddes I</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.550" end="00:34:41.640" style="s2">had to actually go up to the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.560" end="00:34:44.669" style="s2">camera obscura</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.640" end="00:34:48.060" style="s2">and see what he saw there and absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.669" end="00:34:56.220" style="s2">I feel I feel like yin that you just</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.060" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">mentioned that in white also so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.220" end="00:35:02.070" style="s2">been in in he and he&#39;s been inside the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:06.480" style="s2">Academy Academy in Canada and because I</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.070" end="00:35:09.570" style="s2">was always an associate at akka division</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.480" end="00:35:11.880" style="s2">out of Royal Roads University Ian could</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.570" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">feed me all kinds of things that he just</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.880" end="00:35:15.750" style="s2">couldn&#39;t you know push too hard in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:18.540" style="s2">Academy and I would go off and</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.750" end="00:35:19.740" style="s2">experiment with them I know that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.540" end="00:35:21.990" style="s2">knew each other but it makes perfect</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.740" end="00:35:25.080" style="s2">sense yeah we&#39;re very close friends very</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.990" end="00:35:27.200" style="s2">close friends so yeah I go visit just</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.080" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">because you mentioned the outlet power</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.200" end="00:35:34.100" style="s2">lately through my I was in March I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:35.810" style="s2">in Brazil launching my book in in</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.100" end="00:35:38.090" style="s2">Portuguese there and I met some people</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.810" end="00:35:41.210" style="s2">who an both with the Museum of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.090" end="00:35:43.880" style="s2">future in in Rio de Janeiro and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.210" end="00:35:46.610" style="s2">towards the end of the last year I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.880" end="00:35:48.860" style="s2">in Barcelona where a small foundation is</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.610" end="00:35:51.350" style="s2">also thinking about starting a museum of</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.860" end="00:35:53.990" style="s2">tomorrow and somehow I&#39;ve connected over</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.350" end="00:35:56.750" style="s2">the last two or three years to more and</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.990" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">more people who are really living into</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.750" end="00:36:02.780" style="s2">this question what is the role of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:05.570" style="s2">cultural institutions and museums in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.780" end="00:36:08.990" style="s2">the necessary public education and</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.570" end="00:36:11.180" style="s2">transformative process of basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.990" end="00:36:13.460" style="s2">creating platforms to have the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.180" end="00:36:17.120" style="s2">conversations you were just explaining</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.460" end="00:36:22.070" style="s2">with the work you were doing in was it</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.120" end="00:36:24.590" style="s2">an Oklahoman he said hey get Geddes</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.070" end="00:36:27.590" style="s2">again was a visionary there with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.590" end="00:36:30.020" style="s2">outlook tower to basically make</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.590" end="00:36:32.120" style="s2">everybody in Edinburgh understand the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.020" end="00:36:36.410" style="s2">scale linking that the fractal dimension</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.120" end="00:36:39.110" style="s2">of he is the world he is Europe</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.410" end="00:36:40.970" style="s2">he is England here Scotland he is your</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.110" end="00:36:43.100" style="s2">city and now you&#39;re at the top and not</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.970" end="00:36:44.930" style="s2">have a look at your city with really</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.100" end="00:36:49.460" style="s2">high technology at the time the camera</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.930" end="00:36:52.790" style="s2">yeah yeah but it in one exhibition</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.460" end="00:36:56.300" style="s2">people walked up that tower and had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.790" end="00:36:59.090" style="s2">nested sense of place yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.300" end="00:37:02.660" style="s2">given to them in a in an easily</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.090" end="00:37:04.850" style="s2">communicated way that educated people</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.660" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">could go deeper less educated people</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.850" end="00:37:10.370" style="s2">could just enjoy the experience and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:10.580" style="s2">and and still be very deeply affected by</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.370" end="00:37:14.210" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.580" end="00:37:16.220" style="s2">and and I think we that&#39;s that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.210" end="00:37:20.300" style="s2">challenge for the future as well too</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.220" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">under that part of kind of a Keynesian</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.300" end="00:37:25.190" style="s2">seed of how do we create culture because</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:28.100" style="s2">I also think that the Edinburgh Festival</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.190" end="00:37:31.480" style="s2">was that intention like this he he was</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.100" end="00:37:34.340" style="s2">trying to invite us back into synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.480" end="00:37:35.090" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s continued another hundred</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.340" end="00:37:38.960" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.090" end="00:37:40.460" style="s2">yes began in two hours silos and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.960" end="00:37:42.230" style="s2">with all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.460" end="00:37:43.730" style="s2">the negative side-effects that that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.230" end="00:37:46.490" style="s2">had and of course it if there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.730" end="00:37:48.859" style="s2">interesting knowledge but can you bring</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.490" end="00:37:52.339" style="s2">it back together again and actually so</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.859" end="00:37:54.440" style="s2">that that&#39;s really um sparks me because</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.339" end="00:37:57.710" style="s2">a number of interests are are</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.440" end="00:37:59.839" style="s2">discovering Patrick Geddes totally we</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.710" end="00:38:02.810" style="s2">know without city planning background</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.839" end="00:38:06.790" style="s2">and saying yes there&#39;s there&#39;s been in</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.810" end="00:38:09.410" style="s2">the Journal of integral theory and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.790" end="00:38:12.220" style="s2">practice an article written on Patrick</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.410" end="00:38:14.930" style="s2">Geddes an early integrate integralists</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.220" end="00:38:17.630" style="s2">and your description of the outlook</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.930" end="00:38:19.339" style="s2">tower sort of is a way for me to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.630" end="00:38:23.060" style="s2">well that&#39;s what I would like to do is</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.339" end="00:38:27.369" style="s2">bring all the interests together and say</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.060" end="00:38:31.130" style="s2">what if we were in Edinburgh and um</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.369" end="00:38:33.290" style="s2">we&#39;re now faced with all of these wicked</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.130" end="00:38:37.339" style="s2">problems and particularly climate</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.290" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">challenges how would we work together so</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.339" end="00:38:43.220" style="s2">that we could offer the ways that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:46.790" style="s2">many new insights that we have around</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.220" end="00:38:50.690" style="s2">building capacity how would we do that</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.790" end="00:38:53.900" style="s2">so my invitation for this urban hub book</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.690" end="00:38:56.630" style="s2">is kind of like that it turns out I</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.900" end="00:38:59.089" style="s2">actually also made the same proposal to</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.630" end="00:39:01.190" style="s2">the integral Europe conference I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.089" end="00:39:02.960" style="s2">put the two together until I started to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.190" end="00:39:05.300" style="s2">send the invitations for the urban hub</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.960" end="00:39:08.150" style="s2">and I realized how these are actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.300" end="00:39:13.490" style="s2">just part of a trajectory that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.150" end="00:39:18.260" style="s2">trying to synthesize all this expertise</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.490" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">in in service to cities and ecoregions</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.260" end="00:39:24.140" style="s2">so when I finished writing that first</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:26.950" style="s2">book which was had all of those</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.140" end="00:39:30.140" style="s2">intelligence is the last chapter was on</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.950" end="00:39:33.380" style="s2">evolutionary intelligence and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.140" end="00:39:35.270" style="s2">chapter I realized that what I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.380" end="00:39:37.250" style="s2">really saying in the whole rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.270" end="00:39:40.250" style="s2">book was there was a code there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.250" end="00:39:45.500" style="s2">master code that we can live by in</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.250" end="00:39:48.830" style="s2">service to human systems and and all</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.500" end="00:39:52.099" style="s2">that is and I call it to care for</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.830" end="00:39:53.670" style="s2">yourself you must care for yourself so</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.099" end="00:39:55.770" style="s2">you can care for others</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.670" end="00:39:58.470" style="s2">and we care for others so we can care</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.770" end="00:39:59.400" style="s2">for our places and together we can care</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.470" end="00:40:03.930" style="s2">for the planet</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">so like individual others some planet</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.930" end="00:40:09.150" style="s2">and that together is is the master code</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.480" end="00:40:11.880" style="s2">and I even borrowed from Aurobindo I</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.150" end="00:40:14.010" style="s2">think it&#39;s like an integral yoga at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.880" end="00:40:16.079" style="s2">end of every day I asked myself how have</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.010" end="00:40:18.750" style="s2">I done that how have I done that caring</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.079" end="00:40:20.700" style="s2">for self others placing planet I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.750" end="00:40:24.119" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because it for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.700" end="00:40:26.369" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a reframing interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.119" end="00:40:29.069" style="s2">reframing because if you put your put in</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.369" end="00:40:32.309" style="s2">place and then in that way because for</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.069" end="00:40:35.400" style="s2">like I understood that the question of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.309" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">how do I serve self community and life</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.400" end="00:40:42.270" style="s2">or planet is is really at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:44.730" style="s2">almost all indigenous cultures like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.270" end="00:40:48.470" style="s2">is a master quote that is how we as</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.730" end="00:40:53.010" style="s2">human beings have learned to live over</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.470" end="00:40:55.589" style="s2">millennia in in a sense of a way but but</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.010" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">by putting place in particularly at this</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.589" end="00:41:01.460" style="s2">point in time it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.839" end="00:41:04.950" style="s2">invitation to reconnection to the earth</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.460" end="00:41:06.510" style="s2">which of course you could say it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.950" end="00:41:09.900" style="s2">the how do I serve planet or how do I</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.510" end="00:41:12.390" style="s2">serve life but right now what we in so</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.900" end="00:41:14.940" style="s2">need is that deeper reconnection and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.390" end="00:41:16.799" style="s2">I was I just saw that and in general I</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.940" end="00:41:19.829" style="s2">think your integral city side is an</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.799" end="00:41:22.170" style="s2">incredible piece of work the layers and</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.829" end="00:41:26.099" style="s2">layers of mapping you&#39;ve done and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.170" end="00:41:30.270" style="s2">synthesizing is um is really like what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.099" end="00:41:32.040" style="s2">always ask myself is I hope like I</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.270" end="00:41:36.780" style="s2">really hope that resources like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.040" end="00:41:39.420" style="s2">actually get to use that well because</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.780" end="00:41:41.220" style="s2">they offer so much but there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.420" end="00:41:45.530" style="s2">out there then I&#39;m often wondering do</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.220" end="00:41:47.339" style="s2">people actually find the site and use it</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.530" end="00:41:50.130" style="s2">so is that a question</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.339" end="00:41:52.290" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s it&#39;s a question and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.130" end="00:41:54.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s also a question for me and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.290" end="00:41:59.990" style="s2">leads to another question I would like</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.839" end="00:42:05.869" style="s2">to to ask you and which is this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.990" end="00:42:05.869" style="s2">urgency of unraveling of</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:15.490" style="s2">more and more voices falling into acid</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.020" end="00:42:18.859" style="s2">apocalyptic tone about the future and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.490" end="00:42:22.510" style="s2">where of course we need to be realistic</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.859" end="00:42:25.970" style="s2">about to an extent we&#39;ve committed</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.510" end="00:42:27.589" style="s2">already because of lag in the system of</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.970" end="00:42:31.099" style="s2">climate change and so on we&#39;ve committed</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.589" end="00:42:34.280" style="s2">to things getting worse and there</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.099" end="00:42:36.849" style="s2">already have been getting worse so much</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.280" end="00:42:39.470" style="s2">faster in the last three four five years</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.849" end="00:42:42.380" style="s2">which is why people are finally starting</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.470" end="00:42:45.460" style="s2">to wake up but but in in this context of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.380" end="00:42:50.450" style="s2">this urgency on this nice edge of of</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.460" end="00:42:53.570" style="s2">we&#39;re within one limited frame within</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.450" end="00:42:57.410" style="s2">just one type of scientific analysis you</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.570" end="00:42:59.270" style="s2">could say it&#39;s too late possibly but</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.410" end="00:43:02.270" style="s2">since we know that there are many</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.270" end="00:43:04.760" style="s2">multiple friends and the system is much</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.270" end="00:43:08.710" style="s2">more complex and surprising than we</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.760" end="00:43:11.780" style="s2">could ever map um how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.710" end="00:43:15.829" style="s2">because you and I like we&#39;ve just talked</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.780" end="00:43:19.550" style="s2">about wonderful important needs for</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.829" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">integration but how few people really</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.550" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">care about that at this point in time</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:26.869" style="s2">how many people are still out there</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:30.140" style="s2">caring about other things and and how</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.869" end="00:43:31.910" style="s2">how does that connect to how much time</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.140" end="00:43:36.500" style="s2">we&#39;ve got left how do we become most</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.910" end="00:43:38.960" style="s2">effective in what we do well great</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.500" end="00:43:43.569" style="s2">question and one I wrestle with all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.960" end="00:43:45.230" style="s2">time these days so some of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.569" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">inspirations you&#39;ve already brought</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.230" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">forward I will say one place that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:56.900" style="s2">always believed was important was Gettys</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:57.619" style="s2">think local act global no think global</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.900" end="00:43:59.569" style="s2">act local</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.619" end="00:44:02.810" style="s2">but people have reversed it that way and</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.569" end="00:44:07.010" style="s2">you know our mutual friend Judy Ravana&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.810" end="00:44:11.089" style="s2">said think cosmic feel global act local</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.010" end="00:44:15.800" style="s2">and I feel it&#39;s very important for</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.089" end="00:44:18.260" style="s2">people to have a local relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.800" end="00:44:20.660" style="s2">earth with place because</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.260" end="00:44:24.260" style="s2">that&#39;s where their energy will be I</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.660" end="00:44:30.500" style="s2">haven&#39;t stopped following the energy so</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.260" end="00:44:32.870" style="s2">I feel that people care deeply for those</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.500" end="00:44:37.190" style="s2">people that matter to them and the earth</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.870" end="00:44:40.550" style="s2">I think we see that rising and of course</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.190" end="00:44:43.010" style="s2">the media doesn&#39;t always play it out as</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.550" end="00:44:45.140" style="s2">is what&#39;s actually happening locally</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.010" end="00:44:47.540" style="s2">like say with extinction rebellion with</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.140" end="00:44:49.790" style="s2">it with the local people who have sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.540" end="00:44:54.500" style="s2">of built on all that years of work out</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.790" end="00:44:56.810" style="s2">of transition towns and other other ways</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.500" end="00:45:02.290" style="s2">where they younger people have woken up</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.810" end="00:45:02.290" style="s2">and said we don&#39;t we don&#39;t accept this</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.380" end="00:45:08.470" style="s2">way of disrespecting the earth which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.440" end="00:45:10.820" style="s2">what they&#39;re pointing to basically</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.470" end="00:45:13.490" style="s2">corporations and capitalism as it</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.820" end="00:45:15.950" style="s2">currently exists how are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.490" end="00:45:18.020" style="s2">find our way out of here I think we all</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.950" end="00:45:21.800" style="s2">have to do it together and I have always</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.020" end="00:45:25.580" style="s2">thought that was one of values and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.800" end="00:45:27.410" style="s2">benefits of cities is because in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.580" end="00:45:30.020" style="s2">developed world ninety percent of us</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.410" end="00:45:32.120" style="s2">live in cities when we average it out</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.020" end="00:45:35.060" style="s2">across the whole world 60 percent of us</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.120" end="00:45:37.310" style="s2">live in cities and I think that that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.060" end="00:45:41.500" style="s2">where change is happening because it</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.310" end="00:45:43.970" style="s2">must cities are where we reflect our</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.500" end="00:45:50.840" style="s2">relationships and agreements on a day to</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.970" end="00:45:52.640" style="s2">day basis but we also know as the one</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.840" end="00:45:54.710" style="s2">thing that globalization has enabled as</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.640" end="00:45:58.010" style="s2">most people have some idea that their</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.710" end="00:46:01.130" style="s2">food doesn&#39;t just come from the grocery</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.010" end="00:46:04.250" style="s2">store but they must actually understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.130" end="00:46:06.350" style="s2">something about ecoregions and/or how</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.250" end="00:46:10.010" style="s2">far that food has been transported to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.350" end="00:46:11.510" style="s2">land on their plate so I feel that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.010" end="00:46:12.860" style="s2">opening up the same kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.510" end="00:46:16.910" style="s2">conversations I&#39;ve talked about before</p>

<p begin="00:50:55.730" end="00:51:00.650" style="s2">through the story of that fractal nested</p>

<p begin="00:52:03.680" end="00:52:14.420" style="s2">we&#39;re definitely called to trust that if</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.260" end="00:52:17.930" style="s2">consciousness is primary rather than</p>

<p begin="00:52:34.400" end="00:52:40.430" style="s2">still use science very centrally we need</p>

<p begin="00:52:50.110" end="00:52:55.210" style="s2">is actually to bring forth the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:59.500" style="s2">differently and that means change our</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.210" end="00:53:01.090" style="s2">way of being rather primarily and that</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.500" end="00:53:03.730" style="s2">will change the doing rather than</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.090" end="00:53:10.530" style="s2">constantly trying to adjust our doing</p>

<p begin="00:53:10.530" end="00:53:18.340" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I feel like part of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:25.830" style="s2">with the city we envisioning the city as</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.340" end="00:53:28.000" style="s2">an expression of life and seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.830" end="00:53:30.040" style="s2">anybody who still tells you that</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.000" end="00:53:39.700" style="s2">evolution and life is about competition</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.040" end="00:53:43.780" style="s2">and scarcity like look you&#39;re telling me</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.700" end="00:53:45.940" style="s2">that competition has shaped the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.780" end="00:53:49.750" style="s2">evolution of life and then you&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.940" end="00:53:53.850" style="s2">in a city where if you if you like take</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.750" end="00:54:00.210" style="s2">a city like New York with either 15</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.850" end="00:54:03.520" style="s2">these days the amount of murders and</p>

<p begin="00:54:42.790" end="00:54:48.070" style="s2">when we met each other 12 years ago or</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.310" end="00:54:50.740" style="s2">so you know she was talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.070" end="00:54:53.610" style="s2">cell as a city and I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.740" end="00:54:57.070" style="s2">the city as a cell and we realized Oh</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.610" end="00:54:58.819" style="s2">fractals different scales and just had</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.070" end="00:55:01.910" style="s2">so much resonance</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.819" end="00:55:04.969" style="s2">how she was seeing the city just as I</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.910" end="00:55:06.949" style="s2">was in traveling from 30,000 feet oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.969" end="00:55:10.279" style="s2">this is this is what I call a meshwork</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.949" end="00:55:13.219" style="s2">it&#39;s actually we can see the built form</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.279" end="00:55:14.809" style="s2">and in fact cities are the only human</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.219" end="00:55:17.359" style="s2">system you can actually see from space</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.809" end="00:55:18.919" style="s2">you can&#39;t see the nation&#39;s but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.359" end="00:55:23.329" style="s2">cities you can see you can see where the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.919" end="00:55:25.999" style="s2">energy has been amplified and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.329" end="00:55:28.569" style="s2">important for us to do just what you</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.999" end="00:55:32.329" style="s2">have described here to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.569" end="00:55:35.839" style="s2">consciousness in to complement the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.329" end="00:55:40.429" style="s2">biology and the systems that we created</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.839" end="00:55:42.799" style="s2">and I&#39;ve said for a long time my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.429" end="00:55:44.749" style="s2">was that new governance is not going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.799" end="00:55:47.839" style="s2">come from Nations new governance will</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.749" end="00:55:50.900" style="s2">come from cities because we must create</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.839" end="00:55:52.699" style="s2">new governance in order to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.900" end="00:55:54.140" style="s2">be able to collaborate together and</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.699" end="00:55:56.869" style="s2">that&#39;s what Elizabeth says where we are</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.140" end="00:56:02.109" style="s2">going through a species maturation</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.869" end="00:56:05.059" style="s2">process and that this false story about</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.109" end="00:56:07.819" style="s2">the competition as being the only way</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.059" end="00:56:10.699" style="s2">forward it has to give way to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.819" end="00:56:13.849" style="s2">cooperation and collaboration and she</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.699" end="00:56:15.949" style="s2">can point it the species all around the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.849" end="00:56:17.949" style="s2">earth where this has happened again and</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.949" end="00:56:22.759" style="s2">again and again so we are repeating a</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.949" end="00:56:25.909" style="s2">natural cycle and our capacity for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.759" end="00:56:28.189" style="s2">consciousness and the culture to become</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.909" end="00:56:30.319" style="s2">aware of our worldview to become aware</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.189" end="00:56:34.189" style="s2">that we are consciousness conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.319" end="00:56:37.219" style="s2">itself it is a miracle it&#39;s a miracle</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.189" end="00:56:40.249" style="s2">but for me one thing that that brings me</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.219" end="00:56:42.890" style="s2">back to the one of the deepest insights</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.249" end="00:56:46.989" style="s2">I got out of working with the integra</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.890" end="00:56:49.609" style="s2">map and what spiral dynamics I know</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.989" end="00:56:53.569" style="s2">almost 20 years ago when I first really</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.609" end="00:56:57.169" style="s2">got into it and this insight that it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.569" end="00:56:59.719" style="s2">an evolutionary dynamic map of course</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.169" end="00:57:02.119" style="s2">the big problem I always find with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.719" end="00:57:04.189" style="s2">integral communities that they they lose</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.119" end="00:57:06.709" style="s2">themselves in the frameworks of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.189" end="00:57:09.459" style="s2">theory and get rigid around that but</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.709" end="00:57:09.459" style="s2">that&#39;s a different story</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.540" end="00:57:16.690" style="s2">the developmental part of it like people</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.470" end="00:57:20.079" style="s2">who are in the second tier conversations</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.690" end="00:57:22.210" style="s2">very often fall into this trap of just</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.079" end="00:57:25.750" style="s2">trying to let&#39;s if let&#39;s lift everybody</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.210" end="00:57:28.720" style="s2">up into having this conversation and and</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.750" end="00:57:30.819" style="s2">not acknowledging that if this is an</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.720" end="00:57:34.000" style="s2">evolutionary process we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.819" end="00:57:36.670" style="s2">space for all the stages in it which</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.000" end="00:57:39.670" style="s2">means it will be rednecks in the future</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.670" end="00:57:42.609" style="s2">too but but how do you how do you become</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.670" end="00:57:47.530" style="s2">a healthy place grounded earth loving</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.609" end="00:57:51.190" style="s2">life supporting redneck and and and like</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.530" end="00:57:53.319" style="s2">that&#39;s again that&#39;s bad language or bad</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.190" end="00:57:56.230" style="s2">metaphor because I don&#39;t my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.319" end="00:58:00.130" style="s2">of rednecks in the slightest but but how</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.230" end="00:58:03.160" style="s2">do we create human systems where we see</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.130" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">diversity like we&#39;re now learning the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.160" end="00:58:07.839" style="s2">hard way that we deeply depend on on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.440" end="00:58:09.970" style="s2">on biodiversity and the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.839" end="00:58:11.829" style="s2">life and that the species extinction</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.970" end="00:58:13.690" style="s2">will bring our extinction if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.829" end="00:58:16.180" style="s2">watch out and since we&#39;re a complex</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.690" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">species we&#39;ve gone very quickly the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.180" end="00:58:20.560" style="s2">microbes are gonna and the mushrooms are</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:25.990" style="s2">gonna come back and bring back life long</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.560" end="00:58:30.670" style="s2">after us but but the the how do we</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.990" end="00:58:32.079" style="s2">really work with all of our diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.670" end="00:58:35.109" style="s2">opinions and world views and</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.079" end="00:58:38.050" style="s2">perspectives in a constructive way that</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.109" end="00:58:41.609" style="s2">doesn&#39;t try to get into agreement</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.050" end="00:58:45.300" style="s2">because never get there but honest</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.609" end="00:58:48.010" style="s2">disagreement and diversity in a way as</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.300" end="00:58:50.950" style="s2">the source of creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.010" end="00:58:53.380" style="s2">adaptability and vitality then will</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.950" end="00:58:55.960" style="s2">allow us to keep evolving into the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.380" end="00:58:58.000" style="s2">future but that shift at this point</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.960" end="00:59:01.810" style="s2">where they&#39;re such polarization seems to</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.000" end="00:59:07.240" style="s2">be so hard to make it&#39;s easy to think of</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.810" end="00:59:09.280" style="s2">it intellectually but but it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.240" end="00:59:11.980" style="s2">so you just raised something else that</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.280" end="00:59:15.490" style="s2">we agree on that was one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.980" end="00:59:17.740" style="s2">that um I really appreciated from Claire</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.490" end="00:59:19.780" style="s2">Graves who was the researcher behind</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.740" end="00:59:21.069" style="s2">spiral dynamics who said you must allow</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.780" end="00:59:24.069" style="s2">people to be who they</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.069" end="00:59:26.499" style="s2">at the stage that they are and he was</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.069" end="00:59:29.499" style="s2">the first person that I know who really</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.499" end="00:59:31.239" style="s2">um managed to see human systems</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.499" end="00:59:34.859" style="s2">development within the context of life</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.239" end="00:59:38.049" style="s2">conditions so that meant both the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.859" end="00:59:39.880" style="s2">cultural and social and also the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.049" end="00:59:42.039" style="s2">environmental life conditions in my</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.880" end="00:59:44.739" style="s2">opinion it wasn&#39;t always unpacked that</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.039" end="00:59:47.979" style="s2">way but I always saw it that way and a</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.739" end="00:59:49.900" style="s2">lot of in integralists don&#39;t they forget</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.979" end="00:59:51.699" style="s2">about the life conditions piece that</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.900" end="00:59:54.699" style="s2">we&#39;re co-creating like conditions as</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.699" end="00:59:56.739" style="s2">they&#39;re co-creating us and that as you</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.699" end="00:59:58.630" style="s2">point out as why there is a chapter in</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.739" end="01:00:00.400" style="s2">the first book I just published the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.630" end="01:00:03.729" style="s2">second edition of that kept that in</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.400" end="01:00:06.669" style="s2">there about generations um you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.729" end="01:00:08.789" style="s2">people will evolve through their own</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.669" end="01:00:11.469" style="s2">lives through these different stages and</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.789" end="01:00:14.140" style="s2">I think that one of the ways that we</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.469" end="01:00:17.169" style="s2">might shift from polarities is to go</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.140" end="01:00:19.029" style="s2">back and reclaim at a new level of</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.169" end="01:00:23.019" style="s2">complexity some of the practices from</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.029" end="01:00:25.630" style="s2">tribes who had life passages through</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.019" end="01:00:27.939" style="s2">these different stages and celebrated</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.630" end="01:00:31.239" style="s2">them so that there was healthy read as</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.939" end="01:00:35.619" style="s2">you say it&#39;s gonna happen so they had</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.239" end="01:00:38.559" style="s2">ways of bringing young people into their</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.619" end="01:00:41.650" style="s2">manhood or womanhood and they had rites</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.559" end="01:00:44.559" style="s2">of passage where they learned both the</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.650" end="01:00:47.679" style="s2">energies of that value system and that</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.559" end="01:00:49.989" style="s2">capacity and that made them ready for</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.679" end="01:00:54.549" style="s2">when they would move on into a more</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.989" end="01:00:58.150" style="s2">complex system and the thing that cities</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.549" end="01:00:59.919" style="s2">offer us is very cook the large cities</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.150" end="01:01:03.789" style="s2">you mentioned the year well I was in in</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.919" end="01:01:05.829" style="s2">Delhi in India 26 million people and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.789" end="01:01:08.559" style="s2">was really curious what I would see</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.829" end="01:01:10.569" style="s2">there so I I was looking for a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.559" end="01:01:12.459" style="s2">diversity I was quite surprised at how</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.569" end="01:01:15.519" style="s2">modern the city is because I had all</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.459" end="01:01:17.919" style="s2">kinds of ideas and stereotypes and in my</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.519" end="01:01:21.239" style="s2">mind but also looking at the different</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.919" end="01:01:24.999" style="s2">layers of the ways that people lived in</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.239" end="01:01:28.119" style="s2">their habitats on the streets with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.999" end="01:01:30.819" style="s2">different transportation systems how I</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.119" end="01:01:34.280" style="s2">would say globalization has really</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.819" end="01:01:37.790" style="s2">impacted and destroyed a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.280" end="01:01:41.930" style="s2">flow in the culture and sped it up to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.790" end="01:01:43.640" style="s2">such levels of risk and threat that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.930" end="01:01:46.130" style="s2">truly for somebody who doesn&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.640" end="01:01:49.610" style="s2">there on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.130" end="01:01:51.530" style="s2">very causing me to live on the edge of</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.610" end="01:01:54.710" style="s2">my seat you&#39;ve been there you know that</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.530" end="01:01:57.350" style="s2">I once took a took took from cannot</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.710" end="01:02:00.860" style="s2">circus to the Sun Abaza area of Delhi</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.350" end="01:02:06.230" style="s2">and it was probably like my adrenaline</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.860" end="01:02:09.380" style="s2">levels whenever I know I know but but</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.230" end="01:02:12.710" style="s2">within cities whether it&#39;s New York or</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.380" end="01:02:16.610" style="s2">Delhi that the cities where there is so</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.710" end="01:02:19.640" style="s2">many cultures mixing we&#39;re having to</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.610" end="01:02:22.720" style="s2">find diversity not in just how we make</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.640" end="01:02:26.390" style="s2">decisions or the whole but how those</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.720" end="01:02:28.550" style="s2">decisions are made for the smaller parts</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.390" end="01:02:30.170" style="s2">of the whole where we still have groups</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.550" end="01:02:32.660" style="s2">of people who want to stay together</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.170" end="01:02:35.810" style="s2">because that&#39;s their choice but in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.660" end="01:02:37.370" style="s2">city they have to figure out how are we</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.810" end="01:02:39.980" style="s2">going to live here well this very</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.370" end="01:02:43.010" style="s2">different group of people lives here and</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.980" end="01:02:47.150" style="s2">I think cities will continue to be a</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.010" end="01:02:51.380" style="s2">place where if we don&#39;t get integration</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.150" end="01:02:53.060" style="s2">will will get all kinds of synthesis</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.380" end="01:02:56.660" style="s2">that some of which we can&#39;t even imagine</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.060" end="01:02:59.840" style="s2">now some some some will be I will create</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.660" end="01:03:01.790" style="s2">whole new convergences because people</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.840" end="01:03:05.690" style="s2">will decide they they will come together</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.790" end="01:03:07.850" style="s2">but I think we&#39;ll see quite much more of</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.690" end="01:03:11.740" style="s2">what I would call an ecology of cultures</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.850" end="01:03:15.160" style="s2">that will find it like a forest has a</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.740" end="01:03:17.780" style="s2">million niches and I think that a city</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.160" end="01:03:19.670" style="s2">even if we just looked at say a modern</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.780" end="01:03:22.490" style="s2">city it has that that&#39;s what makes it</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.670" end="01:03:25.040" style="s2">work is the capacity to share labor and</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.490" end="01:03:26.950" style="s2">find niches that allow us to grow I</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.040" end="01:03:31.460" style="s2">think we&#39;re going to find that will</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.950" end="01:03:35.030" style="s2">intensify intensify even more and so if</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.460" end="01:03:37.220" style="s2">we I would agree and I&#39;m just thinking</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.030" end="01:03:42.400" style="s2">how do you impose the enabling</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.220" end="01:03:45.860" style="s2">constraints of living within a planets I</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.400" end="01:03:50.060" style="s2">have physical boundaries yeah systems</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.860" end="01:03:52.430" style="s2">that you also want to be as diverse in</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.060" end="01:03:56.150" style="s2">their expression and and cultural</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.430" end="01:04:00.320" style="s2">exploration as possible in with within</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.150" end="01:04:05.780" style="s2">that is also the question of do we just</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.320" end="01:04:08.360" style="s2">accept that technology has been created</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.780" end="01:04:10.730" style="s2">in such a way so far that it has almost</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.360" end="01:04:12.770" style="s2">become an autopoietic runaway system</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.730" end="01:04:17.120" style="s2">that that we&#39;re now running after rather</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.770" end="01:04:20.180" style="s2">than guiding or do we understand that</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.120" end="01:04:22.430" style="s2">since all technology is ultimately human</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.180" end="01:04:25.640" style="s2">intention turned into some form of</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.430" end="01:04:30.590" style="s2">design process like machinery and so on</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.640" end="01:04:33.200" style="s2">that we also have potential of choosing</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.590" end="01:04:36.500" style="s2">not to use technology because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.200" end="01:04:39.620" style="s2">like there&#39;s a bifurcation nevermind if</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.500" end="01:04:42.020" style="s2">the physical danger of life unraveling</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.620" end="01:04:45.370" style="s2">there&#39;s also a technological danger of</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.020" end="01:04:47.720" style="s2">us bifurcating into a different type of</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.370" end="01:04:50.930" style="s2">technologically enhanced species that</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.720" end="01:04:53.890" style="s2">that might create some opportunities but</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.930" end="01:04:56.590" style="s2">will also kill a lot of what</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.890" end="01:04:59.000" style="s2">evolutionary life has been about so far</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.590" end="01:05:01.760" style="s2">you know I think that&#39;s one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.000" end="01:05:04.040" style="s2">cities as a whole are tend to still be</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.760" end="01:05:05.870" style="s2">very disconnected with and that is there</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.040" end="01:05:09.260" style="s2">I believe they have a responsibility to</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.870" end="01:05:12.350" style="s2">their bio region so and this is I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.260" end="01:05:14.510" style="s2">in most cities everywhere there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.350" end="01:05:17.900" style="s2">awareness that they have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.510" end="01:05:20.780" style="s2">responsibility to know where their</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.900" end="01:05:23.750" style="s2">energy literally their their their</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.780" end="01:05:26.420" style="s2">foodstuffs energy and life stuffs energy</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.750" end="01:05:28.670" style="s2">is coming from and how to replenish it</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.420" end="01:05:30.890" style="s2">so one of the other things we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.670" end="01:05:35.000" style="s2">mentioned is that I call cities human</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.890" end="01:05:38.390" style="s2">hives and I have learned from the</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.000" end="01:05:40.550" style="s2">biomimicry study of bees particularly</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.390" end="01:05:44.420" style="s2">honeybees that they actually have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.550" end="01:05:46.670" style="s2">double sustainability loop so they have</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.420" end="01:05:49.250" style="s2">organized the hive so that they produce</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.670" end="01:05:51.200" style="s2">their twenty kilograms of honey a year</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.250" end="01:05:53.090" style="s2">and that&#39;s where the four voices come</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.200" end="01:05:56.000" style="s2">from the four voices that I use in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.090" end="01:05:59.810" style="s2">city I have learned from the bees</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.000" end="01:06:02.810" style="s2">and in order to do that though they</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.810" end="01:06:04.640" style="s2">pollinate the ecoregion and as they</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.810" end="01:06:08.990" style="s2">pollinate they are actually creating</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.640" end="01:06:12.860" style="s2">energy for next year so the pollination</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.990" end="01:06:15.200" style="s2">process serves them for the energy now</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.860" end="01:06:17.450" style="s2">but also the energy in the future and</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.200" end="01:06:20.360" style="s2">the pollination serves all of the rest</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.450" end="01:06:23.600" style="s2">of the ecology that their hide exists in</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.360" end="01:06:25.790" style="s2">and that I think is the set of</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.600" end="01:06:26.180" style="s2">principles that I think the cities need</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.790" end="01:06:27.980" style="s2">to learn</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.180" end="01:06:30.260" style="s2">I think yetis knew that I think that was</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.980" end="01:06:33.070" style="s2">one of the he also loved feeds and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.260" end="01:06:35.440" style="s2">think he pointed to the same kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.070" end="01:06:38.570" style="s2">relationship could you just briefly</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.440" end="01:06:40.220" style="s2">repeat the four voices because you</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.570" end="01:06:42.040" style="s2">mentioned him a number of times and just</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.220" end="01:06:44.560" style="s2">also for its other people listen to</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.040" end="01:06:47.780" style="s2">bring them back into people&#39;s awareness</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.560" end="01:06:51.860" style="s2">yep so the four voices in the city are</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.780" end="01:06:56.000" style="s2">the citizens and in the Beehive those</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.860" end="01:06:59.060" style="s2">are the forager producers in the city</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.000" end="01:07:00.740" style="s2">the second voice is the civic manager so</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.060" end="01:07:04.910" style="s2">that&#39;s like everybody City Hall</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.740" end="01:07:08.870" style="s2">Education Health Public Works emergency</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.910" end="01:07:13.100" style="s2">fire police and in the Beehive we would</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.870" end="01:07:15.140" style="s2">call those resource allocators the third</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.100" end="01:07:16.970" style="s2">voice are I call them business</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.140" end="01:07:19.550" style="s2">innovators but innovators of all kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.970" end="01:07:22.120" style="s2">and in the Beehive they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.550" end="01:07:24.050" style="s2">diversity generators they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.120" end="01:07:27.530" style="s2">intentionally there to bring in</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.050" end="01:07:29.780" style="s2">innovation and and source new sources of</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.530" end="01:07:32.060" style="s2">energy and then the fourth voice in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.780" end="01:07:35.270" style="s2">city is the third sector or a civil</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.060" end="01:07:37.610" style="s2">society and in the Beehive I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.270" end="01:07:40.850" style="s2">that&#39;s actually the inner judges or the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.610" end="01:07:41.510" style="s2">hive mind and that and that the hive</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.850" end="01:07:43.850" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.510" end="01:07:47.240" style="s2">and the resource allocators in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.850" end="01:07:49.730" style="s2">beehive are the ones that tell us tell</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.240" end="01:07:53.210" style="s2">the hive are we on track to produce our</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.730" end="01:07:55.730" style="s2">twenty kilograms of honey but in so</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.210" end="01:07:58.760" style="s2">doing they also are enabling that um</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.730" end="01:08:01.940" style="s2">double loop of of sustainability to go</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.760" end="01:08:03.770" style="s2">on so those are the four voices in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.940" end="01:08:09.010" style="s2">city citizens and civic managers</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.770" end="01:08:09.010" style="s2">business innovators and civil society</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.290" end="01:08:13.700" style="s2">initially you know that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.420" end="01:08:15.560" style="s2">whole movement around the 4th sector</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.700" end="01:08:17.960" style="s2">networks and which work with the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.560" end="01:08:21.140" style="s2">traditional business sector public</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.960" end="01:08:24.319" style="s2">sector in NGO sector and then they</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.140" end="01:08:27.080" style="s2">called the fourth sector the the people</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.319" end="01:08:31.190" style="s2">who who like in a nutshell definition</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.080" end="01:08:32.960" style="s2">use the tools of the business world to</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.190" end="01:08:35.180" style="s2">address the problems that the private</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.960" end="01:08:38.180" style="s2">sector the public sector isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.180" end="01:08:41.560" style="s2">addressing effectively but with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.180" end="01:08:46.130" style="s2">ethics of the third sector the NGOs and</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.560" end="01:08:48.470" style="s2">civil society and have you ever come</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.130" end="01:08:51.530" style="s2">across people confusing those four</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.470" end="01:08:52.990" style="s2">voices and the four sectors no I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.530" end="01:08:55.280" style="s2">yet because I haven&#39;t been in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.990" end="01:08:57.890" style="s2">discourse like that but I would say</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.280" end="01:09:01.910" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting because I am</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.890" end="01:09:04.580" style="s2">noticing that often times two or three</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.910" end="01:09:07.100" style="s2">of those voices are turning up sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.580" end="01:09:08.780" style="s2">four and slightly different variations</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.100" end="01:09:13.540" style="s2">on them because people have you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.780" end="01:09:16.010" style="s2">they maybe develop them from a rational</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.540" end="01:09:19.339" style="s2">analysis as I said I was inspired</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.010" end="01:09:21.410" style="s2">through a biomimicry to say oh I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.339" end="01:09:24.020" style="s2">this is this pattern that the bees have</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.410" end="01:09:26.180" style="s2">actually exists at the city we just</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.020" end="01:09:29.030" style="s2">don&#39;t see it we don&#39;t use that pattern</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.180" end="01:09:31.310" style="s2">but I started to call it I started to</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.030" end="01:09:34.580" style="s2">call the voices together around the same</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.310" end="01:09:35.870" style="s2">table and I noticed the difference and</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.580" end="01:09:38.930" style="s2">the difference prevented the</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.870" end="01:09:41.810" style="s2">polarization because the bees are</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.930" end="01:09:44.839" style="s2">serving the health of the individual as</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.810" end="01:09:47.210" style="s2">well as the health of the whole um the</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.839" end="01:09:49.850" style="s2">city needs to do both that and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.210" end="01:09:52.339" style="s2">health of the eco of the health of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.850" end="01:09:55.760" style="s2">planet that&#39;s why that layers of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.339" end="01:09:58.820" style="s2">master code really matter and I see how</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.760" end="01:10:03.200" style="s2">I it&#39;s it&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.820" end="01:10:05.720" style="s2">of course you&#39;d expect that but learning</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.200" end="01:10:08.390" style="s2">and deepening into the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.720" end="01:10:11.330" style="s2">regenerative practice work that that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.390" end="01:10:13.220" style="s2">curated and held by-by the Regenesis</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.330" end="01:10:17.270" style="s2">Institute by Ben Haggard and Pamela</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.220" end="01:10:20.250" style="s2">Mannion and Bill Reid and and all these</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.270" end="01:10:23.710" style="s2">wonderful people I&#39;ve I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.250" end="01:10:27.280" style="s2">recognize so many of my own frameworks</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.710" end="01:10:29.290" style="s2">that have together and integrated and</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.280" end="01:10:32.770" style="s2">synthesized over the last 20 years and</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.290" end="01:10:35.080" style="s2">and fell the real parallel evolution and</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.770" end="01:10:37.180" style="s2">the similarly as I listen to you and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.080" end="01:10:40.150" style="s2">and as I was navigating the entire city</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.180" end="01:10:43.720" style="s2">website I realized wow like this we</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.150" end="01:10:45.430" style="s2">could talk for weeks still have lots of</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.720" end="01:10:49.420" style="s2">points of deepening because it is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.430" end="01:10:51.630" style="s2">fractal thing we could dive off in every</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.420" end="01:10:55.780" style="s2">direction but this has been in</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.630" end="01:10:58.330" style="s2">incredibly rich and before we finish and</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.780" end="01:11:00.160" style="s2">you briefly mentioned this this urban</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.330" end="01:11:02.710" style="s2">hub series and you yet invited me to</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.160" end="01:11:05.380" style="s2">contribute some something to it in in</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.710" end="01:11:07.000" style="s2">the next edition and can you tell a</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.380" end="01:11:08.860" style="s2">little bit more about that project</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.000" end="01:11:10.660" style="s2">because we already are on the 12th</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.860" end="01:11:14.410" style="s2">edition awesome something like that oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.660" end="01:11:16.330" style="s2">well yes well this urban hub series is</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.410" end="01:11:17.740" style="s2">actually now they&#39;ve produced the 19th</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.330" end="01:11:19.390" style="s2">one we&#39;re going to get the 20 will be</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.740" end="01:11:22.660" style="s2">urban hub 20 which i think is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.390" end="01:11:26.590" style="s2">beautiful nice symmetry 20 I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.660" end="01:11:29.350" style="s2">for 20 contributors in 2020 for urban</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.590" end="01:11:32.820" style="s2">hub 20 so this series was created by</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.350" end="01:11:35.800" style="s2">Paul van Schaik so Paul van Schaik is</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.820" end="01:11:38.980" style="s2">his organization integral Mentors</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.800" end="01:11:42.780" style="s2">he&#39;s been working as one of the earliest</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.980" end="01:11:44.860" style="s2">integral practitioners his first</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.780" end="01:11:47.470" style="s2">organization I think is called I shake</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.860" end="01:11:50.200" style="s2">and and I remembered seeing it on Ken</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.470" end="01:11:53.050" style="s2">Wilbur&#39;s website and discussions with</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.200" end="01:11:55.090" style="s2">him very early on Paul is also the</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.050" end="01:11:57.340" style="s2">co-founder of integral Without Borders</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.090" end="01:11:59.980" style="s2">so he works with Gayle ha-cha-cha</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.340" end="01:12:02.200" style="s2">and looking at how to bring integral and</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.980" end="01:12:05.910" style="s2">often into places in the developing</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.200" end="01:12:09.600" style="s2">world but Paul is also an architect and</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.910" end="01:12:13.270" style="s2">so he decided that his writing would be</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.600" end="01:12:16.240" style="s2">mostly graphic or at least 50% graphic</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.270" end="01:12:20.080" style="s2">in focus and he created a series of</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.240" end="01:12:21.850" style="s2">graphic books and he&#39;s published them so</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.080" end="01:12:26.770" style="s2">that they&#39;re all free and downloadable</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.850" end="01:12:30.490" style="s2">on the issue web site and you can also</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.770" end="01:12:32.470" style="s2">get a hard copy to run off of Amazon but</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.490" end="01:12:33.020" style="s2">I&#39;ve contributed to four or five of them</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.470" end="01:12:35.120" style="s2">and he</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.020" end="01:12:37.520" style="s2">brought different themes together and</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.120" end="01:12:40.610" style="s2">different practitioners from around the</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.520" end="01:12:43.340" style="s2">world and the basic layout of the book</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.610" end="01:12:46.190" style="s2">is very makes it very appealing I write</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.340" end="01:12:50.540" style="s2">you know very long narratives in my</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.190" end="01:12:53.780" style="s2">books but Paul looks that 50% of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.540" end="01:12:56.840" style="s2">message be graphic and 50% be narrative</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.780" end="01:12:59.540" style="s2">and so how we invite contributors is</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.840" end="01:13:01.130" style="s2">could you give us 6 PowerPoint slides</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.540" end="01:13:05.420" style="s2">because that&#39;s actually how we produce</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.130" end="01:13:07.910" style="s2">the book and 50% of your slides it can</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.420" end="01:13:11.450" style="s2">be each slide or how every wish however</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.910" end="01:13:14.120" style="s2">you wish to allocate it bring bring your</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.450" end="01:13:16.520" style="s2">message in a way that will be</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.120" end="01:13:18.710" style="s2">graphically appealing for readers and</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.520" end="01:13:23.300" style="s2">not just the meaning that you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.710" end="01:13:26.210" style="s2">in the words so when Paul I shared Paul</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.300" end="01:13:28.610" style="s2">with Paul my fantasy about bringing all</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.210" end="01:13:30.500" style="s2">the integralists together for one city I</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.610" end="01:13:32.240" style="s2">like I said what if that happened we</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.500" end="01:13:34.730" style="s2">could we could take a topic like climate</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.240" end="01:13:36.320" style="s2">change and how would we all surpass and</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.730" end="01:13:40.820" style="s2">he looked at me and said well why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.320" end="01:13:44.000" style="s2">you curate an urban hub to do that so I</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.820" end="01:13:44.540" style="s2">took that on and when I started to think</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.000" end="01:13:47.930" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.540" end="01:13:50.150" style="s2">the first major frame to curate around</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.930" end="01:13:53.150" style="s2">was the master code I thought well I</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.150" end="01:13:56.210" style="s2">will invite people who are thinking</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.150" end="01:13:59.270" style="s2">about planet people thinking about place</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.210" end="01:14:01.430" style="s2">people thinking about capacity</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.270" end="01:14:02.960" style="s2">development and others and thinking</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.430" end="01:14:06.290" style="s2">about capacity development in</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.960" end="01:14:09.890" style="s2">individuals and asked them what if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.290" end="01:14:13.940" style="s2">were all together in one city</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.890" end="01:14:17.000" style="s2">what would you contribute to building</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.940" end="01:14:19.880" style="s2">capacity so we could mean climate</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.000" end="01:14:24.440" style="s2">challenge I chose climate as sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.880" end="01:14:27.080" style="s2">example so you&#39;re one of the people I</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.440" end="01:14:33.410" style="s2">invited to contribute at the planetary</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.080" end="01:14:35.630" style="s2">scale and I think in our discussions you</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.410" end="01:14:40.150" style="s2">also obviously have a great heart for</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.630" end="01:14:42.650" style="s2">place and you obviously are well</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.150" end="01:14:45.560" style="s2">practiced and seeing the fractal</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.650" end="01:14:46.450" style="s2">patterns so I would love it if you could</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.560" end="01:14:48.540" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.450" end="01:14:51.400" style="s2">from this conversation some of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.540" end="01:14:53.950" style="s2">comments that you were making about the</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.400" end="01:14:57.220" style="s2">importance of city to relate to</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.950" end="01:15:00.520" style="s2">ecoregion to relate to watersheds and</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.220" end="01:15:02.980" style="s2">show how that contributes on a planetary</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.520" end="01:15:06.910" style="s2">scale you might want to borrow from</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.980" end="01:15:10.200" style="s2">Geddes I would be very happy for for</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.910" end="01:15:13.530" style="s2">that to turn up in the book I have</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.200" end="01:15:16.300" style="s2">contributors from all of the other</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.530" end="01:15:18.010" style="s2">scales in the master code so I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.300" end="01:15:22.510" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be I think we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.010" end="01:15:24.610" style="s2">have our our 24 20 20 and I had another</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.510" end="01:15:27.190" style="s2">piece of synchronicity happen I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.610" end="01:15:30.880" style="s2">appointed to be a fellow of the urban</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.190" end="01:15:33.900" style="s2">arena who are looking at sustainability</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.880" end="01:15:36.670" style="s2">and justice over the next two years we</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.900" end="01:15:38.740" style="s2">visiting about 400 different research</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.670" end="01:15:42.280" style="s2">projects and seeing if we can bring them</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.740" end="01:15:45.550" style="s2">together and offer them forward to</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.280" end="01:15:48.280" style="s2">European cities and while I was sharing</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.550" end="01:15:50.920" style="s2">the urban hub project with a woman from</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.280" end="01:15:53.980" style="s2">Lisbon it turned out they have a really</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.920" end="01:15:56.350" style="s2">nice integral group of thinkers in is</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.980" end="01:16:00.880" style="s2">Lisbon and they volunteered their city</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.350" end="01:16:02.920" style="s2">to be on target city for like okay what</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.880" end="01:16:04.600" style="s2">you bring in for the urban hub will look</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.920" end="01:16:08.140" style="s2">at and see how we could do that and</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.600" end="01:16:12.460" style="s2">enlist them because I think that if we</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.140" end="01:16:14.680" style="s2">do this in the one you know it&#39;ll be in</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.460" end="01:16:18.010" style="s2">the urban hub 20 that it&#39;ll become like</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.680" end="01:16:21.160" style="s2">a prototype at the intera Europe</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.010" end="01:16:24.250" style="s2">conference we&#39;re going to have the you</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.160" end="01:16:26.200" style="s2">theory as one of them and that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.250" end="01:16:28.150" style="s2">the final things that you do is the you</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.200" end="01:16:31.120" style="s2">Theory autogyros work is you come up</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.150" end="01:16:33.430" style="s2">with a prototype so in effect I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.120" end="01:16:36.100" style="s2">will produce a prototype that could be</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.430" end="01:16:39.100" style="s2">used at any city or village even because</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.100" end="01:16:41.800" style="s2">I imagine we can use this thinking back</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.100" end="01:16:43.810" style="s2">and pinpoint even and Lisbon is willing</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.800" end="01:16:46.600" style="s2">to take it on as urtica a first trial</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.810" end="01:16:49.849" style="s2">and see what they can learn from what we</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.600" end="01:16:53.699" style="s2">could call together what&#39;s the timeline</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.849" end="01:16:56.459" style="s2">he said contributions end of general</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.699" end="01:16:58.019" style="s2">yeah that one my invitation went out in</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.459" end="01:17:00.599" style="s2">December I was targeting the end of</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.019" end="01:17:04.289" style="s2">January yes I&#39;m open to a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.599" end="01:17:06.030" style="s2">negotiation if you need and the book is</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.289" end="01:17:07.800" style="s2">it because in that way you could</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.030" end="01:17:12.389" style="s2">probably produce it relatively quickly</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.800" end="01:17:16.409" style="s2">is it because this year 2020 Lisbon a</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.389" end="01:17:17.489" style="s2">city of yes it is yes as a mother</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.409" end="01:17:18.989" style="s2">synchronicity</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.489" end="01:17:21.089" style="s2">yes I didn&#39;t know that when when they</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.989" end="01:17:24.239" style="s2">came forward yes the brew the book will</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.089" end="01:17:26.459" style="s2">be produced by April I will be taking it</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.239" end="01:17:27.989" style="s2">to the integral Europe conference in May</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.459" end="01:17:30.929" style="s2">so yes this is one of the wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.989" end="01:17:33.449" style="s2">things Paul having done 19 of them has a</p>
