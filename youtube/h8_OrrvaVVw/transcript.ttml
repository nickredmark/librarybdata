<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:06.270" style="s2">hello there mr. Rubin all right JP</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.049" end="00:00:08.790" style="s2">January 1 we got anything good for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.270" end="00:00:12.540" style="s2">people well I don&#39;t know how good it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.790" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">I guess we&#39;re gonna find out how good it</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.540" end="00:00:17.550" style="s2">is it&#39;s not something I&#39;m thrilled about</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:19.170" style="s2">by any stretch of the imagination so you</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.550" end="00:00:19.890" style="s2">and I have been talking for a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.170" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">weeks now</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.890" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">ever since this scandal around carl</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.760" end="00:00:30.060" style="s2">benjamin or sargon of akkad broken we</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.449" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">decided a while back that we were going</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.060" end="00:00:35.550" style="s2">to well do a variety of things right we</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:37.980" style="s2">were going to announce our departure</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.550" end="00:00:41.250" style="s2">from patreon which is what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.980" end="00:00:45.059" style="s2">in this video I&#39;m going to leave patreon</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.250" end="00:00:47.700" style="s2">January 15th I also am going to leave</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.059" end="00:00:49.770" style="s2">patreon On January 15th which by the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.700" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">we should just be clear this is not</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.770" end="00:00:54.899" style="s2">something that we wanted to do we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:57.000" style="s2">both perfectly happy on patreon patreon</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.899" end="00:00:59.850" style="s2">at least for me it&#39;s been the backbone</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.000" end="00:01:02.250" style="s2">of my show I mean that&#39;s somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.850" end="00:01:03.930" style="s2">between 60 and 70 percent of our funding</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.250" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">is through patreon so this is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.930" end="00:01:06.930" style="s2">something we wanted to do I know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:09.780" style="s2">gonna talk about a whole bunch of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.930" end="00:01:11.610" style="s2">in this recording but that New York</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.780" end="00:01:13.619" style="s2">Times article that came out the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.610" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">implication was oh we&#39;re doing this for</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.619" end="00:01:17.850" style="s2">money it&#39;s like we&#39;re taking a major hit</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:19.950" style="s2">right now and opening ourselves up to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.850" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">all sorts of risks so I&#39;m going ahead</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:24.090" style="s2">and doing that because I believe we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:25.799" style="s2">do something better we&#39;ve got to figure</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.090" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">out exactly what that is and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.799" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">we&#39;re working on so we can say two</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:32.579" style="s2">things I mean I I&#39;d also like to thank</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:35.159" style="s2">the patreon people for what they did in</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.579" end="00:01:38.220" style="s2">the past because they provided me with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.159" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">tremendous amount of or the ability the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.220" end="00:01:41.670" style="s2">opportunity to generate a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.780" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">amount of financial support at a time I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:46.920" style="s2">really needed it and so I&#39;m not happy in</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:49.020" style="s2">the least with what has happened I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.920" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">thought about it a lot and believe that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.020" end="00:01:53.159" style="s2">given patrons proclivity to censor and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:54.570" style="s2">the reasons that they&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.159" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">especially as I&#39;ve looked more and more</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:02:01.140" style="s2">deeply into the reasons particularly</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:04.700" style="s2">with regards to my discovery of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.140" end="00:02:07.829" style="s2">website changed the terms I&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.700" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">increasingly convinced that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.829" end="00:02:12.780" style="s2">unethical to continue my association</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">with the company and I also agree jack</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.780" end="00:02:15.900" style="s2">conte said</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:17.909" style="s2">New York Times article trying to justify</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.900" end="00:02:19.620" style="s2">say Sam Harris&#39;s departure and our</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.909" end="00:02:22.530" style="s2">threatened departure that it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.620" end="00:02:24.840" style="s2">motivated primarily by financial gain</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.530" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">and like look I&#39;ve got nothing against</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.840" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">financial gain you know I&#39;ve said that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:33.299" style="s2">from the beginning I and if if things</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing generate an honest amount</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.299" end="00:02:37.400" style="s2">of money that I can put to reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:42.269" style="s2">use then so much the better</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.400" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">but if this is a major financial blow</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.269" end="00:02:46.049" style="s2">I&#39;m using the patreon money for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:47.970" style="s2">variety of reasons most particularly to</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.049" end="00:02:49.260" style="s2">support this educational endeavor that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.970" end="00:02:51.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve talked to people about right our</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.260" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">attempt to build an online education</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.420" end="00:02:55.590" style="s2">system and so like it&#39;s a major hit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:57.750" style="s2">and of course you know just to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.590" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">it&#39;s like when we&#39;re doing my show I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.750" end="00:03:01.049" style="s2">mean I don&#39;t have to tell everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:02.760" style="s2">about YouTube be monetization but for</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.049" end="00:03:05.519" style="s2">example in my show a week or two ago</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.760" end="00:03:07.500" style="s2">with Imam to Edie was demonetized by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.519" end="00:03:09.989" style="s2">algorithm then demonetised</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.500" end="00:03:12.450" style="s2">further after manual review by a human</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.989" end="00:03:14.609" style="s2">so it&#39;s patreon it&#39;s it&#39;s the supporters</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.450" end="00:03:17.090" style="s2">the individual people that allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.609" end="00:03:19.799" style="s2">go ahead and do more of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.090" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">controversial so to speak episodes so</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.799" end="00:03:23.250" style="s2">yeah just nothing that we&#39;re doing right</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:24.989" style="s2">now is against the people that have</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.250" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">supported us or our patrons or anything</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.989" end="00:03:28.889" style="s2">like that so this is about making a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:31.260" style="s2">stand against this ever moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.889" end="00:03:32.700" style="s2">encroachment on free speech on free</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.260" end="00:03:34.470" style="s2">expression and the rest of it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.700" end="00:03:36.810" style="s2">like this is one that we just feel is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.470" end="00:03:39.359" style="s2">the right one to make the move on and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.810" end="00:03:40.739" style="s2">the reason we jointly decided on January</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.359" end="00:03:43.560" style="s2">15th while there was a couple of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.739" end="00:03:45.389" style="s2">the first was that we thought that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.560" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">might have something approximating an</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.389" end="00:03:49.560" style="s2">alternative potentially available for</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:52.379" style="s2">preliminary launch of that date although</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.560" end="00:03:54.299" style="s2">we&#39;ve decided to delay that because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.379" end="00:03:55.739" style="s2">user interface needs work because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.299" end="00:03:57.569" style="s2">the other thing right is that there</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.739" end="00:03:59.940" style="s2">needs perhaps to be a replacement for</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.569" end="00:04:02.699" style="s2">patreon if that&#39;s a possibility like</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.940" end="00:04:06.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not obvious to me that corporations</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.699" end="00:04:09.239" style="s2">can run platforms for untrammeled</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:11.790" style="s2">communication successfully on the net in</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.239" end="00:04:13.709" style="s2">today&#39;s climate yeah would anything I</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.790" end="00:04:15.510" style="s2">might design but let&#39;s not let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.709" end="00:04:17.880" style="s2">gloss over that I mean it might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.510" end="00:04:19.889" style="s2">possible that the patreon method is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.880" end="00:04:21.239" style="s2">what&#39;s needed exactly for the future of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.889" end="00:04:22.890" style="s2">the Internet I mean this is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.239" end="00:04:25.380" style="s2">trying to figure out right now which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.890" end="00:04:26.760" style="s2">why we&#39;ve got every engineer I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.380" end="00:04:27.240" style="s2">people from Google and Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.760" end="00:04:28.680" style="s2">Yahoo</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.240" end="00:04:30.810" style="s2">everybody reaching out to us because</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.680" end="00:04:32.819" style="s2">it&#39;s like everyone&#39;s trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.810" end="00:04:33.870" style="s2">this problem and it&#39;s still I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.819" end="00:04:35.669" style="s2">of the things we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.870" end="00:04:37.770" style="s2">now for the last well it&#39;s really for</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.669" end="00:04:41.039" style="s2">the last year but in intensely in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.770" end="00:04:43.889" style="s2">last month is what actually is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.039" end="00:04:45.960" style="s2">problem itself because until we really</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.889" end="00:04:49.860" style="s2">figure out what the problem is well I</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.960" end="00:04:52.319" style="s2">think I think the problem is how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.860" end="00:04:53.039" style="s2">regulate an incredibly diverse range of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.319" end="00:04:55.729" style="s2">opinions</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.039" end="00:04:58.259" style="s2">if such regulation needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.729" end="00:05:01.289" style="s2">instantiated we could take a limit case</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.259" end="00:05:03.180" style="s2">for example the desire of companies like</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.289" end="00:05:05.789" style="s2">Facebook not to have their platforms</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.180" end="00:05:07.979" style="s2">used for recruitment for Isis it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.789" end="00:05:10.259" style="s2">to make a case that that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.979" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">reasonable restriction right but then</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.259" end="00:05:17.430" style="s2">but then the next issue is I think you</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:19.470" style="s2">could make an exception there because</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.430" end="00:05:22.289" style="s2">maybe you consider that a wartime</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.470" end="00:05:24.419" style="s2">exception or something like that but</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.289" end="00:05:26.669" style="s2">then the fundamental problem to me seems</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.419" end="00:05:29.340" style="s2">to be and I&#39;ll return again to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.669" end="00:05:32.750" style="s2">change the terms website that a whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.340" end="00:05:35.490" style="s2">variety of companies and organizations</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.750" end="00:05:37.310" style="s2">spearheaded in not least by the Southern</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.490" end="00:05:41.370" style="s2">Poverty Law Center that hateful</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.310" end="00:05:45.800" style="s2">organization yeah the worth that has</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.370" end="00:05:54.180" style="s2">decided that they&#39;re going to compel</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.800" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">encourage what the fame perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.180" end="00:05:58.380" style="s2">companies that don&#39;t band together to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:00.599" style="s2">regulate what they see as hate speech</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.380" end="00:06:02.729" style="s2">yeah and this is where well this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.599" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">where the moving line is the key part of</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.840" end="00:06:34.440" style="s2">pushback but this is just another level</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:35.159" style="s2">of the stand it&#39;s like they cannot be</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.139" end="00:06:44.530" style="s2">yeah but they are should have access</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.639" end="00:06:45.400" style="s2">it&#39;s really who should have access to</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.400" end="00:06:52.150" style="s2">no it&#39;s worse than that Dave because</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.110" end="00:06:54.069" style="s2">when they start to pressure the credit</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.150" end="00:06:55.810" style="s2">card companies and I would consider this</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.069" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">a warning to everyone who&#39;s listening is</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.810" end="00:07:00.189" style="s2">like okay let&#39;s think this through so</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:01.750" style="s2">the New York Times last week wrote an</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.189" end="00:07:03.909" style="s2">article about the credit cards</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.750" end="00:07:05.889" style="s2">complicity in loaning money to that</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.909" end="00:07:08.860" style="s2">terrible tiny minority of people who</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.889" end="00:07:10.990" style="s2">engaged in mass shootings right stating</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.860" end="00:07:12.669" style="s2">that it was the responsibility of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.990" end="00:07:14.710" style="s2">credit card companies to monitor and</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.710" end="00:07:20.710" style="s2">okay so what&#39;s this what&#39;s the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.990" end="00:07:24.159" style="s2">the idea is that the companies to whom</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.710" end="00:07:25.659" style="s2">we have entrusted our monetary system in</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.159" end="00:07:27.819" style="s2">large parts that would be the credit</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.659" end="00:07:30.340" style="s2">card companies now get to review our</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.819" end="00:07:32.409" style="s2">spending patterns to determine if what</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.340" end="00:07:33.940" style="s2">we purchase is in accordance with that</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.409" end="00:07:36.610" style="s2">with what they regard is morally</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.940" end="00:07:37.270" style="s2">acceptable okay and and we think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.610" end="00:07:39.370" style="s2">a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.270" end="00:07:41.229" style="s2">now that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.370" end="00:07:43.300" style="s2">MasterCard and Visa and PayPal are</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.229" end="00:07:45.099" style="s2">already starting to block people like</p>

<p begin="00:07:45.099" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">in blocking Spencer Robert Spencer right</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.460" end="00:07:53.110" style="s2">its Robert Spencer or not Richard</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.229" end="00:08:02.620" style="s2">just to be very clear they sent out a</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.000" end="00:08:04.210" style="s2">tweet which everyone can find I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.620" end="00:08:06.490" style="s2">shocked that they haven&#39;t deleted it yet</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.210" end="00:08:08.349" style="s2">where they said that they and they use</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.490" end="00:08:09.900" style="s2">this word which i think is the key to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.349" end="00:08:13.419" style="s2">the whole thing they said that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.900" end="00:08:16.210" style="s2">unfortunately had to delete his patreon</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.419" end="00:08:18.069" style="s2">because of MasterCard so what are they</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.210" end="00:08:20.050" style="s2">actually saying there are these patreon</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.069" end="00:08:22.990" style="s2">saying oh we didn&#39;t want to delete your</p>

<p begin="00:08:22.990" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">mean that is some deeply scary stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.750" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">yeah well and we have to talk about hate</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:32.969" style="s2">speech because you know I think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.680" end="00:08:35.380" style="s2">whole concept of look obviously there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.969" end="00:08:40.539" style="s2">people can be very nasty when they</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.380" end="00:08:44.169" style="s2">communicate but the idea that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.539" end="00:08:45.970" style="s2">identifiable category and you can put</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.169" end="00:08:47.380" style="s2">boundaries around it and terment hate</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.970" end="00:08:49.630" style="s2">speech and then you can produce</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.380" end="00:08:52.569" style="s2">committees or deal with people on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.630" end="00:08:53.900" style="s2">one-to-one basis as patreon is doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.569" end="00:08:55.970" style="s2">without any central</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.900" end="00:08:57.830" style="s2">policy or let&#39;s say despite their</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.970" end="00:08:59.560" style="s2">central policy or that you could turn</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.830" end="00:09:02.030" style="s2">that into an algorithm that could</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.560" end="00:09:04.070" style="s2">validly identify hate speech without</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.030" end="00:09:05.900" style="s2">producing false positives right without</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.070" end="00:09:07.820" style="s2">accusing people who shouldn&#39;t be accused</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.900" end="00:09:10.190" style="s2">of violating all of that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.820" end="00:09:12.860" style="s2">completely it&#39;s just Baker&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.190" end="00:09:14.960" style="s2">imagination as far of course and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.860" end="00:09:16.250" style="s2">also just opening a Pandora&#39;s box from</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.960" end="00:09:17.660" style="s2">Hell because just in the last couple</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.250" end="00:09:19.730" style="s2">days I don&#39;t know if you saw this but</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.660" end="00:09:21.500" style="s2">the women&#39;s March in California canceled</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.730" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">their rally because they felt that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.500" end="00:09:25.940" style="s2">was too white yeah now imagine if they</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:28.040" style="s2">canceled their rally because it was too</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.940" end="00:09:30.200" style="s2">black or to anything else it&#39;s like so</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.040" end="00:09:32.060" style="s2">does that now count as hey are you guys</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.200" end="00:09:33.770" style="s2">now being racist against white people no</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.060" end="00:09:35.810" style="s2">no that that wouldn&#39;t be a problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.770" end="00:09:38.840" style="s2">for these guys one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.810" end="00:09:40.940" style="s2">can&#39;t fathom in some sense is the lack</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.840" end="00:09:44.210" style="s2">of imagination on the part of the people</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.940" end="00:09:46.130" style="s2">who are engaging in censorship of what</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.210" end="00:09:48.620" style="s2">they regard as hate speech like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.130" end="00:09:50.360" style="s2">an old military adage which is that if</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.610" end="00:10:09.650" style="s2">makes them so sure that exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.340" end="00:10:11.750" style="s2">tactics won&#39;t be used against them like</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.650" end="00:10:13.940" style="s2">at the drop of a hat once once the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.750" end="00:10:15.890" style="s2">tactics have been validated and put in</p>

<p begin="00:10:15.890" end="00:10:19.400" style="s2">just very short sightedness on their</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.900" end="00:10:21.770" style="s2">hand or they think that they can</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.400" end="00:10:23.990" style="s2">actually stamp out enough hate within</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.770" end="00:10:25.460" style="s2">that very small window before it would</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.990" end="00:10:27.200" style="s2">turn on them or they just don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.460" end="00:10:28.970" style="s2">these things fully through but yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.200" end="00:10:31.760" style="s2">or or there&#39;s another there&#39;s another</p>

<p begin="00:12:05.630" end="00:12:10.480" style="s2">doing that so that&#39;s why this is so</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.220" end="00:12:13.810" style="s2">layered about speech and finance and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.480" end="00:12:16.190" style="s2">journal is so amazing to see journalists</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.810" end="00:12:18.740" style="s2">take the journal if one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.190" end="00:12:22.370" style="s2">that happened in Canada to me was that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.740" end="00:12:24.290" style="s2">you know after I made the initial videos</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.370" end="00:12:27.320" style="s2">that cause such a political furor was</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.290" end="00:12:28.820" style="s2">that once the main journalists in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.320" end="00:12:30.530" style="s2">sort of figured out what I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.820" end="00:12:32.900" style="s2">they all came out my support</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.530" end="00:12:34.970" style="s2">like the post media group which is 200</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.900" end="00:12:36.590" style="s2">newspapers all came out to support what</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.970" end="00:12:40.190" style="s2">I was doing because they realized that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.590" end="00:12:42.290" style="s2">oh they&#39;re journalists apart from</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.550" end="00:13:03.170" style="s2">is also an indication of that same kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.220" end="00:13:05.570" style="s2">of willful blindness that we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.170" end="00:13:07.310" style="s2">been discussing but having said that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.570" end="00:13:10.220" style="s2">would still like to say that I think the</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.220" end="00:13:14.780" style="s2">just made my jaw drop over the last</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.430" end="00:14:34.650" style="s2">that the test case well it I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.279" end="00:14:36.510" style="s2">it&#39;s an indication that the fact that</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.510" end="00:14:40.470" style="s2">is also an indication of the temptation</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.000" end="00:14:43.260" style="s2">that&#39;s intrinsic in the technological</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.470" end="00:14:45.029" style="s2">power the credit card companies are in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.260" end="00:14:47.610" style="s2">weird situation as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.029" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">because the only reason they work at all</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.610" end="00:14:53.940" style="s2">is because people actually trust them</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">completely remains like oh you&#39;re just a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.940" end="00:14:59.339" style="s2">proxy for money like you&#39;re a proxy for</p>

<p begin="00:15:01.440" end="00:15:05.339" style="s2">you&#39;re a proxy for cash and the</p>

<p begin="00:15:10.470" end="00:15:15.209" style="s2">money laundering laws and so forth but</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.630" end="00:15:16.890" style="s2">that&#39;s a direct violation of a law right</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.209" end="00:15:19.140" style="s2">that&#39;s part of tracking down criminal</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.890" end="00:15:22.440" style="s2">activity now it has nothing to do so far</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.140" end="00:15:24.930" style="s2">with with hate speech which by the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.440" end="00:15:27.270" style="s2">is protected by the First Amendment yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.930" end="00:15:29.459" style="s2">so or which means in some sense that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.270" end="00:15:34.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist you know as as illegal as</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.459" end="00:15:36.290" style="s2">a legal concept right now this is like</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.610" end="00:15:37.880" style="s2">which is right we shouldn&#39;t go us over</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.290" end="00:15:40.190" style="s2">that fact to because you know Jordan we</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.880" end="00:15:42.200" style="s2">just did however many countries in in</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.190" end="00:15:44.570" style="s2">Europe and we&#39;re gonna go back this</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.200" end="00:15:47.840" style="s2">spring and it&#39;s like everybody that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.570" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">met was jealous of the freedoms that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.840" end="00:15:52.520" style="s2">have in the United States relative to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:54.080" style="s2">speech you know I mean everybody that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.520" end="00:15:55.910" style="s2">would come up to us after the show holy</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.080" end="00:15:57.170" style="s2">cow I wish we could say that and I wish</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.910" end="00:15:59.510" style="s2">we didn&#39;t worry about this or that or</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.170" end="00:16:00.920" style="s2">jokes or the rest of it we did that</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.510" end="00:16:04.340" style="s2">video in Oslo where you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.920" end="00:16:06.380" style="s2">Angela and it&#39;s like they&#39;re jealous of</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.340" end="00:16:09.230" style="s2">our freedom so we should be very clear</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.380" end="00:16:11.780" style="s2">here they though you&#39;re right because we</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.230" end="00:16:15.200" style="s2">now have a payment processor issue which</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.780" end="00:16:17.210" style="s2">is in indirect connection to whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.200" end="00:16:18.920" style="s2">is that we&#39;re trying to build out here</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.210" end="00:16:21.980" style="s2">and we&#39;re still it&#39;s a little Amorphis</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.920" end="00:16:23.420" style="s2">at the moment yeah that it&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.980" end="00:16:25.160" style="s2">because a lot of people are saying all</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.420" end="00:16:27.200" style="s2">right you guys really want to solve this</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.160" end="00:16:30.080" style="s2">then you have to go full critical yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.200" end="00:16:33.110" style="s2">the promo video has to be hosted crypto</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.080" end="00:16:34.730" style="s2">yeah the finances have to be hosted or</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.110" end="00:16:36.500" style="s2">have to be done via crypto yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.730" end="00:16:38.750" style="s2">these things these are these are major</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.500" end="00:16:40.190" style="s2">major things that we&#39;re trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.750" end="00:16:42.200" style="s2">out on every front certain payment</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.190" end="00:16:44.180" style="s2">processors are a little more willing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.200" end="00:16:46.760" style="s2">stand up to the mob than others so have</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.180" end="00:16:48.380" style="s2">different people I mean really going on</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.760" end="00:16:50.390" style="s2">every front hair that&#39;s right well the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.380" end="00:16:52.730" style="s2">tentative platform that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.390" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">build and to build carefully will</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.730" end="00:16:58.430" style="s2">provide the possibility of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:17:01.220" style="s2">payment portals in the hope that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.430" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">creators will be less susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.220" end="00:17:07.850" style="s2">being rapidly shut down or perhaps shut</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:09.740" style="s2">down at all but you know you only a fool</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.850" end="00:17:11.720" style="s2">would say that that problem is going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.740" end="00:17:13.820" style="s2">be definitively solved I have some real</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.720" end="00:17:16.189" style="s2">and increasing sympathy for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.820" end="00:17:18.530" style="s2">cryptocurrency types you know but the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.189" end="00:17:21.040" style="s2">problem there is that as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.530" end="00:17:23.720" style="s2">tell their solution is still</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.040" end="00:17:25.939" style="s2">sufficiently technically complex to keep</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.720" end="00:17:29.990" style="s2">it out of the mainstream use and also</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.939" end="00:17:32.090" style="s2">not sufficiently liquid to actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.990" end="00:17:34.820" style="s2">constitute a realistic current</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.090" end="00:17:35.930" style="s2">replacement even for credit cards right</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.820" end="00:17:38.450" style="s2">so one of the things we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.930" end="00:17:40.220" style="s2">discussing is that it&#39;s almost like we</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.450" end="00:17:42.020" style="s2">have to have several markers down the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.220" end="00:17:44.540" style="s2">road to figure out what the real</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.020" end="00:17:46.500" style="s2">solution is because not everything can</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.540" end="00:17:48.870" style="s2">be solved in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.500" end="00:17:50.970" style="s2">terms of service tomorrow related to</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.870" end="00:17:53.460" style="s2">everyone that exists not everything can</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.970" end="00:17:55.740" style="s2">be solved tomorrow related to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.460" end="00:17:57.809" style="s2">payment processors maybe crypto really</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.740" end="00:18:00.539" style="s2">is the ultimate answer but it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.809" end="00:18:03.390" style="s2">answer tomorrow for everything so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.539" end="00:18:05.549" style="s2">really we&#39;re plotting out a lot here but</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.390" end="00:18:08.370" style="s2">it seems like a fresh and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.549" end="00:18:11.309" style="s2">fitting way to start the year I think so</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.370" end="00:18:13.679" style="s2">and so for January 15th I mean part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.309" end="00:18:15.150" style="s2">the reason that we picked that date as I</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:16.890" style="s2">said before it was because we thought we</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.150" end="00:18:18.600" style="s2">might have something to announce with</p>

<p begin="00:19:33.179" end="00:19:38.280" style="s2">that are creating this mess I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.970" end="00:19:41.640" style="s2">too much to hope for a perfect solution</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.280" end="00:19:43.490" style="s2">to a very complex problem and we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.120" end="00:19:58.620" style="s2">as a step in the right direction however</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.860" end="00:20:00.210" style="s2">imperfectly taken yeah well look I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.620" end="00:20:02.010" style="s2">I said it before but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.210" end="00:20:07.110" style="s2">really think that and maybe this will be</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.010" end="00:20:10.050" style="s2">the defining idea of 2019 is that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.110" end="00:20:12.060" style="s2">think we&#39;re basically at the point where</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.050" end="00:20:14.370" style="s2">people have to decide what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.060" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">internet they want yeah and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.370" end="00:20:18.660" style="s2">only what sort of internet it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:21.360" style="s2">what sort of freedom do you want in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.660" end="00:20:23.550" style="s2">digital world and either or do you want</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:24.900" style="s2">any or do you want any and maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.550" end="00:20:26.340" style="s2">you don&#39;t or you don&#39;t want to think</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.900" end="00:20:28.260" style="s2">about it and you just want to play for</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.340" end="00:20:28.590" style="s2">at night and watch porn and never think</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.260" end="00:20:30.780" style="s2">it through</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.590" end="00:20:33.420" style="s2">but assuming that you&#39;ll be allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.780" end="00:20:36.840" style="s2">watch porn right for that now you really</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.420" end="00:20:40.560" style="s2">are tight or play for that matter right</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.840" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">so the games of violence should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.560" end="00:20:44.460" style="s2">allowed what makes you think that credit</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:47.010" style="s2">card companies should allow you to use</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.460" end="00:20:49.140" style="s2">their there are funds to purchase first</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.010" end="00:20:50.940" style="s2">shoot first-person shooter games for</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.140" end="00:20:53.370" style="s2">example or or any game where anyone is</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.940" end="00:20:54.510" style="s2">killed no no you&#39;re totally right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.370" end="00:20:57.030" style="s2">it I mean that sounds completely</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.510" end="00:20:58.800" style="s2">dystopian and yet it seems like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.030" end="00:21:00.180" style="s2">would just be the next encroachment that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.800" end="00:21:01.590" style="s2">we would see here so the point at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.180" end="00:21:04.590" style="s2">end at the end of this is I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.590" end="00:21:05.820" style="s2">everyone for 2019 since it&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.590" end="00:21:08.370" style="s2">day of a year it&#39;s like you have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.820" end="00:21:10.860" style="s2">think about what type of internet do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.370" end="00:21:13.800" style="s2">want what type of ability to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.860" end="00:21:15.120" style="s2">with other people do you want and if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.800" end="00:21:17.160" style="s2">want something that&#39;s a little better</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.120" end="00:21:19.680" style="s2">than what we&#39;ve got right now we better</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.160" end="00:21:21.660" style="s2">stand up quick because this window we</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.680" end="00:21:23.460" style="s2">know it&#39;s closing slowly but we never</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.660" end="00:21:26.340" style="s2">know when it&#39;s gonna really slap shot</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.460" end="00:21:27.690" style="s2">quick so so we&#39;re working on it and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.340" end="00:21:29.220" style="s2">I think people are ready to stand up</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.690" end="00:21:31.830" style="s2">with us I really do we might also</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.220" end="00:21:33.690" style="s2">suggest to people and this is of course</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.830" end="00:21:36.870" style="s2">up to everyone who&#39;s viewing this to</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.690" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">decide but you know a couple of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.870" end="00:21:43.140" style="s2">thousand letters to MasterCard and</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:46.220" style="s2">PayPal and Visa indicating pronounced</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.630" end="00:21:58.740" style="s2">to public pressure which is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.430" end="00:22:00.360" style="s2">partly why they&#39;re determining to play</p>

<p begin="00:22:02.010" end="00:22:06.870" style="s2">from these let&#39;s call them activists</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.800" end="00:22:22.380" style="s2">understandable it&#39;s understandable but</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.920" end="00:22:28.990" style="s2">but inexcusable it&#39;s uncertain in a</p>

<p begin="00:22:28.990" end="00:22:34.120" style="s2">to begin to push back is to let the</p>

<p begin="00:23:33.850" end="00:23:38.080" style="s2">discussing this every single discussion</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.980" end="00:23:40.090" style="s2">that we&#39;ve had about this</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.080" end="00:23:41.410" style="s2">I don&#39;t think once did we entertain the</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.840" end="00:23:53.770" style="s2">specific legal issues that pop up</p>

<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:24:00.400" style="s2">sort of thing yeah but but the beauty of</p>

<p begin="00:24:00.400" end="00:24:04.810" style="s2">watching my my monthly rev up my company</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.480" end="00:24:13.090" style="s2">I&#39;m incredibly inspired right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.820" end="00:24:15.040" style="s2">because literally thousands of emails</p>

<p begin="00:24:24.030" end="00:24:28.809" style="s2">people are people are afraid and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.530" end="00:24:31.690" style="s2">see this problem and they just want some</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.809" end="00:24:34.210" style="s2">solutions and and maybe there isn&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.690" end="00:24:36.429" style="s2">solution as you said I&#39;ve also been</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.210" end="00:24:38.020" style="s2">talking with you online with a whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.429" end="00:24:40.059" style="s2">bunch of the people who&#39;ve been loosely</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.020" end="00:24:42.220" style="s2">aggregated under the aegis of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.059" end="00:24:44.200" style="s2">intellectual dark web and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.220" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">probably 30 people that that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.200" end="00:24:49.330" style="s2">communicating with with a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:52.510" style="s2">peripheral people and it&#39;s also useful</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.330" end="00:24:54.970" style="s2">to let people know that every one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.510" end="00:24:57.100" style="s2">those people is unbelievably concerned</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.970" end="00:25:00.510" style="s2">about what happened to Carl Benjamin two</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.100" end="00:25:03.669" style="s2">circuits are going and even more so</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.510" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">dumbstruck by the collusion of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.669" end="00:25:09.179" style="s2">payment processing companies and and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:12.059" style="s2">emergence of this activist</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.179" end="00:25:15.100" style="s2">infrastructure online that&#39;s devoted</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.059" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">specifically to the suppression of free</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.100" end="00:25:20.230" style="s2">speech yeah well and also we should also</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:23.650" style="s2">note that within that group of say 30 or</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.230" end="00:25:25.030" style="s2">some odd people we all sort of look we</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.650" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">agree on basic fundamental principles</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.030" end="00:25:28.120" style="s2">related to free speech and things like</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:30.130" style="s2">that but there&#39;s a lot of disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.120" end="00:25:31.780" style="s2">on how to move forward with this I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.130" end="00:25:33.190" style="s2">we&#39;re talking it out respectfully as we</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.780" end="00:25:35.559" style="s2">always do but some people are saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.190" end="00:25:37.299" style="s2">stay and fight on patreon because this</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.559" end="00:25:39.130" style="s2">is how you know they&#39;re small enough say</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.299" end="00:25:41.080" style="s2">that you might get them to change some</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.130" end="00:25:43.240" style="s2">people are saying you gotta go and some</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.080" end="00:25:45.220" style="s2">people are saying some version of you</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.240" end="00:25:47.830" style="s2">know mixing those two and nobody&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.220" end="00:25:50.410" style="s2">about the proper pathway forward yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.830" end="00:25:52.360" style="s2">but that&#39;s again I mean I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.410" end="00:25:54.549" style="s2">what the brilliance of human ingenuity</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.360" end="00:25:56.020" style="s2">is all about it&#39;s like well there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.549" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">gonna be some pitfalls in front of us</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.020" end="00:25:59.470" style="s2">and stain would have its risks and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:01.000" style="s2">leaving would have its risks and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.470" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">all gonna do what we think is why we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.000" end="00:26:05.020" style="s2">already discussed about two writers then</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:09.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s no there&#39;s no no risk</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.020" end="00:26:11.950" style="s2">option here and like and so we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.040" end="00:26:13.480" style="s2">the risk of leaving and then we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.950" end="00:26:15.549" style="s2">make the best of it I mean often when</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.480" end="00:26:17.049" style="s2">you take a risk you often in life all</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.549" end="00:26:19.299" style="s2">you have is a choice between two</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.049" end="00:26:20.770" style="s2">different risks and sometimes neither of</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.299" end="00:26:23.500" style="s2">them are risks you would like to take</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.770" end="00:26:25.480" style="s2">but then in the aftermath of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.500" end="00:26:27.700" style="s2">decision a new field of possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.480" end="00:26:29.260" style="s2">opened up in front of you - and whether</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.700" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">or not you made the right decision is</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.260" end="00:26:34.120" style="s2">actually a consequence of how well you</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:36.730" style="s2">manage the aftermath of the decision so</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.120" end="00:26:37.710" style="s2">we&#39;ll we&#39;ll keep talking over the next</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.730" end="00:26:40.980" style="s2">couple of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.710" end="00:26:43.980" style="s2">like I&#39;ve got good people working on</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.980" end="00:26:47.900" style="s2">this alternative you know which which</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.980" end="00:26:51.840" style="s2">was as I mentioned in other places</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.900" end="00:26:54.210" style="s2">started seven months ago or so and good</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.840" end="00:26:56.370" style="s2">people supervising it whether it&#39;ll turn</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.210" end="00:26:57.390" style="s2">out to be a viable product and whether</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.370" end="00:26:59.700" style="s2">or not we can figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.390" end="00:27:01.560" style="s2">implement it in a sustainable way that</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.700" end="00:27:03.780" style="s2">actually addresses these issues in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.560" end="00:27:06.600" style="s2">reasonable manner remains to be seen</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.780" end="00:27:08.460" style="s2">yeah hey on a personal note just because</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.600" end="00:27:10.200" style="s2">you know I got to see you a couple days</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.460" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">before Christmas in West Palm Beach and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.200" end="00:27:13.890" style="s2">and we had dinner with with your family</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:15.540" style="s2">and your kids and everything hasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.890" end="00:27:17.220" style="s2">sort of been nice because I I did a week</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.540" end="00:27:19.230" style="s2">with with my brother and sister and</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.220" end="00:27:22.230" style="s2">nieces and nephews over Christmas also</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.230" end="00:27:24.450" style="s2">sort of circling back to family on some</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.230" end="00:27:26.340" style="s2">of this it&#39;s given me a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.450" end="00:27:27.900" style="s2">perspective you know it is mean because</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.340" end="00:27:29.100" style="s2">I&#39;m getting I&#39;m getting reached out by</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.900" end="00:27:31.020" style="s2">so many different people on all</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.100" end="00:27:32.670" style="s2">different fronts but then to have sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.020" end="00:27:34.620" style="s2">of a close-knit group of people that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.670" end="00:27:37.110" style="s2">really do have your interests in mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.620" end="00:27:38.730" style="s2">and all those things you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.110" end="00:27:41.220" style="s2">family with your kids at dinner it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.730" end="00:27:43.590" style="s2">like oh these are good people too</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.220" end="00:27:45.750" style="s2">well there&#39;s unanimity on the part of</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.590" end="00:27:48.740" style="s2">the people around me that the proper</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.750" end="00:27:50.970" style="s2">thing to do is well twofold one is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.740" end="00:27:52.590" style="s2">separate myself from patreon in</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.970" end="00:27:55.740" style="s2">accordance with our discussions and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.590" end="00:27:59.880" style="s2">second is to proceed with exceeding</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.740" end="00:28:02.550" style="s2">caution and non over promise or try to</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.880" end="00:28:05.730" style="s2">deliver too quickly a solution although</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.550" end="00:28:07.590" style="s2">to work on that carefully so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.730" end="00:28:10.170" style="s2">we&#39;ve decided to do yeah so let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.590" end="00:28:12.210" style="s2">be crystal clear on that latter part we</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.170" end="00:28:14.070" style="s2">are working on this we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.210" end="00:28:16.290" style="s2">deliberate we&#39;re gonna be cautious we</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.070" end="00:28:18.300" style="s2">understand that it can&#39;t be solved</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.290" end="00:28:20.250" style="s2">tomorrow we understand that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.300" end="00:28:22.200" style="s2">financial part a free-speech part and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.250" end="00:28:23.460" style="s2">everything else and we&#39;re just gonna lay</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.200" end="00:28:24.510" style="s2">these things out in front of us and</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.460" end="00:28:25.770" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna keep working through them</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.510" end="00:28:28.890" style="s2">with a lot of the people that you guys</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.770" end="00:28:30.900" style="s2">know and trust yeah and and and with</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.890" end="00:28:32.610" style="s2">with some other people and hearing from</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.900" end="00:28:33.990" style="s2">random people that have given us ideas I</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.610" end="00:28:35.250" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve been forward and you emails</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.990" end="00:28:37.230" style="s2">left and right where people are like you</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.250" end="00:28:38.970" style="s2">know this might be the the pressure</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.230" end="00:28:41.970" style="s2">point you might want to go after so</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.970" end="00:28:45.090" style="s2">we&#39;re just gonna keep going yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.970" end="00:28:47.280" style="s2">okay well I got a couple of things to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.090" end="00:28:48.600" style="s2">end this I guess let&#39;s summarize and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.280" end="00:28:51.169" style="s2">then I&#39;ve got a couple of things just to</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.600" end="00:28:54.600" style="s2">let people know about sure</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.169" end="00:28:56.760" style="s2">ah well the first is so we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.600" end="00:28:58.549" style="s2">leaving on January 15th and the second</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.760" end="00:29:01.169" style="s2">is we&#39;re working on this platform and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.549" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">the third is a warning to people to keep</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.169" end="00:29:03.990" style="s2">a close eye on what the credit card</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:06.380" style="s2">companies are up to because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.990" end="00:29:08.970" style="s2">really bad thing in my estimation I</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.380" end="00:29:10.980" style="s2">guess that&#39;s probably it on my front I</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.970" end="00:29:13.440" style="s2">have a talk coming up in Zurich I have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.980" end="00:29:16.200" style="s2">couple of talks in California in January</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.250" end="00:29:29.700" style="s2">partners as a New Year&#39;s token let&#39;s say</p>
