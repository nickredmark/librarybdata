<p begin="00:00:03.929" end="00:00:07.919" style="s2">i wanted to show that i&#39;m actually got</p>

<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:27.960" style="s2">just wanted to show that the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.890" end="00:00:29.760" style="s2">benevolent goddess isn&#39;t limited to a</p>

<p begin="00:00:34.500" end="00:00:39.690" style="s2">she&#39;s like them though the nourishing</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.750" end="00:00:41.610" style="s2">element of of being that&#39;s the best way</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.690" end="00:00:43.739" style="s2">to think about it and the nourishing</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.610" end="00:00:45.870" style="s2">element of being emerges in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.739" end="00:00:48.329" style="s2">fashion so that&#39;s the differentiation of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.870" end="00:00:50.730" style="s2">the archetype so way at the back there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.329" end="00:00:51.899" style="s2">the predatory serpent chaos that lurks</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.730" end="00:00:53.579" style="s2">in the background and then that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.899" end="00:00:54.930" style="s2">fragments out is one more</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.579" end="00:00:56.969" style="s2">differentiating swap out in one</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.930" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">direction into the feminine you know in</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.969" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">the feminine this is a tough one because</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:09.540" style="s2">there&#39;s this weird interaction here with</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:12.409" style="s2">with gender and archetype you know so so</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.540" end="00:01:12.409" style="s2">here&#39;s other thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.040" end="00:01:17.810" style="s2">and I&#39;m floundering the both on this</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.040" end="00:01:22.430" style="s2">because I have for a long time because</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.810" end="00:01:24.140" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult which gender of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.430" end="00:01:28.880" style="s2">person are you most likely to see on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.140" end="00:01:30.500" style="s2">cover of men&#39;s magazine a woman what</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.880" end="00:01:38.050" style="s2">generally most likely see on the cover</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.500" end="00:01:38.050" style="s2">of women&#39;s magazine okay why why is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.180" end="00:01:49.310" style="s2">yes that&#39;s right I think that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.670" end="00:01:51.229" style="s2">think that&#39;s why and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.310" end="00:01:53.330" style="s2">they&#39;re both possessed by the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.229" end="00:01:56.060" style="s2">archetype in a different way and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.330" end="00:01:58.370" style="s2">archetype is the archetypal feminine</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.060" end="00:02:01.130" style="s2">fundamentally and for women the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.370" end="00:02:04.190" style="s2">archetypal feminine is a judge and an</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.130" end="00:02:06.740" style="s2">ideal the judges will how far do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.190" end="00:02:09.229" style="s2">deviate from that the ideal is to what</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.740" end="00:02:10.940" style="s2">degree can you emulate and then for men</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.229" end="00:02:13.459" style="s2">it&#39;s the same damn thing the judge</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.940" end="00:02:14.810" style="s2">elements exactly the same thing and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.459" end="00:02:16.130" style="s2">possession element well it&#39;s slightly</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.810" end="00:02:18.830" style="s2">different but it&#39;s not that different</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.130" end="00:02:21.320" style="s2">you know so but it&#39;s a strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.830" end="00:02:24.620" style="s2">because the visual image general digital</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.320" end="00:02:26.780" style="s2">image is that of the feminine so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.620" end="00:02:28.700" style="s2">strange because I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.780" end="00:02:30.590" style="s2">archetypal structures work the same and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.700" end="00:02:33.170" style="s2">women and so are people the way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.590" end="00:02:35.989" style="s2">trying to figure this out is like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.170" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">Sun the hero is the Sun like the male</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.989" end="00:02:41.480" style="s2">not the shiny Sun no it&#39;s also that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:42.920" style="s2">like but women obviously have an element</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.480" end="00:02:45.830" style="s2">of them that can be heroic and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.920" end="00:02:47.690" style="s2">adversarial just like men but then in</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.830" end="00:02:49.880" style="s2">women that&#39;s complicated because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.690" end="00:02:52.670" style="s2">other primary element of their being is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.880" end="00:02:54.680" style="s2">the maternal feminine element and so but</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.670" end="00:02:57.230" style="s2">that&#39;s complicated because women or men</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.680" end="00:02:59.980" style="s2">can also be quite maternal like for</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.230" end="00:03:02.840" style="s2">Mallos predatory mammals manner</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.980" end="00:03:04.970" style="s2">unbelievably nurturing and feminine you</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.840" end="00:03:07.280" style="s2">know risen bears we just eat our own</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.970" end="00:03:09.260" style="s2">cows you know so mannered</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:10.670" style="s2">they&#39;re quite feminine as well as being</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.260" end="00:03:12.560" style="s2">masculine so I kind of think of it this</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.670" end="00:03:13.470" style="s2">way it&#39;s like if you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.560" end="00:03:16.500" style="s2">what your are</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.470" end="00:03:19.590" style="s2">personality structure is is for men the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.500" end="00:03:21.570" style="s2">hero is at the forefront and the mother</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.590" end="00:03:24.150" style="s2">the feminine mother is sort of behind</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.570" end="00:03:26.040" style="s2">that and for women it&#39;s reversed the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.150" end="00:03:27.870" style="s2">feminine mother is sort of forefront and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.040" end="00:03:33.480" style="s2">the heroes behind them but both of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.870" end="00:03:34.830" style="s2">archetypes are are are operative so so</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.480" end="00:03:39.450" style="s2">you can think about that you can see</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.830" end="00:03:40.590" style="s2">what you see what you make of it but you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.450" end="00:03:42.630" style="s2">know because you might say well why</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.590" end="00:03:45.300" style="s2">would women is it reasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.630" end="00:03:47.520" style="s2">presuppose but for women the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.300" end="00:03:49.830" style="s2">represents the unknown just like he does</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.520" end="00:03:52.530" style="s2">for men and I don&#39;t think it is just</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.830" end="00:03:54.930" style="s2">like it is for men because I think for</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.530" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2">women there&#39;s an element of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.930" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">patriarchal structure that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.670" end="00:04:01.260" style="s2">unknown than it is for men you know and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:03.060" style="s2">I think you see the reaction to that in</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.260" end="00:04:05.430" style="s2">part you see the raptures of that in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.060" end="00:04:07.170" style="s2">feminist movement because the patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.430" end="00:04:10.070" style="s2">is like the tyrannical father you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.170" end="00:04:13.110" style="s2">and the patriarchy exists but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.070" end="00:04:14.700" style="s2">the tyrannical father is not the entire</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.110" end="00:04:17.609" style="s2">substrate of culture it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.700" end="00:04:20.250" style="s2">ridiculous but I think because women are</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.609" end="00:04:26.610" style="s2">you know in some sense they&#39;re outsiders</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.250" end="00:04:28.650" style="s2">to the male dominance hierarchy that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.610" end="00:04:30.300" style="s2">male dominance art is more contaminated</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.650" end="00:04:32.010" style="s2">by the unknown for women than it is for</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.300" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">men and I think it&#39;s more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.010" end="00:04:36.810" style="s2">interpreted as the tyrannical father</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:38.700" style="s2">because of that so anyways I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.810" end="00:04:41.550" style="s2">exactly sort it out because you end up</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.700" end="00:04:44.040" style="s2">with nested problems you know so insofar</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.550" end="00:04:45.720" style="s2">as your primary mode of being as</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.040" end="00:04:47.700" style="s2">feminine than your secondary mode of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.720" end="00:04:49.140" style="s2">being is masculine you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.700" end="00:04:50.729" style="s2">all the characteristics of something</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.140" end="00:04:52.770" style="s2">masculine and all the characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.729" end="00:04:54.390" style="s2">something feminine but the manner in</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.770" end="00:04:55.770" style="s2">which they manifest themselves is going</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.390" end="00:04:58.650" style="s2">to be different and I just can&#39;t sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.770" end="00:05:01.290" style="s2">that out to em clunky plus I think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.650" end="00:05:03.300" style="s2">that is what we&#39;re sorting out right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.290" end="00:05:05.220" style="s2">in our culture you know ever since women</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.300" end="00:05:06.990" style="s2">got the ability to control the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.220" end="00:05:09.390" style="s2">reproductive function which was probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.990" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">at least in part a consequence of an a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.390" end="00:05:13.590" style="s2">priori psychological transformation</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:15.660" style="s2">because you could say well the pill</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.590" end="00:05:17.400" style="s2">freed women but then you could say well</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.660" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">what was the precondition for creating a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.400" end="00:05:22.200" style="s2">society in which the person who invented</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:23.950" style="s2">the pill didn&#39;t get killed you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.200" end="00:05:26.050" style="s2">because the Catholic Church for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.950" end="00:05:28.570" style="s2">how people build was invented seriously</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.050" end="00:05:31.000" style="s2">not happy and no wonder you know so</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.570" end="00:05:33.580" style="s2">obviously there had to be some shifting</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.000" end="00:05:35.770" style="s2">in the underlying conceptual landscape</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.580" end="00:05:37.690" style="s2">in relationship to the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.770" end="00:05:39.910" style="s2">between men and women for that invention</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.690" end="00:05:41.740" style="s2">to even have come about you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.910" end="00:05:44.170" style="s2">think you can really see that starting</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.740" end="00:05:46.660" style="s2">know if you read the classic Russian</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.170" end="00:05:48.460" style="s2">novels you can see that the push towards</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.660" end="00:05:50.830" style="s2">equality that characterized women was</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.460" end="00:05:53.170" style="s2">really alive and well in 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.830" end="00:05:55.090" style="s2">Russian among the aristocrats Caucasus</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.170" end="00:06:03.940" style="s2">so you know like it has a pretty lengthy</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.090" end="00:06:06.280" style="s2">history the waning you mean that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.940" end="00:06:08.680" style="s2">widening widening of personality</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.280" end="00:06:15.940" style="s2">differences so five differences they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.680" end="00:06:18.430" style="s2">wider I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.940" end="00:06:20.410" style="s2">answer that exactly so the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.430" end="00:06:21.910" style="s2">if you look at personality differences</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.410" end="00:06:23.890" style="s2">between men and women in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.910" end="00:06:25.660" style="s2">world the most egalitarian cultures have</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.890" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">the biggest personality differences the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.660" end="00:06:29.560" style="s2">gender differences and so the technical</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:31.630" style="s2">reason for that is all the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.560" end="00:06:33.280" style="s2">variability has been eliminated that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.630" end="00:06:36.190" style="s2">all that&#39;s left is genetic variability</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:37.750" style="s2">and there&#39;s and that&#39;s not masks in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.190" end="00:06:40.390" style="s2">sense by the environmental variability</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.750" end="00:06:42.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s powerful and profound but it</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.390" end="00:06:45.040" style="s2">definitely shows that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.040" end="00:06:47.710" style="s2">powerful genetic variability</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.040" end="00:06:50.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a powerful evidence for that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.710" end="00:06:52.860" style="s2">know but it also could be you know it</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.740" end="00:06:55.420" style="s2">could easily be that in this society</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.860" end="00:06:58.900" style="s2">what you&#39;re aiming for in an egalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.420" end="00:07:01.330" style="s2">society is the right for everyone to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.900" end="00:07:03.760" style="s2">different in their own way whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.330" end="00:07:05.350" style="s2">happens to be you know and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.760" end="00:07:08.110" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be a limited right to</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.350" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">some degree so an egalitarian society</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.110" end="00:07:11.080" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t necessarily eradicate</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:13.210" style="s2">personality differences that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.080" end="00:07:16.360" style="s2">bloody totalitarian societies like get</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.210" end="00:07:18.580" style="s2">rid of all the differences to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.360" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">that you&#39;re a female and whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.580" end="00:07:22.840" style="s2">hell that means fundamentally and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:27.840" style="s2">male if we have to be the same then</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.840" end="00:07:30.340" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be a function of intense</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:32.180" style="s2">control on the part of the state you</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.340" end="00:07:33.590" style="s2">know to degree that that&#39;s intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.180" end="00:07:35.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what how much of its</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.590" end="00:08:22.630" style="s2">intrinsic I would be very hesitant to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.480" end="00:08:25.010" style="s2">say not I mean but it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.630" end="00:08:27.200" style="s2">prerequisite for long-term relationships</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.010" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">between men and women right if we work a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.200" end="00:08:32.210" style="s2">lot the same or at least capable of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:34.010" style="s2">being the same then we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.210" end="00:08:36.530" style="s2">understand each other at all I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.010" end="00:08:38.270" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we do what we do we do</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.530" end="00:08:41.300" style="s2">more than other creatures of our</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.270" end="00:08:43.490" style="s2">complexity that&#39;s for sure so yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.300" end="00:08:46.100" style="s2">you know it&#39;s certainly the case that if</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.490" end="00:08:47.660" style="s2">you look at a given individual and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.100" end="00:08:50.210" style="s2">look at the variability of their</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.660" end="00:08:53.180" style="s2">personnel feelings behaviors the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.210" end="00:08:55.070" style="s2">variability within a person is generally</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.180" end="00:08:57.530" style="s2">greater than the average variability</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.070" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">within a population so you know human</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.530" end="00:09:01.910" style="s2">beings if you&#39;re an extrovert you can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:04.580" style="s2">extremely introverted like there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.910" end="00:09:07.370" style="s2">very many extroverts at a funeral know</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.580" end="00:09:09.170" style="s2">the noisiest people at a funeral will be</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.370" end="00:09:11.180" style="s2">the extroverts but they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.170" end="00:09:12.950" style="s2">hardly noisy at all you know and an</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.180" end="00:09:15.110" style="s2">introvert can party themselves in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.950" end="00:09:16.340" style="s2">situation where they can&#39;t shut up you</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.110" end="00:09:18.530" style="s2">know so there&#39;s a lot of entry</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.340" end="00:09:21.650" style="s2">individual variability I actually think</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.530" end="00:09:24.740" style="s2">that one of the indexes of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.650" end="00:09:26.600" style="s2">health is the maximization of individual</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.740" end="00:09:28.850" style="s2">variability because you should be able</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.600" end="00:09:30.200" style="s2">to be extremely compassionate for</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.850" end="00:09:32.600" style="s2">example when you&#39;re dealing with a sick</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.200" end="00:09:33.939" style="s2">baby you know and extremely</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.600" end="00:09:35.470" style="s2">uncompassionate when</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.939" end="00:09:38.049" style="s2">dealing with someone who&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.470" end="00:09:40.209" style="s2">using their illness as an excuse not to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.049" end="00:09:42.279" style="s2">pull their own weight but you need both</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.209" end="00:09:44.139" style="s2">of those right and you know you&#39;ll end</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.279" end="00:09:46.089" style="s2">up with an average point as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.139" end="00:09:48.189" style="s2">consequence of your genetic structure</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.089" end="00:09:49.899" style="s2">and maybe your your socialization and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.189" end="00:09:52.119" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of up to you that widen</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.899" end="00:09:53.949" style="s2">yourself out across the full spectrum so</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.119" end="00:09:56.559" style="s2">that you can call on those abilities</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.949" end="00:09:58.269" style="s2">when it&#39;s necessary I think that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.559" end="00:10:00.429" style="s2">of what differentiation as a person</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.269" end="00:10:03.189" style="s2">actually means you know because you you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.429" end="00:10:05.709" style="s2">come to be able to do more things and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.189" end="00:10:07.599" style="s2">you can match yourself much more</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.709" end="00:10:12.849" style="s2">carefully to the immediate demands of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.599" end="00:10:20.339" style="s2">the situation so yeah we have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.849" end="00:10:24.699" style="s2">questions okay so the the symbol for for</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.339" end="00:10:26.109" style="s2">anomaly the feminine differentiates into</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.699" end="00:10:27.639" style="s2">the negative feminine and the positive</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.109" end="00:10:29.079" style="s2">feminine part of the issue is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.639" end="00:10:30.879" style="s2">get more of the positives and keep the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.079" end="00:10:32.529" style="s2">negative that thing and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.879" end="00:10:34.239" style="s2">that&#39;s a question that people have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.529" end="00:10:36.189" style="s2">ask themselves at the person of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.239" end="00:10:38.470" style="s2">individual at the level of individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.189" end="00:10:40.839" style="s2">interaction with other people and with</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.470" end="00:10:43.779" style="s2">themselves but then it also works as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.839" end="00:10:46.029" style="s2">representation of the unknown and nature</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.779" end="00:10:48.159" style="s2">as such it&#39;s because in some ways those</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.029" end="00:10:54.369" style="s2">are the same thing so that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.159" end="00:10:56.049" style="s2">that&#39;s a differentiation so so this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.369" end="00:10:57.699" style="s2">the relationship between the hero</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.049" end="00:10:59.349" style="s2">archetype and the feminine so what you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.699" end="00:11:01.239" style="s2">have here is the chaos dragon</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.349" end="00:11:03.129" style="s2">differentiating itself into the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.239" end="00:11:05.049" style="s2">which is half positive and half negative</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.129" end="00:11:06.909" style="s2">and the feminine they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.049" end="00:11:09.279" style="s2">manifested in the form of that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.909" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">Virgin Mary with Christ on her lap it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.279" end="00:11:12.939" style="s2">a using you saw the same representation</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:14.829" style="s2">we were looking at Isis and Horus and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.939" end="00:11:17.039" style="s2">what&#39;s really quite cool about that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.829" end="00:11:22.319" style="s2">you see she&#39;s surrounded by this this</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.039" end="00:11:25.539" style="s2">mandala this this you know almond shaped</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.319" end="00:11:26.979" style="s2">opening fundamentally and you see this</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.539" end="00:11:29.199" style="s2">is something that Renaissance artists</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.979" end="00:11:29.850" style="s2">did a lot you see along the edges of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.199" end="00:11:31.139" style="s2">mat door</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.850" end="00:11:33.089" style="s2">so these little baby heads that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.139" end="00:11:34.920" style="s2">popping up with wings on them and those</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.089" end="00:11:36.779" style="s2">are called poutine you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.920" end="00:11:39.720" style="s2">common that when you see representations</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.779" end="00:11:41.910" style="s2">of married with-with-with like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.720" end="00:11:43.199" style="s2">cosmos sort of billowing out behind her</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.910" end="00:11:45.360" style="s2">because that&#39;s what you see it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.199" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">hole into time and space that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.360" end="00:11:48.509" style="s2">all these potential beings that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:51.540" style="s2">surrounding her you know it&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.509" end="00:11:53.759" style="s2">little baby heads with wings what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.540" end="00:11:55.920" style="s2">hell are they well what is this thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.759" end="00:11:58.110" style="s2">you know it&#39;s so straight right I went</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.920" end="00:12:00.120" style="s2">to a museum in New York were a number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.110" end="00:12:02.279" style="s2">Renaissance paintings of this type work</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.120" end="00:12:03.930" style="s2">were arrayed in this one room that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.279" end="00:12:05.910" style="s2">like a room with affiliate dollars</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.930" end="00:12:07.290" style="s2">almost amazing room and there were</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.910" end="00:12:08.579" style="s2">people all from all over the world and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.290" end="00:12:11.279" style="s2">they&#39;re looking at these damn paintings</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.579" end="00:12:13.649" style="s2">they see you know this it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.279" end="00:12:15.240" style="s2">Mary and she&#39;s sitting on the moon and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.649" end="00:12:18.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of like winged baby</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.240" end="00:12:23.490" style="s2">heads around her and everybody&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.750" end="00:12:25.639" style="s2">at this cap them on the shoulder and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.490" end="00:12:28.050" style="s2">say why did you travel from Lane</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.639" end="00:12:31.920" style="s2">Cincinnati to come to this museum to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.050" end="00:12:33.990" style="s2">look at what this woman do we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.920" end="00:12:37.079" style="s2">believe in sitting on the crescent moon</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.990" end="00:12:38.730" style="s2">surrounded by a baby heads I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.079" end="00:12:41.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve no idea why they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.730" end="00:12:43.620" style="s2">they&#39;re fascinated by the painting</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.420" end="00:12:46.110" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna conjure up some reasons</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.620" end="00:12:47.759" style="s2">with you know you don&#39;t even notice how</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.110" end="00:12:49.110" style="s2">absurd it is till you take the picture a</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.759" end="00:12:50.939" style="s2">part of it what the hell are these</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.110" end="00:12:53.399" style="s2">things these poutine you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.939" end="00:12:55.649" style="s2">what they are our potential beings</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.399" end="00:12:59.639" style="s2">that&#39;s the representation so Mary</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.649" end="00:13:02.040" style="s2">represents the the feminine domain from</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.639" end="00:13:03.269" style="s2">which potential being emerges which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.040" end="00:13:05.579" style="s2">perfectly reasonable way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.269" end="00:13:07.620" style="s2">characterizing a feminine archetypes you</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.579" end="00:13:09.720" style="s2">know what are the pictures I will show</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.620" end="00:13:11.370" style="s2">you which I just love is married it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.759" end="00:13:38.170" style="s2">course it&#39;s the archetype because that</p>

<p begin="00:13:51.850" end="00:13:55.870" style="s2">could it not be you might say well I</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.680" end="00:13:57.970" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in that was like hell does</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.870" end="00:14:00.580" style="s2">that mean you don&#39;t believe in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.970" end="00:14:02.790" style="s2">no I I didn&#39;t even understand what that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.580" end="00:14:02.790" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.280" end="00:14:14.050" style="s2">you know is that the mother of God and</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.130" end="00:14:16.390" style="s2">what you mean you know what depends on</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.390" end="00:14:20.320" style="s2">child and believe me once you have that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.030" end="00:14:22.390" style="s2">child you&#39;re gonna think hey there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.320" end="00:14:24.070" style="s2">pretty big chunk of divinity embodied in</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.390" end="00:14:25.570" style="s2">that child no one will snakes gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.070" end="00:14:28.060" style="s2">back I&#39;m gonna keep it away from</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.770" end="00:14:42.640" style="s2">gonna say that&#39;s wrong because I</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.390" end="00:14:44.560" style="s2">actually think it&#39;s right I think the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.640" end="00:14:46.780" style="s2">child is a container of the divine and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.560" end="00:14:48.850" style="s2">that your job as a mother is to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.780" end="00:14:51.190" style="s2">that child to facilitate the development</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.850" end="00:14:53.860" style="s2">of that child into the mythological hero</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.190" end="00:14:55.810" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re up to and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.860" end="00:14:57.730" style="s2">holy mission insofar as you could use</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.810" end="00:15:00.070" style="s2">that word to describe anything and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.730" end="00:15:03.580" style="s2">failed to see how that is not real I</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.070" end="00:15:05.050" style="s2">think it&#39;s the most real thing so but I</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.580" end="00:15:06.370" style="s2">also think the degree to which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.050" end="00:15:08.740" style="s2">going to be able to do that as a mother</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.370" end="00:15:10.990" style="s2">it will be the most rewarding thing you</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.740" end="00:15:14.200" style="s2">ever do in your life and you&#39;ll figure</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.990" end="00:15:16.810" style="s2">that out it&#39;s a powerful thing and your</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.200" end="00:15:18.580" style="s2">whole life can change us completely once</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.810" end="00:15:20.560" style="s2">you have your own child it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.580" end="00:15:23.110" style="s2">they&#39;re not like other children they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.560" end="00:15:24.490" style="s2">your old child it&#39;s like they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.110" end="00:15:27.490" style="s2">most important thing in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.490" end="00:15:29.820" style="s2">then and from then on if you&#39;re healthy</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.490" end="00:15:31.860" style="s2">it&#39;s like your priority shift it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.820" end="00:15:33.690" style="s2">you anymore and that&#39;s a sacrifice you</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.860" end="00:15:35.160" style="s2">know it&#39;s a real sacrifice it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.690" end="00:15:42.090" style="s2">sacrifice that women are called on to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.160" end="00:15:43.620" style="s2">make it&#39;s a major sacrifice okay so then</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.090" end="00:15:45.180" style="s2">you know the mother gives birth to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.620" end="00:15:46.770" style="s2">hero okay that&#39;s Hercules it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.180" end="00:15:49.290" style="s2">Christ it&#39;s Hercules in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.770" end="00:15:51.330" style="s2">representation and she&#39;s I love this</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.290" end="00:15:53.310" style="s2">representation it&#39;s so cool</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.330" end="00:15:56.310" style="s2">so Hercules he&#39;s out there in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.310" end="00:15:58.440" style="s2">darkness on the water so it&#39;s the watery</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.310" end="00:16:00.840" style="s2">chaos so that&#39;s where he&#39;s situated</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.440" end="00:16:02.730" style="s2">himself voluntarily and he is in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.840" end="00:16:04.350" style="s2">container now it&#39;s a good thing you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.730" end="00:16:06.450" style="s2">think about that as a maternal container</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.350" end="00:16:08.730" style="s2">or you can think about it as cultural</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.450" end="00:16:11.370" style="s2">protection doesn&#39;t really matter and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.730" end="00:16:13.050" style="s2">then he&#39;s got this Club and if you look</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.370" end="00:16:15.270" style="s2">on the club it&#39;s got these weird bombs</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.050" end="00:16:16.890" style="s2">but if you look at the bumps what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.270" end="00:16:21.000" style="s2">understand is those aren&#39;t bumps those</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.890" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">are eyes so he&#39;s just like murder he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.000" end="00:16:25.380" style="s2">got this club then what&#39;s the club it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:26.490" style="s2">like attention that&#39;s it you know what</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.380" end="00:16:28.590" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna club something you make</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.490" end="00:16:30.960" style="s2">multi-speed a attention to it maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.590" end="00:16:33.150" style="s2">like a rampaging lion and you turn away</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.960" end="00:16:35.820" style="s2">from it well it&#39;s gonna eat you so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.150" end="00:16:38.370" style="s2">clubs useless without the attention but</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.820" end="00:16:41.250" style="s2">you know the picture says a club which</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.370" end="00:16:44.010" style="s2">is a weapon a weapon is a meta is a form</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.250" end="00:16:47.880" style="s2">of meta attention story I thought every</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.010" end="00:16:50.730" style="s2">person attention is a meta weapon it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.880" end="00:16:52.260" style="s2">the ultimate weapon against unknown and</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.730" end="00:16:53.970" style="s2">so there&#39;s Hercules he&#39;s got his eyes</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.260" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">wide open he&#39;s peering out into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.970" end="00:16:58.740" style="s2">darkness he&#39;s got this lion head on and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:00.570" style="s2">that&#39;s because he killed the lion you</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.740" end="00:17:02.640" style="s2">know men used to do that know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.570" end="00:17:05.189" style="s2">neighbors Shepherds out in the desert</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.640" end="00:17:05.430" style="s2">and in the Middle East one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.189" end="00:17:07.680" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.430" end="00:17:12.060" style="s2">to do was kill a lion with a spear it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.680" end="00:17:14.550" style="s2">like that&#39;s really worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.060" end="00:17:16.050" style="s2">man that&#39;s hard to do that that would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.550" end="00:17:18.750" style="s2">very hard to be very frightening to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.050" end="00:17:20.280" style="s2">that and so but men used to do that so</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.750" end="00:17:23.130" style="s2">that&#39;s really something to think about</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.280" end="00:17:25.200" style="s2">anyway so he&#39;s got this lion suit on and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.130" end="00:17:27.030" style="s2">a lion is king of the beasts roughly</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.200" end="00:17:28.680" style="s2">speaking so it represents the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.030" end="00:17:30.270" style="s2">set the talk with the doorman in Turkey</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.680" end="00:17:31.830" style="s2">you all know that because otherwise he</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.270" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">could have understood the Lion King and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.830" end="00:17:36.150" style="s2">the lion is a solar beast because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:37.950" style="s2">yellow but it weren&#39;t so you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.150" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">daylight creature it&#39;s out there of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.950" end="00:17:42.270" style="s2">felt where everything&#39;s sunny so its</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:46.130" style="s2">associated with the Sun and illumination</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.270" end="00:17:50.250" style="s2">and enlightenment so it&#39;s like lions sun</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.130" end="00:17:51.870" style="s2">sun with eyes goes out to conquer the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.250" end="00:17:54.000" style="s2">unknown that&#39;s what the mother does if</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.870" end="00:17:55.710" style="s2">she raises the proper Sun right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.000" end="00:17:57.480" style="s2">she&#39;s also doing that for the daughter</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.710" end="00:17:59.580" style="s2">but again that&#39;s complicated because</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.480" end="00:18:02.730" style="s2">women are complicated and then their</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.580" end="00:18:04.230" style="s2">role is very very complex and so to some</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.730" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">degree they&#39;re the hero but to some</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.230" end="00:18:12.980" style="s2">degree they&#39;re the mother of the hero</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:12.980" style="s2">and those are I would say I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:21.210" style="s2">it you could say</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.940" end="00:18:31.009" style="s2">you could say that in some sense a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.730" end="00:18:35.059" style="s2">conscious mother gives up her own</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.009" end="00:18:38.029" style="s2">individual heroism as a sacrifice to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.059" end="00:18:39.620" style="s2">potential heroism of her children you</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.029" end="00:18:42.289" style="s2">know and that&#39;s worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.620" end="00:18:44.330" style="s2">because my guess is that for most of you</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.289" end="00:18:45.980" style="s2">your mother did that you know now you</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.330" end="00:18:47.779" style="s2">want to you know we have my wife had a</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.980" end="00:18:49.340" style="s2">dream once about putting on her</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.779" end="00:18:50.570" style="s2">great-grandmother&#39;s shoes her</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.340" end="00:18:52.250" style="s2">grandmother she she really liked her</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.570" end="00:18:54.440" style="s2">grandmother a very feminine person and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.250" end="00:18:56.419" style="s2">only you know cookie making apple pie</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.440" end="00:18:58.970" style="s2">baking piano playing</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.419" end="00:19:01.370" style="s2">grandmother she had him down preparing</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.970" end="00:19:03.320" style="s2">love people in the old folks home even</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.370" end="00:19:05.509" style="s2">when she was 18 she was really cheerful</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.320" end="00:19:07.730" style="s2">and tough but she is a great person I</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.509" end="00:19:09.320" style="s2">really liked her but when my wife Jane</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.730" end="00:19:12.379" style="s2">Diversey dreamt she was trying on her</p>
