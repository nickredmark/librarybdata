<p begin="00:00:38.720" end="00:00:42.170" style="s2">this conversation yeah I followed your</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.160" end="00:00:44.270" style="s2">work for some time and while I keep my</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.170" end="00:00:46.070" style="s2">eye on several thinkers who are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.270" end="00:00:48.110" style="s2">about the future of our society your</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.070" end="00:00:51.020" style="s2">perspective is perhaps both the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.110" end="00:00:53.540" style="s2">dire and the most hopeful interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.020" end="00:00:56.390" style="s2">that you can be both yeah I call that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.540" end="00:00:57.740" style="s2">kind of a hard fork hypothesis I like</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.390" end="00:00:59.270" style="s2">that it&#39;s a good way to describe it you</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.740" end="00:01:01.460" style="s2">know on the dire side you know you say</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.270" end="00:01:04.070" style="s2">pretty explicitly you believe Humanity</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.460" end="00:01:06.170" style="s2">is going to end relatively soon we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.070" end="00:01:08.450" style="s2">address some of our fundamental design</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.170" end="00:01:12.020" style="s2">issues in our social operating system</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.450" end="00:01:13.520" style="s2">yeah I basically say that when we look</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.020" end="00:01:15.560" style="s2">at history we see that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.520" end="00:01:18.670" style="s2">previous civilizations obviously they</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.560" end="00:01:21.890" style="s2">don&#39;t still exist and they underwent</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.670" end="00:01:24.620" style="s2">internal decay that led to how their</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.890" end="00:01:26.240" style="s2">collapse occurred and we can look at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.620" end="00:01:28.190" style="s2">way that Tainter studies this oh the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.240" end="00:01:29.930" style="s2">Jared Diamond did or the way that kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.190" end="00:01:31.370" style="s2">of Straus how or Baudrillard or</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.930" end="00:01:32.960" style="s2">different models of civilization will</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.370" end="00:01:34.729" style="s2">collapse describe it but they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:36.740" style="s2">like people have a life cycle there seem</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.729" end="00:01:38.510" style="s2">to be these life cycles of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.740" end="00:01:40.580" style="s2">and there are certain things in common</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.510" end="00:01:42.680" style="s2">that lead to their breakdown the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.580" end="00:01:45.260" style="s2">difference now is that we have a fully</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.680" end="00:01:47.180" style="s2">globalized civilization and rather than</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.260" end="00:01:48.409" style="s2">just causing local environmental harm</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.180" end="00:01:50.540" style="s2">that can lead to a limits of growth</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.409" end="00:01:51.530" style="s2">issue we can affect the habitability the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.540" end="00:01:53.750" style="s2">biosphere at large</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.530" end="00:01:55.729" style="s2">obviously we didn&#39;t use to have weapons</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.750" end="00:01:57.500" style="s2">of mass destruction so there&#39;s a total</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.729" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">difference of the capacity for warfare</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.500" end="00:02:01.850" style="s2">etc rates of Technology both the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:04.610" style="s2">globalization and technology have</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.850" end="00:02:06.110" style="s2">changed the magnitude of the issues in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.610" end="00:02:08.119" style="s2">way where the change of magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.110" end="00:02:10.310" style="s2">actually becomes a change in kind and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.119" end="00:02:11.959" style="s2">yet we haven&#39;t figured out not</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.310" end="00:02:14.599" style="s2">civilizational collapse so if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.959" end="00:02:16.819" style="s2">forecast all of the different possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.599" end="00:02:18.739" style="s2">catastrophic risks or existential risks</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.819" end="00:02:21.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of them and what I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.739" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">say is that they all are the result of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.020" end="00:02:24.540" style="s2">some under</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:26.400" style="s2">common generator functions and so as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.540" end="00:02:28.830" style="s2">result if we just tried to deal with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:30.270" style="s2">particular AGI scenario or a particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.830" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">climate change or a particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.270" end="00:02:33.630" style="s2">biodiversity loss or World War three</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:35.430" style="s2">scenario we don&#39;t buy ourselves that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.630" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">much time before another scenario</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.430" end="00:02:38.819" style="s2">emerges because the situation is</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:40.980" style="s2">basically over determined so we actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.819" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">have to address the generator functions</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.980" end="00:02:44.760" style="s2">we have to address it categorically</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">rather than just instances and if we do</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.760" end="00:02:48.270" style="s2">that that becomes the kernel of a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:49.590" style="s2">civilizational model that is radically</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.270" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">different than any civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.590" end="00:02:55.050" style="s2">heretofore which is the more optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:57.030" style="s2">picture and this is kind of like a hard</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.050" end="00:02:58.830" style="s2">fork between very different scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.030" end="00:03:01.500" style="s2">yeah that was I was gonna say on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.830" end="00:03:03.540" style="s2">hopeful side you&#39;re basically trying at</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.500" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">least to define a new social operating</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:07.350" style="s2">system and at least for me and my kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:09.300" style="s2">of naive way of looking at things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.350" end="00:03:11.069" style="s2">still a very rough sketch but I can see</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.300" end="00:03:13.350" style="s2">that if you are able to fill this in it</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.069" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">may make human life vastly better and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.350" end="00:03:16.950" style="s2">more humane than it&#39;s ever been before</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.450" style="s2">before we get to your specific so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.950" end="00:03:20.819" style="s2">would like for our audience and keep in</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.450" end="00:03:22.610" style="s2">mind that our audience are smart people</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.819" end="00:03:25.620" style="s2">I hope but they&#39;re not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.610" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">experts on the way you and I and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.620" end="00:03:29.910" style="s2">and some of our friends talk so I want</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:32.280" style="s2">to make sure that neither of us get too</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.910" end="00:03:34.709" style="s2">far afield in jargon and that we make</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.280" end="00:03:37.410" style="s2">sure that we bring substrate issues up</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.709" end="00:03:39.030" style="s2">before we dive in deeper specifically</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.410" end="00:03:41.459" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard you talk in the past very</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.030" end="00:03:44.070" style="s2">eloquently about how human created</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.459" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">technology is a fundamental change in</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.070" end="00:03:48.690" style="s2">the dynamics of the world and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:51.209" style="s2">technology I invented technology is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.690" end="00:03:53.489" style="s2">fundamentally different than evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.209" end="00:03:55.410" style="s2">and produces fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.489" end="00:03:57.090" style="s2">dynamics we&#39;ll talk about that a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.410" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">bit before we jump into the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.090" end="00:04:02.040" style="s2">specifics of where we&#39;re at yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:04.500" style="s2">definitely a kind of central thing for</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.040" end="00:04:05.810" style="s2">us to figure out especially when if we</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.500" end="00:04:07.890" style="s2">don&#39;t realize this we try and use</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.810" end="00:04:09.959" style="s2">evolutionary biology and evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.890" end="00:04:12.299" style="s2">theory to model human systems like</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.959" end="00:04:14.370" style="s2">reifying theory of markets based in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.299" end="00:04:16.200" style="s2">evolutionary theory and social Darwinism</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.370" end="00:04:18.209" style="s2">writ large and that actually my</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.200" end="00:04:21.320" style="s2">assessment doesn&#39;t work a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.209" end="00:04:23.630" style="s2">insight on the fundamental difference of</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.320" end="00:04:25.310" style="s2">and evolution and highlighting it with</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.630" end="00:04:27.550" style="s2">something Forrest Landry helped me</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.310" end="00:04:30.830" style="s2">understand but model goes like this in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.550" end="00:04:32.300" style="s2">evolution in evolved systems we can kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.830" end="00:04:34.280" style="s2">of think of evolution is defined by</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.300" end="00:04:36.590" style="s2">three primary characteristics which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.280" end="00:04:38.480" style="s2">mutation occurs and then selection</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.590" end="00:04:41.030" style="s2">occurs but selection is two things does</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.480" end="00:04:43.340" style="s2">the agent survive and does it reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.030" end="00:04:45.950" style="s2">so survival selection mate selection and</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.340" end="00:04:48.650" style="s2">then obviously that is survival and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.950" end="00:04:50.540" style="s2">mating with in evolutionary niches now</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.650" end="00:04:52.070" style="s2">something to understand about that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.540" end="00:04:53.510" style="s2">that the mutation pressures that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.070" end="00:04:55.670" style="s2">affecting everything in an ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.510" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of evenness of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.670" end="00:04:58.760" style="s2">distribution of mutation pressures</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:01.040" style="s2">whether we&#39;re talking about gamma rays</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.760" end="00:05:03.140" style="s2">or oxidation or just copying errors or</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.040" end="00:05:05.690" style="s2">viruses they&#39;re affecting all of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.140" end="00:05:07.760" style="s2">Lions pretty similarly and the Lions and</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.690" end="00:05:09.890" style="s2">the gazelles and the plants so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.760" end="00:05:11.150" style="s2">have radical mutation occurring in one</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.890" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">place and no mutation occurring</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.150" end="00:05:14.840" style="s2">somewhere else and so as you have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.800" end="00:05:16.670" style="s2">mutation that would make a lion faster</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.840" end="00:05:18.590" style="s2">or any predator faster you have similar</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.670" end="00:05:20.150" style="s2">mutations that have a distribution and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.590" end="00:05:21.650" style="s2">the fastness and slowness of the prey</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.150" end="00:05:24.680" style="s2">animals so then of course if you get a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.650" end="00:05:26.630" style="s2">little bit faster in one and they say</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.680" end="00:05:28.760" style="s2">the lion eats the slower gazelles then</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.630" end="00:05:30.890" style="s2">the fastest gazelles reproduce and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.760" end="00:05:32.300" style="s2">leads to doubling down on those genes so</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.890" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the next part is not just a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.300" end="00:05:36.860" style="s2">evenness in the distribution of mutation</p>

<p begin="00:05:36.860" end="00:05:41.090" style="s2">the advance is anywhere lead to a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.810" end="00:05:43.730" style="s2">strong symmetric coupling of power</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.090" end="00:05:45.770" style="s2">across the whole system and so this</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.730" end="00:05:48.860" style="s2">leads to a situation where you do have</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.770" end="00:05:51.080" style="s2">rival risk dynamics in nature you do</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.860" end="00:05:53.270" style="s2">have something like individual agents</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.080" end="00:05:54.380" style="s2">doing self maximization of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.270" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">not purely that we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.380" end="00:05:57.110" style="s2">symbiosis we have animals that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:05:58.640" style="s2">paying attention to their yog and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.110" end="00:06:00.170" style="s2">animals that wouldn&#39;t survive it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.640" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">for the whole group of animals that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.170" end="00:06:05.300" style="s2">can model individual self optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:07.610" style="s2">agents and get a certain successfulness</p>

<p begin="00:06:07.610" end="00:06:13.130" style="s2">have this line in this gazelle are in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.180" end="00:06:14.660" style="s2">rival risk dynamic but all lions and all</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.130" end="00:06:16.370" style="s2">gazelles are symbiotic with each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.660" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">meaning the Lions would die without the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.370" end="00:06:19.730" style="s2">gazelles the gazelles would die without</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:21.740" style="s2">the Lions and as either one makes an</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.730" end="00:06:23.270" style="s2">advancement it drives the other one to</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.740" end="00:06:24.770" style="s2">make an advancement so this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.270" end="00:06:26.440" style="s2">where when we think of social Darwinism</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.770" end="00:06:28.990" style="s2">we think of the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.440" end="00:06:30.340" style="s2">competition drives innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.990" end="00:06:32.800" style="s2">advancement and those types of things</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.340" end="00:06:34.660" style="s2">the difference when tech comes about is</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.800" end="00:06:36.370" style="s2">so again these changes in the animals</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.660" end="00:06:38.290" style="s2">are happening mediated through genetics</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.370" end="00:06:39.790" style="s2">mutation of the genes and then survival</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.290" end="00:06:42.340" style="s2">and then recombinant parts of the genes</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.790" end="00:06:44.950" style="s2">so the genes are physically instantiated</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.340" end="00:06:47.590" style="s2">pattern replicators when technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.950" end="00:06:49.600" style="s2">technology I don&#39;t just mean physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.590" end="00:06:51.670" style="s2">tech I also mean language I also mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.600" end="00:06:53.380" style="s2">social tech coordination tech but so</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.670" end="00:06:55.330" style="s2">techne and the Sanskrit sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.380" end="00:06:57.070" style="s2">consciously mediated methods of doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.330" end="00:06:59.050" style="s2">things basically things that come from</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.070" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">the capacity for abstraction and</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.050" end="00:07:02.650" style="s2">creating abstract pattern replicators</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:05.770" style="s2">the abstract pattern replicators can</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.650" end="00:07:08.170" style="s2">change much faster than the instantiated</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.770" end="00:07:10.270" style="s2">ones can and they can change and with an</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.170" end="00:07:12.670" style="s2">uneven distribution so when we think</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.270" end="00:07:14.800" style="s2">about tool making starting with you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.670" end="00:07:17.350" style="s2">Homo habilis and stone tools right which</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.800" end="00:07:19.630" style="s2">is very different than a chimp using a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.350" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">rock that it finds but not whittling</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.630" end="00:07:23.770" style="s2">sharper you know we&#39;re chipping a</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:25.510" style="s2">sharper rock which is the chimp or the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.770" end="00:07:28.030" style="s2">bird or whatever it is that&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.510" end="00:07:29.830" style="s2">something can experientially notice that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.030" end="00:07:31.330" style="s2">this thing is better at doing what it</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.830" end="00:07:33.340" style="s2">wants than this thing is in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.330" end="00:07:35.740" style="s2">but it can&#39;t understand that between all</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.340" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">three rocks why this one is better at</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.740" end="00:07:39.100" style="s2">cutting the thing is because of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:40.930" style="s2">abstract principle of sharpness and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.100" end="00:07:42.460" style="s2">say oh I understand what mediates</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.930" end="00:07:44.320" style="s2">sharpness and I can design something</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.460" end="00:07:46.360" style="s2">with more sharpness that abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.320" end="00:07:48.370" style="s2">capacity seems to be part of how we</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.360" end="00:07:50.470" style="s2">define early humans and then got double</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.370" end="00:07:52.480" style="s2">down in Homo sapiens and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.470" end="00:07:54.640" style="s2">different process than evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.480" end="00:07:56.410" style="s2">bringing new stuff into existence it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.640" end="00:07:58.870" style="s2">not occurring through kind of random</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.410" end="00:08:00.760" style="s2">mutation and just selective dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.870" end="00:08:02.110" style="s2">it&#39;s occurring through an agent that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.760" end="00:08:04.419" style="s2">actually understanding something</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.110" end="00:08:06.370" style="s2">abstractly and intentionally creating it</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.419" end="00:08:08.470" style="s2">and so if you think about evolution as</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.370" end="00:08:10.150" style="s2">the stuff that emerges there wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.470" end="00:08:11.919" style="s2">conscious choice to have something</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.150" end="00:08:13.870" style="s2">emerge it emerged as the result of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.919" end="00:08:16.060" style="s2">complexity dynamics so it&#39;s unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.870" end="00:08:18.190" style="s2">it&#39;s radically parallel it&#39;s radically</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.060" end="00:08:20.890" style="s2">distributed it&#39;s radically combinatoric</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.190" end="00:08:23.050" style="s2">it&#39;s slow almost everything fails but</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.890" end="00:08:24.940" style="s2">you get a interoperability of everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.050" end="00:08:27.250" style="s2">so what makes it through or very</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.940" end="00:08:29.620" style="s2">self-stabilizing complex systems with</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.250" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">technology it&#39;s actually consciously</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.620" end="00:08:32.510" style="s2">created</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:33.950" style="s2">it can happen in a local way not</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.510" end="00:08:35.630" style="s2">everywhere so it&#39;s not radically</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.950" end="00:08:38.390" style="s2">parallel and decentralized it happens</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.630" end="00:08:40.969" style="s2">more in a serial fashion and it creates</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.390" end="00:08:43.700" style="s2">parts that are not necessarily in</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.969" end="00:08:45.440" style="s2">equilibrium with whole systems and so it</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.700" end="00:08:47.779" style="s2">really is mathematically almost an</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:49.700" style="s2">opposite kind of creative process and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.779" end="00:08:52.100" style="s2">the thing is if you have an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.700" end="00:08:55.550" style="s2">agent like a human that has evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.100" end="00:08:58.460" style="s2">motives but is now able to say human</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.550" end="00:09:00.860" style="s2">operating as apex predator can increase</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.460" end="00:09:02.990" style="s2">its predatory capacity orders of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.860" end="00:09:05.630" style="s2">magnitude rapidly faster than the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.990" end="00:09:08.060" style="s2">environment can increase its resilience</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.630" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">to that predatory capacity now we have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.060" end="00:09:12.110" style="s2">fundamental problem this is a lion</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:13.940" style="s2">getting a thousand times faster in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.110" end="00:09:16.760" style="s2">hurry without gazelles being able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.940" end="00:09:18.770" style="s2">make a mutation in adequate time and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.760" end="00:09:21.440" style="s2">lions eat all the gazelles and then go</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.770" end="00:09:23.810" style="s2">extinct and so we have a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">technology has broken the power cemetry</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.810" end="00:09:28.760" style="s2">that is what is necessary for the meta</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">stability of evolved systems and so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.760" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">see that not only is there cemetry of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:34.220" style="s2">power between the line and the gazelle</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">there&#39;s also a symmetry of power between</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.220" end="00:09:36.589" style="s2">lions and lions and gazelles and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:40.310" style="s2">gazelles</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.589" end="00:09:42.560" style="s2">the most badass lion is only you know 2x</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.310" end="00:09:44.900" style="s2">or one and a half X more than the median</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.560" end="00:09:46.790" style="s2">lion but if we look at putin&#39;s killing</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.900" end="00:09:48.740" style="s2">ability or Trump&#39;s compared to yours or</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.790" end="00:09:51.620" style="s2">mine it might be billions or trillions</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.740" end="00:09:53.810" style="s2">of times more and the same we could say</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.620" end="00:09:55.790" style="s2">for economic capacity and if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.810" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">sapiens writ large compared to the rest</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.790" end="00:09:59.480" style="s2">of the biosphere it&#39;s similar and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:01.370" style="s2">when you think about like you know one</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.480" end="00:10:02.690" style="s2">lion just even if it went rogue and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.370" end="00:10:04.430" style="s2">didn&#39;t just kill to survive to start</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.690" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">killing everything it could it has such</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.430" end="00:10:08.540" style="s2">limited destructive capacity and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:11.510" style="s2">not true and especially as we get into</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.540" end="00:10:13.730" style="s2">decentralized exponential tech one actor</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.510" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">or a small group of actress has really</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.730" end="00:10:18.410" style="s2">radical amplification of agency so if</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">you keep having rivalries agency</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.410" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">rivalries basis for agency but with very</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:27.740" style="s2">high power relative to the overall</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:30.860" style="s2">playing field you end up getting a basis</p>

<p begin="00:10:30.860" end="00:10:34.070" style="s2">course it&#39;s not always all about</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.970" end="00:10:36.110" style="s2">destruction either you know two data</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.070" end="00:10:36.529" style="s2">points that jump out at me that we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.110" end="00:10:39.050" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.529" end="00:10:41.449" style="s2">things that we think of as constructive</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.050" end="00:10:43.249" style="s2">that have to be getting well near our</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.449" end="00:10:45.649" style="s2">limits are you know for instance the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.249" end="00:10:47.779" style="s2">fact that of the large mammals on earth</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.649" end="00:10:49.970" style="s2">it&#39;s now thought that the majority of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.779" end="00:10:51.980" style="s2">the biomass is humans plus our</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.970" end="00:10:53.870" style="s2">domesticated animals and when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.980" end="00:10:56.329" style="s2">to birds it&#39;s even more radical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.870" end="00:11:00.110" style="s2">thought that the domesticated birds</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.329" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">represent 70% of the biomass of all</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.110" end="00:11:04.550" style="s2">birds on earth and so nothing</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:05.899" style="s2">destructive specifically destructive</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.550" end="00:11:07.670" style="s2">about catching and killing but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.899" end="00:11:11.240" style="s2">essentially engineered a technology</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.670" end="00:11:13.819" style="s2">which is co-opted a majority or 70% of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.240" end="00:11:15.350" style="s2">the energetics and biomass of the biome</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.819" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s continuing to grow</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.350" end="00:11:20.660" style="s2">exponentially which strikes me as a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:22.610" style="s2">strong signal which is very little</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.660" end="00:11:24.379" style="s2">talked about yeah so this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.610" end="00:11:27.410" style="s2">kind of a limits of growth thing as</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.379" end="00:11:28.970" style="s2">opposed to say a warfare or terrorism or</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.410" end="00:11:31.100" style="s2">you know intentioned destructive thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.970" end="00:11:33.259" style="s2">so think about this we think of apex</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.100" end="00:11:37.100" style="s2">predators they evolved to fit a niche</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.259" end="00:11:39.680" style="s2">and because they&#39;re adaptive capacity is</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.100" end="00:11:41.449" style="s2">mediated through genes through concrete</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.680" end="00:11:43.339" style="s2">pattern replicators they don&#39;t do very</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.449" end="00:11:45.259" style="s2">well outside of that knee and so polar</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.339" end="00:11:46.819" style="s2">bears don&#39;t leave the Arctic right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.259" end="00:11:49.089" style="s2">cheetahs don&#39;t leave the savanna and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.819" end="00:11:52.459" style="s2">orcas don&#39;t get out of the ocean but</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.089" end="00:11:53.839" style="s2">because our apex predator capacity was</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.459" end="00:11:55.160" style="s2">mediated by tools and we could make</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.839" end="00:11:57.800" style="s2">different tools including different</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.160" end="00:11:59.899" style="s2">coverings for ourselves and in different</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.800" end="00:12:01.399" style="s2">environments when we would overkill an</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.899" end="00:12:03.290" style="s2">environment rather than have our</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.399" end="00:12:04.819" style="s2">population stabilized we would just move</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.290" end="00:12:07.370" style="s2">to a new environment to become the apex</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.819" end="00:12:09.800" style="s2">predator there and so we went and became</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.370" end="00:12:12.379" style="s2">apex predator everywhere over hunted and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.800" end="00:12:14.689" style="s2">over farmed environments everywhere over</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.379" end="00:12:17.720" style="s2">fished etc that is really different than</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.689" end="00:12:19.009" style="s2">every other animal and like again if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.720" end="00:12:20.929" style="s2">think of the examples you were just</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.009" end="00:12:23.449" style="s2">giving this like total biodiversity loss</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.929" end="00:12:26.209" style="s2">and the relationship of total animal</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.449" end="00:12:28.309" style="s2">life in domestication versus wild if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.209" end="00:12:30.319" style="s2">think about an apex predator like in</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.309" end="00:12:33.139" style="s2">Orca or a great white shark in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.319" end="00:12:35.959" style="s2">and how many fish it can kill in an hour</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.139" end="00:12:38.420" style="s2">and then you think about a ocean trawler</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.959" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">with a mile long drift net it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.420" end="00:12:42.379" style="s2">even like obviously we aren&#39;t apex</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:44.089" style="s2">predators they can&#39;t destroy whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.379" end="00:12:46.550" style="s2">ecosystems they also can genetically</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.089" end="00:12:48.350" style="s2">engineer new creatures so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.550" end="00:12:48.920" style="s2">stop modeling ourselves as apex</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.350" end="00:12:49.910" style="s2">predators</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.920" end="00:12:52.130" style="s2">competing with each other to be better</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.910" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">apex predators and take the top because</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.130" end="00:12:56.810" style="s2">the destructive capacity even of not</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">intending to destruct just of intending</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.810" end="00:13:01.820" style="s2">to extract is well beyond the replenish</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.600" end="00:13:04.339" style="s2">rates of the system yeah and on top of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.820" end="00:13:06.620" style="s2">that and on our first episode with Simon</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.339" end="00:13:09.320" style="s2">today oh we talked fair amount about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.620" end="00:13:10.910" style="s2">rate of social evolution is accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.320" end="00:13:13.850" style="s2">the rate of invention of new</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.910" end="00:13:16.220" style="s2">technologies new capabilities is way</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.850" end="00:13:17.899" style="s2">faster now than it was just 30 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.220" end="00:13:20.630" style="s2">and if we&#39;re already approaching the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.899" end="00:13:23.209" style="s2">limits probably exceeded the sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.630" end="00:13:25.399" style="s2">limits of our society and we have social</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.209" end="00:13:27.740" style="s2">evolution that&#39;s going exponential and</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.399" end="00:13:29.990" style="s2">we still have a rising world population</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.740" end="00:13:31.720" style="s2">last I saw projected to top out 11</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.990" end="00:13:35.570" style="s2">billion with many of those people</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.720" end="00:13:37.370" style="s2">expecting a increase in their lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.570" end="00:13:39.139" style="s2">quote unquote towards the American and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.370" end="00:13:41.510" style="s2">European one looks like to me a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.139" end="00:13:44.750" style="s2">trainwreck coming at very high speed</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.510" end="00:13:48.170" style="s2">right and so again this idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.750" end="00:13:50.389" style="s2">didn&#39;t start over hunting an environment</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.170" end="00:13:51.980" style="s2">and then it became harder to eat and</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.389" end="00:13:53.720" style="s2">breed so then we came in to sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.980" end="00:13:55.279" style="s2">population with the environment we just</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.720" end="00:13:57.860" style="s2">moved to another environment there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.279" end="00:13:59.510" style="s2">this kind of rebound effect that we see</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.860" end="00:14:01.430" style="s2">with humans and we see it in all of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.510" end="00:14:02.540" style="s2">evolution right like our friend bred why</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.430" end="00:14:04.250" style="s2">interesting we&#39;ll say if there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.540" end="00:14:06.290" style="s2">evolutionary niche it will get filled</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.250" end="00:14:08.600" style="s2">with something right so in the similar</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.290" end="00:14:10.490" style="s2">sense though with humans we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.600" end="00:14:12.050" style="s2">to wait for a genetic mutation we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.490" end="00:14:14.990" style="s2">have a memetic mutation to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.050" end="00:14:16.910" style="s2">how to exploit some new niche and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.990" end="00:14:18.529" style="s2">this is where we get rebound effects</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.910" end="00:14:20.089" style="s2">where it increases in efficiency don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.529" end="00:14:21.589" style="s2">lead to us being more sustainable the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.089" end="00:14:24.050" style="s2">environment they lead to us figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.589" end="00:14:25.850" style="s2">how to have profitable exploits on more</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.050" end="00:14:27.620" style="s2">area and so you know when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.850" end="00:14:29.990" style="s2">something like the jebin&#39;s paradox or</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.620" end="00:14:32.510" style="s2">other abstractions of it if I give a 20%</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.990" end="00:14:34.970" style="s2">increase in energy efficiency we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.510" end="00:14:36.949" style="s2">just use 20% less energy we find whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.970" end="00:14:39.589" style="s2">new markets that weren&#39;t open based on</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.949" end="00:14:41.630" style="s2">now the what&#39;s gonna be profitable we go</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.589" end="00:14:44.060" style="s2">exploit those and in the abusing more</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.630" end="00:14:45.560" style="s2">net energy as a result and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.060" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">look at like trying to figure out a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.560" end="00:14:49.580" style="s2">steady-state population steady-state</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:50.960" style="s2">population doesn&#39;t actually work</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.580" end="00:14:53.210" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work the way that we like to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.960" end="00:14:55.340" style="s2">model in evolutionary biology with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.210" end="00:14:57.530" style="s2">way that humans continue to advance</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.340" end="00:14:59.570" style="s2">increases in capacity and efficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.530" end="00:15:01.210" style="s2">then exploit all yeah and you&#39;ve spoken</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.570" end="00:15:03.770" style="s2">quite a bit about you combine</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.210" end="00:15:07.970" style="s2">exponentially increasing technology with</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.770" end="00:15:10.010" style="s2">the core rival risks win-loss dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.970" end="00:15:11.810" style="s2">of at least our economic system and a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.010" end="00:15:13.490" style="s2">goodly part of our social system you</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.810" end="00:15:16.580" style="s2">talk a little bit about how the coupling</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.490" end="00:15:19.280" style="s2">of those two together are spectacularly</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.580" end="00:15:22.040" style="s2">different than either by itself yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.280" end="00:15:23.930" style="s2">this is I mentioned earlier that all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.040" end="00:15:25.790" style="s2">catastrophic and existential risks have</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.930" end="00:15:28.790" style="s2">underlying generator functions what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.790" end="00:15:33.080" style="s2">mean by that is that so like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.790" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at wanting to stop or take</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.080" end="00:15:37.250" style="s2">your kind of environmental destruction</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">or war or whatever it is well we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.250" end="00:15:40.850" style="s2">look at why are those things caused and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.440" end="00:15:42.830" style="s2">we can find some things that seems</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.850" end="00:15:44.630" style="s2">special to specific instances but some</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.830" end="00:15:46.310" style="s2">things that are part of a causal set</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.630" end="00:15:47.930" style="s2">that are true across all of them so</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.310" end="00:15:50.600" style="s2">obviously we can look at something like</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.930" end="00:15:52.640" style="s2">perverse incentive and so with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.600" end="00:15:55.100" style="s2">environmental destruction if the wild</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.640" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">birds aren&#39;t worth very much to us in</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.100" end="00:15:59.570" style="s2">the wild but domesticated ones and farms</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:02.090" style="s2">where the farms take over the wild areas</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.570" end="00:16:04.190" style="s2">are if cattle are worth something to us</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.090" end="00:16:06.260" style="s2">when domesticated and then killed and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.190" end="00:16:08.060" style="s2">not when they&#39;re free and of course we</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.260" end="00:16:10.100" style="s2">have an economic incentive to exploit</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.060" end="00:16:11.540" style="s2">everything and the same would be true if</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.100" end="00:16:13.280" style="s2">we have a for-profit military industrial</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.540" end="00:16:15.470" style="s2">complex where war is more profitable</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.280" end="00:16:17.900" style="s2">than pieces and so the underlying idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.470" end="00:16:20.780" style="s2">here is that you can&#39;t prevent a harm</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.900" end="00:16:22.580" style="s2">well there is a very strong incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.780" end="00:16:24.050" style="s2">cause it because that incentive is kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.580" end="00:16:26.150" style="s2">of an evolutionary niche for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.050" end="00:16:27.770" style="s2">particular and way of getting ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.150" end="00:16:29.900" style="s2">it will end up getting filled so we try</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.770" end="00:16:32.000" style="s2">to make law to bind that but as we know</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.900" end="00:16:34.010" style="s2">strong economic power ends up being able</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.000" end="00:16:36.320" style="s2">to influence law pretty heavily so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.010" end="00:16:38.540" style="s2">thing that is designed to bind the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.320" end="00:16:39.770" style="s2">problems of the incentive system ends up</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.540" end="00:16:41.000" style="s2">getting corrupted by the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.770" end="00:16:42.980" style="s2">system so we can get into that more</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.000" end="00:16:44.900" style="s2">later but this is an idea of something</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.980" end="00:16:47.210" style="s2">like perverse incentive that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.900" end="00:16:49.070" style="s2">unique to one issue it&#39;s underneath lots</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.210" end="00:16:50.840" style="s2">of issues so if we want to abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.070" end="00:16:53.240" style="s2">say what are the generators that give</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.840" end="00:16:55.460" style="s2">rise to all of the possible existential</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.240" end="00:16:56.780" style="s2">risks in the future the first one is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.460" end="00:16:58.550" style="s2">one that you just mentioned first one I</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.780" end="00:17:00.640" style="s2">would identify is that if humans are</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.550" end="00:17:02.770" style="s2">running rival risk games and by right</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.640" end="00:17:05.140" style="s2">wrist games I mean some in group that is</p>

<p begin="00:19:30.870" end="00:19:35.850" style="s2">radical approach which we might call</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.690" end="00:19:37.860" style="s2">Democratic liberalism and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.850" end="00:19:40.260" style="s2">passing talked about the fact that our</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.260" end="00:19:44.550" style="s2">been hijacked by our economic and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.300" end="00:19:46.890" style="s2">financial systems we could in theory fix</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.550" end="00:19:48.960" style="s2">that it may require an amendment to the</p>

<p begin="00:19:48.960" end="00:19:53.460" style="s2">it could be fixed secondly the depletion</p>

<p begin="00:19:58.050" end="00:20:03.270" style="s2">the Commons we also look at Ostrom</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.929" end="00:20:05.400" style="s2">theories of managing the Commons and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.270" end="00:20:07.800" style="s2">those are assumed to take place in a</p>

<p begin="00:20:07.800" end="00:20:12.750" style="s2">them well how would you respond to those</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.510" end="00:20:14.250" style="s2">who say rather than changing the jet</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.250" end="00:20:18.929" style="s2">flight we&#39;d be better off attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.559" end="00:20:21.240" style="s2">be smart about fixing our Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.929" end="00:20:24.500" style="s2">liberalism by breaking the hack between</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.240" end="00:20:27.179" style="s2">money and politics and by rigorously and</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.500" end="00:20:29.130" style="s2">probably initially very conservatively</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.179" end="00:20:32.570" style="s2">meaning expensively pricing</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.130" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">externalities I will say that that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.570" end="00:20:38.970" style="s2">formally impossible and explain why but</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:40.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a few aspects to it so well like</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.970" end="00:20:42.120" style="s2">this we&#39;ll take a minute take us what</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.650" end="00:20:44.700" style="s2">stop me feel like this is really</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.120" end="00:20:47.130" style="s2">important I would start by wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.700" end="00:20:49.590" style="s2">just be clear on the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.130" end="00:20:51.150" style="s2">difference between a market and a</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.590" end="00:20:52.410" style="s2">government and the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.150" end="00:20:55.290" style="s2">those because what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.410" end="00:20:56.900" style="s2">is a government regulating a market yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.290" end="00:20:59.610" style="s2">in fact that would call that the modern</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.900" end="00:21:01.740" style="s2">Democratic liberal synthesis that</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.610" end="00:21:04.110" style="s2">started in the 1920s was fully in</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.740" end="00:21:07.350" style="s2">existence by the 1930s and was locked in</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.110" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">in its modern form in 1948 great so what</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.350" end="00:21:12.270" style="s2">I would say is that there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">architectures within markets that lead</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.270" end="00:21:16.250" style="s2">inexorably to certain issues other</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:18.410" style="s2">within governments and I&#39;m gonna try and</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.250" end="00:21:20.570" style="s2">abstract us at the most abstract level</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.410" end="00:21:22.340" style="s2">that works which is this will be true</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.570" end="00:21:23.809" style="s2">for any form of government whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.340" end="00:21:25.850" style="s2">a two-party system or a three-party</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.809" end="00:21:28.040" style="s2">system or has a parliament or doesn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.850" end="00:21:31.130" style="s2">too simply the nature of it being a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.040" end="00:21:33.350" style="s2">top-down imposition of law via monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.130" end="00:21:35.030" style="s2">of force and the same is true for</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.350" end="00:21:37.309" style="s2">whether we&#39;re talking about any</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.030" end="00:21:39.020" style="s2">different version of how one might think</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.309" end="00:21:40.820" style="s2">of a market so if we think of a market</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.020" end="00:21:42.950" style="s2">you can actually think about theory of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.820" end="00:21:45.620" style="s2">markets like pure lays a fair theory and</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.950" end="00:21:47.030" style="s2">try and model it via evolutionary theory</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.620" end="00:21:48.920" style="s2">and people do and this is where social</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.030" end="00:21:51.170" style="s2">Darwinism kind of comes right which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.920" end="00:21:53.270" style="s2">these three things mutation survival</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.170" end="00:21:55.850" style="s2">selection and then mating mating</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.270" end="00:21:57.320" style="s2">selection are what define the success of</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.850" end="00:21:59.300" style="s2">markets so you have an environmental</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.320" end="00:22:02.300" style="s2">niche which here would be called demand</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.300" end="00:22:04.490" style="s2">people need real stuff and so then that</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.300" end="00:22:06.559" style="s2">creates a impetus to try and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.490" end="00:22:08.090" style="s2">how to fit that niche which is supply it</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.559" end="00:22:09.590" style="s2">will make some product or service to try</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.090" end="00:22:11.450" style="s2">and do it but they&#39;ll make slightly</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.590" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">different versions that equals mutation</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.450" end="00:22:15.110" style="s2">the one that actually meets people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:16.550" style="s2">needs best of the best value is the one</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.110" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">that will make it through survival</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.550" end="00:22:20.120" style="s2">selection and then if a few of them have</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:22.280" style="s2">different properties that are all really</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.120" end="00:22:24.350" style="s2">desirable they might mate and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.280" end="00:22:25.700" style="s2">you know merger and acquisition or IP</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.350" end="00:22:27.470" style="s2">trade or whatever and you get a</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.700" end="00:22:28.940" style="s2">recombinant oriole dynamic and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.470" end="00:22:31.970" style="s2">main selection and that&#39;s the idea right</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.940" end="00:22:34.070" style="s2">except as we mentioned that&#39;s true but</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.970" end="00:22:36.620" style="s2">you don&#39;t get the meta stability of an</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.070" end="00:22:38.870" style="s2">evolved system because of the a</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.620" end="00:22:40.460" style="s2">symmetries are gonna be intrinsic to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.870" end="00:22:42.590" style="s2">abstract replicators that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.460" end="00:22:45.320" style="s2">therefore instantiated replicators so if</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.590" end="00:22:47.929" style="s2">we think about a market as a bottom-up</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:54.309" style="s2">trying to do everybody&#39;s not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.970" end="00:22:56.600" style="s2">agree on something we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.309" end="00:22:58.550" style="s2">interacting with each other via supply</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.600" end="00:23:01.040" style="s2">and demand dynamics and stuff gets up</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.550" end="00:23:03.260" style="s2">regulated so that basically the society</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.040" end="00:23:05.780" style="s2">is all emergent properties of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.260" end="00:23:07.550" style="s2">bottom-up interactions so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.780" end="00:23:09.590" style="s2">kind of thing and we can really think of</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.550" end="00:23:11.809" style="s2">as having certain characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.590" end="00:23:13.400" style="s2">just the bottom-up math of it one thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.809" end="00:23:16.640" style="s2">I would say then and this is a critique</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.400" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">of libertarian ideology free-market kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:20.929" style="s2">of ideology writ large</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:23.059" style="s2">is that without regulation markets are</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.929" end="00:23:26.090" style="s2">going to have multipolar traps that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.059" end="00:23:28.940" style="s2">cannot resolve and by a multipolar trap</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.090" end="00:23:31.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a generalization of weather it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.940" end="00:23:33.260" style="s2">tragedy of the Commons or an arms race</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.039" end="00:23:35.169" style="s2">or any kind of race to the cliff a race</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.260" end="00:23:38.090" style="s2">to the bottom these are scenarios where</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.169" end="00:23:39.919" style="s2">somebody can do something that is bad</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.090" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">for the whole over the long term but</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.919" end="00:23:43.190" style="s2">very good for them over the near term</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:45.830" style="s2">and provides so much competitive</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.190" end="00:23:47.899" style="s2">advantage that without law to bind it</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.830" end="00:23:49.220" style="s2">people will still buy the thing they</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.899" end="00:23:50.929" style="s2">will still be able to get employees</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.220" end="00:23:53.630" style="s2">right like the market forces won&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.929" end="00:23:56.809" style="s2">it and so then everyone else has to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.630" end="00:23:58.730" style="s2">compete to do the same thing or they</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.809" end="00:24:00.679" style="s2">will just lose by default in the short</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.730" end="00:24:02.659" style="s2">term so now you have everybody competing</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.679" end="00:24:04.279" style="s2">to get the cheaper material that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.659" end="00:24:06.980" style="s2">comprehensively damaging the environment</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.279" end="00:24:08.539" style="s2">or racing to cut down the trees faster</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.980" end="00:24:09.889" style="s2">than they actually need them because if</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.539" end="00:24:12.110" style="s2">they don&#39;t the other guy will cut down</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.889" end="00:24:13.789" style="s2">the trees anyways or one guy makes a I</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.110" end="00:24:15.590" style="s2">weapon so everybody has to make the AI</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.789" end="00:24:16.070" style="s2">weapons where they&#39;re going to lose by</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.590" end="00:24:19.909" style="s2">default</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.070" end="00:24:22.850" style="s2">and so multipolar traps in the past when</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.909" end="00:24:26.120" style="s2">we had limited power could lead to boom</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.850" end="00:24:28.309" style="s2">and bust cycles where we start polluting</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.120" end="00:24:30.260" style="s2">the water because say everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.309" end="00:24:31.429" style="s2">isn&#39;t polluting the water my pollution</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.260" end="00:24:33.710" style="s2">of the water doesn&#39;t make it that much</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.429" end="00:24:35.809" style="s2">worse but not having to deal with my</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.710" end="00:24:37.639" style="s2">pollution properly increases my margins</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.809" end="00:24:38.990" style="s2">because I externalize some of the cost</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.639" end="00:24:40.370" style="s2">so I&#39;m getting ahead then other people</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.990" end="00:24:42.139" style="s2">say it that guy&#39;s getting so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.370" end="00:24:43.429" style="s2">more ahead everybody starts doing it</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.139" end="00:24:44.840" style="s2">eventually the water is so polluted that</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.429" end="00:24:46.970" style="s2">everybody is doing worse because the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.840" end="00:24:49.100" style="s2">fish are all dead so then there&#39;s now a</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.970" end="00:24:51.380" style="s2">new market for selling water purifiers</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.100" end="00:24:53.570" style="s2">and so we start doing that thing until</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.380" end="00:24:55.250" style="s2">you know then there is a new scenario</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.570" end="00:24:57.559" style="s2">for the pollution to occur so you get</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.250" end="00:24:59.419" style="s2">these kind of best you get a race to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.559" end="00:25:00.740" style="s2">bottom and then some new market</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.419" end="00:25:02.779" style="s2">opportunity race to the top with</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.740" end="00:25:04.610" style="s2">exponentially more people and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.779" end="00:25:07.220" style="s2">exponentially more power per person more</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.610" end="00:25:08.690" style="s2">moreover you have situations where the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.220" end="00:25:10.260" style="s2">bottom can be so bad that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.690" end="00:25:12.420" style="s2">unrecoverable let me jump</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.260" end="00:25:14.610" style="s2">but here you&#39;re drawing the classic 19th</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.420" end="00:25:16.890" style="s2">century Adam Smith quasi-libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.610" end="00:25:18.750" style="s2">model suppose though we take a more</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.890" end="00:25:22.110" style="s2">modern social democratic perspective</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.750" end="00:25:24.630" style="s2">where we assume it is the job of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.110" end="00:25:26.640" style="s2">legal political government side as</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.630" end="00:25:29.190" style="s2">instantiated through democracy to put</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.640" end="00:25:30.810" style="s2">limits on the market and when I call</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.190" end="00:25:32.820" style="s2">what I&#39;ve called in the past parametric</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.810" end="00:25:36.060" style="s2">social democracy where instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.820" end="00:25:39.150" style="s2">bunch of fine grained regulations used a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.060" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">dozen or so very powerful settings on</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.150" end="00:25:43.410" style="s2">the gravitational attractors within the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:45.330" style="s2">game itself I&#39;ll just throw out two</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.410" end="00:25:47.760" style="s2">examples which I&#39;ve talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.330" end="00:25:50.970" style="s2">past in some detail one would be a high</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.760" end="00:25:54.570" style="s2">and rapidly rising carbon tax let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.970" end="00:25:57.630" style="s2">$50 a ton to start rising $10 a year for</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.570" end="00:26:00.660" style="s2">15 years to $200 a ton which would send</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.630" end="00:26:03.540" style="s2">a magnificently powerful signal to stop</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.660" end="00:26:05.670" style="s2">using carbon would empower alternative</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.540" end="00:26:07.710" style="s2">energy production in a very major way a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.670" end="00:26:09.840" style="s2">second one much simpler one of the hacks</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.710" end="00:26:12.300" style="s2">we know that our current system does is</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:14.160" style="s2">you psychologically informed advertising</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.300" end="00:26:16.650" style="s2">to invent demand suppose we put a two</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.160" end="00:26:18.600" style="s2">hundred percent tax on all advertising I</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.650" end="00:26:21.870" style="s2">have ten more I could throw out there so</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.600" end="00:26:24.090" style="s2">why can&#39;t a list of powerful parameters</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.870" end="00:26:26.130" style="s2">tame the market without having to</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.090" end="00:26:28.620" style="s2">undergo the radical shift that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.130" end="00:26:30.420" style="s2">talking about forgive me I was starting</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.620" end="00:26:31.770" style="s2">with an unregulated market because I</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.420" end="00:26:33.900" style="s2">wanted to establish something about</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.770" end="00:26:36.060" style="s2">theory of the markets which is why we</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.900" end="00:26:38.880" style="s2">can do just a libertarian thing and why</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.060" end="00:26:40.860" style="s2">there is a good case for a regulated</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.880" end="00:26:42.860" style="s2">market now once you then do a</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.860" end="00:26:45.030" style="s2">construction on what&#39;s wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.860" end="00:26:46.230" style="s2">governments and then I want to do a</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.030" end="00:26:47.400" style="s2">construction on what&#39;s wrong with them</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.230" end="00:26:48.570" style="s2">together because I have to refer to</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.400" end="00:26:50.490" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with each one individually</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.570" end="00:26:52.830" style="s2">before I can do the combined test all</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.490" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">right you go right ahead okay so</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.830" end="00:26:57.030" style="s2">basically anything that has bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:26:59.160" style="s2">coordination only but abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.030" end="00:27:00.690" style="s2">mediated capacities like markets is</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.160" end="00:27:02.880" style="s2">going to fall to multipolar traps</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.690" end="00:27:04.860" style="s2">multipolar traps with exponential tech</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.880" end="00:27:08.550" style="s2">will be catastrophic ly bad that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.860" end="00:27:10.710" style="s2">then this is at least of the story of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.550" end="00:27:13.860" style="s2">major reason why we justify creating</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.710" end="00:27:15.840" style="s2">states which is okay we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.860" end="00:27:18.060" style="s2">everybody to cut down all of the trees</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.840" end="00:27:18.830" style="s2">just to store them as lumber because if</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.060" end="00:27:20.899" style="s2">they don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.830" end="00:27:22.370" style="s2">I will and were left with no trees and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.899" end="00:27:24.350" style="s2">yet how do we deal with this we have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.370" end="00:27:27.860" style="s2">real coordination problem well we need</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.350" end="00:27:30.169" style="s2">to create some entity that has the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.860" end="00:27:32.149" style="s2">ability to stop everybody from doing it</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.169" end="00:27:34.610" style="s2">and so that entity needs some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.149" end="00:27:36.409" style="s2">monopoly of force to be able to actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.610" end="00:27:38.390" style="s2">uphold an agreement so we want something</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.409" end="00:27:39.799" style="s2">like rule of law we want the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.390" end="00:27:41.960" style="s2">come up with good laws and we want the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.799" end="00:27:45.140" style="s2">ability to enforce those laws so we</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.960" end="00:27:47.390" style="s2">agree to bequeath to a government a</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.140" end="00:27:50.720" style="s2">legitimate monopoly on violence which</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.390" end="00:27:53.149" style="s2">internal is a police force without which</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.720" end="00:27:54.830" style="s2">law doesn&#39;t actually exist right the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.149" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">thing that we think of as law doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.830" end="00:27:59.750" style="s2">exist and then externally a military</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:01.789" style="s2">force so that the freedom for us to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.750" end="00:28:05.179" style="s2">this thing is upheld against other</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.789" end="00:28:07.100" style="s2">groups now we can say why do we create</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.179" end="00:28:09.830" style="s2">States well one reason is to unify</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.100" end="00:28:12.110" style="s2">groups to be able to win Wars and defend</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.830" end="00:28:14.120" style="s2">themselves and the other is to solve</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.110" end="00:28:15.470" style="s2">multipolar traps ie create rule of law</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.120" end="00:28:17.450" style="s2">so that we can coordinate better and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.470" end="00:28:20.029" style="s2">arguably the actual reason is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.450" end="00:28:21.769" style="s2">consolidate power even more but that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.029" end="00:28:23.480" style="s2">not the answer that is given it when</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.769" end="00:28:25.010" style="s2">justifying it so if we think about a</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.480" end="00:28:26.779" style="s2">government the government is now not a</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.010" end="00:28:29.269" style="s2">bottom-up system it&#39;s a top-down system</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.779" end="00:28:31.610" style="s2">meaning that there is some centralized</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.269" end="00:28:33.529" style="s2">rather than decentralized body that can</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.610" end="00:28:36.889" style="s2">actually make choices whether it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.529" end="00:28:38.870" style="s2">monarchy or a oligarchy or democracy or</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.889" end="00:28:40.519" style="s2">whatever so it&#39;s one person or it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.870" end="00:28:42.559" style="s2">majority of people there is some process</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.519" end="00:28:44.510" style="s2">to be able to say okay this is the law</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.559" end="00:28:47.389" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do and here&#39;s then how</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.510" end="00:28:49.100" style="s2">that law will be upheld via the agency</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.389" end="00:28:51.860" style="s2">of that central body in its monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.100" end="00:28:54.649" style="s2">force now we can identify things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.860" end="00:28:57.769" style="s2">will end up going wrong with top-down</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.649" end="00:29:00.200" style="s2">systems and we&#39;re trying to bind the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.769" end="00:29:03.169" style="s2">problems associated with incentive and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.200" end="00:29:05.059" style="s2">yet the agents who are mediating cuz the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.169" end="00:29:06.500" style="s2">government isn&#39;t actually an entity in</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.059" end="00:29:08.690" style="s2">and of itself even though it&#39;s acting</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.500" end="00:29:10.789" style="s2">like it it&#39;s run by people who are all</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.690" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">still agents within the economic system</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.789" end="00:29:13.750" style="s2">that all still have incentives</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:15.529" style="s2">themselves to the judge and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.750" end="00:29:17.269" style="s2">lobbyists and the lawyer and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.529" end="00:29:19.820" style="s2">politician all still have their own</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.269" end="00:29:22.450" style="s2">fundamentally still largely rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.820" end="00:29:24.700" style="s2">basis for wanting increased status power</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.450" end="00:29:27.400" style="s2">it is yeah the famous economic problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.700" end="00:29:29.710" style="s2">of agency risk right every company has</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.400" end="00:29:31.990" style="s2">that problem right every employee in</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.710" end="00:29:33.940" style="s2">theory is out for their own good and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.990" end="00:29:36.190" style="s2">they have to build structures so that at</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.940" end="00:29:38.740" style="s2">least to a first-order approximation the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.190" end="00:29:40.420" style="s2">company achieved some level of good for</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.740" end="00:29:42.490" style="s2">the shareholder so yeah this is a common</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.420" end="00:29:44.500" style="s2">place of any social structure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.490" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">because the corporation is also a</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.500" end="00:29:48.490" style="s2">top-down system like a government is and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:51.310" style="s2">so we can see similar issues that occur</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.490" end="00:29:54.370" style="s2">and so this is public choice theory is</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.310" end="00:29:56.110" style="s2">basically the critique of the wrongness</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.370" end="00:29:58.570" style="s2">of the incentive structures of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.110" end="00:30:00.400" style="s2">government agents associated with</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.570" end="00:30:02.380" style="s2">markets and it&#39;s a classic libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.400" end="00:30:04.750" style="s2">critique of the regulatory process on</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.380" end="00:30:07.660" style="s2">markets but so let&#39;s look like this some</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.750" end="00:30:09.490" style="s2">examples so unless I have a fully global</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.660" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">government I&#39;m gonna make a lot the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.490" end="00:30:13.000" style="s2">level of say about a carbon tax or</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:15.760" style="s2">whatever at the level of us say a nation</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.000" end="00:30:17.590" style="s2">state and if anyone doesn&#39;t make that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:19.660" style="s2">the nation states are still caught in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.590" end="00:30:21.010" style="s2">multipolar trap with each other so I can</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.660" end="00:30:23.410" style="s2">have multicolor trap at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.010" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">individuals or corporations or countries</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.410" end="00:30:27.880" style="s2">or trading bloc&#39;s and so then anybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:30.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do the thing and they</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.880" end="00:30:31.330" style="s2">economically get ahead in the short term</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.130" end="00:30:41.080" style="s2">even if what they&#39;re doing is totally</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.330" end="00:30:43.450" style="s2">unbelievable aw on everyone else and</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.080" end="00:30:45.280" style="s2">this would be true for things like AI</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.450" end="00:30:47.620" style="s2">arms races this is why we tried to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.280" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">a UN after World War 2 is recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.620" end="00:30:50.830" style="s2">that national only governments won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:52.930" style="s2">stop World War so we wanted some</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.830" end="00:30:54.400" style="s2">supranational force to be a monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.930" end="00:30:56.050" style="s2">force for everyone except when</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.400" end="00:30:58.690" style="s2">individual nation states have</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.050" end="00:31:00.940" style="s2">catastrophic level capacity ie they have</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.690" end="00:31:02.500" style="s2">nukes what we find is that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.940" end="00:31:03.970" style="s2">monopoly of force that can be exerted</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.500" end="00:31:05.620" style="s2">over them because to have the monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.970" end="00:31:08.650" style="s2">force work you have to be able to exert</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.620" end="00:31:10.660" style="s2">it so the UN can&#39;t tell a member country</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.650" end="00:31:11.740" style="s2">that has nukes you have to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.660" end="00:31:13.090" style="s2">them because they&#39;re like we have nukes</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.740" end="00:31:15.760" style="s2"> off what are you gonna do invade us</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.090" end="00:31:17.260" style="s2">and this is one of the big problems is</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.760" end="00:31:19.240" style="s2">that the Nopalea force only works when</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.260" end="00:31:20.290" style="s2">you can exert it that&#39;s why it obviously</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.240" end="00:31:21.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for nuclear deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.290" end="00:31:23.800" style="s2">proliferation it&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.640" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">for a lot of global issues but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.800" end="00:31:28.119" style="s2">why even as a national</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:30.249" style="s2">with the evolution or the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.119" end="00:31:33.070" style="s2">decentralized exponential technologies</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.249" end="00:31:34.570" style="s2">where small groups and non-state actors</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.070" end="00:31:36.639" style="s2">and even individuals can get</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.570" end="00:31:40.090" style="s2">catastrophic capacity through gene</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.639" end="00:31:42.460" style="s2">drives and drones and whatever if I have</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.090" end="00:31:44.139" style="s2">a gene Drive pandemic type weapon</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.460" end="00:31:46.149" style="s2">connected to a Deadman switch there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.139" end="00:31:47.860" style="s2">no rule of law that can be exerted over</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.149" end="00:31:49.989" style="s2">me and we&#39;re not that far from those</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.860" end="00:31:52.360" style="s2">types of things being possibilities so</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.989" end="00:31:54.279" style="s2">this represents an emergent breakdown in</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.360" end="00:31:56.049" style="s2">the capacity for rule of law writ large</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.279" end="00:31:57.340" style="s2">and less you run a perfected</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.049" end="00:31:59.320" style="s2">surveillance state that doesn&#39;t allow</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.340" end="00:32:01.960" style="s2">anyone to have capacities which is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.320" end="00:32:04.539" style="s2">China strategy again I&#39;m gonna argue</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.960" end="00:32:06.070" style="s2">here the moderate ameliorative position</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.539" end="00:32:08.200" style="s2">even though it may not actually be mine</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.070" end="00:32:10.539" style="s2">let&#39;s take the example of the carbon tax</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.200" end="00:32:12.609" style="s2">that other countries want to freeride</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.539" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">and defect from right which you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.609" end="00:32:16.509" style="s2">easily see there being pressures to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.320" end="00:32:18.519" style="s2">so free riders and defections are the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.509" end="00:32:21.759" style="s2">essence of game theory and at least in</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.519" end="00:32:23.769" style="s2">my mind you&#39;re multipolar trap is slight</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.759" end="00:32:26.769" style="s2">generalization of the concepts of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.769" end="00:32:28.869" style="s2">predatory game theory so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.769" end="00:32:31.119" style="s2">personal fix whether it&#39;s enough or not</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.869" end="00:32:34.179" style="s2">I don&#39;t know which would be to have an</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.119" end="00:32:36.369" style="s2">implicit carbon tariff on imports so</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.179" end="00:32:38.350" style="s2">let&#39;s say the Chinese want to defect and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.369" end="00:32:39.909" style="s2">not collect the carbon tax we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.350" end="00:32:41.559" style="s2">really care to the degree they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.909" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">collect the carbon tax that we do care</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.559" end="00:32:47.109" style="s2">but at least partially we can penalize</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:49.539" style="s2">them by putting a tariff equal to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.109" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">implicit carbon tax that we would have</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.539" end="00:32:53.049" style="s2">charged for the equivalent amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:54.909" style="s2">carbon in a product and in a worry</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.049" end="00:32:57.009" style="s2">especially in countries like China and</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.909" end="00:32:59.649" style="s2">increasingly India which are very</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.009" end="00:33:02.619" style="s2">dependent on trade this is at least a</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.649" end="00:33:04.749" style="s2">partial way of raising the cost quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.619" end="00:33:06.639" style="s2">significantly for those who defect or</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.749" end="00:33:09.220" style="s2">attempt to be Free Riders how would you</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.639" end="00:33:10.989" style="s2">respond to that yeah so let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.220" end="00:33:13.720" style="s2">u.s. agreed to do that but then let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.989" end="00:33:14.950" style="s2">say Brazil under its new presidency says</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.720" end="00:33:17.649" style="s2"> that all buy the stuff from China</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.950" end="00:33:19.239" style="s2">and they have some capacity to and say</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.649" end="00:33:21.580" style="s2">Russia does say some other places do</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.239" end="00:33:23.919" style="s2">China is still growing in its GDP</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.580" end="00:33:26.109" style="s2">externalizing cost and those other</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.919" end="00:33:28.029" style="s2">places are and now we&#39;re losing relative</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.109" end="00:33:30.580" style="s2">to them now you get increasing citizen</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.029" end="00:33:31.869" style="s2">pressure to revoke that law so this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.580" end="00:33:34.809" style="s2">again the essence of a coordination</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.869" end="00:33:36.820" style="s2">problem from the view of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.809" end="00:33:38.350" style="s2">make sense if we all did the good thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.820" end="00:33:40.090" style="s2">right in the prisoner&#39;s dilemma if we</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.350" end="00:33:41.860" style="s2">all coordinated would be good but if we</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.090" end="00:33:43.509" style="s2">don&#39;t have the capacity to ensure the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.860" end="00:33:45.429" style="s2">coordination anyone can defect it</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.509" end="00:33:47.200" style="s2">becomes very easy to have the strange</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.429" end="00:33:48.639" style="s2">attractor be everybody default to</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:50.230" style="s2">defection yeah the answer the prisoner&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.639" end="00:33:52.389" style="s2">dilemma as we all know is you have Tony</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.230" end="00:33:55.629" style="s2">Soprano right that if you defect I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.389" end="00:33:58.330" style="s2">kill ya yeah which is basically you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.629" end="00:34:00.070" style="s2">some kind of even worse punishment than</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.330" end="00:34:02.200" style="s2">the original thing was its outside of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.070" end="00:34:04.389" style="s2">the scenario and that ends up being how</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.200" end="00:34:06.159" style="s2">we do it right which is underneath our</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.389" end="00:34:08.589" style="s2">tariff situation we&#39;re willing to go to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.159" end="00:34:10.510" style="s2">war to uphold a lot of these things but</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.589" end="00:34:13.589" style="s2">now let&#39;s come back to even within a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.510" end="00:34:16.389" style="s2">country so we know that right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.589" end="00:34:21.339" style="s2">someone&#39;s ability to get elected has to</p>

<p begin="00:34:24.609" end="00:34:28.510" style="s2">going to affect how other</p>

<p begin="00:34:30.520" end="00:34:34.389" style="s2">they can get and all those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.470" end="00:34:37.480" style="s2">things and we know that we don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.389" end="00:34:39.280" style="s2">educated citizenry and so you have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.480" end="00:34:41.530" style="s2">situation where people are going to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.280" end="00:34:43.270" style="s2">elected proportional to really the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.530" end="00:34:45.639" style="s2">incentives of the system more than</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.270" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">anything else and because people can say</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.639" end="00:34:48.490" style="s2">stuff that isn&#39;t true and people still</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:50.379" style="s2">believe it and they can do Russell</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.490" end="00:34:52.329" style="s2">conjugations to give people the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.379" end="00:34:54.310" style="s2">sense of things and appeal to emotional</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.329" end="00:34:56.260" style="s2">triggers and in-group defection dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.310" end="00:34:58.089" style="s2">and stuff like that so let&#39;s say that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.260" end="00:35:00.339" style="s2">try to make a law then of course</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.089" end="00:35:01.810" style="s2">everyone who has financial interest that</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.339" end="00:35:03.220" style="s2">would be damaged by that law supports</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.810" end="00:35:05.020" style="s2">the other candidate so then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.220" end="00:35:07.060" style="s2">do something like campaign finance</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.020" end="00:35:09.609" style="s2">reform but who is gonna bring the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.060" end="00:35:11.380" style="s2">campaign finance reform through this</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.609" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">isn&#39;t of being one of the key things is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.380" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">that the lobbyists are paid for by</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:16.869" style="s2">somebody the people who are working to</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:19.300" style="s2">change the laws continuously are paid</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.869" end="00:35:21.550" style="s2">for by somebody and whoever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.300" end="00:35:23.680" style="s2">would the ability to get money to</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.550" end="00:35:26.140" style="s2">someone who is campaigning also is very</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:28.150" style="s2">easy to hide through offshore banking</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.140" end="00:35:29.829" style="s2">and through third party entities and</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.150" end="00:35:31.480" style="s2">think tanks and whatever so because we</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.829" end="00:35:33.230" style="s2">don&#39;t have something like perfected</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.480" end="00:35:35.720" style="s2">transparent accounting if</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.230" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">tried to bind incentive using law</p>

<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:45.080" style="s2">that law has more resources than those</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.080" end="00:35:50.180" style="s2">up basically winning and the gist there</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.060" end="00:35:53.210" style="s2">is that economics is deeper than law is</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.180" end="00:35:55.340" style="s2">in the stack of power and so you can use</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.210" end="00:35:58.070" style="s2">law to bind economics to a limited</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.340" end="00:36:00.410" style="s2">degree but let&#39;s say again the company a</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.070" end="00:36:02.060" style="s2">country tries to put some law forth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.410" end="00:36:03.859" style="s2">particularly bad for a multinational</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.060" end="00:36:05.210" style="s2">company the multinational company says</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.859" end="00:36:06.619" style="s2">I&#39;ll move headquarters to another</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.210" end="00:36:08.510" style="s2">country that doesn&#39;t do that I&#39;ll give</p>

<p begin="00:36:08.510" end="00:36:11.690" style="s2">we will you know support whoever is</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.280" end="00:36:13.460" style="s2">campaigning against you and we&#39;ll put a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.690" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2"> ton of lobbyists on changing the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.460" end="00:36:17.900" style="s2">law this is all the critique of public</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:19.970" style="s2">choice theory is that the incentive of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.900" end="00:36:22.220" style="s2">the agents in the system doesn&#39;t align</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.970" end="00:36:24.530" style="s2">with the well-being of the whole and the</p>

<p begin="00:36:37.369" end="00:36:43.100" style="s2">whole because of the misalignment in</p>

<p begin="00:37:01.160" end="00:37:05.810" style="s2">and talked about in a very</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.410" end="00:37:07.940" style="s2">underappreciated book by Mansur Olson</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.470" end="00:37:13.070" style="s2">haven&#39;t I would strongly recommend it</p>

<p begin="00:37:20.000" end="00:37:24.500" style="s2">that strong small groups that have a</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.000" end="00:37:33.190" style="s2">of skin in the game and it you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.609" end="00:37:36.859" style="s2">a pretty strong critique and it does</p>

<p begin="00:37:43.009" end="00:37:48.109" style="s2">coordinate better than larger groups and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.869" end="00:37:49.369" style="s2">this is why if I had two groups two</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.109" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">countries say they had an equal number</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:54.619" style="s2">dollars to begin with and one of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.999" end="00:37:56.539" style="s2">tried to create a law that bound</p>

<p begin="00:38:07.519" end="00:38:11.150" style="s2">because if you end up getting a</p>

<p begin="00:38:11.150" end="00:38:14.779" style="s2">three guys own almost everything and</p>

<p begin="00:38:20.599" end="00:38:24.440" style="s2">other at least so far and I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.700" end="00:38:26.420" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting possibility to</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.440" end="00:38:28.369" style="s2">think about what comes next you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.420" end="00:38:30.440" style="s2">really all these are coordination and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.369" end="00:38:33.769" style="s2">signaling problems right and we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.440" end="00:38:36.140" style="s2">operating on a single relatively low</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.769" end="00:38:38.420" style="s2">dimensional signaling and coordination</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.140" end="00:38:40.339" style="s2">system that has given rise to the system</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.420" end="00:38:43.220" style="s2">that we have today what I often call the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.339" end="00:38:45.079" style="s2">money on money return signal right molds</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.220" end="00:38:46.759" style="s2">our world so presumably if we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.079" end="00:38:49.160" style="s2">get past this we have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.759" end="00:38:51.529" style="s2">multi-dimensional signaling and</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.160" end="00:38:53.720" style="s2">multi-dimensional coordination this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.529" end="00:38:56.539" style="s2">exactly the centre of what I&#39;m focused</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.720" end="00:38:58.749" style="s2">on is that the problem is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.539" end="00:39:01.420" style="s2">the inability to coordinate between</p>

<p begin="00:39:01.420" end="00:39:05.599" style="s2">intrinsically has Delta&#39;s right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.980" end="00:39:07.160" style="s2">a what&#39;s best for me in the current</p>

<p begin="00:39:10.190" end="00:39:13.970" style="s2">and best for the comments even though it</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.900" end="00:39:15.829" style="s2">would be over the long term over the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.970" end="00:39:18.619" style="s2">short term it doesn&#39;t seem to be and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.829" end="00:39:20.960" style="s2">everyone is doing utility maximization</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.619" end="00:39:23.690" style="s2">functions but with again unlike</p>

<p begin="00:39:32.660" end="00:39:36.369" style="s2">actually very important point if I have</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.690" end="00:39:38.710" style="s2">true information about the nature of</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.350" end="00:42:03.940" style="s2">right let&#39;s stipulate now that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.600" end="00:42:06.130" style="s2">no way out within the present game what</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.940" end="00:42:08.350" style="s2">do you suggest we do next</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.130" end="00:42:11.370" style="s2">okay so I would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.350" end="00:42:14.380" style="s2">consideration that rival risk games are</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.370" end="00:42:16.630" style="s2">necessarily causing harm to some other</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.380" end="00:42:18.880" style="s2">agent or to the Commons but that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.630" end="00:42:21.310" style="s2">they are multiplied by the leverage of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.880" end="00:42:23.140" style="s2">technology that that harm becomes larger</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.310" end="00:42:25.330" style="s2">than the ecosystem can handle if we take</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.140" end="00:42:26.830" style="s2">that as one generator function of X risk</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.330" end="00:42:29.020" style="s2">we know we have to have a situation that</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.830" end="00:42:31.000" style="s2">creates an anti rival risk basis for</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.020" end="00:42:32.800" style="s2">coordination that is necessary but not</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.000" end="00:42:35.380" style="s2">sufficient there are a couple other</p>

<p begin="00:42:35.380" end="00:42:39.940" style="s2">also have to address because we can show</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.960" end="00:42:41.830" style="s2">that all of the catastrophic risk this</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.940" end="00:42:44.200" style="s2">would take longer to do than we have but</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.830" end="00:42:46.510" style="s2">we can show that all the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.200" end="00:42:47.740" style="s2">degradation issues pollution issues dead</p>

<p begin="00:43:03.250" end="00:43:07.930" style="s2">all the things that would cause collapse</p>

<p begin="00:43:07.930" end="00:43:11.980" style="s2">of those have a few generator functions</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.420" end="00:43:14.020" style="s2">in common and we could actually do a</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.980" end="00:43:16.300" style="s2">construction where we put forward these</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.020" end="00:43:18.280" style="s2">three generator functions and prove that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.300" end="00:43:20.950" style="s2">set is actually some some t&#39;v that there</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.280" end="00:43:22.810" style="s2">are no risks that are not a result of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.950" end="00:43:25.450" style="s2">those things so then coming up with a</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.810" end="00:43:27.160" style="s2">solution to those things is solving for</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.450" end="00:43:29.080" style="s2">the class of what creates all of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.160" end="00:43:31.540" style="s2">rather than instances that becomes the</p>

<p begin="00:44:00.940" end="00:44:06.280" style="s2">humans take the antifragility of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.370" end="00:44:08.050" style="s2">natural world and turn it into fragile</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.280" end="00:44:09.760" style="s2">stuff we turn it into simple and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.050" end="00:44:11.560" style="s2">complicated stuff so we turn a tree</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.760" end="00:44:13.660" style="s2">that&#39;s anti fragile and complex into a</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.560" end="00:44:15.760" style="s2">2x4 that is simple and then a house that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.660" end="00:44:17.680" style="s2">is complicated but both fragile but we</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.760" end="00:44:19.810" style="s2">don&#39;t stop at a certain place we</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.680" end="00:44:22.060" style="s2">basically have complicated systems</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.810" end="00:44:23.740" style="s2">subsume the complex system so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.060" end="00:44:26.530" style="s2">creating an increasingly higher</p>

<p begin="00:44:26.530" end="00:44:29.770" style="s2">we&#39;re then trying to run exponentially</p>

<p begin="00:44:34.060" end="00:44:37.780" style="s2">said in the collapse of complex</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.380" end="00:44:39.670" style="s2">societies which is the relationship</p>

<p begin="00:44:39.670" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">as we continue to grow the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.100" end="00:44:46.750" style="s2">complicatedness of the scenario ends up</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">breaking down and so it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.750" end="00:44:50.260" style="s2">know humans only know how to build</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:52.120" style="s2">complicated stuff we don&#39;t actually know</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.260" end="00:44:53.620" style="s2">how to build complex stuff and we also</p>

<p begin="00:44:53.620" end="00:44:56.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was saying whenever</p>

<p begin="00:44:56.200" end="00:44:59.920" style="s2">just exploit more stuff so this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.270" end="00:45:02.950" style="s2">another kind of generator function is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.920" end="00:45:05.620" style="s2">we both have to learn how to build stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.950" end="00:45:08.050" style="s2">that is either anti fragile itself or in</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.620" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">a fundamentally different kind of well</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.050" end="00:45:11.500" style="s2">to some degree we have to build stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:14.470" style="s2">that&#39;s more anti fragile and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.500" end="00:45:16.840" style="s2">not exploit all exploitable areas and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.470" end="00:45:18.820" style="s2">this is really different than everything</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.840" end="00:45:21.460" style="s2">we have ever done this is kind of one</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.820" end="00:45:22.630" style="s2">way of speaking about it the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.460" end="00:45:24.940" style="s2">that we can say is a generator function</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.630" end="00:45:27.550" style="s2">of X risk is that it&#39;s much easier to</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.550" end="00:45:32.020" style="s2">stuff just from a kind of entropy or</p>

<p begin="00:45:43.720" end="00:45:49.210" style="s2">that the way humans solve problems tends</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.570" end="00:45:50.990" style="s2">to create worse problems so whether</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.210" end="00:45:53.840" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about us coming up with a</p>

<p begin="00:46:05.030" end="00:46:08.869" style="s2">than the problem was but the solution</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.830" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">typically is to solve a very narrowly</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.869" end="00:46:13.430" style="s2">defined problem so we&#39;re defining a</p>

<p begin="00:46:20.119" end="00:46:24.140" style="s2">larger than the original thing so the</p>

<p begin="00:46:24.140" end="00:46:28.369" style="s2">but ended up causing desertification and</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.450" end="00:47:00.020" style="s2">problem in a narrow way but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.310" end="00:47:01.430" style="s2">actually not the problem right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.020" end="00:47:03.619" style="s2">little part of it and this is the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.430" end="00:47:06.320" style="s2">with biotech right it which is I can say</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.619" end="00:47:08.150" style="s2">the problem is one biometric that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:47:08.150" end="00:47:11.240" style="s2">and I can give something that lowers</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.500" end="00:47:12.440" style="s2">that but it might also do a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.240" end="00:47:14.420" style="s2">other things that are negative which are</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.440" end="00:47:16.100" style="s2">the side effects of that thing in the</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.100" end="00:47:19.940" style="s2">approach is not a really good approach</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.750" end="00:47:22.570" style="s2">to medicine and so to formalize this</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.940" end="00:47:25.190" style="s2">even further what we can say is that the</p>

<p begin="00:47:36.080" end="00:47:40.670" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just orders of magnitude we</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.330" end="00:47:44.180" style="s2">can say that the safety analysis is</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.670" end="00:47:45.830" style="s2">gonna end up being np-hard relative to</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.180" end="00:47:47.180" style="s2">the work that it takes to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.830" end="00:47:49.490" style="s2">the tech being expressible as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.180" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">polynomial yes that&#39;s absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.490" end="00:47:53.990" style="s2">one of the things I&#39;ve learned in my 17</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:55.790" style="s2">years of rolling around in complex</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.990" end="00:47:58.010" style="s2">system Sciences the truth of the matter</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.790" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">is the ability to project the future</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.010" end="00:48:01.490" style="s2">evolution of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:03.829" style="s2">complex system is way less than most</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.490" end="00:48:06.200" style="s2">people think if only for the very simple</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.829" end="00:48:08.509" style="s2">reason of dependency on initial</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.200" end="00:48:11.079" style="s2">conditions we know from the very simple</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.509" end="00:48:13.279" style="s2">Lorenz Ian strange attractors that</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.079" end="00:48:15.410" style="s2">surprisingly simple systems are</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.279" end="00:48:17.240" style="s2">effectively impossible to predict</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.410" end="00:48:18.769" style="s2">because they&#39;re highly dependent on very</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.240" end="00:48:21.019" style="s2">small differences in initial conditions</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.769" end="00:48:23.420" style="s2">and when you add into that strategic</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.019" end="00:48:25.099" style="s2">agents the problem becomes I would say</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.420" end="00:48:26.779" style="s2">effectively impossible so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.099" end="00:48:29.240" style="s2">answer that basically says don&#39;t ever do</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.779" end="00:48:31.160" style="s2">anything yet we can&#39;t do that and this</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.240" end="00:48:32.539" style="s2">is the tricky thing so this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.160" end="00:48:34.730" style="s2">why I say there&#39;s a something like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.539" end="00:48:37.339" style="s2">hard fork hypothesis which is if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.730" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">look at the history of humans the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.339" end="00:48:41.029" style="s2">recorded history that we have at least</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:43.490" style="s2">nobody would consider us very good</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.029" end="00:48:45.380" style="s2">stewards of power we&#39;ve used our power</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.490" end="00:48:47.599" style="s2">to do some lovely things and we&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.380" end="00:48:50.420" style="s2">used our power to torture and oppress</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.599" end="00:48:52.279" style="s2">and kill and destroy environments and</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.420" end="00:48:53.960" style="s2">whatever and everybody&#39;s done that and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.279" end="00:48:56.420" style="s2">the few that didn&#39;t do it got killed in</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.960" end="00:48:58.430" style="s2">war by those who did do it and so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.420" end="00:49:00.440" style="s2">say there&#39;s a Gaussian distribution on</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.430" end="00:49:02.809" style="s2">the goodness or badness of our choices</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.440" end="00:49:04.940" style="s2">the rivalry or non-rivalry of how we use</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.809" end="00:49:06.619" style="s2">our power if we have beings that are at</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.940" end="00:49:08.809" style="s2">all like the beings we have been for a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.619" end="00:49:10.430" style="s2">long time and you exponentially increase</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.809" end="00:49:12.859" style="s2">the power of those choices itself</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.430" end="00:49:14.509" style="s2">terminates so you can&#39;t get the power of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.859" end="00:49:16.130" style="s2">gods without the love and wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.509" end="00:49:18.019" style="s2">prudence of gods to guide it and have</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.130" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">that be a sustainable scenario so we</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.019" end="00:49:23.059" style="s2">actually need humans to be safer vessels</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.200" end="00:49:24.859" style="s2">for power given the amount of power that</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.059" end="00:49:26.900" style="s2">we&#39;re coming into and we have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.859" end="00:49:29.299" style="s2">how to do that and what that means is we</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.900" end="00:49:31.489" style="s2">need a different basis for human choice</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.299" end="00:49:32.960" style="s2">making than we&#39;ve ever had to have the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.489" end="00:49:34.910" style="s2">level of choice making power that</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.960" end="00:49:36.980" style="s2">exponential tech is bringing about and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.910" end="00:49:38.329" style="s2">so then we have to really get into well</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.980" end="00:49:40.220" style="s2">why is it the humans are making the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.329" end="00:49:42.410" style="s2">choices that they do and what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.220" end="00:49:44.299" style="s2">is conditioning the rival risk basis of</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.410" end="00:49:45.950" style="s2">those choices to basically have us suck</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.299" end="00:49:47.900" style="s2">with choices yes so we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.950" end="00:49:49.640" style="s2">what are some systems that we could</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.900" end="00:49:51.470" style="s2">suggest get there but I would say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.640" end="00:49:54.589" style="s2">the core of the thing that we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.470" end="00:49:56.930" style="s2">to address is how do we create a system</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.589" end="00:49:59.299" style="s2">in which any agents that are making</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.930" end="00:50:01.519" style="s2">choices are making choices that are not</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.299" end="00:50:03.739" style="s2">directly causing or indirectly causing</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.519" end="00:50:04.000" style="s2">harm to the system because that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.739" end="00:50:06.070" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.000" end="00:50:07.660" style="s2">ratcheting of others doing that and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.070" end="00:50:09.550" style="s2">leads to self-determination and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.660" end="00:50:11.770" style="s2">too powerful to do that so how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.550" end="00:50:13.930" style="s2">something like on the consideration of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.770" end="00:50:16.300" style="s2">the agents leading to any positivity of</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.930" end="00:50:18.010" style="s2">choice making sounds nice but how do we</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.300" end="00:50:19.900" style="s2">do it in a world where with the ability</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.010" end="00:50:22.330" style="s2">to project in a complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.900" end="00:50:24.970" style="s2">environment the impact of any change is</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.330" end="00:50:26.080" style="s2">well nigh impossible I would also add</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.970" end="00:50:27.460" style="s2">another thing I&#39;d love to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.080" end="00:50:29.590" style="s2">thoughts on this one of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.460" end="00:50:31.090" style="s2">know from human anthropology is in</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.590" end="00:50:34.570" style="s2">essentially every society on earth</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.090" end="00:50:37.750" style="s2">somewhere between 1/2 of 1% and 2% of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.570" end="00:50:39.640" style="s2">humans are sociopaths right and I&#39;d had</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.750" end="00:50:41.800" style="s2">in my experience as a corporate</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.640" end="00:50:44.320" style="s2">executive that that number may go up to</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.800" end="00:50:45.730" style="s2">10% or more in the c-level Suites and</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.320" end="00:50:48.010" style="s2">probably higher than that in the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.730" end="00:50:50.530" style="s2">of finance so we have this problem how</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.010" end="00:50:52.510" style="s2">do we evaluate the impact of a proposed</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.530" end="00:50:54.970" style="s2">change in a complex system which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.510" end="00:50:56.320" style="s2">inherently not very predictable a little</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.970" end="00:50:59.590" style="s2">bit predictable but we lose our ability</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.320" end="00:51:01.540" style="s2">to see quickly and that some noticeable</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.590" end="00:51:03.310" style="s2">percent of the actors you say 1% of</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.540" end="00:51:04.900" style="s2">sociopaths doesn&#39;t sound that bad that</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.310" end="00:51:07.060" style="s2">means in the United States there&#39;s 3</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.900" end="00:51:09.190" style="s2">million sociopaths right and they</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.060" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">gravitate towards power and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.190" end="00:51:12.130" style="s2">them are pretty damn good at</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:16.090" style="s2">manipulating people how do we get across</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.130" end="00:51:18.580" style="s2">those two traps yeah if I look at all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.090" end="00:51:20.230" style="s2">the cluster B personality disorders in</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.580" end="00:51:22.210" style="s2">the current DSM I would say they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.230" end="00:51:24.850" style="s2">pretty concerning so you know not just</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.210" end="00:51:27.130" style="s2">to see Apogee but narcissism and etc but</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.850" end="00:51:30.010" style="s2">the most current stats I have seen were</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.130" end="00:51:31.690" style="s2">3 to 5 percent of the general population</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.010" end="00:51:34.360" style="s2">in the developed world tests for</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.690" end="00:51:36.580" style="s2">sociopathy and 30 percent of people in</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.360" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">the c-suite of fortune 500 companies I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.580" end="00:51:41.590" style="s2">gonna share a thought on this that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:43.570" style="s2">don&#39;t have all the data to back up but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.590" end="00:51:45.850" style="s2">don&#39;t think would be hard to come up</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.570" end="00:51:48.100" style="s2">with so why do we get so much</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.850" end="00:51:50.620" style="s2">concentration of sociopathy in the top</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.100" end="00:51:52.360" style="s2">of fortune 500 companies and politics</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.620" end="00:51:54.820" style="s2">and then especially things like finance</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.360" end="00:51:57.430" style="s2">well because they&#39;re basically systems</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.820" end="00:51:59.530" style="s2">to attract reward incentivize and</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.430" end="00:52:00.140" style="s2">condition sociopathy because to get to</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.530" end="00:52:02.090" style="s2">the top</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.140" end="00:52:03.740" style="s2">the power game it&#39;s going to be people</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.090" end="00:52:05.420" style="s2">who are attracted to power and people</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.740" end="00:52:07.790" style="s2">who are good at winning a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.420" end="00:52:09.140" style="s2">win-lose games because at each step they</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.790" end="00:52:11.210" style="s2">move up the ladder they&#39;re winning</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.140" end="00:52:13.700" style="s2">against somebody else usually the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.210" end="00:52:16.100" style="s2">involving things like disinformation and</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.700" end="00:52:17.570" style="s2">defection and whatever it is and so if</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.100" end="00:52:19.220" style="s2">you think about the nature of what a</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.570" end="00:52:21.650" style="s2">government or a corporation or any</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.220" end="00:52:24.140" style="s2">top-down power system are it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.650" end="00:52:26.690" style="s2">basically a strange attractor for people</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.140" end="00:52:28.340" style="s2">who want to have power over for people</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.690" end="00:52:30.710" style="s2">who are running power dynamics and this</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.340" end="00:52:32.990" style="s2">is why you know let&#39;s try and save that</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.710" end="00:52:34.520" style="s2">I have a benevolent dictator well</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.990" end="00:52:36.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason that we don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.520" end="00:52:37.910" style="s2">sustainable benevolent dictators is</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.470" end="00:52:39.260" style="s2">because let&#39;s say I have a benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.910" end="00:52:41.270" style="s2">dictator and we can get this in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.260" end="00:52:44.690" style="s2">corporation from great founder Theory</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.270" end="00:52:46.340" style="s2">sometimes because if the founder holds</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.690" end="00:52:47.810" style="s2">the you know majority of stock in</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.340" end="00:52:49.520" style="s2">whatever but it never out lives them and</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.810" end="00:52:51.980" style="s2">usually they end up getting kicked out</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.520" end="00:52:54.230" style="s2">so let&#39;s say I have a benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.980" end="00:52:56.420" style="s2">dictator all the people who are one step</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.230" end="00:52:59.540" style="s2">under them are doing things that they</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.420" end="00:53:00.590" style="s2">require to be able to stay as a dictator</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.540" end="00:53:03.050" style="s2">because it&#39;s pretty easy to kill</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.590" end="00:53:05.180" style="s2">somebody or to oust them or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.050" end="00:53:07.190" style="s2">if I&#39;m at the top of a top-down power</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.180" end="00:53:08.990" style="s2">system I have to keep everybody under me</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.190" end="00:53:10.700" style="s2">preferring me to be above them rather</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.990" end="00:53:12.200" style="s2">than overthrow me which means that</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.700" end="00:53:13.970" style="s2">rather than do what&#39;s best for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.200" end="00:53:15.470" style="s2">I have to do what&#39;s best largely for</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.970" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">those who are right near me and they</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.470" end="00:53:18.500" style="s2">have to do that for those who are under</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:21.080" style="s2">them and that ensures a kind of power</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.500" end="00:53:22.490" style="s2">law distribution of power and again</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.080" end="00:53:23.870" style="s2">there&#39;s like a multipolar trap on</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.490" end="00:53:25.190" style="s2">corruption if anyone&#39;s willing to do a</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.870" end="00:53:27.470" style="s2">really up thing to try and</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.190" end="00:53:28.910" style="s2">overthrow me I have to be able to play</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.470" end="00:53:31.250" style="s2">at the game of up things where I</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.910" end="00:53:33.650" style="s2">get overthrown so we can see how</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.250" end="00:53:35.930" style="s2">top-down power systems are going to both</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.650" end="00:53:38.930" style="s2">attract condition reward incentivize</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.930" end="00:53:41.030" style="s2">things like sociopathy and so then we</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.930" end="00:53:42.650" style="s2">end up having a world run by sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.030" end="00:53:44.960" style="s2">which is not a good thing for anybody</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.650" end="00:53:47.360" style="s2">but now let&#39;s think about something like</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.960" end="00:53:48.890" style="s2">a tribe and I&#39;m not gonna over</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.360" end="00:53:50.630" style="s2">romanticize here I&#39;m just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.890" end="00:53:54.050" style="s2">thinking through the dynamics in a first</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.630" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">principles way if I&#39;ve got 40 50 70 up</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.050" end="00:53:57.170" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:59.630" style="s2">our number of people living in a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.170" end="00:54:01.580" style="s2">there&#39;s an extraordinarily high degree</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.630" end="00:54:03.140" style="s2">of transparency that is forced in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.580" end="00:54:03.950" style="s2">scenario everybody pretty much sees</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.140" end="00:54:05.690" style="s2">everything that&#39;s going on with</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.950" end="00:54:07.250" style="s2">everybody and everybody knows everyone</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.690" end="00:54:09.920" style="s2">everyone has fealty relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.250" end="00:54:11.570" style="s2">everybody in the tribe so sociopathy is</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.920" end="00:54:13.640" style="s2">not gonna be advantageous you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.570" end="00:54:17.330" style="s2">going to have an evolutionary niche in</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.640" end="00:54:19.880" style="s2">that environment for much in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.330" end="00:54:22.400" style="s2">conspiring and lying because it will get</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.880" end="00:54:24.860" style="s2">found out and it will get punished and</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.400" end="00:54:26.720" style="s2">so the forced transparency creates an</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.860" end="00:54:28.610" style="s2">accounting system where you don&#39;t get an</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:31.130" style="s2">evolutionary niche for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.610" end="00:54:33.020" style="s2">the other people in the system and so as</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.130" end="00:54:35.720" style="s2">soon as the system starts to get large</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.020" end="00:54:37.250" style="s2">enough then one there&#39;s anonymous people</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.720" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">so I can harm people who I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.250" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">know and care about as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:42.230" style="s2">everybody who is in the system as</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">somebody that I know and care about and</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.230" end="00:54:46.490" style="s2">two I can do stuff that people won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:47.870" style="s2">able to see they can kind of have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.490" end="00:54:50.180" style="s2">corruption of the accounting in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.870" end="00:54:53.120" style="s2">system now we get an evolutionary niche</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.180" end="00:54:55.760" style="s2">for rather than participating with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.120" end="00:54:57.410" style="s2">system doing internal defection I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.760" end="00:54:59.240" style="s2">externally defecting and leaving the</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.410" end="00:55:02.150" style="s2">system I&#39;m internally defecting and</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.240" end="00:55:03.860" style="s2">playing the system and that&#39;s what most</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.150" end="00:55:05.750" style="s2">everyone inside of a corporation or a</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.860" end="00:55:07.040" style="s2">government is optimizing what is good</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.750" end="00:55:08.660" style="s2">for them and their direct fealty</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.040" end="00:55:10.360" style="s2">relationships rather than what&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.660" end="00:55:13.310" style="s2">for the whole and nobody can tell and</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.360" end="00:55:14.870" style="s2">this is a particularly hard scenario but</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.310" end="00:55:18.140" style="s2">the reason I&#39;m saying this is because we</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.870" end="00:55:20.480" style="s2">do our social science inside of a world</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.140" end="00:55:22.430" style="s2">where these systems have become a Bic</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.480" end="00:55:24.530" style="s2">with us and then we assume that those</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.430" end="00:55:26.180" style="s2">properties where there&#39;s ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.530" end="00:55:28.130" style="s2">conditioning are intrinsic to human</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.180" end="00:55:29.690" style="s2">nature and I think we have to be very</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.130" end="00:55:31.250" style="s2">careful about that I think a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.690" end="00:55:33.350" style="s2">are not intrinsic to human nature they</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.250" end="00:55:34.700" style="s2">are a result of the ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.350" end="00:55:36.260" style="s2">conditioning and we could create</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.700" end="00:55:38.690" style="s2">conditioning environments in which</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.260" end="00:55:40.430" style="s2">things like sociopathy are just not</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.690" end="00:55:42.350" style="s2">advantageous and so they don&#39;t get up</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.430" end="00:55:44.870" style="s2">regulated the answer probably just seem</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.350" end="00:55:47.120" style="s2">to find sociopaths the varying ratios</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.870" end="00:55:49.040" style="s2">that they find them at a least half a</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.120" end="00:55:51.140" style="s2">percent ratio pretty much every place</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.040" end="00:55:53.240" style="s2">and in fact I&#39;ve thrown a challenge out</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.140" end="00:55:54.830" style="s2">some anthropologist so they&#39;ve not been</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.240" end="00:55:57.320" style="s2">able to reject it one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.830" end="00:56:00.080" style="s2">questions and anthropology is how did</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.320" end="00:56:02.390" style="s2">human society transition from chiefdoms</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.080" end="00:56:04.760" style="s2">to early States and</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.390" end="00:56:06.640" style="s2">my conjecture has been that it&#39;s based</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.760" end="00:56:09.170" style="s2">on the arrival of a sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.640" end="00:56:11.390" style="s2">charismatic sociopath and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.170" end="00:56:13.460" style="s2">story right and they&#39;ve pulled their</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.390" end="00:56:15.230" style="s2">beards and that&#39;s an interesting theory</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.460" end="00:56:16.910" style="s2">here&#39;s even some ways to measure it so I</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.230" end="00:56:18.200" style="s2">think if we&#39;re gonna design a social</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.910" end="00:56:20.869" style="s2">operating system we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.200" end="00:56:23.089" style="s2">assume some levels sociopathy and have</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.869" end="00:56:24.890" style="s2">some defense mechanisms for saying well</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.089" end="00:56:27.470" style="s2">so let&#39;s go ahead and do the analogy and</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.890" end="00:56:30.140" style="s2">say that sociopathy within a social body</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.470" end="00:56:33.019" style="s2">is like a cancer cell inside of a animal</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.950" end="00:56:55.640" style="s2">relationship now a cancer cell realizes</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.380" end="00:56:57.470" style="s2">that it can actually consume and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.640" end="00:56:59.599" style="s2">reproduce faster if it defects on the</p>

<p begin="00:56:59.599" end="00:57:03.589" style="s2">but that cancer cell is only able to</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.789" end="00:57:05.720" style="s2">affect the cells immediately around it</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.589" end="00:57:08.059" style="s2">and so then they&#39;re able to either fix</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.720" end="00:57:10.220" style="s2">the cell or kill it and limit its</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.059" end="00:57:13.160" style="s2">effective action if the cancer cell</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.220" end="00:57:14.990" style="s2">could broadcast uncle genes to all cells</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.160" end="00:57:16.819" style="s2">in the body simultaneously because it</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.990" end="00:57:18.619" style="s2">had something like technology to be able</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.819" end="00:57:20.150" style="s2">to leverage what it wanted to do we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.619" end="00:57:21.859" style="s2"> and so when we think about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.150" end="00:57:24.710" style="s2">world today and the capacity that</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.859" end="00:57:26.450" style="s2">exponential technology gives for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.710" end="00:57:29.390" style="s2">to have a much stronger coupling to the</p>

<p begin="00:57:33.170" end="00:57:36.500" style="s2">occur this is one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.789" end="00:57:38.569" style="s2">really problematic with the world today</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.500" end="00:57:41.299" style="s2">is it&#39;s even small numbers of people</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.569" end="00:57:42.710" style="s2">that become sadistic sociopathic</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.299" end="00:57:44.990" style="s2">whatever can really the whole</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.710" end="00:57:46.579" style="s2">system up and so you actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.990" end="00:57:49.549" style="s2">have something that creates</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.579" end="00:57:51.109" style="s2">antifragility for this particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.549" end="00:57:53.240" style="s2">and so we can say to have a system that</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.109" end="00:57:56.299" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have catastrophic collapses</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.240" end="00:57:58.579" style="s2">eminence it has to be able to limit this</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.299" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">and one way of doing it is the China</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.579" end="00:58:03.079" style="s2">strategy which is a bit of surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:05.220" style="s2">and anyone does anything that looks at</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.079" end="00:58:07.109" style="s2">all concerning and there</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.220" end="00:58:09.200" style="s2">hours removed from them and I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.109" end="00:58:11.580" style="s2">argue that that system will also</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.200" end="00:58:14.190" style="s2">inexorably collapse because even though</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.580" end="00:58:17.099" style="s2">it won&#39;t collapse because of multipolar</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.190" end="00:58:18.240" style="s2">traps it&#39;ll collapse because we noticed</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.099" end="00:58:20.220" style="s2">that markets are much better at</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.240" end="00:58:21.599" style="s2">innovation bottom-up processes are much</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.220" end="00:58:23.790" style="s2">better at innovation than top-down</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.599" end="00:58:26.190" style="s2">processes tend to be if you control the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.790" end="00:58:27.390" style="s2">bottom-up processes that rigorously you</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.190" end="00:58:29.130" style="s2">won&#39;t end up being able to innovate</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.390" end="00:58:30.660" style="s2">enough to keep up with changing</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.130" end="00:58:32.430" style="s2">environments and you&#39;ll fail too Red</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.660" end="00:58:34.290" style="s2">Queen dynamics that&#39;s my prediction for</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.430" end="00:58:37.170" style="s2">the China strategy but what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.290" end="00:58:39.840" style="s2">is that a tribe is actually like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.170" end="00:58:42.690" style="s2">family and a tribe or a village is</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.840" end="00:58:45.359" style="s2">actually a really good method for being</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.690" end="00:58:46.980" style="s2">able to do surveillance and I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.359" end="00:58:48.770" style="s2">very healthy rather than a up</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.980" end="00:58:50.880" style="s2">type of surveillance it&#39;s not a top-down</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.770" end="00:58:53.369" style="s2">one-to-many surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.880" end="00:58:54.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a many-to-many and where the goal</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.369" end="00:58:56.369" style="s2">does not prevent someone from doing bad</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.900" end="00:58:59.070" style="s2">things but actually caring about people</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.369" end="00:59:01.320" style="s2">and so rather than the sesame credit</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.070" end="00:59:03.180" style="s2">version or the Institute a religious</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.320" end="00:59:05.310" style="s2">idea where everyone shames everyone out</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.180" end="00:59:07.500" style="s2">of fear of God version this is a have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.310" end="00:59:09.450" style="s2">situation where no one can actually be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.500" end="00:59:10.680" style="s2">shut-in right we noticed that when</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.450" end="00:59:12.780" style="s2">somebody goes and shoots a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.680" end="00:59:14.220" style="s2">people up with ar-15 typically they</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.780" end="00:59:16.619" style="s2">weren&#39;t in interaction with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.220" end="00:59:18.930" style="s2">other humans they were able to because</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.619" end="00:59:21.000" style="s2">of modern society they were able to live</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.930" end="00:59:22.290" style="s2">for a while where afterwards and</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.000" end="00:59:23.730" style="s2">interviews their neighbors say we never</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.290" end="00:59:25.619" style="s2">saw him he was real quiet he kept to</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.730" end="00:59:27.690" style="s2">himself he never came out as we have</p>

<p begin="00:59:31.440" end="00:59:35.220" style="s2">unchecked we also can&#39;t have situations</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.570" end="00:59:37.619" style="s2">where they are interacting that they can</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.220" end="00:59:40.109" style="s2">hide the results so we need something</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.619" end="00:59:42.540" style="s2">like both real accounting of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.109" end="00:59:45.270" style="s2">happening and everyone having to</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.540" end="00:59:47.280" style="s2">interact with other people in local ways</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.270" end="00:59:48.839" style="s2">that ensure the health of people and if</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.280" end="00:59:50.760" style="s2">not actually take care of them so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.839" end="00:59:54.420" style="s2">one of the first things I can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.760" end="00:59:57.660" style="s2">is that as long as the defect on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.420" end="00:59:59.640" style="s2">whole is more advantageous just two</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.660" end="01:00:00.839" style="s2">things one is as long as the defect on</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.640" end="01:00:02.670" style="s2">the whole is more advantageous than</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.839" end="01:00:04.260" style="s2">participate with it it will happen and</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.670" end="01:00:05.760" style="s2">so you have to have the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.260" end="01:00:07.500" style="s2">accounting that keep that from occurring</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.760" end="01:00:09.180" style="s2">and the other thing is as long as</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.500" end="01:00:11.460" style="s2">individuals can</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.180" end="01:00:12.990" style="s2">become psychologically damaged and have</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.460" end="01:00:15.270" style="s2">that not be noticed and still have</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.990" end="01:00:17.099" style="s2">access to power that&#39;s also a problem so</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.270" end="01:00:20.099" style="s2">there is a process by which the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.099" end="01:00:22.559" style="s2">psychologic health of people has to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.099" end="01:00:24.630" style="s2">noticed and the process by which the</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.559" end="01:00:26.670" style="s2">social system has to be more</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.630" end="01:00:28.829" style="s2">advantageous to participate with and to</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.670" end="01:00:31.529" style="s2">defect against you have some ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.829" end="01:00:33.779" style="s2">how we might structure this sound like a</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.529" end="01:00:35.700" style="s2">cell network essentially where people</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.779" end="01:00:38.460" style="s2">are assembled at the Dunbar number or</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.700" end="01:00:40.260" style="s2">below in an intense solid way and</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.460" end="01:00:41.760" style="s2">presumably with minimal ability to</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.260" end="01:00:43.980" style="s2">migrate because we all know that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.760" end="01:00:45.480" style="s2">stranger in town is a much riskier</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.980" end="01:00:47.220" style="s2">character than the person&#39;s that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.480" end="01:00:48.420" style="s2">around for 30 years talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.220" end="01:00:51.299" style="s2">about how that might actually be</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.420" end="01:00:54.029" style="s2">accomplished I am gonna go somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.299" end="01:00:55.950" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be really bothersome I</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.029" end="01:00:57.450" style="s2">don&#39;t know of any model where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.950" end="01:00:59.700" style="s2">accomplishable as long as there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.450" end="01:01:02.609" style="s2">private property okay we certainly have</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.700" end="01:01:05.160" style="s2">alternatives such as syndicalism which</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.609" end="01:01:07.170" style="s2">is quasi private property but not in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.160" end="01:01:09.510" style="s2">same sense we have here and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.170" end="01:01:11.160" style="s2">an RG which is another similar model so</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.510" end="01:01:12.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we have to keep private</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.160" end="01:01:13.980" style="s2">property on the table so I would</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.420" end="01:01:15.270" style="s2">entertain any proposal that you think</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.980" end="01:01:18.210" style="s2">could implement this theory</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.270" end="01:01:19.770" style="s2">I think if organs believed that they</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.210" end="01:01:21.480" style="s2">could live at the expense of the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.770" end="01:01:22.859" style="s2">ones and that a famine might come so</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.480" end="01:01:23.910" style="s2">they needed to hoard resource because</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.859" end="01:01:25.230" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t be able to get it from</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.910" end="01:01:27.599" style="s2">other ones and they were actually in</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.230" end="01:01:29.220" style="s2">competition for scarce resource we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.599" end="01:01:31.799" style="s2"> right the body would break down</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.220" end="01:01:34.049" style="s2">very very quickly and so you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.799" end="01:01:35.700" style="s2">the coordination dynamics of cells or</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.049" end="01:01:36.809" style="s2">organs or tissues involving something</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.700" end="01:01:38.849" style="s2">like private property you have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.809" end="01:01:40.589" style="s2">situation where things are stored</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.849" end="01:01:42.059" style="s2">wherever they&#39;re stored the calcium</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.589" end="01:01:44.010" style="s2">stored in the bones fat cells are so</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.059" end="01:01:46.140" style="s2">really they are for the utilization by</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.010" end="01:01:48.180" style="s2">any part of the system that needs it as</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.140" end="01:01:50.339" style="s2">it&#39;s needed so you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.180" end="01:01:52.380" style="s2">situation where any cell or organ has a</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.339" end="01:01:53.760" style="s2">Delta between what&#39;s good for it and</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.380" end="01:01:55.500" style="s2">what&#39;s good for the whole cuz it depends</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.760" end="01:01:57.119" style="s2">upon the rest of the whole I do believe</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.500" end="01:01:59.640" style="s2">that we have to create a similar thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.119" end="01:02:02.099" style="s2">in the human systems and specifically my</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.640" end="01:02:03.930" style="s2">ability to increase my own private</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.099" end="01:02:07.920" style="s2">property ownership my own balance sheet</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.930" end="01:02:10.170" style="s2">increases my quality of life not only</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.920" end="01:02:12.270" style="s2">can ID couple that from you or the</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.170" end="01:02:14.130" style="s2">Commons I can ante couple it I can</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.270" end="01:02:15.170" style="s2">directly the Commons or you</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.130" end="01:02:17.150" style="s2">and get ahead in that way</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.170" end="01:02:20.059" style="s2">that becomes the basis for misaligned</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.150" end="01:02:21.980" style="s2">agency and I think we assume that basis</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.059" end="01:02:23.750" style="s2">for misaligned agency kind of across the</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.980" end="01:02:25.819" style="s2">board and of course I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.750" end="01:02:27.140" style="s2">present something like Marxism but I</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.819" end="01:02:28.940" style="s2">think if you actually study something</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.140" end="01:02:30.349" style="s2">like how the resource provisioning of</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.940" end="01:02:32.299" style="s2">something like a Body Works</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.349" end="01:02:34.190" style="s2">it is obviously neither socialism or</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.299" end="01:02:36.109" style="s2">Marxism or capitalism it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.190" end="01:02:39.470" style="s2">complex system with different underlying</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.109" end="01:02:41.780" style="s2">axioms and so let&#39;s say that rather than</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.470" end="01:02:44.180" style="s2">you possess a good in order to have</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.780" end="01:02:45.410" style="s2">access to it your capacity to access it</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.180" end="01:02:47.180" style="s2">is to be a possession but your</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.410" end="01:02:49.250" style="s2">possession means that I no longer have</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.180" end="01:02:50.990" style="s2">access to it and the scarce or something</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.250" end="01:02:53.119" style="s2">is the more value we give to it so then</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.990" end="01:02:55.040" style="s2">we also have a incentive to create</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.119" end="01:02:56.859" style="s2">artificial scarcity because abundance</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.040" end="01:02:59.450" style="s2">makes the stuff not worth anything and</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.859" end="01:03:00.920" style="s2">you also then have an incentive to</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.450" end="01:03:02.569" style="s2">possess more stuff than you need</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.920" end="01:03:04.309" style="s2">especially when you get compounding</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.569" end="01:03:06.829" style="s2">returns on the stuff that you have so</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.309" end="01:03:09.020" style="s2">your incentive is to extract as much it</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.829" end="01:03:10.849" style="s2">is possible to drive scarcity in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.020" end="01:03:12.680" style="s2">system to hoard information to cause</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.849" end="01:03:15.380" style="s2">disinformation all of those things</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.680" end="01:03:17.690" style="s2">associated with the private ownership</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.380" end="01:03:19.849" style="s2">type advantages so then anything that</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.690" end="01:03:22.309" style="s2">you own that I no longer have access to</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.849" end="01:03:24.680" style="s2">I&#39;m not stoked on you owning stuff right</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.309" end="01:03:26.660" style="s2">I&#39;m actually don&#39;t want you to own the</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.680" end="01:03:28.880" style="s2">stuff I want to own the stuff if instead</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.660" end="01:03:30.829" style="s2">you have access to something that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.880" end="01:03:33.440" style="s2">part of a common wealth resource where</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.829" end="01:03:35.720" style="s2">your access doesn&#39;t remove my access via</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.440" end="01:03:37.849" style="s2">possession like shopping carts at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.720" end="01:03:40.520" style="s2">grocery store because there is enough of</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.849" end="01:03:41.780" style="s2">them for peak-time everybody doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.520" end="01:03:43.309" style="s2">have to bring their own shopping cart</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.780" end="01:03:44.780" style="s2">which would be a pain in the ass take a</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.309" end="01:03:46.280" style="s2">lot more resources and you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.780" end="01:03:47.960" style="s2">obviously be more difficult so you</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.280" end="01:03:49.730" style="s2">having access to smother me a dog</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.960" end="01:03:51.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t live in my access we start to</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.730" end="01:03:53.150" style="s2">say how many places could this be the</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.650" end="01:03:55.670" style="s2">case and we see that with the sharing</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.150" end="01:03:57.859" style="s2">economy we could replace transportation</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.670" end="01:04:00.410" style="s2">comprehensively with common wealth</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.859" end="01:04:03.650" style="s2">shared resources rather than possessed</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.410" end="01:04:05.480" style="s2">resources have just enough for peak time</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.650" end="01:04:07.190" style="s2">plus maintenance which would be</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.480" end="01:04:08.540" style="s2">something like a twentieth of the total</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.190" end="01:04:10.099" style="s2">number that are there now have them be</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.540" end="01:04:13.099" style="s2">higher quality for everybody and</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.099" end="01:04:15.290" style="s2">obviously lower accidents higher quality</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.099" end="01:04:16.430" style="s2">much lower cost to civilization because</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.290" end="01:04:18.160" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a bunch of grotesque</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.430" end="01:04:19.600" style="s2">duplication and you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.160" end="01:04:21.130" style="s2">having to go to marketing budgets and</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.600" end="01:04:22.510" style="s2">financial services it just goes to</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.130" end="01:04:24.100" style="s2">product developments you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.510" end="01:04:26.260" style="s2">designed in obsolescence you have</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.100" end="01:04:28.090" style="s2">modular upgrade ability built right into</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.260" end="01:04:30.340" style="s2">the system so you can see a much higher</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.090" end="01:04:33.070" style="s2">quality of life for everyone with a much</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.340" end="01:04:35.740" style="s2">lower load on the system and you also</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.070" end="01:04:39.010" style="s2">then remove the destructive competitive</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.740" end="01:04:41.050" style="s2">dynamics in doing so now let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.010" end="01:04:42.760" style="s2">rather than have a central company like</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.050" end="01:04:45.100" style="s2">an uber whatever mediating that which</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.760" end="01:04:47.470" style="s2">now still has a misalignment of agency</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.100" end="01:04:49.690" style="s2">we use something like a blockchain type</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.470" end="01:04:51.970" style="s2">system to be able to make that actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.690" end="01:04:53.710" style="s2">a common wealth resource where the money</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.970" end="01:04:55.480" style="s2">that would be extracted from the system</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.710" end="01:04:57.550" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be extracted from the</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.480" end="01:04:59.170" style="s2">system you start to see oh we could</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.550" end="01:05:02.080" style="s2">actually create things that are like</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.170" end="01:05:04.150" style="s2">Commonwealth access based dynamics were</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.080" end="01:05:05.920" style="s2">you having access doesn&#39;t decrease my</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.150" end="01:05:07.480" style="s2">access that it&#39;s actually better than</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.920" end="01:05:09.640" style="s2">that that would just be non rival risk</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.480" end="01:05:11.530" style="s2">rival risks is your access mediated</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.640" end="01:05:12.070" style="s2">through possession decreases mind so</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.530" end="01:05:13.750" style="s2"> you</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.070" end="01:05:15.100" style="s2">rival risk is an T coupled your</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.750" end="01:05:17.320" style="s2">well-being and mine are actually ante</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.100" end="01:05:18.550" style="s2">coupled non-rival risk is just uncoupled</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.320" end="01:05:21.490" style="s2">which all argue is not strong enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.550" end="01:05:23.440" style="s2">ante rival risk is rigorously positively</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.490" end="01:05:25.780" style="s2">coupled your well-being in mind go up</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.440" end="01:05:27.670" style="s2">and down together so in a situation</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.780" end="01:05:29.050" style="s2">where you have access to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.670" end="01:05:31.210" style="s2">transportation and access to other</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.050" end="01:05:33.310" style="s2">Commonwealth resources it actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.210" end="01:05:35.380" style="s2">increases your capacity to be creative</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.310" end="01:05:37.270" style="s2">now you can also get to the maker studio</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.380" end="01:05:39.610" style="s2">into the art studio to make art and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.270" end="01:05:41.140" style="s2">music and your motive isn&#39;t to get money</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.610" end="01:05:42.460" style="s2">by selling the art because you already</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.140" end="01:05:44.200" style="s2">have access to all the things that money</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.460" end="01:05:46.270" style="s2">would normally give you so getting stuff</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.200" end="01:05:48.190" style="s2">doesn&#39;t confer advantage and also</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.270" end="01:05:50.530" style="s2">doesn&#39;t grant identity your identity is</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.190" end="01:05:52.330" style="s2">now only gonna come not through what you</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.530" end="01:05:54.760" style="s2">get out of the system but by what you</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.330" end="01:05:57.190" style="s2">create and contribute to the system and</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.760" end="01:05:59.020" style="s2">we don&#39;t get the same zero-sum dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.190" end="01:06:00.460" style="s2">on contribution to a system through</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.020" end="01:06:02.530" style="s2">creativity as you do through getting</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.460" end="01:06:04.510" style="s2">stuff because it&#39;s much harder to</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.530" end="01:06:06.550" style="s2">compare a Salvador Dali and an MC Escher</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.510" end="01:06:08.170" style="s2">than it is dollars and dollars right the</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.550" end="01:06:11.140" style="s2">creativity ins of being non fungible</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.170" end="01:06:13.540" style="s2">yeah very high-dimensional right and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.140" end="01:06:15.850" style="s2">now if I have a system where if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.540" end="01:06:17.440" style="s2">don&#39;t get stuff you die and then if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.850" end="01:06:18.520" style="s2">don&#39;t get stuff you don&#39;t breed and then</p>

<p begin="01:06:24.340" end="01:06:27.930" style="s2">way to condition greed jealousy and</p>

<p begin="01:06:27.930" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">and then call it human nature if I have</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.670" end="01:06:32.880" style="s2">a situation in which having access to</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.200" end="01:06:34.650" style="s2">those things is a given and it&#39;s utterly</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.880" end="01:06:37.080" style="s2">boring and the only way that you</p>

<p begin="01:06:37.080" end="01:06:40.020" style="s2">through that you create</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:42.000" style="s2">but as other people are more creative</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.020" end="01:06:43.290" style="s2">the Commonwealth that you live in is</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.000" end="01:06:45.390" style="s2">better and you actually have access to</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.290" end="01:06:47.400" style="s2">more stuff then you both have a much</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.390" end="01:06:49.620" style="s2">better basis for real creativity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.400" end="01:06:51.660" style="s2">one master not two masters and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:07:15.300" end="01:07:19.710" style="s2">so there&#39;s much more to say about it but</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.640" end="01:07:22.320" style="s2">this is one example now here&#39;s the key</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.710" end="01:07:24.780" style="s2">part I will buy that this would be great</p>

<p begin="01:07:26.790" end="01:07:31.050" style="s2">up fairly naive political program</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.830" end="01:07:33.540" style="s2">several years ago and we identified</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.050" end="01:07:35.190" style="s2">maximizing self-actualization as the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.540" end="01:07:36.930" style="s2">highest goal and we weren&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.190" end="01:07:38.610" style="s2">structured as this thinking but we had</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.930" end="01:07:40.080" style="s2">some things that were moving in this</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.610" end="01:07:42.930" style="s2">direction which eventually became a</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.080" end="01:07:44.580" style="s2">concept called game B but game B at that</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.930" end="01:07:47.370" style="s2">point at least failed because it</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.580" end="01:07:49.650" style="s2">couldn&#39;t convince any of us or at least</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.370" end="01:07:52.200" style="s2">that critical mass of us that there was</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.650" end="01:07:54.690" style="s2">a reasonable way to get from here to</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.200" end="01:07:57.000" style="s2">there you know the current system is</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.690" end="01:08:00.180" style="s2">pretty damn optimized for doing what it</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.000" end="01:08:03.210" style="s2">does and how do you get people to switch</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.180" end="01:08:04.950" style="s2">from the current activities that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.210" end="01:08:07.350" style="s2">engaged in which are relatively</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.950" end="01:08:09.450" style="s2">economically optimized to this new</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.350" end="01:08:11.820" style="s2">alternative system that&#39;s the hard</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.450" end="01:08:15.210" style="s2">question and I would put to you that</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.820" end="01:08:17.190" style="s2">that transition from game a to game B is</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.210" end="01:08:20.130" style="s2">the part that so far many of us have</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.190" end="01:08:22.740" style="s2">never seen a reasonable path yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.130" end="01:08:24.570" style="s2">first I think an adequate blueprint for</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.740" end="01:08:27.050" style="s2">game B has to become clear and so we</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.570" end="01:08:29.160" style="s2">have to say that we have a set of</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.050" end="01:08:30.770" style="s2">architectures that mean necessary and</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.160" end="01:08:33.200" style="s2">sufficient criteria otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.770" end="01:08:34.609" style="s2">know how to reverse engineer then yes</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.200" end="01:08:36.770" style="s2">there has to be an implementation path</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.609" end="01:08:39.170" style="s2">first I want to say that I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.770" end="01:08:41.270" style="s2">the current system is close to</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.170" end="01:08:43.100" style="s2">economically optimized and this actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.270" end="01:08:44.630" style="s2">a very important point let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.100" end="01:08:46.520" style="s2">I&#39;m one of the richest people in the</p>

<p begin="01:09:31.339" end="01:09:36.260" style="s2">at one level they have some beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.490" end="01:09:37.609" style="s2">engineering nice integration but on the</p>

<p begin="01:09:39.350" end="01:09:43.430" style="s2">right it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.970" end="01:09:45.140" style="s2"> you and the environment and</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.430" end="01:09:47.660" style="s2">people and all kinds of things right and</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.140" end="01:09:49.790" style="s2">so then I go to things like okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.660" end="01:09:51.290" style="s2">take a look at and this might be more</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.790" end="01:09:53.240" style="s2">controversial but I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.290" end="01:09:55.040" style="s2">should be let&#39;s take a look at biotech</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.240" end="01:09:56.480" style="s2">and health research there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.040" end="01:09:57.980" style="s2">bunch of that makes sense to</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.480" end="01:09:59.990" style="s2">research where there&#39;s just no money to</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.980" end="01:10:01.910" style="s2">research it so we did so much work in</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.990" end="01:10:03.440" style="s2">small molecules because they were</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.910" end="01:10:04.910" style="s2">patentable and it was really critical</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.440" end="01:10:06.350" style="s2">they were patentable because if I had to</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.910" end="01:10:07.580" style="s2">go through FDA trials that cost a</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.350" end="01:10:09.650" style="s2">billion dollars and I needed to make</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.580" end="01:10:11.390" style="s2">that money back I had to be able to have</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.650" end="01:10:13.220" style="s2">the patent on the thing so that people</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.390" end="01:10:15.110" style="s2">couldn&#39;t undercut me just on cost of</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.220" end="01:10:16.820" style="s2">goods so we were only gonna research it</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.110" end="01:10:18.260" style="s2">was patentable the patentable stuff was</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.820" end="01:10:19.160" style="s2">only gonna be synthetic stuff because</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.260" end="01:10:20.870" style="s2">you don&#39;t want people to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.160" end="01:10:23.150" style="s2">patent intrinsic parts of humans or</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.870" end="01:10:25.040" style="s2">nature so that means that anything that</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.150" end="01:10:26.930" style="s2">was a part of how my body worked when I</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.040" end="01:10:29.060" style="s2">was healthy doesn&#39;t get to be something</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.930" end="01:10:31.250" style="s2">I do research on because I won&#39;t be able</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.060" end="01:10:33.560" style="s2">to ever make the money on that research</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.250" end="01:10:34.910" style="s2">and a synthetic molecule that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.560" end="01:10:36.110" style="s2">part of the evolutionary environment it</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.910" end="01:10:37.460" style="s2">wasn&#39;t part of how my body worked when</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.110" end="01:10:39.230" style="s2">it was healthy it doesn&#39;t even make</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.460" end="01:10:41.000" style="s2">sense that that would actually be a real</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.230" end="01:10:42.740" style="s2">cure and that&#39;s the only shortened</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.000" end="01:10:44.600" style="s2">research and of course I live in a world</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.740" end="01:10:46.490" style="s2">where war is more likely in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.600" end="01:10:47.630" style="s2">environment as factual reasons that even</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.490" end="01:10:49.580" style="s2">from the richest person in the world I</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.630" end="01:10:51.290" style="s2">can&#39;t control and where near-term</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.580" end="01:10:53.570" style="s2">catastrophic risk affects everybody</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.290" end="01:10:55.400" style="s2">including me so I think today even the</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.570" end="01:10:58.490" style="s2">wealthiest people if they are willing to</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.400" end="01:11:00.830" style="s2">think about it can recognize that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.490" end="01:11:03.020" style="s2">world that we are discussing if it was</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.830" end="01:11:05.210" style="s2">possible as comprehensively better for</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.020" end="01:11:07.700" style="s2">them and the current world is the mature</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.210" end="01:11:10.970" style="s2">I believe that but I try to sell that to</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.700" end="01:11:13.730" style="s2">Peter Thiel yeah so I won&#39;t name names</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.970" end="01:11:15.950" style="s2">but I have had conversations like this</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.730" end="01:11:17.960" style="s2">with many people of that class and both</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.950" end="01:11:20.990" style="s2">in the face of the inexorability of</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.960" end="01:11:22.760" style="s2">catastrophic risk and the incapacity for</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.990" end="01:11:23.930" style="s2">this system to produce some really</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.760" end="01:11:25.730" style="s2">important stuff and they would care</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.930" end="01:11:27.920" style="s2">about a lot of people are increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.730" end="01:11:29.270" style="s2">capable of recognizing that they just</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.920" end="01:11:31.580" style="s2">don&#39;t feel like they know how to</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.270" end="01:11:33.110" style="s2">initiate the new system either well</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.580" end="01:11:35.390" style="s2">that&#39;s good news actually and of course</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.110" end="01:11:37.700" style="s2">you know I think ecocide is at now</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.390" end="01:11:40.670" style="s2">becoming the forcing function anyone who</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.700" end="01:11:43.220" style="s2">is really thinking seriously about this</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.670" end="01:11:45.290" style="s2">stuff has to realize that we are have</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.220" end="01:11:47.390" style="s2">either already overshot or are about to</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.290" end="01:11:49.640" style="s2">overshot the carrying capacity of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.390" end="01:11:51.170" style="s2">earth and that alone ought to be a</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.640" end="01:11:53.270" style="s2">pretty strong argument to go on a</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.170" end="01:11:55.070" style="s2">different road but as we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.270" end="01:11:56.990" style="s2">before people are locked into these</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.070" end="01:11:58.640" style="s2">rival risk structures and their fractal</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.990" end="01:12:01.040" style="s2">in their nature they&#39;re a goodly amount</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.640" end="01:12:03.530" style="s2">of their self definition is about where</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.040" end="01:12:05.510" style="s2">they sit in this complex multi-leveled</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.530" end="01:12:06.530" style="s2">pecking order that&#39;s a big lift to get</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.510" end="01:12:09.230" style="s2">three hundred and thirty million</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.530" end="01:12:11.200" style="s2">Americans let alone a billion people in</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.230" end="01:12:14.120" style="s2">the world to retreat from the game a</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.200" end="01:12:16.820" style="s2">hierarchical fractal structure and move</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.120" end="01:12:18.410" style="s2">towards something else yeah everyone is</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.820" end="01:12:20.360" style="s2">stuck in a kind of multipolar trap</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.410" end="01:12:21.590" style="s2">regarding incapacity to coordinate</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.360" end="01:12:23.000" style="s2">better because let&#39;s say I got a</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.590" end="01:12:24.650" style="s2">billionaire and they say okay well that</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.000" end="01:12:26.000" style="s2">makes sense but I have no idea how to</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.650" end="01:12:27.200" style="s2">build a new system and I have no idea</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.000" end="01:12:28.850" style="s2">how to get people to participate with a</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.200" end="01:12:30.560" style="s2">new system and as long as other people</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.850" end="01:12:31.880" style="s2">are doing the thing then it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.560" end="01:12:33.290" style="s2">seem like there is any other game for me</p>

<p begin="01:12:33.290" end="01:12:36.800" style="s2">really only one game in town so if we</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.060" end="01:12:38.150" style="s2">can even take like let&#39;s say kilo and</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.800" end="01:12:39.260" style="s2">musk as an interesting example where</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.150" end="01:12:41.120" style="s2">okay argue</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.260" end="01:12:43.520" style="s2">one of the highest agency people in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.120" end="01:12:45.140" style="s2">world currently right and after he came</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.520" end="01:12:47.180" style="s2">across boström stuff he became very</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.140" end="01:12:50.150" style="s2">concerned about existential risk from</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.180" end="01:12:51.890" style="s2">AGI created open ai to work on it and</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.150" end="01:12:53.960" style="s2">then when you saw him on Joe Rogan a few</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.890" end="01:12:56.360" style="s2">months ago he was saying I spent years</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.960" end="01:12:57.980" style="s2">trying to get the world to understand</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.360" end="01:13:00.320" style="s2">this AGI issue and to create different</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.980" end="01:13:02.840" style="s2">you know safety protocols and their own</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.320" end="01:13:05.030" style="s2">incentive to be their first first mover</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.840" end="01:13:06.050" style="s2">advantage whatever is such that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.030" end="01:13:08.360" style="s2">do anything about it and I basically</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.050" end="01:13:10.610" style="s2">have kind of given up on being able to</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.360" end="01:13:12.380" style="s2">protect against this risk and all we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.610" end="01:13:14.840" style="s2">do now is just hope that the risk isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.380" end="01:13:17.210" style="s2">terrible and try to mitigate it so if</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.840" end="01:13:19.310" style="s2">even the most agentic powerful people</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.210" end="01:13:21.170" style="s2">feel like they actually don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.310" end="01:13:23.570" style="s2">capacity to do anything in the presence</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.170" end="01:13:25.160" style="s2">of you know multipolar trap type dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.570" end="01:13:27.050" style="s2">since like alright how do you do it this</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.160" end="01:13:28.970" style="s2">is the transition question well one</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.050" end="01:13:30.680" style="s2">thing is the what is the new thing you</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.970" end="01:13:32.870" style="s2">transition to has never been adequately</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.680" end="01:13:34.910" style="s2">specified so we have to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.870" end="01:13:36.380" style="s2">specify something that meets the</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.910" end="01:13:37.940" style="s2">solution to these generator functions</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.380" end="01:13:40.010" style="s2">and again that&#39;s a longer conversation</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.940" end="01:13:41.210" style="s2">but we could go further we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.010" end="01:13:43.490" style="s2">to lay some of the ground work and as</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.210" end="01:13:45.650" style="s2">far as transition goes I&#39;ll share one</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.490" end="01:13:47.030" style="s2">example of a way to think about it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.650" end="01:13:48.800" style="s2">not saying this is how it will happen</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.030" end="01:13:51.170" style="s2">I&#39;m saying this at least provides a</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.800" end="01:13:54.140" style="s2">thought experiment first there is no</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.170" end="01:13:55.790" style="s2">such thing as sustained competitive</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.140" end="01:13:57.500" style="s2">advantage from a single innovation</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.790" end="01:14:00.140" style="s2">because if I have an innovation whether</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.500" end="01:14:03.080" style="s2">it&#39;s better extraction tech or economic</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.140" end="01:14:06.020" style="s2">tech or social tech or warfare tech the</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.080" end="01:14:07.100" style="s2">moment I deploy that capacity then</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.020" end="01:14:08.990" style="s2">everyone else will see it</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.100" end="01:14:10.910" style="s2">reverse-engineer it you know make their</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.990" end="01:14:12.800" style="s2">own kind of innovations on it and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.910" end="01:14:15.500" style="s2">sustained competitive advantage is an</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.800" end="01:14:17.270" style="s2">ongoing innovation competition which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.500" end="01:14:19.100" style="s2">the up ratcheting of rival risk power</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.270" end="01:14:21.500" style="s2">which is the dynamic that we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.100" end="01:14:22.700" style="s2">at here and so there&#39;s this question</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.500" end="01:14:24.290" style="s2">most people get stuck in which is like</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.700" end="01:14:26.120" style="s2">okay well the current system seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.290" end="01:14:29.120" style="s2">self terminating so if we need to make a</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.120" end="01:14:31.220" style="s2">new system that outcompetes this system</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.120" end="01:14:32.900" style="s2">what source of asymmetric advantage over</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.220" end="01:14:34.490" style="s2">the current system is it gonna have and</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.900" end="01:14:36.080" style="s2">how does that not just is that not just</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.490" end="01:14:37.220" style="s2">part of the same power game because</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.080" end="01:14:37.880" style="s2">we&#39;re used to thinking in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.220" end="01:14:39.440" style="s2">outcompetes</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.880" end="01:14:41.780" style="s2">and so like if you think historically</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.440" end="01:14:44.300" style="s2">that there were less violent cultures</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.780" end="01:14:46.160" style="s2">that invested less in military and more</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.300" end="01:14:47.400" style="s2">in quality of life Arts and Sciences and</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.160" end="01:14:48.690" style="s2">humanity and lived in more</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.400" end="01:14:50.400" style="s2">harmony with the environment and lower</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.690" end="01:14:52.020" style="s2">population they just got slaughtered by</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.400" end="01:14:53.909" style="s2">the warring cultures and then when the</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.020" end="01:14:56.280" style="s2">warring cultures intersected the most</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.909" end="01:14:57.780" style="s2">successful one subsumed these successful</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.280" end="01:14:59.610" style="s2">parts of the other one and there was</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.780" end="01:15:01.560" style="s2">this basically distillation of</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.610" end="01:15:02.969" style="s2">successful warfare capacity then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.560" end="01:15:04.409" style="s2">like okay well we don&#39;t want to try and</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.969" end="01:15:06.810" style="s2">beat Tibet in the presence of China</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.409" end="01:15:08.400" style="s2">again or any of those scenarios so I</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.810" end="01:15:10.230" style="s2">can&#39;t make some nonviolent thing that</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.400" end="01:15:12.270" style="s2">will simply just get killed and yet</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.230" end="01:15:13.469" style="s2">whatever else I create if that isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.270" end="01:15:15.120" style="s2">case seems like it&#39;s still just</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.469" end="01:15:16.980" style="s2">competing at the game of power so</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.120" end="01:15:19.920" style="s2">what is the option so there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.980" end="01:15:22.980" style="s2">of what could provide increased capacity</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.920" end="01:15:25.199" style="s2">that can&#39;t be weaponized that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.980" end="01:15:29.280" style="s2">interesting question we could say that</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.199" end="01:15:32.280" style="s2">every technology that increases capacity</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.280" end="01:15:34.050" style="s2">can be weaponized meaning can be used by</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.280" end="01:15:36.120" style="s2">some agent to increase their capacity</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.050" end="01:15:39.150" style="s2">relative to other agents or the commons</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.120" end="01:15:40.949" style="s2">except if we had a social technology</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.150" end="01:15:42.679" style="s2">that was anti rival risks but it</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.949" end="01:15:45.540" style="s2">actually produced increased coordination</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.679" end="01:15:47.159" style="s2">capacity you actually can&#39;t weaponize it</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.540" end="01:15:50.429" style="s2">because it is the solvent for weapon</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.159" end="01:15:52.590" style="s2">ization itself it is actually the basis</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.429" end="01:15:55.290" style="s2">of how agents interact in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.590" end="01:15:58.110" style="s2">doesn&#39;t incentivize weapons and so for</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.290" end="01:16:00.000" style="s2">anyone to instantiate that thing they</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.110" end="01:16:02.340" style="s2">are actually changing the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.000" end="01:16:04.560" style="s2">their agency so in the current system</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.340" end="01:16:06.270" style="s2">again private balance sheet I&#39;m in a big</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.560" end="01:16:08.610" style="s2">corporation I&#39;m gonna do the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.270" end="01:16:10.949" style="s2">optimizes my bonus structure and my</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.610" end="01:16:12.120" style="s2">status and the company even if it</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.949" end="01:16:14.400" style="s2">other people in the company and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.120" end="01:16:15.949" style="s2">company as a whole and that might</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.400" end="01:16:18.300" style="s2">include spreading disinformation</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.949" end="01:16:20.640" style="s2">withholding information etc well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.300" end="01:16:22.409" style="s2">say I could create a situation where I</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.640" end="01:16:24.030" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get ahead of the expense of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.409" end="01:16:26.100" style="s2">whole so I had both the right kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.030" end="01:16:28.320" style="s2">transparency and accounting systems and</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.100" end="01:16:29.880" style="s2">access to Commonwealth resources where</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.320" end="01:16:31.650" style="s2">only as the Commonwealth does better do</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.880" end="01:16:34.350" style="s2">I do better and things like that then we</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.650" end="01:16:36.570" style="s2">can have a situation where no one let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.350" end="01:16:40.199" style="s2">just say if we could invent a situation</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.570" end="01:16:43.440" style="s2">in which no one had an actual incentive</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.199" end="01:16:46.540" style="s2">to spread disinformation or to hoard</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.440" end="01:16:48.040" style="s2">information if they shared true and</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.540" end="01:16:50.020" style="s2">maybe they&#39;d be wrong but they at least</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.040" end="01:16:52.240" style="s2">had the incentive for full earnestness</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.020" end="01:16:54.160" style="s2">and full transparency if you had a</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.240" end="01:16:55.240" style="s2">situation where that was the incentive</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.160" end="01:16:56.800" style="s2">you figured out how to do that and I</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.240" end="01:16:58.120" style="s2">will say there is a way to do that I</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.800" end="01:17:00.130" style="s2">believe there&#39;s a way to do that then</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.120" end="01:17:02.530" style="s2">you would get a situation where you had</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.130" end="01:17:05.980" style="s2">an information ecology that was actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.530" end="01:17:08.170" style="s2">intact at a larger scale that would lead</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.980" end="01:17:10.030" style="s2">to radically better capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.170" end="01:17:11.350" style="s2">coordinate and innovate better since</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.030" end="01:17:12.970" style="s2">making the current system has in that</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.350" end="01:17:14.830" style="s2">system as a whole would be more</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.970" end="01:17:16.630" style="s2">effective at producing all of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.830" end="01:17:18.550" style="s2">metrics that matter relative to total</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.630" end="01:17:22.150" style="s2">resource per capita than any current</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.550" end="01:17:24.220" style="s2">system would be and I only need a small</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.150" end="01:17:25.780" style="s2">number of people relatively small number</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.220" end="01:17:27.970" style="s2">of people who get that and want to</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.780" end="01:17:30.040" style="s2">instantiate it as a new full stack</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.970" end="01:17:32.140" style="s2">civilization to create a new strange</p>

<p begin="01:17:32.140" end="01:17:35.470" style="s2">anyone else looking at it says well</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.910" end="01:17:38.080" style="s2">quality of life is higher on every</p>

<p begin="01:17:38.080" end="01:17:41.050" style="s2">innovate us on a bunch of things they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:18:06.730" end="01:18:09.520" style="s2">solutions and create dependents rather</p>

<p begin="01:18:12.550" end="01:18:15.460" style="s2">actually open sourced it it&#39;s a social</p>

<p begin="01:18:15.460" end="01:18:18.310" style="s2">social technology but the social</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.110" end="01:18:20.170" style="s2">technology will fundamentally change</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.310" end="01:18:22.120" style="s2">your basis for agency if you employ it</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.170" end="01:18:23.710" style="s2">so obviously there&#39;s a million things we</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.120" end="01:18:26.020" style="s2">would need to dig into there but just</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.710" end="01:18:28.510" style="s2">the thought experiment goes fast the</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.020" end="01:18:30.310" style="s2">doctors build a new ground-up system</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.510" end="01:18:32.800" style="s2">where the new ground-up system becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.310" end="01:18:35.140" style="s2">new attractive Basin and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.800" end="01:18:37.120" style="s2">a way of thinking about that I don&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.140" end="01:18:38.739" style="s2">and if I have to shift at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.120" end="01:18:40.719" style="s2">axioms I can&#39;t retrofit</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.739" end="01:18:42.610" style="s2">current system I have to build something</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.719" end="01:18:44.860" style="s2">but if the thing that I build is</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.610" end="01:18:47.469" style="s2">fundamentally more attractive ground up</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.860" end="01:18:49.269" style="s2">then I only need fast adopters to</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.469" end="01:18:51.460" style="s2">understand it in concept to have medium</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.269" end="01:18:53.829" style="s2">adopters understand that after seeing</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.460" end="01:18:55.480" style="s2">its implementation I really like that</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.829" end="01:18:57.400" style="s2">and in fact when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.480" end="01:18:59.409" style="s2">the lack of sustainable competitive</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.400" end="01:19:01.090" style="s2">advantage from any single innovation I</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.409" end="01:19:03.820" style="s2">was thinking there&#39;s a soft counter</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.090" end="01:19:05.769" style="s2">example it&#39;s not good forever but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.820" end="01:19:08.769" style="s2">what we call network effects right and</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.769" end="01:19:10.840" style="s2">if we spend what you just said a little</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.769" end="01:19:14.019" style="s2">bit suppose we were able to create a</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.840" end="01:19:17.079" style="s2">strong beneficial Network effect to</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.019" end="01:19:19.150" style="s2">people who played by positive generative</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.079" end="01:19:21.190" style="s2">rules and did so in a way that was not</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.150" end="01:19:22.690" style="s2">directly threatening back to people who</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.190" end="01:19:25.030" style="s2">didn&#39;t play by the rules but because</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.690" end="01:19:27.280" style="s2">these people were better sense makers</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.030" end="01:19:29.829" style="s2">and choice makers they actually could</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.280" end="01:19:31.630" style="s2">create things to trade back to people</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.829" end="01:19:34.150" style="s2">who aren&#39;t on the network and of course</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.630" end="01:19:36.039" style="s2">as we know the early adopter a types</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.150" end="01:19:38.289" style="s2">will come and join the network and once</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.039" end="01:19:40.510" style="s2">it&#39;s proven to be more successful per</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.289" end="01:19:43.300" style="s2">unit of human effort at both well being</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.510" end="01:19:44.860" style="s2">but also importantly actual creation the</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.300" end="01:19:46.749" style="s2">next layer of people will come in if</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.860" end="01:19:48.460" style="s2">only to hang out with the A&#39;s and then</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.749" end="01:19:49.900" style="s2">you make that as you said I think this</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.460" end="01:19:51.460" style="s2">was the brilliant part that I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.900" end="01:19:54.639" style="s2">thought of before you make the ground</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.460" end="01:19:57.460" style="s2">rules such that anyone who becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.639" end="01:20:00.429" style="s2">member has essentially committed to a</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.460" end="01:20:02.469" style="s2">doctrine which is subversive of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.429" end="01:20:04.749" style="s2">previous paradigm but in a subtle way</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.469" end="01:20:06.849" style="s2">not directly challenging at just a value</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.749" end="01:20:08.710" style="s2">orientation and a set of rules for</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.849" end="01:20:10.690" style="s2">dealing with each other and this again</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.710" end="01:20:13.119" style="s2">gets very much back to the original</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.690" end="01:20:14.800" style="s2">naive spirit of game B where one of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.119" end="01:20:17.650" style="s2">things we did was gave ourselves all the</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.800" end="01:20:18.820" style="s2">title of peer we always said that when</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.650" end="01:20:22.059" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with another game B</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.820" end="01:20:24.159" style="s2">person you have a moral obligation of</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.059" end="01:20:26.170" style="s2">considerable power to deal with them as</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.159" end="01:20:28.090" style="s2">a peer irrespective of any other</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.170" end="01:20:30.249" style="s2">different other dimensions of power</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.090" end="01:20:32.650" style="s2">differences and so if this strong</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.249" end="01:20:34.480" style="s2">beneficial Network effect system had as</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.650" end="01:20:35.980" style="s2">an example that anyone who&#39;s a member of</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.480" end="01:20:38.650" style="s2">it is within the constraints of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.980" end="01:20:41.679" style="s2">system at least a true peer that would</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.650" end="01:20:45.369" style="s2">be very interesting yeah so I can only</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.679" end="01:20:47.679" style="s2">compete on a define and narrow metric</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.369" end="01:20:50.100" style="s2">right so if we&#39;re competing over who has</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.679" end="01:20:51.540" style="s2">more money or who&#39;s taller who can run</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.100" end="01:20:54.450" style="s2">then we can just have a straight-up</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.540" end="01:20:56.790" style="s2">competition but how do I compare dolly</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.450" end="01:20:58.740" style="s2">techer it&#39;s a up thing right you</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.790" end="01:21:00.930" style="s2">actually kind of can&#39;t do that in a</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.740" end="01:21:02.970" style="s2">meaningful way and any way that you try</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.930" end="01:21:04.830" style="s2">to say well here&#39;s a metric or some set</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.970" end="01:21:06.510" style="s2">of metrics with which to assess that</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.830" end="01:21:08.190" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually reduced the thing to</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.510" end="01:21:10.950" style="s2">something it isn&#39;t and so you could</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.190" end="01:21:12.930" style="s2">imagine that an usher and a dolly could</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.950" end="01:21:14.370" style="s2">interact with each other in a way where</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.930" end="01:21:15.840" style="s2">they both acknowledge that each other</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.370" end="01:21:17.160" style="s2">are bringing something to the world that</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.840" end="01:21:18.630" style="s2">is actually enriching the world and</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.160" end="01:21:20.040" style="s2">beautiful that they aren&#39;t bringing and</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.630" end="01:21:21.810" style="s2">that they&#39;re stoked each other doing it</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.040" end="01:21:23.130" style="s2">and there&#39;s no hierarchy intrinsic in</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.810" end="01:21:24.510" style="s2">that and I&#39;m not saying there are never</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.130" end="01:21:26.730" style="s2">healthy hierarchies but I&#39;m saying in</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.510" end="01:21:28.620" style="s2">general rather than a competition on a</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.730" end="01:21:31.100" style="s2">very narrow metric which is inherently</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.620" end="01:21:34.140" style="s2">information reduction we are seeking</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.100" end="01:21:37.160" style="s2">self-actualization of rich creativity</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.140" end="01:21:39.810" style="s2">and that intrinsically can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.160" end="01:21:42.750" style="s2">holistically compared in the same way so</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.810" end="01:21:44.670" style="s2">that&#39;s one big part of it and the other</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.750" end="01:21:46.050" style="s2">part of it is you know that you and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.670" end="01:21:47.370" style="s2">had a conversation the other day Jim</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.050" end="01:21:48.420" style="s2">where you said something and you and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.370" end="01:21:50.550" style="s2">are just getting to know each other and</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.420" end="01:21:52.830" style="s2">like I instantly loved you because of it</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.550" end="01:21:55.680" style="s2">because you said anyone who would abuse</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.830" end="01:21:56.910" style="s2">people with a below 90 IQ I want to beat</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.680" end="01:21:59.010" style="s2">their head and with a baseball bat or</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.910" end="01:22:00.150" style="s2">something like that and you wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.010" end="01:22:02.280" style="s2">see that those who have more</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.150" end="01:22:04.050" style="s2">intelligence are actually protective of</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.280" end="01:22:06.270" style="s2">rather than exploiting of those who</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.050" end="01:22:08.100" style="s2">couldn&#39;t compete so then the question is</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.270" end="01:22:10.050" style="s2">what made you that way and how do we</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.100" end="01:22:12.150" style="s2">create social systems where to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.050" end="01:22:14.190" style="s2">extent that anyone has obviously</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.150" end="01:22:17.190" style="s2">increased capacity over anyone else</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.190" end="01:22:18.930" style="s2">they&#39;re actually oriented to steward</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.190" end="01:22:20.940" style="s2">everyone else rather than use that in an</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.930" end="01:22:23.490" style="s2">exploitive way and I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.940" end="01:22:25.650" style="s2">conditional both at the level of social</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.490" end="01:22:27.840" style="s2">values and at the level of the way</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.650" end="01:22:29.820" style="s2">values are codified in a value equation</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.840" end="01:22:32.310" style="s2">ie the economics and the social system</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.820" end="01:22:34.590" style="s2">Wow I think we should wrap it here we</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.310" end="01:22:36.420" style="s2">could go on for three more hours but I</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.590" end="01:22:38.220" style="s2">like to thank you for an amazingly</p>
