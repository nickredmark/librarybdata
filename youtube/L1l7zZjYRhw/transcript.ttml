<p begin="00:00:08.309" end="00:00:13.080" style="s2">after the end of the UK general election</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.950" end="00:00:14.790" style="s2">and we don&#39;t usually cover sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.080" end="00:00:16.770" style="s2">micro of politics on the channel we</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.790" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">usually sort of look at what the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.770" end="00:00:20.189" style="s2">underlying dynamics what the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:21.510" style="s2">cultural dynamics are but we think this</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.189" end="00:00:23.850" style="s2">is a really good opportunity to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.510" end="00:00:24.900" style="s2">about some of the subjects we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.850" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">talking about on the channel cuz we</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.900" end="00:00:29.609" style="s2">think some of the frames that we&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:32.099" style="s2">can maybe hope to highlight what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.609" end="00:00:33.960" style="s2">going on for those who haven&#39;t watched</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.099" end="00:00:36.840" style="s2">or don&#39;t follow UK politics that closely</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.960" end="00:00:39.239" style="s2">I think a fair summary would be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.840" end="00:00:42.420" style="s2">conservative landslide Boris Johnson</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.239" end="00:00:45.180" style="s2">winning a big majority and the Labour</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.420" end="00:00:48.510" style="s2">Party under Jeremy Corbyn going to their</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.180" end="00:00:52.199" style="s2">lowest seat total since 1935 ley it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.510" end="00:00:54.500" style="s2">it&#39;s the pretty much the I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.199" end="00:00:57.000" style="s2">destruction of the left which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.500" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">something that&#39;s quite close to my heart</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.000" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk a bit about our own political</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:02.850" style="s2">kind of background as well in this piece</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:05.670" style="s2">but I think what&#39;s really important for</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.850" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">this it&#39;s one of the meta frames one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.670" end="00:01:08.369" style="s2">the bigger frames that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:10.460" style="s2">looking at since the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.369" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">channel since a glitch in the matrix is</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.460" end="00:01:18.030" style="s2">where progressives the Left liberals</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:20.759" style="s2">generally go wrong what the blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.030" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">are and what because of whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.759" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">on the left or the right</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">a healthy left is good for a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:28.350" style="s2">right it&#39;s good health for a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:30.810" style="s2">politics we&#39;ve been covering a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.350" end="00:01:32.549" style="s2">different threads on the channel and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.810" end="00:01:34.110" style="s2">feels like a lot of them converge in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.549" end="00:01:36.780" style="s2">moment like this so we&#39;ve been covering</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.110" end="00:01:38.939" style="s2">the ongoing polarization in culture this</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.780" end="00:01:41.250" style="s2">inability we have to talk to people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.939" end="00:01:42.899" style="s2">have differing opinions related to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.250" end="00:01:44.310" style="s2">is the fact that we are existing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.899" end="00:01:46.649" style="s2">spending a lot of our time in social</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.310" end="00:01:49.470" style="s2">media filter bubbles so we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:51.659" style="s2">over and over people who think like us I</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.470" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">noticed this on Facebook today you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.659" end="00:01:56.549" style="s2">the particular bubble I&#39;m in everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">kind of shocked because they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.549" end="00:02:01.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of a lot of very</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">progressive friends and it seemed it</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.770" end="00:02:04.979" style="s2">would seem like up until this moments</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:06.299" style="s2">like labour was just definitely going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:09.450" style="s2">whimpers we all think like this and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.299" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just yet again huge upset so as</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.450" end="00:02:13.490" style="s2">well as that there&#39;s also the the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:14.540" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.490" end="00:02:17.150" style="s2">talk about all the time on the channel</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.540" end="00:02:18.920" style="s2">and especially the shadow of progressive</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.150" end="00:02:21.500" style="s2">politics in the shadow of liberalism is</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.920" end="00:02:23.270" style="s2">that what is the what is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.500" end="00:02:25.070" style="s2">that&#39;s not being seen that is creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.270" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">these major surprises and these major</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.070" end="00:02:28.790" style="s2">upsets so we&#39;re gonna play a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:30.980" style="s2">different clips and we then a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.790" end="00:02:33.950" style="s2">different people we&#39;ve had talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.980" end="00:02:35.300" style="s2">this and then finally also what do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.950" end="00:02:36.170" style="s2">need to know about our own biology what</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.300" end="00:02:38.060" style="s2">do we need to know about our own</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.170" end="00:02:39.890" style="s2">psychology that&#39;s playing into this so</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.060" end="00:02:42.590" style="s2">something that often gets overlooked is</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.890" end="00:02:45.080" style="s2">us as individuals where are we where are</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.590" end="00:02:46.970" style="s2">we contributing to this whole Malou of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.080" end="00:02:48.380" style="s2">you know the world going upside down as</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.970" end="00:02:50.210" style="s2">a lot of people see it and what can we</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.380" end="00:02:51.800" style="s2">then do about that so yeah we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.210" end="00:02:53.060" style="s2">playing some clips from films that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.800" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">already put out and we&#39;ll be playing</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.060" end="00:02:58.280" style="s2">some new material as well something from</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:03:02.390" style="s2">Diane musho Hamilton amazing mediator a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.280" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2">Zen priest and an expert on integral</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.390" end="00:03:06.050" style="s2">theory we&#39;ve used the integral map quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.920" end="00:03:08.480" style="s2">a bit in the past and Daniel SHM Acton</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.050" end="00:03:10.460" style="s2">Berger so we had war on sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.480" end="00:03:12.620" style="s2">a couple of months ago and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.460" end="00:03:15.080" style="s2">big hit on the channel we&#39;ve got war on</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.620" end="00:03:16.550" style="s2">sense-making 2 coming out next week I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.080" end="00:03:18.830" style="s2">going to play a couple of clips from</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.550" end="00:03:21.650" style="s2">that I&#39;m gonna play one clip from him</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.830" end="00:03:23.540" style="s2">now which I think so really for me this</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.650" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">whole will talk about kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.540" end="00:03:26.600" style="s2">political biography and sort of where</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:29.660" style="s2">I&#39;m coming from in a minute but what</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.600" end="00:03:33.680" style="s2">this whole especially now this this sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.660" end="00:03:36.680" style="s2">of real and demolition of the Labour</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:39.350" style="s2">Party the left in the UK and after a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.680" end="00:03:40.760" style="s2">really toxic election campaign where so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.350" end="00:03:44.570" style="s2">many people had a sense that none of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.760" end="00:03:45.860" style="s2">parties really were fit for purpose like</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.570" end="00:03:48.740" style="s2">the politics just wasn&#39;t fit for</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.860" end="00:03:50.420" style="s2">purposes like if we accept that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.740" end="00:03:52.280" style="s2">world is changing massively and changing</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.420" end="00:03:54.230" style="s2">quickly and that we need some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.280" end="00:03:55.430" style="s2">new synthesis which is what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.230" end="00:03:57.230" style="s2">talking about on the channel a lot that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.430" end="00:03:59.980" style="s2">what would a new synthesis look like and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.230" end="00:04:02.750" style="s2">I think a new synthesis would involve</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.980" end="00:04:05.900" style="s2">probably going beyond sort of fairly</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.750" end="00:04:08.840" style="s2">outdated concepts of left and right what</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.900" end="00:04:10.850" style="s2">the integral worldview has called a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.840" end="00:04:12.860" style="s2">integral position what does a place</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.850" end="00:04:14.690" style="s2">beyond the polarization look like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.860" end="00:04:17.030" style="s2">going to explore that a bit and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.690" end="00:04:19.640" style="s2">it&#39;s also like deeply intertwined in</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.030" end="00:04:22.250" style="s2">thinking for ourselves and moving beyond</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.640" end="00:04:23.690" style="s2">groupthink and tribalism and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.250" end="00:04:25.070" style="s2">to play Daniels clip around that cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.690" end="00:04:26.870" style="s2">think it speaks to it perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.070" end="00:04:29.300" style="s2">we were talking earlier about Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.870" end="00:04:31.690" style="s2">in the way that echo chamber type</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.300" end="00:04:34.640" style="s2">phenomena just built into algorithms can</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.690" end="00:04:36.710" style="s2">let alone the social tribal type</p>

<p begin="00:04:39.220" end="00:04:42.980" style="s2">people think that most everyone believes</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.630" end="00:04:45.860" style="s2">kind of the way they do because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.980" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">what they&#39;re seeing except those bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.860" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">guys over there that are far that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:53.750" style="s2">far enough away that they only get the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:56.600" style="s2">caricature eyes version of them the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.750" end="00:04:59.780" style="s2">essential thing to good sense making is</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.600" end="00:05:03.080" style="s2">a commitment to earnestness like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.780" end="00:05:06.380" style="s2">sincere profound commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.080" end="00:05:09.560" style="s2">earnestness in our sense making which</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.380" end="00:05:15.290" style="s2">means that the enemy of that is bias of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.560" end="00:05:19.190" style="s2">any kind and which means vested</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.290" end="00:05:21.110" style="s2">interests of any kind and so the desire</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.190" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">to fit in my group is a source of bias</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.110" end="00:05:24.470" style="s2">in vested interest because my group</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:26.390" style="s2">might have things wrong or be missing</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.470" end="00:05:27.680" style="s2">stuff so another concept but I find</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.390" end="00:05:30.290" style="s2">really useful from Daniel schmock</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.680" end="00:05:32.150" style="s2">hamburger is the process whereby we</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.290" end="00:05:34.130" style="s2">outsource our sense making and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.150" end="00:05:35.810" style="s2">that&#39;s something I&#39;ve seen quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.130" end="00:05:37.580" style="s2">of in this particular election because</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.810" end="00:05:39.290" style="s2">to stay completely up to date with</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.580" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">everything that&#39;s going on requires</p>

<p begin="00:05:42.710" end="00:05:47.570" style="s2">think that level of self responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:49.730" style="s2">is part of that new political or social</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.990" end="00:11:22.400" style="s2">to kind of look at that and see why has</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.580" end="00:11:24.560" style="s2">that happened so I&#39;ve been on quite a</p>

<p begin="00:11:24.560" end="00:11:30.350" style="s2">my friends in that I started fairly</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.930" end="00:11:39.020" style="s2">anarchist ideas and started moving</p>

<p begin="00:11:39.020" end="00:11:44.090" style="s2">difficult to define is it left or right</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.000" end="00:11:46.790" style="s2">for example I I really value individual</p>

<p begin="00:11:54.980" end="00:11:59.240" style="s2">days like today when when a lot of my</p>

<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:52.059" style="s2">ethnocentric it is tribal and identity</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.850" end="00:18:54.639" style="s2">politics lends itself to tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.059" end="00:18:57.580" style="s2">because what you&#39;re emphasizing is your</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.000" end="00:19:11.860" style="s2">differences there are you also talk</p>

<p begin="00:19:20.940" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">your tribe and how it&#39;s different from</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.130" end="00:19:29.010" style="s2">all the other tribes and is there some</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.070" end="00:22:58.700" style="s2">differently there&#39;s just one point</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.570" end="00:23:00.230" style="s2">around one idea from integral studies I</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.700" end="00:23:01.670" style="s2">think it&#39;s also quite useful to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.230" end="00:23:03.950" style="s2">to this conversation which is a pre</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.670" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">trans fallacy so to take your point</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.950" end="00:23:09.050" style="s2">before about something like immigration</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:11.750" style="s2">right so from a level of development</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.050" end="00:23:15.020" style="s2">which cares about me my family my tribe</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.750" end="00:23:16.550" style="s2">say like read in that model the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.020" end="00:23:19.040" style="s2">natural response might be close the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.550" end="00:23:21.980" style="s2">borders it&#39;s just us we&#39;re gonna isolate</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.040" end="00:23:24.620" style="s2">and then Green might have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.980" end="00:23:26.090" style="s2">perspective of no let&#39;s let everyone in</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.620" end="00:23:27.860" style="s2">what is the nation anyway let&#39;s play</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.090" end="00:23:30.950" style="s2">with this let&#39;s kind of deconstruct that</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.860" end="00:23:33.680" style="s2">which is also a natural stage and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.950" end="00:23:34.370" style="s2">the next level up is the more nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.680" end="00:23:36.740" style="s2">level where it goes</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.370" end="00:23:38.540" style="s2">hang on maybe we should have some</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.740" end="00:23:39.980" style="s2">restrictions and maybe in this situation</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.540" end="00:23:42.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like this and other situations like</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.980" end="00:23:44.360" style="s2">that the pre trans fallacy is really</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.230" end="00:23:48.530" style="s2">useful but it points out that the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.360" end="00:23:50.060" style="s2">tends to go for example should there be</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.530" end="00:23:51.380" style="s2">in that example</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.060" end="00:23:53.240" style="s2">should there be limited immigration it</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.380" end="00:23:54.230" style="s2">goes yes from that red tribalist yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.240" end="00:23:56.540" style="s2">there should be because I wanna protect</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.230" end="00:23:59.480" style="s2">me in my family then the Green goes no</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.540" end="00:24:01.250" style="s2">and then again the more nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.480" end="00:24:04.730" style="s2">perspective might say kind of yes but</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.250" end="00:24:06.890" style="s2">also no so people confuse the two so as</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.730" end="00:24:08.300" style="s2">soon as you for example mention well</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.890" end="00:24:10.010" style="s2">actually I think sometimes immigration</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.300" end="00:24:12.200" style="s2">is like you&#39;re one of them you know so</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.010" end="00:24:13.670" style="s2">that pre trans fallacy is a really core</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.200" end="00:24:15.950" style="s2">concept I encourage it you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.670" end="00:24:17.660" style="s2">kind of a big concept to research but I</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.950" end="00:24:18.860" style="s2">find it particularly useful for</p>

<p begin="00:28:37.210" end="00:28:44.530" style="s2">the rescuer keeps the victim stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.649" end="00:28:47.490" style="s2">perpetual victimhood</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.530" end="00:28:50.530" style="s2">unable to take responsibility and</p>

<p begin="00:28:50.530" end="00:28:55.650" style="s2">the scapegoat there&#39;s also something</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.190" end="00:28:58.150" style="s2">Jonathan hike talks about which is how</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.650" end="00:29:00.340" style="s2">polarization and division has grown and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.150" end="00:29:02.080" style="s2">he looks at sort of political mapping</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.340" end="00:29:03.790" style="s2">and how they used to be an overlap we</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.080" end="00:29:05.650" style="s2">might be show this picture at least to</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.790" end="00:29:06.760" style="s2">be of an overlap between the two sides</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.650" end="00:29:11.290" style="s2">and now they&#39;re getting more and more</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.760" end="00:29:13.000" style="s2">apart and but the key part of that is is</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.290" end="00:29:14.380" style="s2">not so much that they have different</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.000" end="00:29:17.260" style="s2">views as what they think of the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.380" end="00:29:18.610" style="s2">side and how in the last 20 years and</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.260" end="00:29:20.320" style="s2">especially it seems like over the last</p>

<p begin="00:29:25.990" end="00:29:31.960" style="s2">side is evil there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.570" end="00:29:33.430" style="s2">definitively wrong with these people who</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.960" end="00:29:35.110" style="s2">are they we don&#39;t even understand</p>

<p begin="00:29:37.680" end="00:29:41.500" style="s2">where do you go when that starts</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.970" end="00:29:42.700" style="s2">becoming your kind of the way you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.500" end="00:29:44.230" style="s2">about the other side then where do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.700" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">end up you end up is in pretty nasty</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.230" end="00:29:47.200" style="s2">places pretty quickly and there&#39;s a lot</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.200" end="00:29:51.400" style="s2">getting far more concerning if we can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:26.680" style="s2">people ranting on social medium it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.250" end="00:31:29.140" style="s2">just the Tories or the opposition it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.680" end="00:31:31.660" style="s2">also now blaming the people like blaming</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.140" end="00:31:33.520" style="s2">the British people for rejecting labor</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.660" end="00:31:35.860" style="s2">like all the people are stupid the peope</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.520" end="00:31:37.450" style="s2">it&#39;s like this is this isn&#39;t incredible</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.860" end="00:31:40.510" style="s2">like the arrogance of that is incredible</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.450" end="00:31:42.580" style="s2">and also it ties into virtue signaling</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.510" end="00:31:43.510" style="s2">as well and in the piece that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.580" end="00:31:44.830" style="s2">about to release with daniel</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.510" end="00:31:47.050" style="s2">trachtenberg of the war on sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.830" end="00:31:48.760" style="s2">- he makes a really interesting little</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.050" end="00:31:52.120" style="s2">digression about virtue signaling like</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.760" end="00:31:55.090" style="s2">what virtue signaling is compared to</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.120" end="00:31:57.490" style="s2">what it and like what genuine virtue is</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.090" end="00:31:59.620" style="s2">I&#39;d like to play one way that I think of</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.490" end="00:32:03.730" style="s2">the distinction between real virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.620" end="00:32:07.240" style="s2">virtue signaling is virtue signaling is</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.730" end="00:32:09.550" style="s2">when it&#39;s clear that an enough people</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.240" end="00:32:12.400" style="s2">hold a particular trait as a virtue that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.550" end="00:32:14.170" style="s2">if I seem to have that virtue it would</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.400" end="00:32:16.150" style="s2">be good for me right the people would</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.170" end="00:32:19.180" style="s2">like me accept me agree with me buy my</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.150" end="00:32:21.640" style="s2">stuff like my ideas whatever it is so if</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.180" end="00:32:24.850" style="s2">I signal if I communicate in some way</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.640" end="00:32:27.490" style="s2">that I have that virtue it&#39;s beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.850" end="00:32:30.850" style="s2">for me in straight self-serving ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.490" end="00:32:33.850" style="s2">right so I have a reason to signal the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.850" end="00:32:40.600" style="s2">virtue beyond my authentic living of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.850" end="00:32:44.220" style="s2">a real virtue is something that is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.600" end="00:32:48.090" style="s2">I care about that I value actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.220" end="00:32:51.400" style="s2">hopefully something that is sacred to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.090" end="00:32:54.730" style="s2">that I am willing to experience personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.400" end="00:32:56.110" style="s2">sacrifice for not that my signalling of</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.730" end="00:32:58.630" style="s2">it creates personal gain but I am</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.110" end="00:33:00.280" style="s2">willing to lose personal gain in service</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.630" end="00:33:02.860" style="s2">of this because it&#39;s more important than</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.280" end="00:33:04.660" style="s2">personal gain to me so yeah hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.860" end="00:33:06.700" style="s2">for me at least this can be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.660" end="00:33:09.090" style="s2">blank slate like I&#39;ve seen so much</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.700" end="00:33:12.120" style="s2">enthusiasm and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.090" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">fashioned from a lot of my friends kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.120" end="00:33:17.820" style="s2">of energized by either Jeremy Corbyn or</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:19.260" style="s2">by kind of the Labour Party and</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.820" end="00:33:19.920" style="s2">progressive politics which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.260" end="00:33:23.310" style="s2">fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.920" end="00:33:26.280" style="s2">for me they&#39;ve been taken advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.310" end="00:33:28.350" style="s2">frankly like these are Corbin and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.280" end="00:33:31.140" style="s2">McDonnell and Mill and Andrew Murray</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.350" end="00:33:34.140" style="s2">those kind of people like the old guard</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.140" end="00:33:36.840" style="s2">of the sort of 1970s leftists have</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.140" end="00:33:40.080" style="s2">basically been the recipients of some</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.840" end="00:33:42.150" style="s2">really well-meaning and great energy</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.080" end="00:33:43.620" style="s2">that could go towards a good cause and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.150" end="00:33:46.440" style="s2">think they&#39;ve kind of taken advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.620" end="00:33:49.620" style="s2">it so I am hoping that this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.440" end="00:33:51.540" style="s2">we&#39;ll be able to all of that energy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.620" end="00:33:53.640" style="s2">all of that potential for change can now</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.540" end="00:33:55.290" style="s2">be put into something more valuable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.640" end="00:33:57.060" style="s2">and for me it&#39;s very much I like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.290" end="00:33:59.250" style="s2">idea of a blank slate because I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.060" end="00:34:01.260" style="s2">like rebel wisdom is in many ways a</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.250" end="00:34:02.910" style="s2">process of inquiry and so it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.260" end="00:34:04.770" style="s2">don&#39;t know where to go next I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.910" end="00:34:06.300" style="s2">where what all the different I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.770" end="00:34:08.400" style="s2">know what direction we need to go but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.300" end="00:34:10.410" style="s2">think we&#39;ve had a lot of people on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.400" end="00:34:12.330" style="s2">channel talking about pieces of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.410" end="00:34:14.550" style="s2">puzzle you know and so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.330" end="00:34:16.680" style="s2">and that inquiry is ongoing so my hope</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.550" end="00:34:18.720" style="s2">is that and it kind of begins with a</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.680" end="00:34:20.520" style="s2">sense of humility that we all have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.720" end="00:34:22.200" style="s2">just say okay we&#39;re not quite sure the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.520" end="00:34:23.180" style="s2">world is very different now there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.200" end="00:34:25.590" style="s2">different routes we could go in</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.180" end="00:34:28.200" style="s2">certainly my hope is that it moves</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.590" end="00:34:30.030" style="s2">towards somewhere more empathetic where</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.200" end="00:34:32.400" style="s2">we don&#39;t all have to agree but at least</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.030" end="00:34:34.050" style="s2">we can kind of create something through</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.400" end="00:34:36.990" style="s2">our disagreement instead of it just kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.050" end="00:34:38.250" style="s2">of polarizing us in little bubbles so my</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.990" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">hope is that kind of some kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.250" end="00:34:42.930" style="s2">opening up and less rigidity and an</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:45.570" style="s2">openness to different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.930" end="00:34:46.890" style="s2">there&#39;s at least part of you know what</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.570" end="00:34:49.410" style="s2">might drive us forward somewhere it</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.890" end="00:34:51.870" style="s2">decently and if you&#39;ve made it this far</p>
