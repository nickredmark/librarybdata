<p begin="00:00:03.540" end="00:00:08.519" style="s2">health history so that I can point</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.870" end="00:00:11.219" style="s2">people to here when they have questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.519" end="00:00:14.040" style="s2">as opposed to having to keep explaining</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.219" end="00:00:17.550" style="s2">it again and again which just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.040" end="00:00:19.560" style="s2">adds to the symptoms keep talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.550" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">the symptoms add symptoms is this weird</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.560" end="00:00:23.820" style="s2">like a negative affirmation it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:25.590" style="s2">worse when the positive ones can&#39;t undo</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.820" end="00:00:28.500" style="s2">it like I can&#39;t just pretend I&#39;m not in</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.590" end="00:00:31.140" style="s2">pain or have energy because my brain</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.500" end="00:00:32.430" style="s2">cause on that like it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.140" end="00:00:33.690" style="s2">that&#39;s not true either so like the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.430" end="00:00:35.149" style="s2">positive ones don&#39;t work and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.690" end="00:00:38.690" style="s2">negative ones just lead to this like</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.149" end="00:00:42.540" style="s2">negative positive feedback loop so</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.690" end="00:00:45.050" style="s2">that&#39;s what this video is in 2005 I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.540" end="00:00:48.059" style="s2">twenty five third year of University</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.050" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">experiencing double vision demanded that</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.059" end="00:00:54.600" style="s2">they give me a cat scan after weeks of</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:56.190" style="s2">them thinking it was anything else and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.600" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">it turns out I had brain tumors I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">right and I had an acoustic neuroma</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.760" end="00:01:04.500" style="s2">which is a tumor on your hearing nerve</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">and because you can only have one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.500" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">those and they open me up a 93 it turns</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:10.830" style="s2">out it was also to mention Ouma&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:13.350" style="s2">just so happened they were on my Harry</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.830" end="00:01:17.250" style="s2">nervin to my hearing canal so they had</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.350" end="00:01:19.170" style="s2">to disconnect the nerve in order to kill</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.250" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">part of the tumor and so I&#39;m definitely</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.170" end="00:01:22.049" style="s2">or as well as I guess there&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:24.869" style="s2">balance on that side but that&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.049" end="00:01:26.790" style="s2">more easy to cope with as well as after</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.869" end="00:01:28.470" style="s2">the surgery I was taken off with</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.790" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">steroids in the hospital and then sent</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.470" end="00:01:32.310" style="s2">home which is what they do medically for</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">like the population but for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.310" end="00:01:37.409" style="s2">personally as an individual with my own</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:40.829" style="s2">chemistry bad decision and my brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.409" end="00:01:43.350" style="s2">swells I started acting like a toddler I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.829" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">was really sensitive to lightning sounds</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.350" end="00:01:48.390" style="s2">and the proper temper tantrum I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:49.860" style="s2">going to my GP which was just down the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.390" end="00:01:51.659" style="s2">street and she didn&#39;t know that that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.860" end="00:01:53.700" style="s2">a problem went to call my my surgeon my</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.659" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">roommate didn&#39;t know my friends ended up</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.700" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">coming over to check on me and saving my</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">life and remitting you the hospital but</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:01.530" style="s2">the process to recover for my first</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:03.870" style="s2">brain surgery was a lot longer due to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.530" end="00:02:06.760" style="s2">the fact that I had that brains</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.870" end="00:02:08.350" style="s2">lasted for days either way I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.760" end="00:02:10.630" style="s2">be definitely air but that brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.350" end="00:02:12.610" style="s2">swelling is what could&#39;ve slashed</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.630" end="00:02:15.970" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have happened if things had</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.610" end="00:02:19.000" style="s2">been done right for me personally and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.970" end="00:02:23.590" style="s2">I was 25 I continued on with my life I</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.000" end="00:02:28.300" style="s2">got my university degree I dated like I</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.590" end="00:02:30.310" style="s2">probably separate them I started working</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.300" end="00:02:34.150" style="s2">for Vancity which is a local credit</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.310" end="00:02:35.650" style="s2">union all pro credit union cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.150" end="00:02:39.370" style="s2">we get into all these things in other</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.650" end="00:02:40.840" style="s2">videos and then went on to do to work</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.370" end="00:02:41.890" style="s2">for the government well I was working</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.840" end="00:02:44.020" style="s2">for the government it&#39;s not she that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.890" end="00:02:45.940" style="s2">in ten it&#39;s five years later I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.020" end="00:02:49.810" style="s2">getting a yearly MRI to see about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.940" end="00:02:51.730" style="s2">the tumor that I had in 2005 and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.810" end="00:02:53.860" style="s2">turns out it was still growing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.730" end="00:02:55.510" style="s2">surgery was not successful and so my</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.860" end="00:02:57.550" style="s2">options were either to continually have</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.510" end="00:02:59.170" style="s2">surgery every ten years or to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.550" end="00:03:00.670" style="s2">radiation and I didn&#39;t want to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.170" end="00:03:02.980" style="s2">radiation but it felt like it was my</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.670" end="00:03:04.300" style="s2">only option into Western medicine and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.980" end="00:03:07.239" style="s2">I did I opted for a course of radiation</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.300" end="00:03:10.570" style="s2">and well undergoing it I was exhausted</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.239" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">and nauseous and I&#39;m sensitive to light</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.570" end="00:03:15.459" style="s2">and sound like before but now this added</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:17.049" style="s2">fun of smell as well as his brain fog</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.459" end="00:03:19.090" style="s2">and all the things you undergo during</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.049" end="00:03:21.610" style="s2">radiation are supposed to go away after</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.090" end="00:03:25.320" style="s2">and mine didn&#39;t and that&#39;s not normal</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.610" end="00:03:29.890" style="s2">but I&#39;m not normal I figured out so</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.320" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">dealing with this what they track</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.890" end="00:03:33.010" style="s2">everything up to mental still like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:34.330" style="s2">PTSD you&#39;re under stress and you go back</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.010" end="00:03:35.769" style="s2">to where like your brain was under</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.330" end="00:03:38.019" style="s2">radiation but whatever it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.769" end="00:03:40.510" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens I go under stress</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.019" end="00:03:42.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s like I&#39;m back having radiation</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.510" end="00:03:43.720" style="s2">I get nauseous my brain stops working in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.760" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">fact sometimes I think I&#39;m having a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.720" end="00:03:47.380" style="s2">stroke</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:48.850" style="s2">it is dysfunctional enough and I get</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.380" end="00:03:51.220" style="s2">really sensitive to light sound and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.850" end="00:03:55.390" style="s2">smells and it&#39;s just not not the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.220" end="00:03:57.730" style="s2">greatest I went back I was still working</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.390" end="00:03:59.980" style="s2">I was experiencing depression and just</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.730" end="00:04:03.340" style="s2">sadness and feeling like crap because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.980" end="00:04:05.470" style="s2">allow radiation and also this new health</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.340" end="00:04:08.470" style="s2"> that I didn&#39;t want to have to deal</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.470" end="00:04:09.530" style="s2">with but also realizing that possibly my</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.470" end="00:04:12.440" style="s2">depression was from</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.530" end="00:04:14.240" style="s2">being a mom and not seeing that on the</p>

<p begin="00:04:25.820" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">depression and what came along with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.530" end="00:04:31.700" style="s2">depression but not all of it because I</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:34.970" style="s2">still had all of the symptoms from</p>

<p begin="00:07:52.490" end="00:07:55.040" style="s2">having this amazing conversation with my</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.780" end="00:07:56.540" style="s2">roommate and it just went downhill no</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.040" end="00:07:58.760" style="s2">spirit released that day and I did but</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.540" end="00:08:00.380" style="s2">they put gave me hysteresis at home like</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.760" end="00:08:02.240" style="s2">I&#39;m not selling oh my goodness they</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.380" end="00:08:05.360" style="s2">tapered me off over over two to three</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.240" end="00:08:06.350" style="s2">weeks and it was fine and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.360" end="00:08:07.910" style="s2">they should have happened the first time</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.350" end="00:08:10.370" style="s2">but they didn&#39;t know and I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.910" end="00:08:12.200" style="s2">to fight for it so it&#39;s that I&#39;ve learnt</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.370" end="00:08:13.790" style="s2">a lot from having this condition and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.200" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">also that because none of that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.790" end="00:08:17.870" style="s2">associate I had to find new answers and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:19.550" style="s2">fighting for a diagnosis of chronic</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.870" end="00:08:22.040" style="s2">fatigue because I could see my mom have</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.550" end="00:08:24.170" style="s2">it and I had every symptom and you guys</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.040" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">have tested everything and it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.170" end="00:08:27.230" style="s2">cuz they&#39;re like well you have brain</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:29.510" style="s2">tumors like you you</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.230" end="00:08:30.980" style="s2">explosion you can&#39;t be exploded I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.510" end="00:08:33.650" style="s2">yes but does that explain what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.980" end="00:08:35.060" style="s2">experiencing no then if this if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.650" end="00:08:37.669" style="s2">can&#39;t explain it and we&#39;ve looked at</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.060" end="00:08:39.710" style="s2">everything then this is what explains it</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.669" end="00:08:42.590" style="s2">so I&#39;ve chronic fatigue which means that</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.710" end="00:08:45.020" style="s2">I can&#39;t recover from being exhausted</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.590" end="00:08:46.580" style="s2">like other people so I can&#39;t just let</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.020" end="00:08:50.120" style="s2">myself get exhausted and then sleep and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.580" end="00:08:52.670" style="s2">recover I have to it takes me a long</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.120" end="00:08:54.290" style="s2">time to recover it takes me like days</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.670" end="00:08:56.480" style="s2">and days and days to recover from having</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.290" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">a bad day it takes me if I don&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.480" end="00:09:01.880" style="s2">and I push through it it takes weeks or</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:03.230" style="s2">months to recover and that&#39;s what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.880" end="00:09:04.370" style="s2">learned when you get chronic fatigue is</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.230" end="00:09:07.100" style="s2">that you have to listen to your</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.370" end="00:09:09.560" style="s2">boundaries and you have to listen to and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.100" end="00:09:10.970" style="s2">for me personally all of my conditions</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.560" end="00:09:13.160" style="s2">are made worse under stress so I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.970" end="00:09:14.600" style="s2">to de-stress my life which both involves</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.160" end="00:09:17.090" style="s2">taking away things that are stressful</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.600" end="00:09:18.410" style="s2">and stop letting myself getting stressed</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.090" end="00:09:19.520" style="s2">about stuff I don&#39;t need to get stressed</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.410" end="00:09:21.410" style="s2">by and then some things are just</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.520" end="00:09:23.870" style="s2">stressful and I have to deal with them</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.410" end="00:09:25.490" style="s2">and every time I have a new episode it</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.870" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">puts me that little further down because</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.490" end="00:09:28.970" style="s2">it&#39;s like I crashed and I am the energy</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:31.070" style="s2">to kind of come back up but my new</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.970" end="00:09:32.510" style="s2">plateau is less than and less than I</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.070" end="00:09:34.130" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to say that cuz I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.510" end="00:09:35.990" style="s2">the negative part makes it less than and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.130" end="00:09:38.780" style="s2">less than and it&#39;s all of that together</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.990" end="00:09:41.870" style="s2">this chaotic chaotic mess but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.780" end="00:09:44.950" style="s2">big piece of I don&#39;t know if I got into</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.870" end="00:09:47.150" style="s2">like the more more recent like I have</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.950" end="00:09:48.980" style="s2">chronic fatigue I have fibromyalgia</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.390" end="00:09:53.780" style="s2">something that I&#39;d say it&#39;s not Vermeil</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.980" end="00:09:55.040" style="s2">Jen is in the same category as but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.780" end="00:09:56.839" style="s2">don&#39;t know were the diagnosis name which</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.040" end="00:09:58.370" style="s2">is weird so remember Serena Elia which</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.839" end="00:10:00.140" style="s2">is something I got diagnosed with that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.370" end="00:10:04.100" style="s2">didn&#39;t have and they got undiagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.140" end="00:10:07.330" style="s2">with participatory or a whole thing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.100" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna get into another video about</p>

<p begin="00:10:27.260" end="00:10:33.980" style="s2">the line explaining it more succinctly</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.960" end="00:10:36.730" style="s2">that is edited but today it&#39;s live today</p>
