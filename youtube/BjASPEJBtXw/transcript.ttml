<p begin="00:00:00.579" end="00:00:03.839" style="s2">What would you say to a young man looking to get into politics</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.550" end="00:00:11.550" style="s2">Well, the first thing I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.190" end="00:00:19.619" style="s2">It&#39;s a mistake to be fatally cynical about politics because</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.250" end="00:00:25.170" style="s2">For all the reasons there are to be fatally cynical about politics</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.170" end="00:00:28.559" style="s2">There&#39;s much more reason to be fatally cynical about</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.869" end="00:00:33.988" style="s2">the conflict that will inevitably arise or the tyranny that will inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.420" end="00:00:38.700" style="s2">Manifest itself if we can&#39;t handle the dirty business of politics</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.340" end="00:00:43.469" style="s2">properly. So I would say don&#39;t become prematurely</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.860" end="00:00:48.059" style="s2">Cynical about it. The next thing I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.629" end="00:00:51.629" style="s2">What do you know? And</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.600" end="00:00:54.750" style="s2">That&#39;s a very important question. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.449" end="00:00:58.049" style="s2">What does it mean to get into politics?</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.629" end="00:01:03.689" style="s2">Exactly. Does that mean to seek political power? Does that mean to seek power?</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.299" end="00:01:09.239" style="s2">Well, first of all, you shouldn&#39;t be seeking power. You should be seeking competence and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.820" end="00:01:16.229" style="s2">In order to seek competence, you better know something and so I would say well if you want to get into politics</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.780" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">You want to educate yourself, you know and all the things you need to be educated in life</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:26.879" style="s2">I mean you can you can start to play the political game to familiarize yourself with it</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:29.460" style="s2">But you know, it&#39;s not such a bad idea - to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.710" end="00:01:33.029" style="s2">well it&#39;s not such a bad idea to have a job for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.369" end="00:01:38.819" style="s2">Maybe a career and maybe it&#39;s not such a bad idea to have a successful career, upon,</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.189" end="00:01:44.069" style="s2">In which people are dependent on you so that you start to understand what that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.259" end="00:01:49.859" style="s2">Responsibility means. And then maybe it&#39;s not such a bad idea to have a family because like human beings</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.500" end="00:01:57.989" style="s2">mature adult human beings tend to have families and and they transform when they have families because when you have children then someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.300" end="00:02:05.460" style="s2">becomes more important to you than you are and you&#39;re not mature until that happens. And so that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.460" end="00:02:11.820" style="s2">And so I would say well make sure that if you&#39;re looking to get into politics that you&#39;re even more looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.040" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">To get into competence and that you learned</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">everything you can possibly learn that would make you a reasonably wise person by the time you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.100" end="00:02:28.320" style="s2">Attain whatever level of power you might, authority, let&#39;s say, you might be seeking. I mean I&#39;ve seen lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.940" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">Get into politics</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:37.800" style="s2">You know this happens with ideologues and the way they ratchet themselves up the power hierarchy is by being more effective</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.300" end="00:02:44.500" style="s2">Avatars... puppets of their particular ideological stance and there&#39;s nothing about that, that&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.500" end="00:02:50.739" style="s2">There&#39;s nothing in it that will solve any real-world problems and there&#39;s plenty that will make it much worse</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.739" end="00:02:55.869" style="s2">And so if that&#39;s what getting into politics means I would say stay the hell away from it</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.870" end="00:02:59.379" style="s2">but if it&#39;s a matter of developing your character and then at some point</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.900" end="00:03:01.549" style="s2">adopting your social</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.549" end="00:03:09.429" style="s2">responsibility then go for it and more power to you because we need people who are competent and careful and truthful and courageous and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.950" end="00:03:14.229" style="s2">forthright to enter the political sphere so that things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.750" end="00:03:21.009" style="s2">degenerate and hopefully have some chance of at least maintaining themselves or improving so</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.040" end="00:03:24.579" style="s2">There&#39;s...you need... What do you need to know?</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.579" end="00:03:30.608" style="s2">You need to be really good at at least one thing you have to specialize. You have to be a great networker</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.609" end="00:03:34.719" style="s2">You have to know a lot of people. You have to be honest. You have to be articulate.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:40.629" style="s2">you have to... You have to have a vision. You have to have a strategy. You have to know something about history and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.760" end="00:03:43.870" style="s2">Economics and politics. It&#39;d be good to know something about science</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.419" end="00:03:45.099" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.099" end="00:03:50.649" style="s2">you have to be a polymath of sorts before you should dare to enter that realm with any degree of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.810" end="00:03:52.180" style="s2">confidence because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.180" end="00:03:58.329" style="s2">All you are is a loose cannon and you&#39;ll come up with global proposals to improve improve the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.370" end="00:04:02.530" style="s2">You know by waving your wand that will do nothing but make everything worse</p>
