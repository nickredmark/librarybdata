<p begin="00:00:07.540" end="00:00:14.809" style="s2">so I&#39;ve got my list of questions for you</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.039" end="00:00:17.450" style="s2">cuz you read the feet Erica trilogy now</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.809" end="00:00:19.910" style="s2">no I&#39;m almost finished for Cherica</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.450" end="00:00:21.950" style="s2">trilogy yeah okay come on the last book</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.910" end="00:00:24.290" style="s2">I&#39;m halfway through the last book so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.950" end="00:00:27.110" style="s2">should explain first what that is is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.290" end="00:00:30.170" style="s2">re-released version of the first three</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.110" end="00:00:32.989" style="s2">books battle Thunderbird and John said</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.170" end="00:00:35.359" style="s2">it lists the three books are the medic</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.989" end="00:00:37.640" style="s2">rats which was released in the year 2000</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.359" end="00:00:39.829" style="s2">regional Swedish version came out two</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.640" end="00:00:41.210" style="s2">years later in English and then the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.829" end="00:00:43.129" style="s2">global Empire that came out three years</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.210" end="00:00:46.100" style="s2">later and then the body machines that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.129" end="00:00:48.589" style="s2">came out six years after that so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.100" end="00:00:49.339" style="s2">three books together are meant as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.589" end="00:00:52.940" style="s2">trilogy</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.339" end="00:00:57.079" style="s2">meaning the netic rats is a book on</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.940" end="00:00:59.629" style="s2">technology and a book on the class</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.079" end="00:01:02.899" style="s2">structure or the forthcoming digital</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.629" end="00:01:04.280" style="s2">society which we now you know we see the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.899" end="00:01:08.270" style="s2">birth of that society now twenty years</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.280" end="00:01:11.170" style="s2">later so so it&#39;s essentially a Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.270" end="00:01:14.719" style="s2">analysis of our future class society</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.170" end="00:01:16.430" style="s2">built on did and then the global Empire</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.719" end="00:01:19.700" style="s2">that came out three years later is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.430" end="00:01:21.829" style="s2">book that understands the world now as</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.700" end="00:01:24.110" style="s2">imperial meaning that the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.829" end="00:01:26.750" style="s2">Protocol is in itself an imperial</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.110" end="00:01:28.369" style="s2">function meaning if we look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.750" end="00:01:30.049" style="s2">technologically rather than politically</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.369" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">it&#39;s already an empire meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.049" end="00:01:34.820" style="s2">everything else like politics art and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:37.280" style="s2">everything else we do as humans it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.820" end="00:01:40.820" style="s2">subordinated to our an empire which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.280" end="00:01:43.250" style="s2">technological it&#39;s a world empire it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.820" end="00:01:45.320" style="s2">war Olympic yeah protocol you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.250" end="00:01:47.570" style="s2">escape from you number one you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.320" end="00:01:50.390" style="s2">turn off the internet it will be on</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.570" end="00:01:52.340" style="s2">forever from now on and number two were</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.390" end="00:01:55.969" style="s2">all subordinate to it so that means even</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.340" end="00:01:58.899" style="s2">the Chinese Communist Party and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.969" end="00:02:01.880" style="s2">the American government in Washington</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.899" end="00:02:03.979" style="s2">everybody is supported to each protocol</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.880" end="00:02:06.740" style="s2">meaning it all technology will now be</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.979" end="00:02:10.129" style="s2">combined into one huge computer and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.740" end="00:02:12.530" style="s2">we human beings eight billion of us have</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.129" end="00:02:14.520" style="s2">to adjust to this phenomena so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.530" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">what&#39;s called the global Empire</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.520" end="00:02:19.110" style="s2">the third book at the bottom machines</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:23.340" style="s2">then deals with what it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.110" end="00:02:27.090" style="s2">human as a result to the other two and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.340" end="00:02:29.069" style="s2">and this book is very close related to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:31.739" style="s2">the work of Antonio Damasio in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.069" end="00:02:34.650" style="s2">and Thomas Metzinger in the early</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.739" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">noughties Portuguese and a German</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.650" end="00:02:38.700" style="s2">philosopher respectively</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:41.250" style="s2">who worked a lot on a sort of anti anti</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.700" end="00:02:43.140" style="s2">Cartesian idea what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.250" end="00:02:45.270" style="s2">and this is what the book is called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.140" end="00:02:47.700" style="s2">body machines since when ad card is</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.270" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">famous for his quote that if the human</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.700" end="00:02:51.330" style="s2">beings did not have a soul separate from</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:53.340" style="s2">the body we would be nothing the body</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.330" end="00:02:55.320" style="s2">machines yeah and we&#39;re saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.340" end="00:02:57.030" style="s2">we are these body machines you know we</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.320" end="00:02:59.910" style="s2">are his worst nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.030" end="00:03:02.610" style="s2">meaning that we are and therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.910" end="00:03:04.500" style="s2">think so you would have to you would</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.610" end="00:03:06.269" style="s2">have to look at the card and say that no</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.500" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">you&#39;re wrong mr. Descartes because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.269" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">actually the opposite way around we we</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:13.019" style="s2">only find some kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:17.310" style="s2">consciousness at best at the end of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.019" end="00:03:19.500" style="s2">process to tie together don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.310" end="00:03:22.470" style="s2">that&#39;s the only beings as prior to</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.500" end="00:03:24.900" style="s2">thinking in other words or yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.470" end="00:03:27.299" style="s2">absolutely yes there has to be a body</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.900" end="00:03:30.870" style="s2">first with a brain inside that body for</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.299" end="00:03:31.410" style="s2">this function to to be able to think at</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.870" end="00:03:33.959" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.410" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">and the thinking is a byproduct of other</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.959" end="00:03:37.140" style="s2">processes that are actually more</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:39.090" style="s2">important is that where you would call</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.140" end="00:03:45.329" style="s2">physicalism I&#39;ve been following some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.090" end="00:03:48.299" style="s2">your conversations yeah it&#39;s modest you</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.329" end="00:03:50.930" style="s2">know what kind of neutral ask to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.299" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">nature of the substance of reality so</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.930" end="00:03:55.709" style="s2">we&#39;re not saying that the the universe</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:58.170" style="s2">necessarily has to be a materialist or</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.709" end="00:04:01.109" style="s2">physical phenomenon it can be more than</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.170" end="00:04:03.450" style="s2">that but or something different but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.109" end="00:04:05.489" style="s2">universe is same and it&#39;s only one</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.450" end="00:04:06.030" style="s2">substance and that&#39;s where we agree it</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.489" end="00:04:09.150" style="s2">Spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.030" end="00:04:11.250" style="s2">and so do Damacio and so the messenger</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.150" end="00:04:13.380" style="s2">they&#39;re also stances and it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.250" end="00:04:15.510" style="s2">that any person out there who&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.380" end="00:04:18.090" style="s2">advanced neuroscientist today and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.510" end="00:04:20.190" style="s2">does philosophy turns out to be a spin</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.090" end="00:04:22.169" style="s2">assist it&#39;s it&#39;s you know spinning</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.190" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">spinning sesame is a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.169" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">fact that you understand out</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:28.120" style="s2">neuroscience works and he&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">sort of serious monist</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.120" end="00:04:32.380" style="s2">or not the first but no western monist</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:35.919" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.380" end="00:04:39.130" style="s2">you could proudly argue that the Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.919" end="00:04:41.380" style="s2">akina&#39;s bow was closed to mana so he did</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.130" end="00:04:42.880" style="s2">not like dualism at least it was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.380" end="00:04:45.250" style="s2">own place with it and it&#39;s also probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.880" end="00:04:46.540" style="s2">Thomas akina&#39;s didn&#39;t finish he he set</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.250" end="00:04:48.250" style="s2">out to do because they probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.540" end="00:04:51.250" style="s2">discovered you cannot have an afterlife</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.250" end="00:04:53.770" style="s2">and go somewhere else besides living on</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.250" end="00:04:56.830" style="s2">planet Earth you die because your body</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.770" end="00:04:58.510" style="s2">composed decompose and mertens and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.830" end="00:05:01.960" style="s2">gone without the body that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.510" end="00:05:03.550" style="s2">mined so um Thomas akina&#39;s and some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.960" end="00:05:04.600" style="s2">the Scholastic&#39;s were onto these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.550" end="00:05:07.510" style="s2">and they were uncomfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.600" end="00:05:08.229" style="s2">Christianity&#39;s adherence to play towards</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.510" end="00:05:10.180" style="s2">dualism</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.229" end="00:05:12.430" style="s2">but we know sighs the guy who really</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.180" end="00:05:14.740" style="s2">makes the radical break in the West we</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.430" end="00:05:17.800" style="s2">do an ism and he deduces Western</p>

<p begin="00:05:17.800" end="00:05:23.889" style="s2">from a materialist perspective weary us</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.490" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">later Hegel does the same thing he just</p>

<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:30.310" style="s2">perspective um meaning they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.050" end="00:05:32.380" style="s2">care none of them what the substance</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.310" end="00:05:36.190" style="s2">consists of as someone is one substance</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.380" end="00:05:38.800" style="s2">and the substance can have okay doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.190" end="00:05:45.400" style="s2">matter if it&#39;s material or spiritual the</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.400" end="00:05:48.880" style="s2">thing with emergence theory which said</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.260" end="00:05:51.610" style="s2">exist and I are working at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.880" end="00:05:54.760" style="s2">this is an area that philosophy sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.610" end="00:05:56.889" style="s2">sloppy put aside until recently and an</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.760" end="00:05:58.539" style="s2">emergency really means that for us to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.889" end="00:06:05.700" style="s2">understand the similarities between the</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.700" end="00:06:11.710" style="s2">you understand emergencies like physics</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.160" end="00:06:13.870" style="s2">and biology and the victors of emergence</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.710" end="00:06:16.510" style="s2">which is what physics developed into but</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.870" end="00:06:18.669" style="s2">all it is developed into to understand</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.669" end="00:06:22.090" style="s2">necessarily need to understand what life</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.300" end="00:06:29.470" style="s2">we just need to accept that they did</p>

<p begin="00:06:29.470" end="00:06:33.400" style="s2">axis we had the birth of physics we had</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.419" end="00:06:35.080" style="s2">the birth of biology so we can do</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.400" end="00:06:37.000" style="s2">emergence theory and discuss what an</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.080" end="00:06:38.740" style="s2">emergency&#39;s or what a Victorian</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.000" end="00:06:40.659" style="s2">emergences which is for example the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.740" end="00:06:41.930" style="s2">field of biology we can discuss that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.659" end="00:06:43.639" style="s2">without knowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.930" end="00:06:46.100" style="s2">how it all started what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.639" end="00:06:48.650" style="s2">technology as the extension of the human</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.100" end="00:06:51.770" style="s2">body changes what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.650" end="00:06:52.580" style="s2">so I think this is even more important</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.770" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">than the fact even being</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.580" end="00:06:56.750" style="s2">self-consciousness about have language</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:06:58.130" style="s2">that we have culture what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.750" end="00:06:59.990" style="s2">important with even beings what makes us</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.130" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">different they&#39;re animals is that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.990" end="00:07:03.590" style="s2">have a very advanced technological</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:07.430" style="s2">environment around us that we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.590" end="00:07:09.080" style="s2">created so we have magic first and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.430" end="00:07:11.270" style="s2">we dream about what if magic could come</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.080" end="00:07:14.330" style="s2">true and there are some people you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.270" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">cooking soups and try to conduct magic</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.330" end="00:07:18.169" style="s2">or or you know tarot cards to try to</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:19.760" style="s2">cannot magic other people but and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.169" end="00:07:21.949" style="s2">becoming engineers educate themselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.760" end="00:07:25.160" style="s2">and actually do the proper map you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.949" end="00:07:27.229" style="s2">that&#39;s called technology so um a we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.160" end="00:07:29.680" style="s2">home with technological so the proper</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.229" end="00:07:32.270" style="s2">magic is technology that&#39;s that&#39;s her</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.680" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">yesterday&#39;s magic is today&#39;s technology</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.270" end="00:07:36.020" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:39.260" style="s2">what&#39;s called clairvoyance in the past</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.020" end="00:07:40.970" style="s2">now called smartphones today bingo so so</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.260" end="00:07:43.099" style="s2">that&#39;s very important to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.970" end="00:07:46.220" style="s2">important technology is because to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.099" end="00:07:48.470" style="s2">realize the alchemists were whereas as</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.220" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">empirical as they could be at that time</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.470" end="00:07:53.510" style="s2">no yeah they were cooking little soups</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:56.120" style="s2">and things but they were at least trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.510" end="00:07:58.430" style="s2">to conduct science and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.120" end="00:08:00.949" style="s2">chemists like Isaac Newton also then</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.430" end="00:08:02.930" style="s2">became great scientists so yes we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.949" end="00:08:04.820" style="s2">alchemy to thank for a lot of great</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.930" end="00:08:06.830" style="s2">stuff that was actually done later but</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.820" end="00:08:09.979" style="s2">what&#39;s important here is the emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.830" end="00:08:12.710" style="s2">the universe is being one substance okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.979" end="00:08:14.300" style="s2">yeah that also means within that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.710" end="00:08:15.530" style="s2">substance there are not only many</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.300" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">attributes but they can also be</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.530" end="00:08:20.570" style="s2">emergences so for example out of a black</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:23.060" style="s2">hole a new universe could get</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.570" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">kick-started that&#39;s perfectly feasible</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.060" end="00:08:28.310" style="s2">in our philosophy that&#39;s emergent that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:30.770" style="s2">a new emergence in that case so the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.310" end="00:08:32.150" style="s2">big bang for that universe the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.770" end="00:08:34.159" style="s2">of that universe would be a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.150" end="00:08:36.289" style="s2">emergence so we have to have a proper</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.159" end="00:08:37.969" style="s2">emergence theory which were working on</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.289" end="00:08:40.339" style="s2">at the moment we cannot parallel</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.969" end="00:08:42.050" style="s2">universes and we can also within our</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.339" end="00:08:49.220" style="s2">current universe have sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.050" end="00:08:51.290" style="s2">drops of new new systems new laws and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.220" end="00:08:53.240" style="s2">new habits within them for example like</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.290" end="00:08:54.020" style="s2">biology is different from chemistry in</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.240" end="00:08:56.110" style="s2">chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.020" end="00:08:59.390" style="s2">physics so they&#39;re all different</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.110" end="00:09:01.220" style="s2">emergencies and that&#39;s what we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.390" end="00:09:04.520" style="s2">proper emergency were to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.220" end="00:09:06.500" style="s2">then possibly science can one day tell</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.520" end="00:09:09.440" style="s2">us how life got started and science can</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.500" end="00:09:11.270" style="s2">one day tell us how the bending up if</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.440" end="00:09:12.740" style="s2">they can do that one day at least then</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.270" end="00:09:18.260" style="s2">already here for Sophocles solve the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.740" end="00:09:20.899" style="s2">problem of what in emergences okay so</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.260" end="00:09:25.670" style="s2">the traditional like let&#39;s say critique</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.899" end="00:09:27.260" style="s2">of monism would be that you know it</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.670" end="00:09:30.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t acknowledge difference right</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.260" end="00:09:31.580" style="s2">and then the traditional critique of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.170" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">dualism would be it doesn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.580" end="00:09:40.580" style="s2">acknowledge like oneness well I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:42.500" style="s2">going over the couch I know I missed a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.580" end="00:09:44.899" style="s2">the opposite I would say the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.500" end="00:09:47.029" style="s2">monism does recognize difference because</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.899" end="00:09:49.779" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously difference you and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.029" end="00:09:51.830" style="s2">are not the same things right so</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.779" end="00:09:55.630" style="s2">modernism recognizes that there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.830" end="00:10:00.160" style="s2">opposite okay I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.630" end="00:10:03.860" style="s2">multiplicity the idea that the universe</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.160" end="00:10:05.329" style="s2">has all this manifold of things there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.860" end="00:10:06.290" style="s2">so much in the universe and there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.329" end="00:10:08.690" style="s2">much difference in universe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.290" end="00:10:11.029" style="s2">actually a result to monism no I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.690" end="00:10:12.649" style="s2">say that dualism doesn&#39;t have much in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.029" end="00:10:14.329" style="s2">defense of it when you start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.649" end="00:10:17.510" style="s2">it because the first Pro module is is</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.329" end="00:10:19.790" style="s2">that spirit and body are two different</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.510" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">substances then the question is since</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.790" end="00:10:23.420" style="s2">character body obviously are connected</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:27.459" style="s2">in human being and how the fuck should</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.420" end="00:10:30.020" style="s2">they communicate with each other grapes</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.459" end="00:10:32.390" style="s2">and then you end up with more and more</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.020" end="00:10:33.800" style="s2">substance and you&#39;re enough for this</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.390" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">idea of the soul or something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.800" end="00:10:37.520" style="s2">connects the body and the spirit or</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:39.470" style="s2">something like that I don&#39;t even think</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.520" end="00:10:41.060" style="s2">that&#39;s the case I think the card was</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.470" end="00:10:44.329" style="s2">perfectly how can we just a solar in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.060" end="00:10:45.770" style="s2">body period so but you know well you end</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.329" end="00:10:47.570" style="s2">up with the third and then you need</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.770" end="00:10:49.370" style="s2">connections between those three and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.570" end="00:10:51.140" style="s2">you end up with five substances known of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.370" end="00:10:52.940" style="s2">a sudden you&#39;ve got billions of</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.140" end="00:10:55.579" style="s2">substances that are no longer connected</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.940" end="00:10:58.579" style="s2">with one another and then problems like</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.579" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">gravity messes it up for you in for</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.579" end="00:11:03.740" style="s2">example physics because obviously</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:05.390" style="s2">biologies contained within physics so</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.740" end="00:11:07.699" style="s2">the the emergence of biology exist</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.390" end="00:11:09.829" style="s2">within physics and requires fatigue</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.699" end="00:11:12.499" style="s2">to exist without being reduced to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.829" end="00:11:13.399" style="s2">physics in repairs 4/6 accessory okay in</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.499" end="00:11:14.869" style="s2">a physical universe</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.399" end="00:11:17.629" style="s2">everything is connected with everything</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.869" end="00:11:20.899" style="s2">else more or less that means it is truly</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.629" end="00:11:22.999" style="s2">one substance and that will be you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.899" end="00:11:26.059" style="s2">the container within which all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.999" end="00:11:28.279" style="s2">different universes exist and even if we</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.059" end="00:11:30.019" style="s2">only philosophically consider that there</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.279" end="00:11:31.999" style="s2">might not be anything material that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.019" end="00:11:33.619" style="s2">connects different universes there might</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.999" end="00:11:35.119" style="s2">be such separate entities that they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.619" end="00:11:37.730" style="s2">no longer any connections with each</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.119" end="00:11:39.889" style="s2">other period okay if that would happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.730" end="00:11:41.869" style="s2">though we would still have to think of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.889" end="00:11:44.299" style="s2">it for our human little minds to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.869" end="00:11:46.100" style="s2">it we have to think of it and this</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.299" end="00:11:51.319" style="s2">illusion so dickfist and are working on</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.100" end="00:11:53.989" style="s2">here is instead of a hyperspace which</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.319" end="00:11:55.699" style="s2">physicists do which within which then</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.989" end="00:11:58.279" style="s2">the different universes would be chained</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.699" end="00:12:00.470" style="s2">so maybe think of a metaphor that has a</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.279" end="00:12:02.119" style="s2">hyperspace I mean the type of space the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.470" end="00:12:04.879" style="s2">different universes exist to have space</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.119" end="00:12:07.069" style="s2">in them so that the mistake there is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.879" end="00:12:11.859" style="s2">always think of space as primordial</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.069" end="00:12:19.149" style="s2">which it isn&#39;t so since time is primary</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.859" end="00:12:23.899" style="s2">to space in process which is what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.149" end="00:12:25.639" style="s2">have to widen that means that we would</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.899" end="00:12:27.259" style="s2">have to think again as we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.639" end="00:12:29.929" style="s2">before you and I that means we require</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.259" end="00:12:33.679" style="s2">an extra dimensional time compared to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.929" end="00:12:37.100" style="s2">the classical physics tutorial this time</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.679" end="00:12:40.129" style="s2">axis yeah we call that hyper time you</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.100" end="00:12:42.559" style="s2">could also call hyper time a meta vector</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.129" end="00:12:45.470" style="s2">or a hyper vector if you like so this</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.559" end="00:12:49.089" style="s2">would be the container of all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.470" end="00:12:51.559" style="s2">everything else that exists so um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.089" end="00:12:53.539" style="s2">but you know we don&#39;t know that yet and</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.559" end="00:12:55.249" style="s2">we probably don&#39;t know it until we</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.539" end="00:12:56.899" style="s2">figure out what the big bang with yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.249" end="00:12:58.910" style="s2">because even if the big bang is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.899" end="00:13:01.549" style="s2">emergence it could be an emergency</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.910" end="00:13:03.619" style="s2">some other kind of container lord I know</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.549" end="00:13:05.660" style="s2">that physics uh split itself into two</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.619" end="00:13:07.489" style="s2">over the last 100 years it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.660" end="00:13:09.109" style="s2">separated between quantum physics and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.489" end="00:13:10.999" style="s2">classical physics meaning classical</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.109" end="00:13:12.589" style="s2">physics is a separate emergence from</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.999" end="00:13:15.529" style="s2">quantum physics because they offer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.589" end="00:13:17.720" style="s2">differently so um we don&#39;t know that yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.529" end="00:13:21.049" style="s2">but it&#39;s an interesting idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.720" end="00:13:24.589" style="s2">and we could at least but if time is</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.049" end="00:13:25.879" style="s2">relative even if it even if all&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.589" end="00:13:27.409" style="s2">arrow time it only goes from one</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.879" end="00:13:30.409" style="s2">direction still relative in the current</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.409" end="00:13:33.049" style="s2">universe so we for example have to sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.409" end="00:13:35.829" style="s2">of split time so but we can have a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.049" end="00:13:38.749" style="s2">term you can have a sort of continue on</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.829" end="00:13:40.850" style="s2">two weights we then add the current</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.749" end="00:13:43.970" style="s2">universe which turns out to look very</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.850" end="00:13:46.850" style="s2">discrete meaning the current universe is</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.970" end="00:13:51.439" style="s2">actually on or off it&#39;s zeroes and ones</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.850" end="00:13:53.480" style="s2">in a very fundamental sense well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.439" end="00:13:56.419" style="s2">interesting with the analogy of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.480" end="00:13:57.829" style="s2">computers well in this case it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.419" end="00:13:59.899" style="s2">that physics has discovered this</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.829" end="00:14:02.569" style="s2">independently of computers so just look</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.899" end="00:14:05.899" style="s2">similar to computers but it means for</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.569" end="00:14:09.230" style="s2">example because we&#39;re raising computing</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.899" end="00:14:10.939" style="s2">I mean we might go into quantum</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.230" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">computers eventually but that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.939" end="00:14:18.259" style="s2">actually irrelevant the universal</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:21.139" style="s2">physics so what we&#39;ve discovered is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.259" end="00:14:23.299" style="s2">if the universe and its expansion is an</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.139" end="00:14:25.039" style="s2">expanse of information because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.299" end="00:14:28.609" style="s2">information cannot be destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.039" end="00:14:29.359" style="s2">meaning that information runs opposite</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.609" end="00:14:31.669" style="s2">to entropy</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.359" end="00:14:34.579" style="s2">meaning that if entropy is expanding the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.669" end="00:14:37.600" style="s2">information extraction mean that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.579" end="00:14:40.489" style="s2">the universe expands okay that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.600" end="00:14:45.289" style="s2">contrary theory to entropy well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.489" end="00:14:47.539" style="s2">like we have a it&#39;s not discussed a the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.289" end="00:14:50.269" style="s2">idea of something opposite of entropy</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.539" end="00:14:52.039" style="s2">called centra P in our degrees Sophie</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.269" end="00:14:54.559" style="s2">Meghan through P another term that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.039" end="00:14:56.980" style="s2">being used for that it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.559" end="00:14:59.929" style="s2">maybe negentropy or Center P our</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.980" end="00:15:01.999" style="s2">information because lunar Siskin is</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.929" end="00:15:04.489" style="s2">proven information is not destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.999" end="00:15:06.470" style="s2">inside my house okay I see if</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.489" end="00:15:09.499" style="s2">information is never destroyed it</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.470" end="00:15:10.699" style="s2">there were in the universe and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.499" end="00:15:13.730" style="s2">obviously been a lot of information</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.699" end="00:15:16.549" style="s2">produced over the past thirty one eight</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.730" end="00:15:19.069" style="s2">billion years that means that expansion</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.549" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">of the universe is probably referred</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.069" end="00:15:22.609" style="s2">back to the fact that the amount</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.649" style="s2">information of universe is expanding all</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.609" end="00:15:27.009" style="s2">the time mm-hmm so what does this have</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.649" end="00:15:31.429" style="s2">to do with human intelligence because</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.009" end="00:15:32.250" style="s2">you know we&#39;re getting stupider on some</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.429" end="00:15:34.380" style="s2">level right</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.250" end="00:15:36.690" style="s2">but then we at the same time we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.380" end="00:15:41.130" style="s2">this huge access to to information right</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.690" end="00:15:42.510" style="s2">that&#39;s the simultaneously so but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.130" end="00:15:44.700" style="s2">very to do with us and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.510" end="00:15:46.380" style="s2">problem with the word intelligence we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.700" end="00:15:49.080" style="s2">using the intelligence not both about</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.380" end="00:15:51.180" style="s2">machines and about human beings ok and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.080" end="00:15:53.400" style="s2">turns out that we talk of machine</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.180" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">intelligence it does have a relation to</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.400" end="00:15:58.410" style="s2">physics so we talk about quantum</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:15:59.550" style="s2">information theory and expansion of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.410" end="00:16:01.980" style="s2">universe is the result of</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.550" end="00:16:04.680" style="s2">ever-increasing information that&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.980" end="00:16:06.660" style="s2">destroyed ok if you talk about that way</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.680" end="00:16:08.670" style="s2">that means the universe operates somehow</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.660" end="00:16:11.430" style="s2">pretty similar to a huge computer that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.670" end="00:16:14.340" style="s2">cannot be destroyed so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.430" end="00:16:16.920" style="s2">interesting analogy to the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.340" end="00:16:18.330" style="s2">internet saves absolutely everything and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.920" end="00:16:20.730" style="s2">we&#39;re creating with the Internet&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.330" end="00:16:22.440" style="s2">new digital memory the records at least</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.730" end="00:16:24.300" style="s2">all human history meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.440" end="00:16:25.530" style="s2">everything that you and I and all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.300" end="00:16:27.090" style="s2">other 8 billion people on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.530" end="00:16:29.640" style="s2">are doing at the moment is now being</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.090" end="00:16:31.560" style="s2">recorded and almost all of its saved for</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.640" end="00:16:33.060" style="s2">the future to be processed later</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.560" end="00:16:35.070" style="s2">hopefully by some kind of machine</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.060" end="00:16:36.870" style="s2">intelligence to do whatever it wants</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.070" end="00:16:39.060" style="s2">with it that means that there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.870" end="00:16:42.660" style="s2">similarities here between the machines</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.060" end="00:16:44.520" style="s2">and the universe we must be careful not</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.660" end="00:16:46.770" style="s2">to take the analogy too far because</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.520" end="00:16:49.350" style="s2">whenever we had a major technological</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.770" end="00:16:51.390" style="s2">breakthrough in the past philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.350" end="00:16:54.000" style="s2">and physicists were all to happen to</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.390" end="00:16:55.650" style="s2">jump onto it and then make it analogous</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.000" end="00:16:58.530" style="s2">to the way they looked at the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.650" end="00:17:01.290" style="s2">through physics and biology so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.530" end="00:17:06.810" style="s2">could be a dangerous path to take what</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.290" end="00:17:09.810" style="s2">we do know is that physics as we know it</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.810" end="00:17:12.870" style="s2">operates discretely on the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.810" end="00:17:14.910" style="s2">fundamental level meaning that spins go</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.870" end="00:17:16.350" style="s2">into on or off and then they freeze in</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.910" end="00:17:20.010" style="s2">time basically and they become history</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.350" end="00:17:21.780" style="s2">so if that&#39;s the way the universe</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.010" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">operates it has similarities with</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.780" end="00:17:25.530" style="s2">computers it doesn&#39;t mean that we can go</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:28.020" style="s2">into black hole and access that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.530" end="00:17:30.150" style="s2">information and somehow I know what went</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.020" end="00:17:32.220" style="s2">on before or in the past because the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.150" end="00:17:34.500" style="s2">we store information on computers even</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.220" end="00:17:36.300" style="s2">if it is zeros and ones and we&#39;ll freeze</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.500" end="00:17:37.710" style="s2">them in time it&#39;s still radically</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.300" end="00:17:39.570" style="s2">different from the way nature houndred</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.710" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">stuff so there are now that you see here</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.570" end="00:17:43.740" style="s2">that are very very careful we should be</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:45.179" style="s2">careful with because</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.740" end="00:17:46.740" style="s2">that makes me think of sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.179" end="00:17:50.190" style="s2">question I had for you you know about</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.740" end="00:17:51.809" style="s2">your title machine machine man and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.190" end="00:17:54.840" style="s2">know in McGilchrist books he&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.809" end="00:17:57.779" style="s2">saying that the metaphor of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.840" end="00:18:00.590" style="s2">as machinist is not accurate he hates</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.779" end="00:18:03.450" style="s2">that but actually I think he&#39;s wrong so</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.590" end="00:18:05.580" style="s2">you might not like that but what I do</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.450" end="00:18:08.279" style="s2">say though is that instead of going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.580" end="00:18:10.110" style="s2">physics define an analogy for</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.279" end="00:18:11.789" style="s2">understanding human intelligence if</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.110" end="00:18:13.080" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to make a separation between</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.789" end="00:18:13.620" style="s2">machine intelligence and human</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.080" end="00:18:15.679" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.620" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">number one machine intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.679" end="00:18:18.779" style="s2">technological and it&#39;s a similarities</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:21.330" style="s2">with fish sticks</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.779" end="00:18:22.980" style="s2">so there is promise difference between</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.330" end="00:18:24.659" style="s2">human intelligence and machine</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.980" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">intelligence number one is that machine</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.659" end="00:18:30.210" style="s2">intelligence is built on physics so we</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:32.100" style="s2">can take analogies from unsaved for</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.210" end="00:18:33.779" style="s2">example quantum information theory and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.100" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">maybe apply them to create a great</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.779" end="00:18:37.769" style="s2">narrative about machine intelligence but</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:40.529" style="s2">human eternity is biological hey</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.769" end="00:18:42.450" style="s2">biological beings and biology operates</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.529" end="00:18:46.440" style="s2">very differently from physics it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.450" end="00:18:48.889" style="s2">different emergence so that means the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.440" end="00:18:52.919" style="s2">analogies here between man and machine</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.889" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">are really bad so you&#39;re saying we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.919" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">to you have to look at those two</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:18:59.659" style="s2">emergence within their own rules and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">domains and not mix the two or</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.659" end="00:19:06.600" style="s2">absolutely so we can compare human</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:08.940" style="s2">beings to animals and even to plants and</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.600" end="00:19:11.279" style="s2">we can look at seven genes for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.940" end="00:19:13.110" style="s2">and study sentence which is way more</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.279" end="00:19:16.830" style="s2">important than the overrated concept of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.110" end="00:19:18.149" style="s2">consciousness and because consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.830" end="00:19:20.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist until you have itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.149" end="00:19:22.529" style="s2">really self consciousness is nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.120" end="00:19:24.090" style="s2">sentence that has sense result but</p>

<p begin="00:19:24.090" end="00:19:27.720" style="s2">something we share with animals and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.380" end="00:19:30.059" style="s2">plants and we can then understand how</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.720" end="00:19:32.669" style="s2">plants and especially animals store</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.059" end="00:19:34.320" style="s2">information and create memory over time</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.669" end="00:19:36.510" style="s2">actually you cannot even have life</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.320" end="00:19:38.570" style="s2">without memory because in your life form</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.510" end="00:19:41.669" style="s2">in its separation from the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.570" end="00:19:44.460" style="s2">creating a membrane and and within the</p>

<p begin="00:19:44.460" end="00:19:51.450" style="s2">it learns from me out so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.510" end="00:19:53.340" style="s2">repeat its mistakes and this business</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.450" end="00:19:56.220" style="s2">storage this is memory this is how</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.340" end="00:19:56.700" style="s2">biology memorizes so it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.220" end="00:19:58.290" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.700" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">from say the memory of the computer</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.290" end="00:20:03.240" style="s2">which is Cirrus once and electricity and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.720" end="00:20:05.700" style="s2">hopefully can be frozen in time forever</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.240" end="00:20:08.460" style="s2">and then turned on again by adding it</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.700" end="00:20:10.500" style="s2">okay one more thing I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.460" end="00:20:14.940" style="s2">clarify is what what&#39;s your problem with</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.500" end="00:20:17.820" style="s2">the idea of consciousness it&#39;s overrated</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.940" end="00:20:20.820" style="s2">it&#39;s extremely overrated that&#39;s the very</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.820" end="00:20:22.620" style="s2">narcissistic it&#39;s the word is used</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.820" end="00:20:24.090" style="s2">constantly everywhere especially by</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.620" end="00:20:26.370" style="s2">people who consider themselves to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.090" end="00:20:27.750" style="s2">spiritual and and the sitting meditating</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.370" end="00:20:29.640" style="s2">she&#39;s some kind of pure consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.750" end="00:20:31.350" style="s2">and they talk about ego death and all</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.640" end="00:20:33.990" style="s2">kinds of silly things I&#39;m getting less</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.350" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">and less interested in that shit it just</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.990" end="00:20:39.300" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take us anywhere and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:41.610" style="s2">usually just babble so a brain is</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.300" end="00:20:43.410" style="s2">interesting there&#39;s science it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.610" end="00:20:46.160" style="s2">interesting how the brain operates is</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.410" end="00:20:49.260" style="s2">incredibly interesting but you know any</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.160" end="00:20:52.290" style="s2">feeling you have any emotion any</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.260" end="00:20:54.030" style="s2">thoughts you have has a materialistic a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.290" end="00:20:56.040" style="s2">version of itself that goes on</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.030" end="00:20:59.660" style="s2">simultaneously why that happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.040" end="00:21:02.970" style="s2">so a you know the brain operates</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.660" end="00:21:05.070" style="s2">constantly and and whatever we perceive</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.970" end="00:21:09.180" style="s2">and what we process and what you think</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.070" end="00:21:10.650" style="s2">then has its own person of it in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.180" end="00:21:12.690" style="s2">brain otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.650" end="00:21:14.970" style="s2">changing at all in our perception or or</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.690" end="00:21:16.800" style="s2">in our understanding of the world so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.970" end="00:21:19.250" style="s2">definitely moodily that phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.800" end="00:21:21.960" style="s2">has to be understood that&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.250" end="00:21:24.300" style="s2">physicalist biological phenomenon you</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.960" end="00:21:25.530" style="s2">know we are we are animals what we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.300" end="00:21:27.330" style="s2">as human beings is that we&#39;ve added</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.530" end="00:21:28.740" style="s2">language on top of that and we are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.330" end="00:21:30.810" style="s2">narratives to come with that which on</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.740" end="00:21:34.140" style="s2">top of that those narratives obviously</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.810" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">that was special you know with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.140" end="00:21:38.160" style="s2">center the universe and that we tiny</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:39.870" style="s2">little gods that mummy loves us so much</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.160" end="00:21:41.640" style="s2">there were special and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.870" end="00:21:44.010" style="s2">things and that nurtures certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.640" end="00:21:47.070" style="s2">narcissism which is it creates an</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.010" end="00:21:49.680" style="s2">Anthropocene worldview which means what</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.070" end="00:21:51.810" style="s2">put us at the center of things and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.680" end="00:21:53.850" style="s2">we think that because narrative this</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.810" end="00:21:55.770" style="s2">narrative must be created somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.850" end="00:21:57.630" style="s2">we think that narratives created through</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.770" end="00:21:59.910" style="s2">our consciousness and we in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.630" end="00:22:02.580" style="s2">constants we find a sense of self now</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.910" end="00:22:04.740" style="s2">okay if you talk about a sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.580" end="00:22:06.660" style="s2">you better talk about the sentence of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.740" end="00:22:08.790" style="s2">self and try to understand how that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.660" end="00:22:10.530" style="s2">operates we can do that a laboratory we</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.790" end="00:22:15.870" style="s2">know scientists and we then just</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.530" end="00:22:17.820" style="s2">the self is the last thing that happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.870" end="00:22:19.470" style="s2">in a process for example of</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.820" end="00:22:21.990" style="s2">problem-solving and decision-making is</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.470" end="00:22:24.330" style="s2">involved and is usually we have to leave</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.990" end="00:22:26.490" style="s2">a problem aside to be solved later or we</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.330" end="00:22:28.410" style="s2">are sure about having solve we have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.490" end="00:22:29.910" style="s2">move on to the next problem now we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.410" end="00:22:30.510" style="s2">a heightened sense of self that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.910" end="00:22:32.700" style="s2">exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.510" end="00:22:33.990" style="s2">the sense of self is often really</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.700" end="00:22:37.380" style="s2">heightened when we&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.990" end="00:22:39.390" style="s2">very very risky and very dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.380" end="00:22:42.180" style="s2">we have incredibly alert of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.390" end="00:22:44.460" style="s2">surroundings that that&#39;s the adrenaline</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.180" end="00:22:46.620" style="s2">adrenaline is pumping in we feel very</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.460" end="00:22:48.720" style="s2">much alive but that&#39;s because our sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.620" end="00:22:50.310" style="s2">of self is an heightened now if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.720" end="00:22:51.870" style="s2">what mean consciousness that&#39;s fine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.310" end="00:22:54.600" style="s2">called self awareness</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.870" end="00:22:56.190" style="s2">yeah consciousness consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.600" end="00:22:58.620" style="s2">basically just a lasting word it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.190" end="00:23:00.450" style="s2">fact there were some awareness okay now</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.620" end="00:23:02.640" style="s2">I&#39;m not that interested in awareness</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.450" end="00:23:04.770" style="s2">because what we share with other animals</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.640" end="00:23:08.100" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting for human beings is</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.770" end="00:23:11.550" style="s2">sentence meaning that you have sense we</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.100" end="00:23:13.170" style="s2">smell we touch we watch stuff we hear</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.550" end="00:23:15.180" style="s2">stuff and we then process the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.170" end="00:23:16.950" style="s2">information that we get access to and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.180" end="00:23:18.630" style="s2">the first thing we do we have we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.950" end="00:23:21.330" style="s2">that information in our brain that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.630" end="00:23:23.790" style="s2">try to solidify world so there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.330" end="00:23:26.520" style="s2">that there&#39;s a world out there and we</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.790" end="00:23:28.770" style="s2">then in relation to this world Percy</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.520" end="00:23:32.370" style="s2">that we act so we are involved as an</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.770" end="00:23:34.170" style="s2">agent in this world and when we then</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.370" end="00:23:37.800" style="s2">proceed that were an agent within this</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.170" end="00:23:40.380" style="s2">world we&#39;re acting with that creates the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.800" end="00:23:43.410" style="s2">cells of agency and that agency is</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.380" end="00:23:46.110" style="s2">called the self now please note that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.410" end="00:23:48.210" style="s2">managed to describe this now it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.110" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">scientifically without using the word</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.210" end="00:23:52.950" style="s2">consciousness not even once okay well so</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:55.020" style="s2">the cell I what I&#39;m hearing a bit else</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.950" end="00:23:57.900" style="s2">always that the Tsarina the self the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.020" end="00:23:59.940" style="s2">self varies in intensity it&#39;s here and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.900" end="00:24:02.070" style="s2">then it goes away and so it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.940" end="00:24:06.180" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s some kind of permanent thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.070" end="00:24:08.970" style="s2">yeah yeah and it&#39;s not unified at all</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.180" end="00:24:11.010" style="s2">you know you know when your girlfriend</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.970" end="00:24:13.320" style="s2">or your wife tells you she&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.010" end="00:24:15.030" style="s2">changed your mind so you said this ten</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.320" end="00:24:15.660" style="s2">minutes ago is she sister yeah that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.030" end="00:24:17.370" style="s2">ten minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.660" end="00:24:19.320" style="s2">she means there was another self two</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.370" end="00:24:20.490" style="s2">minutes ago and he&#39;s no different so for</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.320" end="00:24:24.360" style="s2">the so she was ten minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.490" end="00:24:26.940" style="s2">well changes time</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.360" end="00:24:30.000" style="s2">there is not even a continued self you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.940" end="00:24:31.680" style="s2">know the self is really marginal yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.000" end="00:24:33.390" style="s2">your book you said that the ego is like</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.680" end="00:24:34.830" style="s2">a rainbow or something you said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.390" end="00:24:40.380" style="s2">like okay and it looks like something</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.830" end="00:24:42.450" style="s2">but but it&#39;s uh you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.380" end="00:24:44.790" style="s2">something substantive anuses this is all</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.450" end="00:24:46.230" style="s2">I know this is a Buddhist analogy this</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.790" end="00:24:49.790" style="s2">years all the time as well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.230" end="00:24:51.660" style="s2">nothing substantive at nothing permanent</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.790" end="00:24:55.110" style="s2">substantial or anything that you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.660" end="00:25:00.750" style="s2">really you know entrap in in</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.110" end="00:25:05.700" style="s2">consciousness or that make sense well</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.750" end="00:25:07.350" style="s2">you know the importance of the self it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.700" end="00:25:08.940" style="s2">not that strong in - religious and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.350" end="00:25:11.430" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason for that because the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.940" end="00:25:13.980" style="s2">world like you actually act within he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.430" end="00:25:15.660" style="s2">way more important than you are and as</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.980" end="00:25:17.010" style="s2">tribal beings we do human beings are I</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.660" end="00:25:18.330" style="s2">think it&#39;s a better model because</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.010" end="00:25:20.490" style="s2">actually what&#39;s important to us is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.330" end="00:25:23.340" style="s2">tribe that we belong to in our community</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.490" end="00:25:24.540" style="s2">and we want to find a purpose in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.340" end="00:25:25.830" style="s2">community which means they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.540" end="00:25:27.930" style="s2">agents within that community</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.830" end="00:25:30.840" style="s2">now with that community that holds us</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.930" end="00:25:32.550" style="s2">responsible for certain things you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.840" end="00:25:34.620" style="s2">we have obligations to have to fulfill</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.550" end="00:25:36.450" style="s2">we memorize even our commitments that</p>

<p begin="00:28:04.760" end="00:28:13.250" style="s2">okay well there&#39;s the infinite demand</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.140" end="00:28:16.700" style="s2">and the infinite demand is in itself for</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.250" end="00:28:19.460" style="s2">a so an idea and the problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.700" end="00:28:20.990" style="s2">infinite demand is that you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.460" end="00:28:23.600" style="s2">the problems I had with me too was that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.990" end="00:28:26.870" style="s2">it was an infinite demand from women</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.600" end="00:28:29.690" style="s2">versus men meaning that the women love</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.870" end="00:28:32.780" style="s2">to have an accusation they could put on</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.690" end="00:28:35.930" style="s2">the wall and always use forever against</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.780" end="00:28:37.700" style="s2">men that&#39;s exactly how they meet you</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.930" end="00:28:39.680" style="s2">moon put structure it&#39;s just like men</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.700" end="00:28:42.410" style="s2">are abusers women are the victims of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.680" end="00:28:43.280" style="s2">this abuse this has been the case from</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.410" end="00:28:45.020" style="s2">time immemorial</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.280" end="00:28:46.550" style="s2">this will always be the case and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.020" end="00:28:48.350" style="s2">a women should be allowed to use that as</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.550" end="00:28:50.350" style="s2">a weapon against men when every suits</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.350" end="00:28:52.179" style="s2">women&#39;s interests I didn&#39;t buy ink</p>

<p begin="00:28:52.179" end="00:28:56.350" style="s2">to begin with and I didn&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.710" end="00:28:58.210" style="s2">was a fair world view either I think men</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.350" end="00:29:01.360" style="s2">and women are about equally bad or</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.210" end="00:29:03.190" style="s2">equally good or whatever so uh but the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.360" end="00:29:06.039" style="s2">prow of the infinite demand is that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.250" end="00:29:19.720" style="s2">you will not be forgiven that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.950" end="00:29:20.590" style="s2">infinite demand it&#39;s very very important</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.720" end="00:29:22.960" style="s2">to stress that there&#39;s an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.590" end="00:29:25.450" style="s2">demand in ethics that we need to deal</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.960" end="00:29:26.740" style="s2">with and of course I do not subscribe to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.450" end="00:29:29.320" style="s2">number one because I don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.740" end="00:29:31.179" style="s2">infinity and number two I believe they</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.320" end="00:29:32.950" style="s2">should be clear-cut goal if I have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.179" end="00:29:37.990" style="s2">depth some kind of you know exactly I</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.950" end="00:29:41.700" style="s2">repay that okay so there has to be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.990" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">clear way to repay your debt which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.700" end="00:29:48.280" style="s2">real justice so sama Krejci has written</p>

<p begin="00:30:47.080" end="00:30:51.880" style="s2">can find common ground they can create</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.950" end="00:31:00.520" style="s2">respect each other and they can start</p>

<p begin="00:31:10.940" end="00:31:17.539" style="s2">you you have to create a narrative you</p>

<p begin="00:31:23.789" end="00:31:28.139" style="s2">interesting is the effect where these</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.139" end="00:31:33.360" style="s2">so they appreciate lineage</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.700" end="00:31:35.730" style="s2">subtly they&#39;re the same okay if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.360" end="00:31:38.730" style="s2">tribes just lost tribes as you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.730" end="00:31:40.470" style="s2">unified within the same nation and of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.730" end="00:31:42.419" style="s2">course the birth of this is the clan and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.470" end="00:31:44.010" style="s2">we then move from clans to nations and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.419" end="00:31:45.659" style="s2">you know the history from the Bible</p>

<p begin="00:32:04.830" end="00:32:08.309" style="s2">two constant working with for the next</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.149" end="00:32:10.139" style="s2">book incredibly interesting especially</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.309" end="00:32:12.570" style="s2">as they&#39;re interconnected with each</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.139" end="00:32:13.500" style="s2">other you cannot operate a nation to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.570" end="00:32:15.210" style="s2">operate a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.500" end="00:32:17.460" style="s2">give me the nation consistent travel</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.210" end="00:32:19.169" style="s2">tribes and some of these has no close</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.460" end="00:32:20.700" style="s2">relationship to the outside world in</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.169" end="00:32:22.740" style="s2">others that means that you love</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.700" end="00:32:24.510" style="s2">borderlands he will have border areas</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.740" end="00:32:26.519" style="s2">between the nation and the nations that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.510" end="00:32:28.769" style="s2">means some kind of trade between agents</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.519" end="00:32:30.450" style="s2">is preferable to nations that no trade</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.769" end="00:32:32.549" style="s2">with each other at all will probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.450" end="00:32:34.769" style="s2">like to go to war with each other with</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.549" end="00:32:37.019" style="s2">everybody some trade is the only</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.769" end="00:32:39.059" style="s2">relationship we have between nations</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.019" end="00:32:42.779" style="s2">that&#39;s not war so we basically choose</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.059" end="00:32:45.330" style="s2">between war and trade so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.779" end="00:32:48.360" style="s2">priests have always tried to do history</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.330" end="00:32:51.029" style="s2">so what they have to do is that okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.360" end="00:32:53.250" style="s2">let&#39;s maintain a trading relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.029" end="00:32:56.899" style="s2">and keep peace for as long as possible</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.250" end="00:32:59.039" style="s2">because if we keep peace and don&#39;t go to</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.899" end="00:33:01.380" style="s2">decadent that means we can create</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.039" end="00:33:03.600" style="s2">civilization so we can create a more</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.380" end="00:33:05.830" style="s2">advanced society we create more wealth</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.600" end="00:33:08.110" style="s2">to be shared within the nation</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.830" end="00:33:10.629" style="s2">so we know from history that if you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.110" end="00:33:12.220" style="s2">long periods of peace we create more</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.629" end="00:33:14.440" style="s2">wealth and we can then share that wealth</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.220" end="00:33:17.440" style="s2">with the system suppose it&#39;s fit we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.440" end="00:33:19.029" style="s2">more stuff to trade with and if we trade</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:21.009" style="s2">with other nations they have other</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.029" end="00:33:22.119" style="s2">advantages compared to us that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.009" end="00:33:25.179" style="s2">advantages for the different nations</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.119" end="00:33:26.889" style="s2">okay we can create a bigger order now we</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.179" end="00:33:28.509" style="s2">can logically understand this the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.889" end="00:33:30.309" style="s2">problem is that the people within the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.509" end="00:33:32.049" style="s2">tribes have a hard time to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.309" end="00:33:34.330" style="s2">liking the guysss from the next clan</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.049" end="00:33:36.460" style="s2">even more so liking people from other</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.330" end="00:33:38.259" style="s2">nations only people are born to love</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.460" end="00:33:40.450" style="s2">strangers are apparently people with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.259" end="00:33:42.460" style="s2">shamanic traits so we can know from</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.450" end="00:33:44.259" style="s2">studies from psychological studies these</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.460" end="00:33:45.940" style="s2">weirdos that we categorize as humanity</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.259" end="00:33:48.399" style="s2">test they don&#39;t care about skin color</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.940" end="00:33:49.629" style="s2">sexual orientation if you get drug abuse</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.399" end="00:33:50.470" style="s2">or whatever they don&#39;t care they just</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.629" end="00:33:52.869" style="s2">don&#39;t more lies</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.470" end="00:33:55.029" style="s2">they just just risk takers that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.869" end="00:33:58.419" style="s2">infinitely fascinated with strangers</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.029" end="00:34:00.429" style="s2">that&#39;s rare that&#39;s like 4% of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.419" end="00:34:02.139" style="s2">population that I&#39;m born with those</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.429" end="00:34:04.779" style="s2">pressures on everybody and it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.139" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">going to be everybody no it isn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.779" end="00:34:09.159" style="s2">the real challenge today that we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.840" end="00:34:11.409" style="s2">now when we live within the global</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.159" end="00:34:13.960" style="s2">Empire that we did not discuss in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.409" end="00:34:17.109" style="s2">book or without 15 years ago but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.960" end="00:34:18.790" style="s2">going to discuss now is how then do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.109" end="00:34:20.349" style="s2">build the system where people can</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.790" end="00:34:22.540" style="s2">actually live within a global Empire</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.349" end="00:34:24.730" style="s2">without tearing each other apart</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.540" end="00:34:26.500" style="s2">now we discovered ready that the first</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.730" end="00:34:29.139" style="s2">thing people used Internet&#39;s for is to</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.500" end="00:34:31.869" style="s2">create hate groups so what do they do</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.139" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">they create their own little tribes they</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.869" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">find something that the share hatred to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:39.609" style="s2">an object and object yes and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:42.669" style="s2">recreate hate groups and they have an</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.609" end="00:34:44.559" style="s2">object outside the universe and this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.669" end="00:34:46.690" style="s2">the same for people of the identity left</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.559" end="00:34:48.280" style="s2">as it is for that entity right so</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.690" end="00:34:50.139" style="s2">they&#39;re the same you know they have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.280" end="00:34:52.839" style="s2">same problem they&#39;re all following fake</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.139" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">pharmacists we call it in digital TV do</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.839" end="00:34:56.020" style="s2">they follow the fake leaders the fake</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:34:58.180" style="s2">the science and they do so by</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.020" end="00:35:00.250" style="s2">objectifying something they can share</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.180" end="00:35:02.109" style="s2">hatred towards that can be why to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.250" end="00:35:04.150" style="s2">central man or it can be anything that</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.109" end="00:35:05.319" style="s2">isn&#39;t the wisest or sexual man the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.150" end="00:35:07.720" style="s2">problem is that they&#39;re identical</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.319" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">they&#39;re all rose swords and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.720" end="00:35:11.950" style="s2">creating these identitarian groups and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:13.240" style="s2">they&#39;re still gonna cause havoc for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.950" end="00:35:15.010" style="s2">foreseeable future god we haven&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.240" end="00:35:16.750" style="s2">peeked in Europe it&#39;s getting worse here</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.010" end="00:35:19.330" style="s2">England is the worst of them all right</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.750" end="00:35:20.920" style="s2">so Europe is getting really messy</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.330" end="00:35:23.500" style="s2">because identitarian all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.920" end="00:35:25.600" style="s2">and with the alt-right and the out left</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.500" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">love each other because as long as they</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.600" end="00:35:29.560" style="s2">take over the entire arena people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:34.660" style="s2">believe this any other way forward no</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.560" end="00:35:36.610" style="s2">war okay what is that a natural response</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.660" end="00:35:39.100" style="s2">to that well it&#39;s the same response that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.610" end="00:35:41.560" style="s2">we have to the climate crisis the only</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.100" end="00:35:43.690" style="s2">way out of the climate crisis is to</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.560" end="00:35:45.970" style="s2">build technologies that help us avert</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.690" end="00:35:49.900" style="s2">the climate crisis the same thing goes</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.970" end="00:35:52.150" style="s2">here when it comes to strangers well at</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.900" end="00:35:52.780" style="s2">least tolerating each other to not kill</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.150" end="00:35:55.540" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.780" end="00:35:57.190" style="s2">so if you&#39;re not gonna have war across</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.540" end="00:35:59.680" style="s2">the planet all kinds of wars and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.190" end="00:36:02.290" style="s2">widespread terror is more than it&#39;s 5200</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.680" end="00:36:04.750" style="s2">years we need to create machines that</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.290" end="00:36:13.720" style="s2">make it easier for people to like each</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.750" end="00:36:15.820" style="s2">other and trade okay and this is what me</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.720" end="00:36:18.660" style="s2">just clarify so we need machines but we</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.820" end="00:36:21.220" style="s2">also need you said priests we need</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.660" end="00:36:25.810" style="s2">negotiator we need people to go in</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.220" end="00:36:28.990" style="s2">between the tribes and yep</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.810" end="00:36:30.150" style="s2">so what is a machine in the priest I</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.990" end="00:36:34.210" style="s2">guess that&#39;s my question</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.150" end="00:36:36.550" style="s2">okay exactly we we wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.210" end="00:36:38.740" style="s2">the netic rats that book came out twenty</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.550" end="00:36:41.230" style="s2">years ago right on 19 years ago okay in</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.740" end="00:36:44.110" style="s2">that book we discussed that any power</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.230" end="00:36:46.890" style="s2">structure over time has an elite of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.110" end="00:36:50.080" style="s2">three different fields we call them real</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.890" end="00:36:53.080" style="s2">symbolic and imaginary power real power</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.080" end="00:36:54.460" style="s2">is those who have control of the assets</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.080" end="00:36:57.280" style="s2">of any given society</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.460" end="00:36:59.860" style="s2">it used to be land ownership then during</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.280" end="00:37:03.160" style="s2">capitalism became capital or money these</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.860" end="00:37:06.130" style="s2">days it is data the way data comes down</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.160" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">so in an intentional society it&#39;s having</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.130" end="00:37:09.940" style="s2">possession of data the way in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:11.380" style="s2">capitalist society was having possession</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.940" end="00:37:13.510" style="s2">of money there were any feudalist</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.380" end="00:37:17.080" style="s2">society was having position of land so</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.510" end="00:37:20.050" style="s2">the major resource today to control how</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.080" end="00:37:21.640" style="s2">powerless is data we have that nitocris</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.050" end="00:37:24.490" style="s2">and there already it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.640" end="00:37:27.010" style="s2">computer Klaus okay and the anarchists</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.490" end="00:37:28.240" style="s2">opposing them are of course storing</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.010" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">their own data on their own hard drives</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.240" end="00:37:31.570" style="s2">and our tiny little computer clouds and</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:32.859" style="s2">things like that and that&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.570" end="00:37:35.319" style="s2">next things gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.859" end="00:37:36.579" style="s2">a lot of people who refuse to take part</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.319" end="00:37:37.989" style="s2">of the big computer class because they</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.579" end="00:37:39.880" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be controlled by tech</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.989" end="00:37:41.890" style="s2">giants and Chinese Communist Party&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.880" end="00:37:44.559" style="s2">other rules of the world but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.890" end="00:37:46.809" style="s2">those who own and control the data is</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.559" end="00:37:48.579" style="s2">the first leg of the nitocris II they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.809" end="00:37:51.940" style="s2">replacing the old bourgeoisie and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.579" end="00:37:54.430" style="s2">old aristocracy so the first thing on</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.940" end="00:37:56.289" style="s2">the other leg of that is is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.430" end="00:37:58.210" style="s2">imaginary and the symbolic power so the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.289" end="00:38:00.700" style="s2">question is how they appear well the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.210" end="00:38:02.710" style="s2">creators are the first ones there so</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.700" end="00:38:05.609" style="s2">what are the greatest things are the</p>

<p begin="00:38:30.640" end="00:38:34.450" style="s2">algorithm is a machine intelligence</p>

<p begin="00:38:44.019" end="00:38:46.809" style="s2">hundred thousand followers so the guys</p>

<p begin="00:39:17.680" end="00:39:21.489" style="s2">for example art the valise is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.690" end="00:39:23.559" style="s2">creating of the art meaning that the guy</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.489" end="00:39:24.910" style="s2">who puts the creation together puts the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.559" end="00:39:27.309" style="s2">exhibition together it&#39;s more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.910" end="00:39:29.890" style="s2">than the artist this is what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.309" end="00:39:31.960" style="s2">now everywhere in the economy so the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.890" end="00:39:34.180" style="s2">economy is moving towards bands is</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.960" end="00:39:36.249" style="s2">moving towards subcultures in moving</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.180" end="00:39:39.430" style="s2">towards influencers they&#39;re like an</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.430" end="00:39:42.940" style="s2">creators I think employers are over in</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:45.090" style="s2">the next ten years but they will replace</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.940" end="00:39:46.980" style="s2">by more professional creators</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.090" end="00:39:48.960" style="s2">who were directly with the algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.980" end="00:39:50.610" style="s2">means that you&#39;re a human being or a</p>

<p begin="00:39:56.130" end="00:40:01.590" style="s2">or whatever you do your ik writer so the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.100" end="00:40:03.810" style="s2">creators are the second leg of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.590" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">power structure and there of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.810" end="00:40:11.130" style="s2">locating where the nodes are so once the</p>

<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:55.890" style="s2">okay the third leg&#39; is the one that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:41:08.040" end="00:41:11.310" style="s2">now we&#39;re moving on to the technologies</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.690" end="00:41:13.410" style="s2">that will only start to occur in the</p>

<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:27.570" style="s2">because they control the texts they hand</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.740" end="00:41:28.830" style="s2">wrote the text they preached and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.570" end="00:41:30.270" style="s2">could read and write and they were the</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.270" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">stored history and that&#39;s why they were</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.010" end="00:41:39.060" style="s2">immensely powerful they never aspired to</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:41.070" style="s2">own the land or join the capital they</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.060" end="00:41:44.010" style="s2">only aspire to be the truth sayers and</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.070" end="00:41:48.240" style="s2">control truth now they were replaced by</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.010" end="00:41:50.550" style="s2">academia okay which part of societies in</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.240" end="00:41:55.770" style="s2">a huge crisis right now it cannot even</p>

<p begin="00:41:55.770" end="00:42:00.619" style="s2">falling apart and it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.130" end="00:42:04.970" style="s2">while you and I involved in building for</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.619" end="00:42:07.160" style="s2">example monasteries for spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.970" end="00:42:09.349" style="s2">monasteries now because we tried to</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.160" end="00:42:11.749" style="s2">build new institutions of truth</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.349" end="00:42:13.309" style="s2">production so you go to isolated base we</p>

<p begin="00:42:30.619" end="00:42:35.900" style="s2">second just about that so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.049" end="00:42:38.299" style="s2">saying is that academia is the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.900" end="00:42:40.940" style="s2">broken priesthood of the time which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.299" end="00:42:42.950" style="s2">going to be replaced by a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.940" end="00:42:48.380" style="s2">group of people who are much more savvy</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.950" end="00:42:51.170" style="s2">and exactly as this is a technological</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.380" end="00:42:53.299" style="s2">age more than anything what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.170" end="00:42:56.359" style="s2">these new priests will do well what is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.299" end="00:42:57.859" style="s2">the number one obligation is to unify</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.359" end="00:42:59.989" style="s2">the world mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.859" end="00:43:02.119" style="s2">that is creating a grand narrative for</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.989" end="00:43:04.910" style="s2">East and West and did you tell us mark</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.119" end="00:43:08.479" style="s2">Stallman says correctly and that grand</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.910" end="00:43:09.799" style="s2">narrative is the one we&#39;re working on of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.479" end="00:43:11.660" style="s2">course here because for priests and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.799" end="00:43:13.759" style="s2">monks right the grand narrative is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.660" end="00:43:16.910" style="s2">unification of East and West digital</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.759" end="00:43:19.219" style="s2">into one story and that story only has</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.910" end="00:43:23.329" style="s2">one effect of interest and that is to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.219" end="00:43:26.529" style="s2">avoid major terrorists avoid catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.329" end="00:43:30.140" style="s2">yeah apocalypse we could say here</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.529" end="00:43:34.460" style="s2">exactly so sorry about that so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.140" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">means we have to create that narrative</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.460" end="00:43:38.059" style="s2">and we then have to buy with that</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:40.339" style="s2">nurtures it also and they we have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.059" end="00:43:42.979" style="s2">implement it and I I definitely I say</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.339" end="00:43:45.140" style="s2">with certainty that this is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.979" end="00:43:47.509" style="s2">impossible if you don&#39;t know how could</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.140" end="00:43:50.059" style="s2">the machines so just like the curators</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.509" end="00:43:52.279" style="s2">are using algorithms to guide us through</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.059" end="00:43:54.769" style="s2">the chaos and find ordering chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.279" end="00:43:56.329" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the next thing is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.769" end="00:43:58.880" style="s2">priests are then trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.329" end="00:44:01.309" style="s2">direction for us okay the next from</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.880" end="00:44:04.460" style="s2">order is a direction where machines are</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.309" end="00:44:06.710" style="s2">just although I said use machines and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.460" end="00:44:09.529" style="s2">because of the machines and blockchains</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.710" end="00:44:10.770" style="s2">we can out train thousands of strangers</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.529" end="00:44:12.210" style="s2">different culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.770" end="00:44:14.270" style="s2">pronounced and from different silos if</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.210" end="00:44:16.890" style="s2">you like they start trusting each other</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.270" end="00:44:20.280" style="s2">so the machines are gonna create a kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.890" end="00:44:22.110" style="s2">of exponential educational movement or</p>

<p begin="00:57:10.300" end="00:57:16.660" style="s2">right you talked about trans rationalism</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.420" end="00:57:19.270" style="s2">you know and and yeah versus rationalism</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.660" end="00:57:21.100" style="s2">anti-russian ilysm you know in my little</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.270" end="00:57:21.800" style="s2">book that I sent you it was really an</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.100" end="00:57:25.670" style="s2">attack on</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.800" end="00:57:27.460" style="s2">rationalism so what is trans rationalism</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.670" end="00:57:31.190" style="s2">and why is that important</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.460" end="00:57:33.080" style="s2">GWF Hegel German philosopher wrote on</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.190" end="00:57:35.720" style="s2">the six folks early 9th century the</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.080" end="00:57:37.610" style="s2">giant so we owe everything to Hegel</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.720" end="00:57:40.070" style="s2">without Hegel there&#39;s no Freud without</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.610" end="00:57:42.200" style="s2">handle this Nietzsche we don&#39;t haggle</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.070" end="00:57:44.450" style="s2">then there&#39;s another compartment is</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.200" end="00:57:47.240" style="s2">Amanda Whitehead certain so we know</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.450" end="00:57:48.710" style="s2">everything table but if there is a he</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.240" end="00:57:50.810" style="s2">deal me in terms of hating himself</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.710" end="00:57:53.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t use he would be transnationalism</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.810" end="00:57:57.710" style="s2">you know you heard about Hegel&#39;s ideal</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.390" end="00:58:00.500" style="s2">the absolute mmm-hmm okay so he&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.710" end="00:58:02.720" style="s2">accused sometimes even by me when I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.500" end="00:58:04.700" style="s2">younger I kissed Hegel being a total</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.720" end="00:58:06.380" style="s2">Asst meaning that he he&#39;d sort he</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.700" end="00:58:08.750" style="s2">reached the end of history and he</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.380" end="00:58:11.330" style="s2">understood absolutely everything okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.750" end="00:58:14.120" style="s2">but what Hegel actually means with that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.330" end="00:58:15.820" style="s2">is that he&#39;s understood how things work</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.120" end="00:58:19.010" style="s2">and how you reach certain conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.820" end="00:58:20.450" style="s2">and that&#39;s how for example if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.010" end="00:58:22.430" style="s2">understand our narratives are always</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.450" end="00:58:24.680" style="s2">created you understand for example the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.430" end="00:58:26.720" style="s2">narratives or pathos or mythos of logos</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.680" end="00:58:28.940" style="s2">he&#39;s always been like that I always be</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.720" end="00:58:31.010" style="s2">like as long as were you okay did you</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.940" end="00:58:33.710" style="s2">reach the absolute according to her so</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.010" end="00:58:36.380" style="s2">Hegel said that he reached absolute and</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.710" end="00:58:38.960" style="s2">he claimed that the nation state which</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.380" end="00:58:40.700" style="s2">is basically dishonored his friend whom</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.960" end="00:58:44.710" style="s2">Bolton started implementing it in</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.700" end="00:58:46.910" style="s2">Prussia image in 1808 so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.710" end="00:58:48.320" style="s2">Megillah nation state is the nation</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.910" end="00:58:51.800" style="s2">state it&#39;s about two hundred years old</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.320" end="00:58:54.080" style="s2">so higgledy perfect something he did</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.800" end="00:58:56.450" style="s2">certainly do very priestly work in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.080" end="00:58:58.760" style="s2">sense that he created a nation built on</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.450" end="00:59:00.860" style="s2">a shared language and that came out of</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.760" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">the translations of the Bible in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.860" end="00:59:05.360" style="s2">she translated the Bible from great</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.960" end="00:59:07.580" style="s2">Hebrew and Latin to the different local</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.360" end="00:59:10.160" style="s2">tanks of European vented languages like</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.580" end="00:59:12.830" style="s2">an over dialect became German absurdum</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.160" end="00:59:15.110" style="s2">Swedish Oxford English Perry started</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.830" end="00:59:17.060" style="s2">became French etc so we got all the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.110" end="00:59:19.160" style="s2">different natural tongues Europe these</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.060" end="00:59:21.020" style="s2">tungsten became the foundations for the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.160" end="00:59:23.000" style="s2">different nation states of Europe if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.020" end="00:59:24.920" style="s2">shared the same language and even read</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.000" end="00:59:26.450" style="s2">the same newspaper listen to the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.920" end="00:59:28.430" style="s2">radio station and watch the same TV</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.450" end="00:59:31.010" style="s2">shows at night you share a nationality</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.430" end="00:59:33.620" style="s2">you&#39;re part of the same discourse so</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.010" end="00:59:35.480" style="s2">this is a curious media relations thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.620" end="00:59:37.160" style="s2">and in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.480" end="00:59:39.470" style="s2">he had reached an absolute because what</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.160" end="00:59:42.290" style="s2">we&#39;re doing today we&#39;re working on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.470" end="00:59:44.600" style="s2">global Empire and the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.290" end="00:59:47.240" style="s2">creating an entity that is shared by all</p>

<p begin="00:59:47.240" end="00:59:51.530" style="s2">boring if that&#39;s gonna happen we need</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.210" end="00:59:53.150" style="s2">the machines to do it</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.530" end="00:59:54.920" style="s2">we&#39;re still working about a Higgy</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.150" end="00:59:59.330" style="s2">environment we&#39;re only repeating what he</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.920" end="01:00:01.730" style="s2">already did so what is the genius then</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.330" end="01:00:03.859" style="s2">of Hegel&#39;s absolute and the concept</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.730" end="01:00:06.680" style="s2">well it has to do with the fact that he</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.859" end="01:00:09.160" style="s2">who understands the limitations of his</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.680" end="01:00:12.290" style="s2">own rationality so within your</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.160" end="01:00:14.630" style="s2">rationalism understand how far your</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.290" end="01:00:16.760" style="s2">rationalism can take you yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.630" end="01:00:18.859" style="s2">understand what you must leave to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.760" end="01:00:20.600" style="s2">unknown which cannot be comprehended by</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.859" end="01:00:22.100" style="s2">you even because he lacks the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.600" end="01:00:25.180" style="s2">information and you don&#39;t want to guess</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.100" end="01:00:27.470" style="s2">what me or because is simply outside</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.180" end="01:00:30.320" style="s2">possibilities compounded you cannot</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.470" end="01:00:33.619" style="s2">Remy&#39;s so for example you you can&#39;t lick</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.320" end="01:00:37.970" style="s2">your own asshole anybody work kalique</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.619" end="01:00:44.510" style="s2">your ass will accept you that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.970" end="01:00:46.430" style="s2">absolute limit okay well it makes us</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.510" end="01:00:48.440" style="s2">humble doesn&#39;t it right it should make</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.430" end="01:00:51.470" style="s2">you humble the fact everybody colliculus</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.440" end="01:00:54.080" style="s2">want to accept you so you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.470" end="01:00:55.940" style="s2">some limit to your rationalism and to</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.080" end="01:00:57.530" style="s2">understand that limit without thinking</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.940" end="01:00:59.180" style="s2">like a model Conti the rationalism</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.530" end="01:01:01.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a limit where every got</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.180" end="01:01:01.510" style="s2">that idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.619" end="01:01:05.630" style="s2">know there is a limit or far you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.210" end="01:01:08.150" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.630" end="01:01:10.330" style="s2">but once you&#39;ve reached a limit so far</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.150" end="01:01:14.240" style="s2">you can think you reach your absolute</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.330" end="01:01:16.910" style="s2">meaning you cannot get any further okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.240" end="01:01:19.280" style="s2">mm-hmm so old you do then you should go</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.910" end="01:01:20.480" style="s2">back to that absolutely Platinum is how</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.280" end="01:01:22.040" style="s2">I thought about so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.480" end="01:01:27.080" style="s2">interesting I thought of it as being</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.040" end="01:01:29.750" style="s2">like God or something yeah well he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.080" end="01:01:31.369" style="s2">child listen you know all the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.750" end="01:01:32.840" style="s2">critical loving the medic rats</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.369" end="01:01:34.910" style="s2">I probably then have to sort of balance</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.840" end="01:01:37.640" style="s2">that up in the next book the writing but</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.910" end="01:01:39.050" style="s2">by honoring you we do celebrate them all</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.640" end="01:01:42.109" style="s2">over the place the restaurant looks like</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.050" end="01:01:43.940" style="s2">so she&#39;s a girly but you know Higgins</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.109" end="01:01:46.430" style="s2">absolute ass to be understood as a trans</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.940" end="01:01:47.990" style="s2">nationalist concept so the work</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.430" end="01:01:49.220" style="s2">transaction was not invented by us I</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.990" end="01:01:50.420" style="s2">know other philosophers you</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.220" end="01:01:51.530" style="s2">you don&#39;t know we used it first you</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.420" end="01:01:53.390" style="s2">could probably check that if you like</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.530" end="01:01:55.130" style="s2">but we&#39;ll use him while amylose</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.390" end="01:01:57.020" style="s2">explained we use this terms it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.130" end="01:01:58.849" style="s2">our philosophy because I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.020" end="01:02:00.859" style="s2">very important that we see philosophers</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.849" end="01:02:03.320" style="s2">set out these are the limits within</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.859" end="01:02:07.099" style="s2">which we can work well we can guarantee</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.320" end="01:02:09.020" style="s2">you is that our limits are way wider and</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.099" end="01:02:11.930" style="s2">our territory way bigger than anything</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.020" end="01:02:13.700" style="s2">science or anybody else does because if</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.930" end="01:02:15.890" style="s2">somebody else is a bigger territory to</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.700" end="01:02:17.960" style="s2">exploit you comprehend more than we do</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.890" end="01:02:19.730" style="s2">then we bow to them were no longer</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.960" end="01:02:21.590" style="s2">philosophers because then they become</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.730" end="01:02:23.270" style="s2">the philosophers because the guy who</p>

<p begin="01:02:26.869" end="01:02:30.950" style="s2">this is Hegel&#39;s concept on philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.300" end="01:02:33.640" style="s2">and I hope you subscribe to it and he</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.950" end="01:02:37.220" style="s2">inherited it from Aristotle so the great</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.640" end="01:02:39.050" style="s2">Aristotelian of our times is Hegel and</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.220" end="01:02:40.430" style="s2">knows everything turns toddler that&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.050" end="01:02:44.359" style="s2">have to go back to our starting to find</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.430" end="01:02:46.910" style="s2">path onto Hegel and a radical modernism</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.359" end="01:02:49.460" style="s2">and from Hegel then on is what we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.910" end="01:02:52.010" style="s2">inherited now and I will say Western</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.460" end="01:02:53.359" style="s2">philosophy after Hegel it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.010" end="01:02:55.700" style="s2">different ballgame from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.359" end="01:03:01.310" style="s2">judeo-christian Europe we used to live</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.700" end="01:03:04.880" style="s2">in before that mmm-hmm that was trans</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.310" end="01:03:13.099" style="s2">rationalism the most Hegelian term that</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.880" end="01:03:15.290" style="s2">Hegel never used okay next one Nate Neil</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.099" end="01:03:17.839" style="s2">ISM that&#39;s the next one and you now in</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.290" end="01:03:19.580" style="s2">it now this game I say Neil ISM you see</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.839" end="01:03:24.680" style="s2">you said there were three stages of</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.580" end="01:03:27.040" style="s2">nihilism you had you define I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.680" end="01:03:36.290" style="s2">I yell ISM but it could be nihilism</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.040" end="01:03:38.000" style="s2">actually not nihilism okay we divide now</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.290" end="01:03:39.830" style="s2">listening to three different categories</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.000" end="01:03:42.170" style="s2">and have to go to stood the way this</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.830" end="01:03:44.330" style="s2">again is what nature should written but</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.170" end="01:03:46.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t write so we&#39;re going to needs</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.330" end="01:03:49.040" style="s2">cause of nihilism and we discover you</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.520" end="01:03:50.510" style="s2">for them put them into a modern current</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.040" end="01:03:51.650" style="s2">environment the digital society we live</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.510" end="01:03:53.720" style="s2">in today we discover that there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.650" end="01:03:56.300" style="s2">three different steps in Ireland the</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.720" end="01:03:58.910" style="s2">first one is naive nihilism second one</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.300" end="01:04:00.770" style="s2">is cynical nihilism and the third one is</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.910" end="01:04:02.520" style="s2">affirmative that&#39;s okay what are they</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.770" end="01:04:06.840" style="s2">first between these three</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.520" end="01:04:09.090" style="s2">99 Lissa misted for example we take the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.840" end="01:04:12.150" style="s2">question of the existence of God okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.090" end="01:04:13.230" style="s2">naive nihilist doesn&#39;t know that God</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.150" end="01:04:15.750" style="s2">does not exist</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.230" end="01:04:17.910" style="s2">yet he doesn&#39;t know he subconsciously</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.750" end="01:04:19.740" style="s2">knows that God doesn&#39;t exist but he</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.910" end="01:04:22.050" style="s2">thinks still believes in God this is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.740" end="01:04:23.490" style="s2">person who would answer the question do</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.050" end="01:04:25.350" style="s2">you believe in God yes I do</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.490" end="01:04:26.730" style="s2">and then proudly ask but what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.350" end="01:04:28.860" style="s2">God is that he probably not have an</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.730" end="01:04:32.220" style="s2">answer he just probably says it because</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.860" end="01:04:33.990" style="s2">it sounds nice and he is so a religious</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.220" end="01:04:37.970" style="s2">person is just kind of going through the</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.990" end="01:04:41.610" style="s2">motions but doesn&#39;t have any genuine</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.970" end="01:04:43.440" style="s2">intelligent connection to exactly if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.610" end="01:04:45.180" style="s2">believe in God you should probably have</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.440" end="01:04:48.000" style="s2">an idea what you believe in right do you</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.180" end="01:04:49.170" style="s2">agree that you probably believe in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.000" end="01:04:52.430" style="s2">certain God I believe in the virgin</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.170" end="01:04:52.430" style="s2">birth somebody in the resurrection</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.790" end="01:05:06.810" style="s2">returned one day and I and yeah Chris</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.510" end="01:05:08.760" style="s2">pure naive nihilists you do not believe</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.810" end="01:05:10.380" style="s2">in that God and you&#39;re always exposed to</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.760" end="01:05:13.500" style="s2">somebody asked if you believe that God</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.380" end="01:05:17.310" style="s2">exists you believe that God exists so</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.500" end="01:05:18.900" style="s2">next one I nihilism is you say that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.310" end="01:05:19.980" style="s2">believe in God probably because sounds</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.900" end="01:05:23.760" style="s2">good because you&#39;re a beautiful salt</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.980" end="01:05:25.020" style="s2">okay it turns out when I asked what kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.760" end="01:05:26.700" style="s2">of already believe him then you have no</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.020" end="01:05:28.410" style="s2">idea God is I said well if you believe</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.700" end="01:05:30.840" style="s2">in God that&#39;s quite an important thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.410" end="01:05:34.010" style="s2">right so you should have some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.840" end="01:05:36.750" style="s2">concept of what God is and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.010" end="01:05:38.310" style="s2">care and since you don&#39;t care you</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.750" end="01:05:39.780" style="s2">probably don&#39;t believe in God at all and</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.310" end="01:05:41.430" style="s2">then you guys will probably look a bit</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.780" end="01:05:43.320" style="s2">confused no I believe in God I believe</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.430" end="01:05:45.840" style="s2">in God being very afraid of leaving that</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.320" end="01:05:48.060" style="s2">position so that&#39;s not Unitas their</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.840" end="01:05:49.740" style="s2">world is full of it I would say most of</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.060" end="01:05:51.360" style="s2">the people who practice dead religion</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.740" end="01:05:56.280" style="s2">which is the most common form of</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.360" end="01:05:58.980" style="s2">religion today or now you&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.280" end="01:06:04.140" style="s2">meaning they go to temples and they pray</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.980" end="01:06:05.880" style="s2">to a god with blue elephant or something</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.140" end="01:06:08.940" style="s2">but they&#39;re just going through the</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.880" end="01:06:11.400" style="s2">motions and go through the motions and</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.940" end="01:06:13.050" style="s2">the drink are the drinks you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.400" end="01:06:15.350" style="s2">to drink in the drink so longer contain</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.050" end="01:06:17.090" style="s2">the psychedelic substances</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.350" end="01:06:19.640" style="s2">happens we just drink it because you</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.090" end="01:06:21.830" style="s2">drink it so you just go through em to</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.640" end="01:06:23.630" style="s2">rituals and it&#39;s dead religion now the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.830" end="01:06:28.010" style="s2">vast video really didn&#39;t practice in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.630" end="01:06:30.740" style="s2">world today is that religion yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.010" end="01:06:33.410" style="s2">that&#39;s not ISM the second one is cynical</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.740" end="01:06:35.300" style="s2">nihilism you are aware of the fact you</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.410" end="01:06:39.470" style="s2">no longer believe in God you probably</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.300" end="01:06:41.840" style="s2">tell your spouse or close friends you go</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.470" end="01:06:44.540" style="s2">to church at 11 o clock on ascending</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.840" end="01:06:46.310" style="s2">because you&#39;re a beautiful soul so you</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.540" end="01:06:48.230" style="s2">go to church on Sunday because it looks</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.310" end="01:06:49.580" style="s2">good to go in church you might even have</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.230" end="01:06:51.830" style="s2">the pina that it&#39;s important that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.580" end="01:06:53.600" style="s2">still pretend that God exists even if we</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.830" end="01:06:55.160" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in it because if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.600" end="01:07:00.170" style="s2">pretend that God exists and all have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.160" end="01:07:07.130" style="s2">will I call it the Bill and Hillary</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.170" end="01:07:07.760" style="s2">Clinton version of Christianity very</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.130" end="01:07:09.500" style="s2">adamant</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.760" end="01:07:11.480" style="s2">no I am be religious and I go to church</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.500" end="01:07:13.220" style="s2">and I believe in God and they put their</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.480" end="01:07:18.320" style="s2">hand on the Bible whenever they can to</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.220" end="01:07:20.270" style="s2">swear all cynical nineties is prevalent</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.320" end="01:07:21.950" style="s2">in our culture and it&#39;s actually a lot</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.270" end="01:07:23.960" style="s2">worse than I listen to the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.950" end="01:07:26.270" style="s2">the cynical night is actually our only</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.960" end="01:07:28.670" style="s2">pretending to believe in God um I would</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.270" end="01:07:30.590" style="s2">say values are then inter subjective</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.670" end="01:07:32.480" style="s2">meaning that they occur between people</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.590" end="01:07:33.950" style="s2">usually within a tribe and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.480" end="01:07:36.650" style="s2">concerned with the survival of the tribe</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.950" end="01:07:38.330" style="s2">and the domestication of else within the</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.650" end="01:07:39.470" style="s2">tribe to serve the tribe that&#39;s how most</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.330" end="01:07:42.110" style="s2">values are crazy</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.470" end="01:07:43.490" style="s2">so yeah cynical nihilism is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.110" end="01:07:45.800" style="s2">pretending you believe in God which</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.490" end="01:07:47.570" style="s2">actually are aware of the fact you</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.800" end="01:07:48.980" style="s2">you&#39;re not meeting rights it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.570" end="01:07:54.140" style="s2">America it&#39;s a kind of schizophrenic</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.980" end="01:07:55.850" style="s2">religion too isn&#39;t it yes to it but I</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.140" end="01:07:59.840" style="s2">would say most cynical nihilist I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.850" end="01:08:05.240" style="s2">perfectly aware of the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.840" end="01:08:06.890" style="s2">just very career-minded okay so they go</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.240" end="01:08:08.810" style="s2">to the charity galas and they get money</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.890" end="01:08:11.720" style="s2">and they pray to God with open eyes</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.810" end="01:08:12.830" style="s2">while everybody else is they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.720" end="01:08:14.960" style="s2">really care too much about religion</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.830" end="01:08:16.970" style="s2">because god is dead to them because god</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.960" end="01:08:18.740" style="s2">is dead god is gone you can no longer be</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.970" end="01:08:20.120" style="s2">trusted and because there&#39;s no God there</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.740" end="01:08:23.720" style="s2">that means the least whole field open</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.120" end="01:08:25.339" style="s2">then and their pursuits or whatever they</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.720" end="01:08:27.589" style="s2">were looking for so they go for their</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.339" end="01:08:28.589" style="s2">own guys and desires and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.589" end="01:08:29.670" style="s2">afraid of being corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.589" end="01:08:31.560" style="s2">because they&#39;re obviously saying one</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.670" end="01:08:36.779" style="s2">thing and mean something very different</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.560" end="01:08:39.839" style="s2">so hopefully way they arrival algorithms</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.779" end="01:08:42.000" style="s2">and we did till now memorizing</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.839" end="01:08:44.219" style="s2">everything we can expose the Cenacle -</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.000" end="01:08:45.330" style="s2">more and more so you know it could be a</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.219" end="01:08:47.339" style="s2">good thing for people who actually are</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.330" end="01:08:49.170" style="s2">serious about friends because to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.339" end="01:08:51.810" style="s2">just no good there&#39;s no good at all the</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.170" end="01:08:53.639" style="s2">corrupt society I think anytime we have</p>

<p begin="01:08:53.639" end="01:08:57.089" style="s2">thing and then do something different</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.960" end="01:08:58.920" style="s2">that is the fundament direction that is</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.089" end="01:09:00.150" style="s2">corruption we yes and I don&#39;t think they</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.920" end="01:09:01.739" style="s2">should be trusted I don&#39;t think any</p>
