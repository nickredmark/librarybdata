<p begin="00:00:02.760" end="00:00:10.139" style="s2">and an amazing week I only decided to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.520" end="00:00:14.490" style="s2">this yesterday and things happen between</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.139" end="00:00:15.540" style="s2">now and then that I don&#39;t I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.490" end="00:00:19.710" style="s2">get into them right now because I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.540" end="00:00:22.050" style="s2">to do this at the beginning so I am</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.710" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">crating we are going to create but right</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.050" end="00:00:27.779" style="s2">now it&#39;s just me a global technical</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:29.970" style="s2">cooperative because technology companies</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.779" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">have so much power right now they are</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.970" end="00:00:34.739" style="s2">the top like four or five companies on</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:36.300" style="s2">the stock exchange and they&#39;re growing</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.739" end="00:00:41.550" style="s2">all the time between Amazon Apple</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.300" end="00:00:43.350" style="s2">Facebook and I forgot one of them they</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:45.870" style="s2">have more and more of our data more and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.350" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">more money to affect our elections</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.870" end="00:00:49.379" style="s2">oh hello Tiffany this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:50.789" style="s2">things I was doing today and I was going</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.379" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">to be talking to Tiffany and something</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.789" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">else came up which I will talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:01:01.289" style="s2">about later so I have known I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:05.090" style="s2">this idea for a long time and it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.289" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">improving as time goes on but also I</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.090" end="00:01:09.060" style="s2">really want to get it out there now and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:10.470" style="s2">what I keep trying to do I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.060" end="00:01:12.090" style="s2">create a website I tried to have a blog</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.470" end="00:01:12.570" style="s2">I tried to write a book and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.090" end="00:01:14.909" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.570" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">partly because like a business plan once</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.909" end="00:01:19.110" style="s2">it&#39;s out there it&#39;s already updated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:20.700" style="s2">already evolving and the ideas we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.110" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">creating it together from scratch anyway</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.700" end="00:01:27.420" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna create the way to fund it</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:28.950" style="s2">the way to govern how we actually like</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.420" end="00:01:34.020" style="s2">have a board of directors that we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.950" end="00:01:37.259" style="s2">trust and can be run with with all of us</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:39.810" style="s2">and so today because I have been very</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.259" end="00:01:42.710" style="s2">versed on coming live and happy nobody</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.810" end="00:01:45.960" style="s2">coming to ask questions I am going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.710" end="00:01:48.780" style="s2">I&#39;ve notes actually events I also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:50.850" style="s2">always have entitled right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.780" end="00:01:53.970" style="s2">everything you can have with a check</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.850" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">with a tech cooperative and so people</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.970" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">don&#39;t always like it right but what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:01:58.890" style="s2">it for me or what&#39;s in it for the people</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:01.350" style="s2">like that&#39;s great but why would people</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.890" end="00:02:03.240" style="s2">want to get involved and for every</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.350" end="00:02:07.140" style="s2">reason every reason that you currently</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.240" end="00:02:09.690" style="s2">use technology that has a downside and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.140" end="00:02:12.060" style="s2">plus side we can have the plus side with</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.690" end="00:02:13.000" style="s2">very minimal downside when we own it</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.060" end="00:02:16.660" style="s2">together when we</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.000" end="00:02:20.170" style="s2">together and we can exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.660" end="00:02:22.570" style="s2">increase the positive side that Google</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.170" end="00:02:25.270" style="s2">Apple Facebook can&#39;t do because if</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.570" end="00:02:27.490" style="s2">there&#39;s this disconnection between the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.270" end="00:02:28.960" style="s2">creator and the user and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.490" end="00:02:31.570" style="s2">keep things behind a closed door and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.960" end="00:02:34.360" style="s2">they have to keep things the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.570" end="00:02:37.570" style="s2">transparent secret if keep things secret</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.360" end="00:02:39.940" style="s2">in order to be have proprietary</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.570" end="00:02:41.980" style="s2">information we don&#39;t need to do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.940" end="00:02:43.660" style="s2">because we&#39;re going to be opening out in</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.980" end="00:02:46.270" style="s2">the open for everyone to see so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.660" end="00:02:49.660" style="s2">everybody can join oh thanks for sharing</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.270" end="00:02:51.130" style="s2">Tiffany and so I just have a list of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.660" end="00:02:53.290" style="s2">like everything we can to be like</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.130" end="00:02:54.970" style="s2">technological cooperative they just like</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.290" end="00:02:59.020" style="s2">fall asleep above the tech and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.970" end="00:03:00.310" style="s2">cooperative so here&#39;s there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.020" end="00:03:01.480" style="s2">things we can create with technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.310" end="00:03:03.310" style="s2">that already been created with</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.480" end="00:03:05.050" style="s2">technology we just don&#39;t own them and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.310" end="00:03:06.459" style="s2">then other ones that have never been</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.050" end="00:03:07.930" style="s2">created that we can create together I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.459" end="00:03:11.020" style="s2">not gonna distinguish between the two</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.930" end="00:03:13.050" style="s2">but I have what you get when you have we</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.020" end="00:03:15.520" style="s2">have a tech cooperative is access to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.050" end="00:03:18.220" style="s2">understandable usable information that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.520" end="00:03:20.170" style="s2">you can trust in basically all</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.220" end="00:03:23.650" style="s2">information right now is on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.170" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">but each one of us has to decide whether</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.650" end="00:03:26.110" style="s2">something is trustworthy or not and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:29.530" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely more trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.110" end="00:03:30.880" style="s2">sites than other ones but to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.530" end="00:03:32.110" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t even matter because if</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.880" end="00:03:34.180" style="s2">you&#39;re having a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.110" end="00:03:35.950" style="s2">someone and you don&#39;t have a foundation</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.180" end="00:03:37.510" style="s2">that you can go back to you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.950" end="00:03:40.840" style="s2">have to have the same debate the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.510" end="00:03:42.280" style="s2">conversation over and over again there</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.840" end="00:03:44.410" style="s2">is way too much information on this</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.280" end="00:03:45.970" style="s2">planet for any one person to hold it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.410" end="00:03:48.010" style="s2">even if you were a phenomenal human</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.970" end="00:03:49.660" style="s2">being could hold it in your brain the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.010" end="00:03:51.820" style="s2">person you&#39;re talking to can&#39;t and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.660" end="00:03:53.950" style="s2">having one place right now I&#39;d say the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.820" end="00:03:56.440" style="s2">closest thing to that is Wikipedia but</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.950" end="00:03:58.690" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily we don&#39;t own it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.440" end="00:04:00.610" style="s2">together it&#39;s not as trustworthy because</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.690" end="00:04:03.250" style="s2">someone coca-cola can come in and change</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.610" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">their their Wikipedia page so when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.250" end="00:04:07.180" style="s2">able to say what we trust and what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:09.160" style="s2">don&#39;t trust together and as things go</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.180" end="00:04:13.030" style="s2">wrong be like well look Coke is doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.160" end="00:04:14.709" style="s2">their own their own thing we can problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.030" end="00:04:16.690" style="s2">solve that and co-create ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.709" end="00:04:20.290" style="s2">mitigate that without what Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.690" end="00:04:23.020" style="s2">does which is lock-in understandable</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.290" end="00:04:24.310" style="s2">information I don&#39;t find Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.020" end="00:04:26.889" style="s2">exceptionally understandable</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.310" end="00:04:28.840" style="s2">it&#39;s an encyclopedia online it&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.889" end="00:04:30.370" style="s2">really glad it exists but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.840" end="00:04:32.409" style="s2">work for neurologically diverse brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.370" end="00:04:37.569" style="s2">it&#39;s not infographics it&#39;s not visual</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.409" end="00:04:40.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not data we can play with having</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.569" end="00:04:45.729" style="s2">people geeked out in their area of</p>

<p begin="00:04:45.729" end="00:04:48.969" style="s2">this is what it&#39;s cool about this I hope</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.229" end="00:04:52.599" style="s2">you don&#39;t want any but I can put up the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.969" end="00:04:54.430" style="s2">actual they comment on the screen so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.599" end="00:04:57.779" style="s2">can read it we understand the powers of</p>

<p begin="00:04:57.779" end="00:05:05.439" style="s2">having science that we can trust</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:07.719" style="s2">having science be a space of instead of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.439" end="00:05:09.219" style="s2">do you agree with it or not how solid is</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.719" end="00:05:10.569" style="s2">the science how many people were</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:26.919" style="s2">if like this is how we grade science</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.669" end="00:05:28.599" style="s2">having health that is that you can trust</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.919" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">that isn&#39;t necessarily a doctor who may</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.220" end="00:18:42.670" style="s2">that it&#39;s gonna be dissipated but in</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.290" end="00:19:00.010" style="s2">dismantling capitalism and creating a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.610" end="00:19:02.740" style="s2">world that works for everyone in a way</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.010" end="00:19:04.630" style="s2">that is that is safe and peaceful and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.740" end="00:19:06.400" style="s2">enjoyable we can have fun doing this</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.630" end="00:19:08.380" style="s2">because we&#39;re gonna create the tools to</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.400" end="00:19:11.050" style="s2">constantly ask what&#39;s hard about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.380" end="00:19:12.250" style="s2">how do we make it easier what&#39;s not fun</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.360" end="00:19:19.900" style="s2">social media platform and the one that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.220" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">we are creating together that&#39;s solving</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.900" end="00:19:25.540" style="s2">the world&#39;s problems why why are you</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.540" end="00:19:29.260" style="s2">is it they&#39;re giving you that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.740" end="00:19:31.150" style="s2">how do we create that here - you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.260" end="00:19:32.920" style="s2">even if it&#39;s sharing photographs even if</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.150" end="00:19:34.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like you can do exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.920" end="00:19:36.940" style="s2">doing there let&#39;s do that here well</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.660" end="00:19:39.670" style="s2">you&#39;re also creating a community around</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.940" end="00:19:41.290" style="s2">saving our planet without if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.670" end="00:19:42.970" style="s2">wanna concentrate on like the disaster</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.290" end="00:19:45.610" style="s2">that our planet is those of us with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.970" end="00:19:48.070" style="s2">emotional capacity and to do that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.610" end="00:19:50.200" style="s2">emotional labor be happy to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.070" end="00:19:54.310" style="s2">that&#39;s the point is allowing people to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.200" end="00:19:59.320" style="s2">do what they&#39;re here to do and that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.310" end="00:20:02.890" style="s2">my notes so that is what we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.320" end="00:20:05.380" style="s2">by having a technology cooperative we</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.890" end="00:20:08.410" style="s2">can create the tools for access to</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.380" end="00:20:09.850" style="s2">information have everybody be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.410" end="00:20:11.800" style="s2">understand what is going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.850" end="00:20:13.210" style="s2">complex issues because we have a fact we</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.800" end="00:20:15.250" style="s2">don&#39;t have to reinvent the wheel every</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.210" end="00:20:16.450" style="s2">time we have a we have a conversation we</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.250" end="00:20:18.730" style="s2">don&#39;t need to have the climate debate</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.450" end="00:20:20.980" style="s2">for the umpteenth time we need climate</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.730" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">information laid out so there basically</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.980" end="00:20:24.790" style="s2">isn&#39;t a debate and the Koch brothers</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:29.080" style="s2">can&#39;t skew that debate</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.790" end="00:20:30.340" style="s2">brother we can have a community we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.080" end="00:20:32.110" style="s2">connect people with who they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.340" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">everybody&#39;s worthy of connection</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.110" end="00:20:35.590" style="s2">everyone should have people even if I</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:37.390" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be your people and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.590" end="00:20:38.740" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be my people that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.390" end="00:20:40.470" style="s2">mean you&#39;re not invited and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.740" end="00:20:43.630" style="s2">mean you don&#39;t get a table to sit at</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.470" end="00:20:45.940" style="s2">everyone is worthy and the more people</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.630" end="00:20:47.890" style="s2">are connected people who are happy are</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.940" end="00:20:51.010" style="s2">better human beings and I want people to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.890" end="00:20:52.800" style="s2">be better human beings so I want them</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.010" end="00:20:55.720" style="s2">connected we can share resources</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.800" end="00:20:57.580" style="s2">everyone again is worthy of food and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.720" end="00:21:00.460" style="s2">clothing and shelter and health and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.580" end="00:21:02.650" style="s2">education that is usable for them and we</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.460" end="00:21:04.210" style="s2">can create those systems without needing</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.650" end="00:21:06.310" style="s2">to petition our governments without</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.210" end="00:21:07.750" style="s2">needing to like convince people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.310" end="00:21:09.460" style="s2">don&#39;t want their taxpayers to go to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.750" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">to go to that let&#39;s voluntarily create</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.460" end="00:21:14.410" style="s2">the thing that we&#39;ve chosen to put our</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:16.270" style="s2">money towards we get to honor her</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.410" end="00:21:17.680" style="s2">diversity which again is about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.270" end="00:21:18.190" style="s2">community we might not get along with</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.680" end="00:21:20.020" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.190" end="00:21:21.820" style="s2">we might not we&#39;re not gonna get along</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.020" end="00:21:24.580" style="s2">with everybody but creating in a way</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.820" end="00:21:26.530" style="s2">where we can honor that if we have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.580" end="00:21:28.090" style="s2">first get along on this planet before we</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.530" end="00:21:31.060" style="s2">can create anything it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.090" end="00:21:33.550" style="s2">happen so let&#39;s figure out how we create</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.060" end="00:21:35.380" style="s2">a better world well we can also disagree</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.550" end="00:21:37.930" style="s2">and also be on completely different</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.380" end="00:21:39.910" style="s2">sides you can like want me dead and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.930" end="00:21:46.060" style="s2">can still help you with a better life</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.910" end="00:21:47.470" style="s2">just no actual violence and so today</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.060" end="00:21:48.760" style="s2">there weren&#39;t a lot of questions I knew</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.470" end="00:21:51.430" style="s2">that was going to be the case because</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.760" end="00:21:54.970" style="s2">I&#39;m talking to myself for a while now um</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.430" end="00:21:56.200" style="s2">I am going to go since there are people</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.970" end="00:21:58.120" style="s2">asking questions that this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.200" end="00:22:00.040" style="s2">be weekly events I&#39;m gonna come on I</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.120" end="00:22:01.450" style="s2">will do a different topic next week it</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.040" end="00:22:02.950" style="s2">might be what the governance structure</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.450" end="00:22:05.890" style="s2">is what our board of directors is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.950" end="00:22:07.690" style="s2">look like and anyone can come on and ask</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.890" end="00:22:09.610" style="s2">any question about the technology</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.690" end="00:22:10.960" style="s2">cooperative and how do we create a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.610" end="00:22:12.679" style="s2">better world together and I will answer</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.960" end="00:22:13.730" style="s2">it because that&#39;s what my brain does</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.679" end="00:22:15.649" style="s2">I&#39;ll be able to sit down and write this</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.730" end="00:22:17.720" style="s2">in a book but it can answer questions</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.649" end="00:22:20.749" style="s2">and focus that way especially when I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.720" end="00:22:22.399" style="s2">look back at them and this how I end</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.749" end="00:22:25.220" style="s2">them all on YouTube I&#39;m three and daily</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.399" end="00:22:27.019" style="s2">videos is a better world is on its way</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.220" end="00:22:29.029" style="s2">and I&#39;ve never felt that more strongly</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.019" end="00:22:33.019" style="s2">than I do right now after what happened</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.029" end="00:22:35.269" style="s2">today who I was connected with which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.019" end="00:22:37.190" style="s2">now gonna be doing research on this new</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.269" end="00:22:38.509" style="s2">this thing I just I literally I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.190" end="00:22:41.869" style="s2">even know what it is that&#39;s how new it</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.509" end="00:22:45.619" style="s2">is called game B and being on this this</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.869" end="00:22:48.309" style="s2">phone call this morning I launched the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.619" end="00:22:50.330" style="s2">idea cafe on September 11 and that had</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.309" end="00:22:52.460" style="s2">so much meaning even though I did not</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.330" end="00:22:54.649" style="s2">mean to it all and how it came together</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.460" end="00:22:56.269" style="s2">was perfect and then I want him like</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.649" end="00:22:58.549" style="s2">what I also really just want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.269" end="00:23:00.769" style="s2">cooperative and so I created this space</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.549" end="00:23:03.169" style="s2">to do what I want to do which is answer</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.769" end="00:23:05.210" style="s2">questions on technology even though I am</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.169" end="00:23:07.909" style="s2">not first in technology not actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.210" end="00:23:10.070" style="s2">creating it I can&#39;t code I dislike slack</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.909" end="00:23:12.289" style="s2">I dislike discord because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.070" end="00:23:14.690" style="s2">work for my brain and yet I&#39;m like and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.289" end="00:23:16.580" style="s2">I&#39;m crazy the technology cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.690" end="00:23:19.639" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna fix it all cuz I&#39;m brain can</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.580" end="00:23:22.039" style="s2">create this it can create a new way to</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.639" end="00:23:24.080" style="s2">solve a problem with technology every</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.039" end="00:23:26.690" style="s2">time there&#39;s a problem it&#39;s well we</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.080" end="00:23:29.419" style="s2">hadn&#39;t after that and yet our eye can</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.690" end="00:23:31.789" style="s2">see how our world our economic system</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.419" end="00:23:33.619" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work to create apps not from</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.789" end="00:23:34.820" style="s2">scratch not in the grassroots because</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.619" end="00:23:36.139" style="s2">then you have to fight against the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.820" end="00:23:38.090" style="s2">system you have to fight against Google</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.139" end="00:23:39.499" style="s2">and how you make it is by being bought</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.090" end="00:23:41.990" style="s2">by them and then they have more power</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.499" end="00:23:43.460" style="s2">and we have less and so we can come</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.990" end="00:23:45.320" style="s2">together and create something that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.460" end="00:23:47.990" style="s2">for-profit companies will never be able</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.320" end="00:23:52.009" style="s2">to create we can do it out in the open</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.990" end="00:23:54.200" style="s2">for everyone to see because that gives</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.009" end="00:23:55.700" style="s2">us more power that gives us less</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.200" end="00:23:57.769" style="s2">likelihood that they can come in and</p>
