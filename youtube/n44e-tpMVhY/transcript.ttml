<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:05.069" style="s2">welcome to the Hard Day&#39;s Medicine</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.220" end="00:00:09.019" style="s2">inspirations podcast with Professor dr.</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.069" end="00:00:11.340" style="s2">yang Bolivar and Daniel SHM Acton Berger</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.019" end="00:00:13.500" style="s2">Thank You Daniel thank you for being</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.340" end="00:00:16.800" style="s2">with us today thanks for putting this</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.500" end="00:00:19.020" style="s2">together we had a chance today to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.800" end="00:00:20.850" style="s2">about harvest medicine during the board</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.020" end="00:00:25.500" style="s2">meeting and during the opening ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.850" end="00:00:27.930" style="s2">and just wondering what does heart based</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.500" end="00:00:31.220" style="s2">medicine look like for you if you were</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.930" end="00:00:31.220" style="s2">describe it in your own hands</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.879" end="00:00:36.300" style="s2">and the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.480" end="00:00:45.510" style="s2">in a sense that I have is that people</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.880" end="00:00:49.250" style="s2">are called to a life path in the healing</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.510" end="00:00:51.770" style="s2">professions because of a care for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.250" end="00:00:57.420" style="s2">quality of experience of other people</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.770" end="00:01:00.180" style="s2">and the actual sacredness of human life</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.420" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">and human experience and wanting to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.180" end="00:01:04.949" style="s2">in service to and devotion to that so</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:07.860" style="s2">heart based medicine would be with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.949" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">entire system of medicine and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.860" end="00:01:13.259" style="s2">interactions were designed from and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">service to that devotion in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.259" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">sacredness so heart based medicine is</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:28.410" style="s2">about a sacred space for you yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:30.270" style="s2">we think about medicine being preventing</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.410" end="00:01:35.369" style="s2">and correcting illness and promoting</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.270" end="00:01:36.899" style="s2">health people&#39;s experience of life and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.369" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">what they can do with their life to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.899" end="00:01:39.390" style="s2">affect the experience of others is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:42.179" style="s2">sacred</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.390" end="00:01:44.340" style="s2">so then medicine is what is in service</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.179" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">to their capacity to experience life</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.340" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2">fully and contributes life fully in many</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:52.410" style="s2">ways this is where medicine is coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:55.289" style="s2">from at least in our part of the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.410" end="00:01:56.910" style="s2">in our culture&#39;s that medicine was very</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.289" end="00:01:59.880" style="s2">much in the domain of the religious</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.910" end="00:02:02.340" style="s2">missions and that was the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.880" end="00:02:05.160" style="s2">of healthcare that was the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.340" end="00:02:11.459" style="s2">of care given and of elevating the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.160" end="00:02:13.590" style="s2">potential of the ones we serve yeah is</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.459" end="00:02:16.200" style="s2">this something very specific to to our</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">culture&#39;s most is something that you see</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.200" end="00:02:22.140" style="s2">as a she like as a principle beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:24.540" style="s2">kind of cultural and religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.140" end="00:02:28.770" style="s2">background Center we share Emerson here</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.540" end="00:02:30.750" style="s2">I think this might be as unifying a</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.770" end="00:02:34.950" style="s2">thing across cultures as there is in</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.750" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">terms of medicine women and medicine men</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.950" end="00:02:41.640" style="s2">and shamans and Chinese medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:42.990" style="s2">Ayurvedic medicine like early humans</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.640" end="00:02:44.909" style="s2">figuring out how do we care for each</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.990" end="00:02:45.850" style="s2">other how do we care for ourselves how</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.909" end="00:02:50.230" style="s2">do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.850" end="00:02:50.230" style="s2">prevent illness how do we fix illness</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.190" end="00:02:56.570" style="s2">obviously the whole focus to do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.620" end="00:02:58.490" style="s2">would be not just self-preservation but</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.570" end="00:03:00.290" style="s2">also care for each other so I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.490" end="00:03:03.980" style="s2">that&#39;s probably as unifying a thing as</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.290" end="00:03:05.380" style="s2">there is yeah so care is the unifying</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.980" end="00:03:08.570" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.380" end="00:03:14.030" style="s2">so if care is the unifying principle and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.570" end="00:03:17.720" style="s2">we see that all the talk in healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.030" end="00:03:23.060" style="s2">about the importance of care and we see</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.720" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">how it is delivered what do you see as</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.060" end="00:03:31.580" style="s2">the current the strongest obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:33.380" style="s2">those those elements in our current</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.580" end="00:03:35.330" style="s2">healthcare system in the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.380" end="00:03:39.860" style="s2">feel about healthcare what do you see as</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.330" end="00:03:42.070" style="s2">the trying obstacles to deliver the kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.860" end="00:03:50.570" style="s2">of care that we would perceive as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.070" end="00:03:52.670" style="s2">secret mm-hmm a lot actually and I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.570" end="00:03:56.270" style="s2">happy to unpack this but there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.670" end="00:03:58.459" style="s2">of systemic factors there&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.270" end="00:04:00.920" style="s2">trillions of dollars flowing through the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.459" end="00:04:02.780" style="s2">thing we call global healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.920" end="00:04:04.450" style="s2">industrial complex writ large and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.780" end="00:04:07.870" style="s2">pharmaceuticals and hospitals and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.450" end="00:04:11.180" style="s2">industries and insurance industries</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.870" end="00:04:13.790" style="s2">there&#39;s also all of the money in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.180" end="00:04:18.410" style="s2">world flowing through things that affect</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.790" end="00:04:20.180" style="s2">health when we look at the burning of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.410" end="00:04:22.280" style="s2">coal and oil and what that does to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.180" end="00:04:23.780" style="s2">environment that then we&#39;re embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.280" end="00:04:26.480" style="s2">and breathing and drinking the water</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.780" end="00:04:30.500" style="s2">from when we look at agriculture that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.480" end="00:04:33.710" style="s2">depletes the topsoil or sprays</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.500" end="00:04:35.720" style="s2">glyphosate on all the food like upstream</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.710" end="00:04:37.100" style="s2">from someone being sick and coming to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.720" end="00:04:38.990" style="s2">the hospital as do we actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.100" end="00:04:40.280" style="s2">civilization that&#39;s promoting health and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.990" end="00:04:42.919" style="s2">in how many places do we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.280" end="00:04:44.480" style="s2">civilization that through structures</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.919" end="00:04:47.210" style="s2">that creative liquidus psychological</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.480" end="00:04:49.669" style="s2">stress and structures that actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.210" end="00:04:52.730" style="s2">again expose us to the liquidus</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.669" end="00:04:56.510" style="s2">pollution and poor forms of nutrition</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.730" end="00:04:57.930" style="s2">when you just think about it like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.510" end="00:04:59.340" style="s2">goal of almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.930" end="00:05:01.139" style="s2">every business is to maximize the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.340" end="00:05:02.580" style="s2">lifetime revenue of a customer and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.139" end="00:05:05.009" style="s2">nothing does that better than addiction</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.580" end="00:05:07.500" style="s2">obviously the the supply side might be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.009" end="00:05:09.870" style="s2">multi-billion dollar company relative to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.500" end="00:05:12.900" style="s2">an individual consumer and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.870" end="00:05:15.720" style="s2">kind of asymmetric warfare in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.900" end="00:05:19.160" style="s2">their capacity to influence with</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.720" end="00:05:23.190" style="s2">commercial media you know so many things</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.160" end="00:05:25.320" style="s2">so if we wanted a society that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.190" end="00:05:28.050" style="s2">promoting maximum health we would want</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.320" end="00:05:31.080" style="s2">to be minimizing addiction everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.050" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">which would mean that any place where</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.080" end="00:05:35.130" style="s2">addiction was profitable we would have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:38.340" style="s2">fundamental conflict we&#39;d have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.130" end="00:05:41.880" style="s2">perverse incentive in the nature of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.340" end="00:05:44.280" style="s2">type of market dynamic so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.880" end="00:05:47.400" style="s2">think there&#39;s a huge amount of perverse</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.280" end="00:05:51.810" style="s2">incentive that&#39;s one place where there</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.400" end="00:05:56.520" style="s2">are structural issues I think that there</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.810" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">are places where out of caution because</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.520" end="00:06:01.349" style="s2">of malpractice and whatever else</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:03.210" style="s2">hospitals create policies there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.349" end="00:06:04.949" style="s2">insurance guidelines that actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.210" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">allow doctors to do things that would</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.949" end="00:06:11.699" style="s2">demonstrate certain kinds of care I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:13.500" style="s2">think that we have a medical school</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.699" end="00:06:15.810" style="s2">system where the average amount of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.500" end="00:06:17.760" style="s2">nutrition that is taught to a medical</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.810" end="00:06:19.199" style="s2">doctor is extraordinarily low relative</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.760" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">to the importance of nutrition and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.199" end="00:06:25.139" style="s2">health but similarly how much psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.940" style="s2">should actually be taught so that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.139" end="00:06:28.770" style="s2">doctor can actually really understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.940" end="00:06:31.220" style="s2">the experience of the patient well and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.770" end="00:06:33.539" style="s2">be able to relate and work through that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.220" end="00:06:36.630" style="s2">should be a much bigger percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.539" end="00:06:41.789" style="s2">the training that occurs I think we also</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.630" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">have a situation where you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.789" end="00:06:47.639" style="s2">actually measure the felt sense of love</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:49.320" style="s2">and care in the same way that you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.639" end="00:06:51.810" style="s2">measure cholesterol and blood pressure</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.320" end="00:06:52.650" style="s2">and so you end up optimizing for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.810" end="00:06:56.520" style="s2">things that you measure</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.650" end="00:06:59.099" style="s2">I think MRI machines are expensive and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.520" end="00:07:00.780" style="s2">they&#39;re important so you make big</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.099" end="00:07:02.430" style="s2">hospitals that a lot of people go to as</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.780" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">opposed to small County clinics and</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.430" end="00:07:06.270" style="s2">because there&#39;s economies of scale but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:07.440" style="s2">think the economies of scale mean you</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.270" end="00:07:08.490" style="s2">don&#39;t really know your doctor your</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.440" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">doctor doesn&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.490" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">you&#39;re one of maybe hundreds or</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:14.729" style="s2">thousands of people that they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:17.099" style="s2">to see and so I think again the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.729" end="00:07:18.750" style="s2">economies of scale end up really</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.099" end="00:07:21.419" style="s2">damaging personal connection and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.750" end="00:07:24.440" style="s2">personal rapport I think the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.419" end="00:07:28.759" style="s2">important diagnostic tool there is is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.440" end="00:07:31.080" style="s2">really detailed medical intake and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.759" end="00:07:33.750" style="s2">really having the time to think through</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.080" end="00:07:35.880" style="s2">and pay attention and then a continuity</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.750" end="00:07:37.889" style="s2">of being able to think about that for</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.880" end="00:07:40.319" style="s2">the patient and there&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.889" end="00:07:42.870" style="s2">requires a certain amount of time being</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.319" end="00:07:45.000" style="s2">allocated so I think there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.870" end="00:07:49.460" style="s2">structural factors that are oriented to</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.000" end="00:07:53.580" style="s2">things like lowering liability and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.460" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">maximizing profit and economies of scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.580" end="00:07:58.349" style="s2">all of which are not optimized for what</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:08:02.610" style="s2">supposedly the whole thing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.349" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">serviced - mmm thank you that makes a</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.610" end="00:08:11.009" style="s2">lot of sense resonate very much with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:12.930" style="s2">importance of intake that is based on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.009" end="00:08:14.550" style="s2">deep listening really being present as</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.930" end="00:08:16.409" style="s2">the patient understanding where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.550" end="00:08:19.860" style="s2">coming from and seeing that disease</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.409" end="00:08:21.659" style="s2">through their eyes where you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.860" end="00:08:23.370" style="s2">about you&#39;re touching on many issues but</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.659" end="00:08:27.330" style="s2">you are also touching on one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.370" end="00:08:31.740" style="s2">points you are raising is that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.330" end="00:08:35.130" style="s2">person&#39;s subjective experience of their</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.740" end="00:08:37.260" style="s2">disease and how they feel and what it</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.130" end="00:08:39.990" style="s2">means to their lives is something that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.260" end="00:08:42.450" style="s2">is worth exploring and yet it is hard to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.990" end="00:08:49.079" style="s2">measure so the measures that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.450" end="00:08:51.180" style="s2">currently have available are I think too</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.079" end="00:08:53.850" style="s2">crude or are they just is it just</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.180" end="00:08:56.540" style="s2">structurally impossible to measure the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.850" end="00:08:56.540" style="s2">subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.430" end="00:09:04.620" style="s2">well bye-bye definition it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.040" end="00:09:06.700" style="s2">structurally impossible to measure</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.620" end="00:09:08.830" style="s2">subjective experience a measurement</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.700" end="00:09:11.080" style="s2">means some needle move means it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.830" end="00:09:13.900" style="s2">domain of the object or third person I</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.080" end="00:09:16.900" style="s2">can measure a neural correlate I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.900" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">measure a endocrine correlate otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.900" end="00:09:21.760" style="s2">I have to actually listen to the person</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:23.170" style="s2">report their own experience then of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.760" end="00:09:25.140" style="s2">course we&#39;re gonna have all the biases</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.170" end="00:09:28.060" style="s2">that self reporting has and someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.140" end="00:09:29.530" style="s2">having reasons they don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.060" end="00:09:31.480" style="s2">how miserable they are or they want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.530" end="00:09:41.530" style="s2">exaggerate it for empathy or they have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.480" end="00:09:44.290" style="s2">limited vocabulary to express it so I do</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.530" end="00:09:46.860" style="s2">think that there is a need for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.290" end="00:09:50.860" style="s2">question asking of things that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.860" end="00:09:53.110" style="s2">measured in blood tests so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.860" end="00:09:54.820" style="s2">deal with this approach so we we know</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.110" end="00:09:57.910" style="s2">that when we talk to patients that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.820" end="00:10:00.610" style="s2">find out things and as you say there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.910" end="00:10:02.560" style="s2">biases so there&#39;s the preferences</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.610" end="00:10:04.090" style="s2">there&#39;s recall there is you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.560" end="00:10:06.100" style="s2">all sorts of things that that affect</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.090" end="00:10:08.560" style="s2">this and and a lot of the approaches</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.100" end="00:10:11.080" style="s2">that we take in in everyday routine</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.560" end="00:10:14.050" style="s2">clinics is trying to bring some insert</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.080" end="00:10:16.390" style="s2">some objectivity into this assessment</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.050" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">seeing to what degree can we rely on</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.390" end="00:10:24.580" style="s2">this but in a way what we do is we take</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:26.680" style="s2">our tests that we apply our observations</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.580" end="00:10:29.170" style="s2">of that person that we call objective</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.680" end="00:10:31.660" style="s2">observations we take those as the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.170" end="00:10:35.320" style="s2">reference point and whatever the patient</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.660" end="00:10:37.870" style="s2">says is measured against that yeah when</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.320" end="00:10:39.460" style="s2">I kill you correctly then what we really</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.870" end="00:10:41.740" style="s2">want to do is we want to improve on</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.460" end="00:10:44.400" style="s2">understanding the subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.740" end="00:10:46.900" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.400" end="00:10:49.210" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s there&#39;s a number of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.900" end="00:10:51.670" style="s2">parts we can look at here there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.210" end="00:10:54.190" style="s2">way that someone&#39;s subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.670" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">affects their objective physiology right</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.190" end="00:10:57.280" style="s2">- the whole domain of</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:11:00.360" style="s2">psychoneuroimmunology and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.280" end="00:11:03.550" style="s2">stress affects health and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.360" end="00:11:07.660" style="s2">better psychological disposition placebo</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.550" end="00:11:10.140" style="s2">dynamics etc affect health so we want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.660" end="00:11:12.150" style="s2">actually be able to work with people</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.140" end="00:11:14.820" style="s2">subjective experience as part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.150" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">medicine that&#39;s one thing the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.820" end="00:11:18.330" style="s2">thing is that some people might have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:20.130" style="s2">disease that can&#39;t be cured and actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.330" end="00:11:22.740" style="s2">still have a good subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.130" end="00:11:24.420" style="s2">of life based on their focus and their</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.740" end="00:11:27.090" style="s2">meaning making versus having a totally</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.420" end="00:11:29.700" style="s2">ruined experience of life so subjective</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.090" end="00:11:32.720" style="s2">experience is a terminal value in and of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.700" end="00:11:35.520" style="s2">itself it so it is both useful for</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.720" end="00:11:37.290" style="s2">supporting objective physiologic health</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.520" end="00:11:41.150" style="s2">and it is intrinsically valuable</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.290" end="00:11:43.800" style="s2">independent of physiologic health</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.150" end="00:11:45.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of other reasons to talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.800" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">for patient and ask them questions</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.210" end="00:11:53.970" style="s2">though you and I were talking before</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:55.530" style="s2">that modern allopathic medicine does a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.970" end="00:11:56.970" style="s2">really good job in places where we</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.530" end="00:12:01.380" style="s2">actually understand the causation</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.970" end="00:12:02.610" style="s2">clearly and generally that tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.380" end="00:12:04.500" style="s2">more in the direction of things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.610" end="00:12:07.170" style="s2">were acute like an acute injury it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.500" end="00:12:08.700" style="s2">pretty clear like oh there was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.170" end="00:12:11.400" style="s2">puncture wound we&#39;re gonna sew up the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.700" end="00:12:13.410" style="s2">puncture wound or there was an acute</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.400" end="00:12:15.060" style="s2">infection and we can see what type of</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.410" end="00:12:17.040" style="s2">infection it is maybe an antibiotic can</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.060" end="00:12:18.420" style="s2">treat it or there was a acute poisoning</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.040" end="00:12:20.970" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna do in a huge kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.420" end="00:12:22.440" style="s2">detox but there was a acute incident and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.970" end="00:12:25.890" style="s2">then immediate symptom ology and we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.440" end="00:12:29.160" style="s2">trace causation but with autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.890" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">disease and with cognitive decline and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.160" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">neurodegenerative disease and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:38.010" style="s2">psychiatric disease and cancer that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:39.840" style="s2">not the case and so for the most part we</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.010" end="00:12:45.320" style="s2">don&#39;t actually know why those things are</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.840" end="00:12:47.250" style="s2">happening and it happens to be my belief</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.320" end="00:12:48.570" style="s2">similar to much of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.250" end="00:12:53.670" style="s2">functional medicine and naturopathic</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.570" end="00:12:55.620" style="s2">world that most of those diseases are</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.670" end="00:12:57.060" style="s2">multifactorial they don&#39;t have one cause</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.620" end="00:12:59.430" style="s2">they have a lot of causes and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.060" end="00:13:00.840" style="s2">the same set of causes every time so</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.430" end="00:13:02.730" style="s2">there actually isn&#39;t one thing called</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.840" end="00:13:05.220" style="s2">rheumatoid arthritis or one thing called</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.730" end="00:13:07.620" style="s2">MS from a path audiology point of view</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.220" end="00:13:08.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a system that&#39;s being exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.620" end="00:13:10.680" style="s2">things that don&#39;t create immediate</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.640" end="00:13:13.290" style="s2">symptom ology but that are dis</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.680" end="00:13:15.960" style="s2">regulating homeo dynamics and those</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.290" end="00:13:18.150" style="s2">dysregulated homeo dynamics make one</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.960" end="00:13:20.070" style="s2">more susceptible to the additional</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.150" end="00:13:22.050" style="s2">stressors dis regulating homeo dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.070" end="00:13:23.400" style="s2">more until eventually we caught cross a</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.050" end="00:13:25.560" style="s2">threshold and now we get</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.400" end="00:13:27.570" style="s2">symptom ology and biomarkers and a</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.560" end="00:13:32.760" style="s2">cluster of symptoms II and biomarkers</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.570" end="00:13:33.840" style="s2">gets a disease name and but if I really</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.760" end="00:13:38.570" style="s2">start paying attention to those things</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.840" end="00:13:41.820" style="s2">and wanting to be able to trace a</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.570" end="00:13:44.160" style="s2">complex causal situation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.820" end="00:13:47.580" style="s2">multifactorial and maybe very delayed</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.160" end="00:13:49.980" style="s2">causation and time then I want a totally</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.580" end="00:13:52.230" style="s2">different kind of intake right I might</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.980" end="00:13:53.730" style="s2">want to be asking really detailed</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.230" end="00:13:56.250" style="s2">questions to see when they&#39;ve ever been</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.730" end="00:13:58.890" style="s2">exposed to mold when they were ever</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.250" end="00:14:00.360" style="s2">exposed to industrial chemicals or they</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.890" end="00:14:02.010" style="s2">spend a lot of time with epoxy at a</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.360" end="00:14:03.540" style="s2">certain point or whatever it is or when</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.010" end="00:14:06.540" style="s2">they had third world travels where they</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.540" end="00:14:08.610" style="s2">got nasty infections and what symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.540" end="00:14:10.140" style="s2">so I want a timeline of when different</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.610" end="00:14:11.550" style="s2">symptoms kicked on and a timeline of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.140" end="00:14:13.380" style="s2">different kinds of stresses and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.550" end="00:14:15.420" style="s2">exposures when there was a micro</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.380" end="00:14:16.950" style="s2">traumatic brain injury that didn&#39;t show</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.420" end="00:14:18.510" style="s2">up in an MRI but it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.950" end="00:14:20.010" style="s2">there actually wasn&#39;t a micro TBI that</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.010" end="00:14:28.400" style="s2">brain and if I&#39;m able to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.170" end="00:14:31.200" style="s2">current symptomology the current labs</p>

<p begin="00:14:31.200" end="00:14:35.820" style="s2">progression of exposures and have all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.720" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">that fit together and make sense and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.820" end="00:14:39.510" style="s2">might be informed as to how to start a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:42.900" style="s2">treatment that is actually addressing</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.510" end="00:14:45.030" style="s2">more than just symptom ology and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.900" end="00:14:46.740" style="s2">know disease manifestation mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.030" end="00:14:49.800" style="s2">there&#39;s no one going to get that without</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.740" end="00:14:52.620" style="s2">asking them a lot of questions yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.800" end="00:14:55.680" style="s2">is there you do you feel that this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.620" end="00:15:01.460" style="s2">this is an area of research that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.680" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">developing I mean I I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.460" end="00:15:04.650" style="s2">environmental medicine functional</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:06.960" style="s2">medicine and naturopathic medicine</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.650" end="00:15:09.390" style="s2">communities have been focused on with</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.960" end="00:15:12.840" style="s2">chronic complex illness in particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.390" end="00:15:17.580" style="s2">where that best modern treatments are</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.840" end="00:15:19.890" style="s2">mostly symptomatic you know and not just</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.580" end="00:15:24.390" style="s2">symptomatic or biologic can actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.890" end="00:15:27.180" style="s2">decrease the total tissue damage from a</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.390" end="00:15:30.120" style="s2">connective tissue disorder and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.180" end="00:15:31.770" style="s2">if we&#39;re cutting a cancer out or</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.120" end="00:15:33.480" style="s2">radiating it out or poisoning it out</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.770" end="00:15:36.390" style="s2">that&#39;s still better than leaving it</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.480" end="00:15:37.139" style="s2">there often times but why was there</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.390" end="00:15:39.809" style="s2">increased cars</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.139" end="00:15:41.160" style="s2">Genesis in the first place and why did</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.809" end="00:15:42.869" style="s2">the body&#39;s immune system not deal with</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.160" end="00:15:44.220" style="s2">the carcinogenesis are still applying</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.869" end="00:15:45.720" style="s2">questions especially if we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.220" end="00:15:47.249" style="s2">this person to get cancer again and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.720" end="00:15:50.189" style="s2">especially if the things that might have</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.249" end="00:15:53.029" style="s2">led to it might be signs of underlying</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.189" end="00:15:56.850" style="s2">dysregulation that affect other things</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.029" end="00:15:59.489" style="s2">so I think there is a increasing</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.850" end="00:16:03.480" style="s2">awareness that chronic complex illness</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.489" end="00:16:05.929" style="s2">is not just stupid bodies it is just</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.480" end="00:16:08.489" style="s2">kind of deeper complexity where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.929" end="00:16:12.540" style="s2">one disease one cause and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.489" end="00:16:14.699" style="s2">have one pill it is radically complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.540" end="00:16:17.309" style="s2">regulatory systems many different</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.699" end="00:16:23.100" style="s2">elements of causation that end up</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.309" end="00:16:25.259" style="s2">leading to things that present like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.100" end="00:16:28.169" style="s2">cluster of symptoms and biomarkers we</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.259" end="00:16:30.139" style="s2">call it disease and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.169" end="00:16:32.790" style="s2">fascinating is it I think in most of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.139" end="00:16:34.769" style="s2">research that received published today</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.790" end="00:16:38.129" style="s2">most of the clinical researchers means</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.769" end="00:16:40.980" style="s2">maybe see published today what I observe</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.129" end="00:16:42.959" style="s2">is that they skim attic the methodology</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.980" end="00:16:44.879" style="s2">is very much the same so we kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.959" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">two up two points of observation and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.879" end="00:16:51.329" style="s2">between the two points of observation we</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.279" end="00:16:53.160" style="s2">assume a linear correlation but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.329" end="00:16:55.860" style="s2">look at our Q if you look at the classic</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.160" end="00:16:58.079" style="s2">table one in a publication where we were</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.860" end="00:17:01.410" style="s2">looking at the demographics comparing</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.079" end="00:17:03.179" style="s2">the two groups you know three or four or</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.410" end="00:17:06.380" style="s2">five different variables so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.179" end="00:17:11.959" style="s2">looking at you know its gender ethnicity</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.380" end="00:17:14.490" style="s2">age so really really crude variables and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.959" end="00:17:16.980" style="s2">at the end everybody feels comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.490" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">that both groups are comparable while</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.980" end="00:17:21.630" style="s2">we&#39;re not looking at it so it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:23.819" style="s2">happens before the trial</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.630" end="00:17:25.860" style="s2">what are these life stories well as this</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.819" end="00:17:32.190" style="s2">what is this</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.860" end="00:17:35.540" style="s2">the complex of Romeo dynamic regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.190" end="00:17:38.400" style="s2">systems interacting with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.540" end="00:17:41.100" style="s2">building up in a way that that we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.400" end="00:17:43.170" style="s2">great difficulties to establish we</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.100" end="00:17:48.120" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t have any measures or</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.170" end="00:17:50.250" style="s2">markers for this when we establish these</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.120" end="00:17:53.340" style="s2">let&#39;s say if we get better at asking</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.250" end="00:17:57.270" style="s2">questions and really getting at least a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.340" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">reporting picture of what happened do</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.270" end="00:18:02.910" style="s2">you feel that the if we basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:05.400" style="s2">exploded the number of variables from</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.910" end="00:18:08.910" style="s2">you know age and sex and ethnicity to</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.400" end="00:18:15.660" style="s2">two maybe let&#39;s say 200 or 500 variables</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.910" end="00:18:20.910" style="s2">so if we were compiling this index of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.660" end="00:18:24.210" style="s2">measures or indicators would we really</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.910" end="00:18:31.640" style="s2">learn more about what happened before an</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.210" end="00:18:31.640" style="s2">event yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.160" end="00:18:37.290" style="s2">what are the right methods to gain the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.010" end="00:18:40.530" style="s2">kinds of insights we want and domain as</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.290" end="00:18:43.140" style="s2">complex as human physiology is a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.530" end="00:18:45.510" style="s2">interesting question if we look at a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.140" end="00:18:47.100" style="s2">clinical trial say for drug research</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.510" end="00:18:51.600" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to see does this drug do</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.100" end="00:18:53.310" style="s2">something beyond the placebo we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:56.550" style="s2">get something like a Gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.310" end="00:18:57.870" style="s2">distribution where all we you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.550" end="00:18:59.970" style="s2">gonna work pretty well for some people</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.870" end="00:19:01.350" style="s2">and it&#39;s gonna work not well for other</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.970" end="00:19:02.520" style="s2">people and there will be some range of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.350" end="00:19:04.050" style="s2">effect for a lot of people we just want</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.520" end="00:19:05.190" style="s2">to see that that&#39;s some range of effect</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.050" end="00:19:08.040" style="s2">and maybe the front of the bell curve is</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.190" end="00:19:09.450" style="s2">better than what a placebo is but why it</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.040" end="00:19:11.190" style="s2">works really well for these people and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.450" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">not really well for these people or</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.190" end="00:19:14.520" style="s2">maybe even really badly for these people</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:15.870" style="s2">is a bunch of other variables that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.520" end="00:19:18.900" style="s2">just hidden under the shape of a bell</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.870" end="00:19:24.450" style="s2">curve and so obviously we would like to</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.900" end="00:19:27.090" style="s2">find that out so that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.450" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">that is a worthless study that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.090" end="00:19:35.850" style="s2">interesting study that it if we go all</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:37.500" style="s2">the way to the other end we get how can</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.850" end="00:19:40.260" style="s2">we get as much information about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.500" end="00:19:43.050" style="s2">one person as possible rather than this</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.260" end="00:19:44.010" style="s2">one drug across all people right how can</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.050" end="00:19:45.780" style="s2">give as much information about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.010" end="00:19:47.550" style="s2">person and now we&#39;re starting to do N</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.780" end="00:19:50.520" style="s2">equals one kinds of studies and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.550" end="00:19:52.530" style="s2">optimization so I totally think there</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.520" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">are places for clinical trials of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.530" end="00:19:57.180" style="s2">if we have more metrics if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:58.890" style="s2">appropriate metrics additional insight</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.180" end="00:20:00.570" style="s2">comes because it&#39;s not just are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.890" end="00:20:01.980" style="s2">likely to be able to see more things but</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.570" end="00:20:03.480" style="s2">you also start to get to see what are</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.980" end="00:20:08.820" style="s2">the relationships between these metrics</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.480" end="00:20:12.120" style="s2">and are there combinatorial insights but</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.820" end="00:20:14.010" style="s2">as soon as I realize that I&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.120" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">looking at a genome I&#39;m looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.010" end="00:20:20.550" style="s2">combinatorics on all of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:24.120" style="s2">polymorphisms possible on all of the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.550" end="00:20:26.400" style="s2">genes and then all the combinatorics on</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.120" end="00:20:28.320" style="s2">the epigenome and then the proteome</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.400" end="00:20:29.700" style="s2">recursively changing it we&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.320" end="00:20:34.260" style="s2">going to be able to compute all that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.700" end="00:20:36.210" style="s2">is actually not computable so there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.260" end="00:20:38.340" style="s2">better ways we have to think about how</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.210" end="00:20:40.910" style="s2">do we actually understand what health is</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.340" end="00:20:43.910" style="s2">and if we think about hope health has</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.910" end="00:20:46.250" style="s2">the integrity of the regulatory system</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.910" end="00:20:48.230" style="s2">so the homeo dynamics of how the body</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.250" end="00:20:50.750" style="s2">self organizes and self-regulates and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.230" end="00:20:53.110" style="s2">the homeo dynamic not just the homeo</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.750" end="00:20:55.760" style="s2">dynamic state the Tomeo dynamic capacity</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.110" end="00:20:57.890" style="s2">I&#39;d like typically most of the studies</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:21:00.100" style="s2">that most of tests we do in medicine are</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.890" end="00:21:02.210" style="s2">testing state so we&#39;re testing</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.100" end="00:21:05.690" style="s2">cholesterol level or we&#39;re testing blood</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.210" end="00:21:07.070" style="s2">sugar or whatever it is but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.690" end="00:21:10.070" style="s2">really going to determine the overall</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.070" end="00:21:12.530" style="s2">health is much more related to under</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.070" end="00:21:14.780" style="s2">some kind of stress how does the body</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.530" end="00:21:17.000" style="s2">maintain being within homeo dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.780" end="00:21:18.830" style="s2">range so you know we do this sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.000" end="00:21:20.810" style="s2">with a glucose stress test or with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.830" end="00:21:22.700" style="s2">stress echo cardiogram and those are</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.810" end="00:21:24.230" style="s2">super insightful but there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.700" end="00:21:27.350" style="s2">things we don&#39;t do those with work it</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.230" end="00:21:28.760" style="s2">might be in range but very fragile and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.350" end="00:21:30.530" style="s2">could come out of range easily which</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.760" end="00:21:33.080" style="s2">means that the person doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.530" end="00:21:38.420" style="s2">disease but they&#39;re very susceptible and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.080" end="00:21:41.480" style="s2">so yet if I see very high homeo dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.420" end="00:21:45.610" style="s2">capacity across lots of axes that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.480" end="00:21:48.200" style="s2">measure of the robustness of health so</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.610" end="00:21:54.050" style="s2">you know different types of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.200" end="00:22:01.130" style="s2">diagnostics in the future so we are so</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.050" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">what I hear from you is assuming linear</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.130" end="00:22:09.260" style="s2">you need causal association is as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:13.970" style="s2">degree of simplification that silly is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.260" end="00:22:17.750" style="s2">really not very helpful maybe for some</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.970" end="00:22:23.090" style="s2">things in the knife wound case it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.750" end="00:22:26.270" style="s2">yeah except we need to ask you know are</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.090" end="00:22:27.650" style="s2">they clumsy or are they getting in knife</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.270" end="00:22:31.040" style="s2">fights for dumb reason so there might be</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.650" end="00:22:35.320" style="s2">something upstream but so for some</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.040" end="00:22:37.670" style="s2">things you need causal is fine but for</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.320" end="00:22:39.650" style="s2">most anything that emerged not</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.670" end="00:22:42.980" style="s2">immediately following an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.650" end="00:22:46.310" style="s2">causation event this is why we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.980" end="00:22:49.700" style="s2">actually have real cures we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.310" end="00:22:51.890" style="s2">symptomatic treatments and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.700" end="00:22:56.690" style="s2">ameliorative treatments for most complex</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.890" end="00:23:00.680" style="s2">chronic disease so the etiology of</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.690" end="00:23:02.870" style="s2">disease we will more likely find answers</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.680" end="00:23:06.110" style="s2">for what is the real cause of disease if</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.870" end="00:23:10.670" style="s2">we look at our models and we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.110" end="00:23:12.560" style="s2">the period before that this is started</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.670" end="00:23:14.540" style="s2">before the symptoms of her and see what</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.560" end="00:23:18.520" style="s2">what are the different factors that have</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.540" end="00:23:18.520" style="s2">built up and reached that threshold yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.220" end="00:23:30.490" style="s2">when you speculate about what might be</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.840" end="00:23:30.490" style="s2">their areas</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.860" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">that effect the human body what are the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.510" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">areas that if they stuck up will lead to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:46.220" style="s2">an imbalance of dysregulation that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:48.799" style="s2">becomes symptomatic yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.220" end="00:23:50.030" style="s2">there&#39;s some actual pretty simple models</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.799" end="00:23:52.580" style="s2">we can start to look at this</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.030" end="00:23:55.870" style="s2">comprehensively through so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.580" end="00:23:59.620" style="s2">Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.870" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">actually had some kind of good holistic</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.620" end="00:24:03.230" style="s2">sure it&#39;s thickest to start with even</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:06.230" style="s2">though they didn&#39;t have all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.230" end="00:24:07.940" style="s2">assessments we have like say you take a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.230" end="00:24:09.320" style="s2">roughly Chinese medicine point of view</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.940" end="00:24:10.520" style="s2">of where is there too much of something</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.320" end="00:24:13.850" style="s2">where is there not enough of something</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.520" end="00:24:17.500" style="s2">so toxicity and deficiency this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.850" end="00:24:21.860" style="s2">pretty good starting model for</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.500" end="00:24:24.500" style="s2">predispositions towards disease so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.860" end="00:24:28.610" style="s2">can think about that we evolved to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.500" end="00:24:31.030" style="s2">able to like our genetics evolved to</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.610" end="00:24:33.830" style="s2">have a certain set of behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.030" end="00:24:38.380" style="s2">interacting with a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.830" end="00:24:41.299" style="s2">environmental parameters so where our</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.380" end="00:24:44.299" style="s2">behaviors are very different then kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.299" end="00:24:45.799" style="s2">of what we evolved to handle or where</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.299" end="00:24:46.700" style="s2">our environment is meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.799" end="00:24:49.179" style="s2">different those are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.700" end="00:24:52.190" style="s2">interesting things to look at so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.179" end="00:24:53.210" style="s2">know too much well too much can look</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.190" end="00:24:56.929" style="s2">like things that we shouldn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.210" end="00:24:59.210" style="s2">amount of like glyphosate and pesticides</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.929" end="00:25:02.030" style="s2">and you know and we&#39;re really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.210" end="00:25:03.650" style="s2">Ubiquiti sley exposed to the volatile</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.030" end="00:25:06.160" style="s2">organic compounds coming out of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.650" end="00:25:08.809" style="s2">carpet and out of the panes right this</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.160" end="00:25:12.610" style="s2">we have built a world that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.809" end="00:25:15.530" style="s2">actually not genetically fit for where</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.610" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">there are externalities to our health of</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.530" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">the ways that we do lots of things and</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:21.980" style="s2">so when you look at all the volatile</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">organic compounds or all of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.980" end="00:25:24.860" style="s2">petrochemicals that are in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:27.230" style="s2">environment most of them are either</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.860" end="00:25:29.660" style="s2">endocrine disruptors or neurotoxins or</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.230" end="00:25:31.910" style="s2">percentage ins so then we look at how</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.660" end="00:25:36.290" style="s2">many diseases fit into those being part</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.910" end="00:25:37.340" style="s2">of the underlying ideology think so too</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.290" end="00:25:38.090" style="s2">much things that shouldn&#39;t have really</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.340" end="00:25:44.299" style="s2">been there at all</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.090" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">and but obviously too much sugar or you</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.299" end="00:25:50.150" style="s2">know the there can be excesses of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:53.000" style="s2">certain nutrients in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.150" end="00:25:55.700" style="s2">other nutrients like zinc copper balance</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.000" end="00:25:58.940" style="s2">or calcium magnesium balance or things</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.700" end="00:26:03.169" style="s2">like that obviously we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.940" end="00:26:04.610" style="s2">limited to talking about environmental</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.169" end="00:26:06.169" style="s2">toxins that aren&#39;t alive we can also</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.610" end="00:26:08.240" style="s2">talk about things that are alive so</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.169" end="00:26:10.190" style="s2">infection would be kind of a subclass of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:12.590" style="s2">too much of something and that can</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.190" end="00:26:14.510" style="s2">either be things that should be there</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.590" end="00:26:17.870" style="s2">but they&#39;re overgrown like SIBO and</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.510" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">other kinds of microbiome disorders or</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.870" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">actual infections but pathogens that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:28.549" style="s2">not normally part of our healthy kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:30.710" style="s2">microbiome and this is where the concept</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.549" end="00:26:33.559" style="s2">of a subclinical infection or a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.710" end="00:26:36.350" style="s2">subclinical toxicity is important which</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.559" end="00:26:38.330" style="s2">is let&#39;s say that I have a level of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.350" end="00:26:40.159" style="s2">mercury exposure or a level of lead</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.330" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">exposure where we&#39;re gonna say oh yes I</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.159" end="00:26:42.409" style="s2">have lead poisoning</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:44.390" style="s2">well lead poisoning is at this threshold</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.409" end="00:26:46.490" style="s2">but the ideal amount of lead that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.390" end="00:26:48.830" style="s2">would have would be down here well</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.490" end="00:26:50.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole level in here which is I</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.830" end="00:26:52.490" style="s2">don&#39;t yet have the level that we were</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.450" end="00:26:55.490" style="s2">diagnosed with acute lead poisoning that</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.490" end="00:26:57.289" style="s2">is more than none it has some effect and</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.490" end="00:26:58.820" style="s2">that also ends up being true with</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.289" end="00:27:01.750" style="s2">infections that are not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.820" end="00:27:05.529" style="s2">showing up as a cute infection but are</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.750" end="00:27:08.210" style="s2">testable and that have effect so we see</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.529" end="00:27:11.240" style="s2">Helicobacter pylori in the stomach being</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.210" end="00:27:14.230" style="s2">able to cause ulcers and cause stomach</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.240" end="00:27:17.390" style="s2">cancer over a very long time period or H</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.230" end="00:27:19.669" style="s2">P V and cervical cancer or throat cancer</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.390" end="00:27:22.100" style="s2">things like that for those few that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.669" end="00:27:24.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve found recently it&#39;s pretty safe to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.100" end="00:27:26.659" style="s2">assume that there&#39;s a lot more like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.200" end="00:27:28.220" style="s2">where the correlations are just not as</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.659" end="00:27:30.470" style="s2">clear yet and that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.220" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">that again some of the infectious study</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.470" end="00:27:33.919" style="s2">and environmental toxicology studies</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:38.840" style="s2">that functional medicine is doing I</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.919" end="00:27:41.750" style="s2">think are really interesting so too much</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.840" end="00:27:43.549" style="s2">of various things not enough of and</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.750" end="00:27:46.130" style="s2">obviously we can look at things like not</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.549" end="00:27:48.150" style="s2">enough exercise not enough sleep not</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.130" end="00:27:52.030" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.150" end="00:27:56.190" style="s2">human contact the amount of human</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.030" end="00:27:56.190" style="s2">contact is actually profound because</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.180" end="00:28:03.430" style="s2">that ends up being one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.380" end="00:28:05.020" style="s2">profound drivers of addiction which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.430" end="00:28:08.350" style="s2">then gonna cause so many other health</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.020" end="00:28:13.000" style="s2">issues but also not enough of specific</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.350" end="00:28:17.350" style="s2">nutrients and we see that we have a you</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.000" end="00:28:18.940" style="s2">know modern American diet or modern</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.350" end="00:28:21.190" style="s2">industrial world diet it&#39;s very high in</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.940" end="00:28:24.370" style="s2">macronutrients and often low in really</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.190" end="00:28:25.980" style="s2">critical micronutrients and longevity is</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.370" end="00:28:27.640" style="s2">usually best optimized by lower</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.980" end="00:28:30.460" style="s2">macronutrients and higher micronutrients</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.640" end="00:28:33.910" style="s2">which is closer to what evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.460" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">environments would have so that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.910" end="00:28:40.390" style="s2">studying framework mmm thank you so here</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:43.540" style="s2">you have identified areas of risk</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.390" end="00:28:45.820" style="s2">factors and if they&#39;re compiling they</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.540" end="00:28:47.800" style="s2">might add so these are the areas that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.820" end="00:28:50.530" style="s2">would like to explore further and more</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.800" end="00:28:52.120" style="s2">deeply in in an intake as you described</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.530" end="00:28:53.290" style="s2">it where we asked lots of questions and</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.120" end="00:28:56.320" style="s2">trying to understand what happened</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.290" end="00:29:00.130" style="s2">before that the patient has reached a</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:29:02.020" style="s2">stage of disease yeah when we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.130" end="00:29:05.700" style="s2">a lot of time than talking to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.020" end="00:29:08.800" style="s2">patient&#39;s when you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.700" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">systemic factors the limiting factors of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.800" end="00:29:14.770" style="s2">how we are setting up our healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:17.350" style="s2">system certainly I I feel that limited</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.770" end="00:29:18.040" style="s2">time is a critical factor we need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.350" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">make choices</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.040" end="00:29:24.490" style="s2">we need to make choices about what</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:27.400" style="s2">questions to ask and one way is to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.490" end="00:29:31.090" style="s2">through a protocol one way is to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.400" end="00:29:34.150" style="s2">through a long list of questions and ask</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.090" end="00:29:36.400" style="s2">for all the possible questions and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.150" end="00:29:37.539" style="s2">I hope that either ourselves or some</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.400" end="00:29:40.479" style="s2">computer will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.539" end="00:29:43.869" style="s2">sensitive and then there&#39;s another way</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.479" end="00:29:49.419" style="s2">to make choices and that depends it</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.869" end="00:29:51.070" style="s2">involves the observer so it involves the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.419" end="00:29:52.840" style="s2">way we show up as a health care provider</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.070" end="00:29:57.809" style="s2">who relate to the patient and we ask</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.840" end="00:30:00.399" style="s2">these questions he briefly touched on</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.809" end="00:30:04.600" style="s2">the subjective experience of the disease</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.399" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">and you talk you&#39;ve touched on homeo</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.600" end="00:30:11.679" style="s2">dynamics as as the cue principle to</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:14.320" style="s2">understand behind disease evolution now</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.679" end="00:30:16.379" style="s2">if we see that you&#39;re a home a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.320" end="00:30:18.700" style="s2">system and I&#39;m a home here than any 16</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.379" end="00:30:21.820" style="s2">is there a way that those two systems</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.700" end="00:30:23.889" style="s2">can come into resonance is there a way</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.820" end="00:30:27.729" style="s2">that I can tune my system into yours and</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.889" end="00:30:32.109" style="s2">by doing so I can actually ask the right</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.729" end="00:30:34.179" style="s2">questions I wouldn&#39;t ask you as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.109" end="00:30:37.570" style="s2">clinician have you had this experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.179" end="00:30:40.690" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.570" end="00:30:42.820" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we have to get hung up on</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.690" end="00:30:46.210" style="s2">wondering what the mechanism of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.820" end="00:30:49.259" style="s2">intuition is to acknowledge that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.210" end="00:30:50.919" style="s2">a reality to it is it some</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.259" end="00:30:54.489" style="s2">electromagnetic resonance that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.919" end="00:30:56.499" style="s2">happening maybe this cool idea is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.489" end="00:30:59.109" style="s2">simply that I have a lot of experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.499" end="00:31:00.759" style="s2">and when I take the time to quiet I</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.109" end="00:31:02.859" style="s2">process the information in my own</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.759" end="00:31:04.419" style="s2">internal neurologic database better</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.859" end="00:31:07.450" style="s2">that&#39;s a fine idea too</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.419" end="00:31:10.989" style="s2">I don&#39;t really I don&#39;t actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.450" end="00:31:13.330" style="s2">want to attached to a mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.989" end="00:31:16.809" style="s2">explanation of how intuition works that</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.330" end="00:31:19.929" style="s2">someone can say not well enough verified</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.809" end="00:31:23.349" style="s2">and reject to say the increasing</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.929" end="00:31:26.830" style="s2">awareness and presence and perceptive</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.349" end="00:31:28.989" style="s2">&#39;ti is valuable and it will lead to</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.830" end="00:31:31.720" style="s2">better insights from wherever that comes</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.989" end="00:31:35.789" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on with the patient</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.720" end="00:31:35.789" style="s2">and how to ask the right questions</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.970" end="00:31:41.700" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting so you&#39;re leaving</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.400" end="00:31:53.570" style="s2">care as a sacred space and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.220" end="00:31:57.669" style="s2">viewing intuition as a sacred space so</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.570" end="00:31:57.669" style="s2">it feels like we need to talk about love</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.909" end="00:32:04.029" style="s2">in a way connecting the two at least</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.830" end="00:32:04.029" style="s2">that&#39;s what it feels like to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.270" end="00:32:10.309" style="s2">here&#39;s another sacred space and another</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.240" end="00:32:12.110" style="s2">question now can we measure or should we</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.309" end="00:32:19.450" style="s2">measure what might be the value of</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.110" end="00:32:23.710" style="s2">measuring how we relate and and how we</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.450" end="00:32:23.710" style="s2">describe the phenomenon of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:42.429" style="s2">we talked about this earlier we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.340" end="00:32:44.980" style="s2">measure love we can measure things going</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.429" end="00:32:46.450" style="s2">on with the physiology when we say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.980" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">we&#39;re feeling something that we call</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.450" end="00:32:49.629" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:53.490" style="s2">it may be statistically correlated to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.629" end="00:32:55.450" style="s2">some degree and whether I&#39;m measuring</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.490" end="00:32:57.039" style="s2">oxytocin and other kind of neural</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.450" end="00:32:58.539" style="s2">hormones and neurotransmitters or I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.039" end="00:33:02.169" style="s2">measuring heart rate variability or</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.539" end="00:33:04.990" style="s2">measuring some kind of EEG coherence</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.169" end="00:33:10.629" style="s2">pattern those aren&#39;t useless things to</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.990" end="00:33:13.870" style="s2">do like that&#39;s interesting but I could</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.629" end="00:33:15.879" style="s2">just say pick the right person to marry</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.870" end="00:33:17.590" style="s2">on paper whether you have any things for</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.879" end="00:33:20.049" style="s2">them or not and just snort oxytocin</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.590" end="00:33:24.250" style="s2">regularly because love is just oxytocin</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.049" end="00:33:29.769" style="s2">and most people don&#39;t resonate with that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.250" end="00:33:31.779" style="s2">or or you know do a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.769" end="00:33:33.429" style="s2">transcranial magnetic stimulation to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.779" end="00:33:40.210" style="s2">brain region that we identified is where</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.429" end="00:33:42.309" style="s2">love is happening and there it is when a</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.210" end="00:33:43.870" style="s2">parent wakes up who is sick and who</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.309" end="00:33:45.700" style="s2">hasn&#39;t slept in a long time who has an</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.870" end="00:33:47.860" style="s2">infant who&#39;s worn out as can be to take</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.700" end="00:33:51.490" style="s2">care of their infant love is motivating</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.860" end="00:33:53.769" style="s2">them but they might feel like in</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.490" end="00:33:55.899" style="s2">the moment and love doesn&#39;t really feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.769" end="00:33:57.820" style="s2">like a subjective emotion it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.899" end="00:33:59.529" style="s2">something deeper than emotion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.820" end="00:34:03.429" style="s2">transcendent to emotion it can move them</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.529" end="00:34:06.879" style="s2">even through emotion and we might not</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.429" end="00:34:08.319" style="s2">see a look up you know the particular</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.879" end="00:34:13.569" style="s2">great heart rate variability in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.319" end="00:34:16.889" style="s2">moment or whatever it is so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.569" end="00:34:19.659" style="s2">interesting to study correlation between</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.889" end="00:34:22.149" style="s2">physiology and subjective states but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.659" end="00:34:24.099" style="s2">think if we&#39;re studying it through the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.149" end="00:34:26.940" style="s2">method of science and we can do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.099" end="00:34:28.960" style="s2">more with the objective within the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.940" end="00:34:30.159" style="s2">method of science because that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.960" end="00:34:33.940" style="s2">study things that are measurable and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.159" end="00:34:35.319" style="s2">repeatable and experience objective</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.940" end="00:34:37.780" style="s2">experience is not immeasurable nor were</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.319" end="00:34:40.510" style="s2">people then the temptation is going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.780" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">be to reduce subjectivity to being an</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.510" end="00:34:45.780" style="s2">Epiphone</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.200" end="00:34:48.070" style="s2">the objectivity and in doing so then</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.780" end="00:34:51.639" style="s2">consciousness is illusory and choice is</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.070" end="00:34:53.169" style="s2">illusory or their consciousness is real</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.639" end="00:34:55.389" style="s2">as an epiphenomena but choice is</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.169" end="00:34:56.889" style="s2">illusory because everything that happens</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.389" end="00:34:58.869" style="s2">in the brain is controlled by particle</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.889" end="00:35:02.290" style="s2">physics of the voltage differentials or</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.869" end="00:35:04.210" style="s2">sodium ions that&#39;s the exact opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.290" end="00:35:06.700" style="s2">heart based anything faint like that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.210" end="00:35:09.579" style="s2">kind of maximum reductionism and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.700" end="00:35:11.589" style="s2">not even epistemic ly well-founded it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.579" end="00:35:15.570" style="s2">a category error of seeing that there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.589" end="00:35:18.339" style="s2">some pretty low degree of information</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.570" end="00:35:20.200" style="s2">theoretic correlation between objective</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.339" end="00:35:22.960" style="s2">and subjective pretending that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.200" end="00:35:24.339" style="s2">perfect and then pretending that this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.960" end="00:35:25.480" style="s2">the epiphenomena of this one because</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.339" end="00:35:30.970" style="s2">this is the one that we know how to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.480" end="00:35:32.760" style="s2">actually make causal sense of do I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.970" end="00:35:35.530" style="s2">it&#39;s important to have some way of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.760" end="00:35:38.730" style="s2">noticing how the doctor and how the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.530" end="00:35:41.740" style="s2">nurse and how the practitioners feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.730" end="00:35:43.300" style="s2">before they&#39;re with patients and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.740" end="00:35:44.530" style="s2">paying attention to how the patients are</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.300" end="00:35:46.480" style="s2">feeling and they&#39;re paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.530" end="00:35:48.930" style="s2">the quality of the relationship totally</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.480" end="00:35:51.359" style="s2">I don&#39;t think you can measure that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.930" end="00:35:54.430" style="s2">think you can pay attention to it I</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.359" end="00:35:56.349" style="s2">think that you may have some indices</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.430" end="00:35:58.210" style="s2">that are worth noticing but there will</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.349" end="00:35:59.829" style="s2">be meaningful things that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.210" end="00:36:02.230" style="s2">brought into an index and the moment you</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.829" end="00:36:04.990" style="s2">do you&#39;re actually collapsing something</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.230" end="00:36:06.940" style="s2">very information-rich to something very</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.990" end="00:36:09.010" style="s2">not information rich and you&#39;re losing</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.940" end="00:36:10.869" style="s2">so much information in the process that</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.010" end="00:36:12.609" style="s2">if if you make your decisions as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.869" end="00:36:14.380" style="s2">hospital or an insurance company or a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.609" end="00:36:16.420" style="s2">doctor based off the thing that lost all</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.380" end="00:36:18.069" style="s2">the information and then you normalize</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.420" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">this is the thing we want to do we mess</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.069" end="00:36:27.250" style="s2">it up it&#39;s beautiful so so basically our</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:29.910" style="s2">our attempt to simplify questions so</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.250" end="00:36:37.089" style="s2">that we feel comfortable to answer them</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.910" end="00:36:39.490" style="s2">so this reductionist approach limits our</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.089" end="00:36:43.090" style="s2">ability to see just by the by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.490" end="00:36:46.010" style="s2">that we&#39;re setting targets to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.090" end="00:36:53.750" style="s2">yeah that the hell that is nameable is</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.010" end="00:36:57.170" style="s2">not the eternal towel so ultimately good</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.750" end="00:37:01.100" style="s2">medicine is not purely algorithmic and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.170" end="00:37:04.430" style="s2">our job is not just to try and be robots</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.100" end="00:37:05.840" style="s2">that just get data that we just haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.430" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">got good enough robots to do yet but</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.840" end="00:37:10.370" style="s2">will be replaced by them and then do if</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:14.000" style="s2">this then that</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.370" end="00:37:16.520" style="s2">programs it&#39;s actually not that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.000" end="00:37:19.370" style="s2">not the job that&#39;s a part of the job but</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.520" end="00:37:23.720" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely not the whole totality</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.370" end="00:37:27.830" style="s2">the job so there is something to what</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.720" end="00:37:30.740" style="s2">medicine is it is trans algorithmic and</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.830" end="00:37:32.810" style="s2">so then you have to say well if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.740" end="00:37:35.060" style="s2">gonna be training doctors and if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.810" end="00:37:36.950" style="s2">gonna be evaluating them based on a set</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.060" end="00:37:38.390" style="s2">of metrics and a scorecard so then they</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.950" end="00:37:39.770" style="s2">are gonna try and perform to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.390" end="00:37:42.680" style="s2">scorecard they&#39;re gonna mess up the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.770" end="00:37:44.060" style="s2">actual thing this is what the note this</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.680" end="00:37:47.810" style="s2">is how I interpret with the no false</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.060" end="00:37:51.200" style="s2">idols thing is about right is that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.810" end="00:37:53.120" style="s2">that kind of graven image of that set of</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.200" end="00:37:55.370" style="s2">metrics isn&#39;t actually the thing it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.120" end="00:37:57.140" style="s2">pointing at it&#39;s not worthless to pay</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.370" end="00:37:58.730" style="s2">attention to those things but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.140" end="00:38:01.790" style="s2">actually have to have your choice making</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.730" end="00:38:04.790" style="s2">be bound to the actual reality not the</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.790" end="00:38:06.680" style="s2">information reduced model it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.790" end="00:38:12.050" style="s2">interesting particularly when we think</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.680" end="00:38:15.890" style="s2">of artificial intelligence entering the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.050" end="00:38:19.030" style="s2">space of Medicine so when we look at now</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.890" end="00:38:22.490" style="s2">there are computers being built that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.030" end="00:38:26.050" style="s2">exhibiting some features that we would</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.490" end="00:38:29.320" style="s2">describe as compassionate for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.050" end="00:38:33.380" style="s2">non-judgmental listening so some of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.320" end="00:38:35.530" style="s2">robots are now able to listen to a human</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.380" end="00:38:38.950" style="s2">being and</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.530" end="00:38:42.530" style="s2">in a way that they there is a feedback</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.950" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">to the one that that is that that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.530" end="00:38:50.119" style="s2">talking but it&#39;s non-judgmental this</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">this is there&#39;s a conflation of ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.119" end="00:38:58.640" style="s2">here to say non-judgmental assumes a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:39:00.650" style="s2">binary with judgmental that word right</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.640" end="00:39:01.790" style="s2">we&#39;re correlating our experience of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.650" end="00:39:03.859" style="s2">human that is judgmental or</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.790" end="00:39:06.619" style="s2">non-judgmental that computer is not</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.859" end="00:39:08.359" style="s2">being non-judgmental nor judgmental</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.619" end="00:39:10.160" style="s2">there&#39;s actually no one home there is no</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.359" end="00:39:12.710" style="s2">quality it is doing an if this than that</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.160" end="00:39:15.740" style="s2">kind of program and even if it&#39;s doing a</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.710" end="00:39:19.069" style="s2">deep learning program it is simply a</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.740" end="00:39:21.980" style="s2">fully causal input-output through some</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.069" end="00:39:25.210" style="s2">set of program dynamic so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.980" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">really fair to call that non judgmental</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.210" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">it is doing a function it&#39;s doing what</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:33.200" style="s2">it&#39;s told</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:37.579" style="s2">and the interesting observation is is</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.200" end="00:39:44.119" style="s2">that when people with certain disease</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.579" end="00:39:47.420" style="s2">conditions are interacting with these</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.119" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">computers there seems to be a level of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.420" end="00:39:58.220" style="s2">trust or acceptance that evolves and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:40:00.410" style="s2">that those patients exhibiting features</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.220" end="00:40:03.230" style="s2">that we would describe as autistic to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.410" end="00:40:05.150" style="s2">the spectrum will reduce and they will</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.230" end="00:40:08.990" style="s2">be able to open up and actually start a</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.150" end="00:40:12.109" style="s2">conversation I think that that is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.990" end="00:40:14.450" style="s2">statement of how shitty the parenting is</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.109" end="00:40:16.040" style="s2">and how shitty the doctors nurses and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.450" end="00:40:18.380" style="s2">educators are that the person does</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.040" end="00:40:20.839" style="s2">better the robot like a fairly low level</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.380" end="00:40:25.069" style="s2">robot rather than it is something</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.839" end="00:40:26.900" style="s2">exciting about AI for me if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.069" end="00:40:29.180" style="s2">doing better with a robot because it</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.900" end="00:40:30.440" style="s2">simply doesn&#39;t seem judgmental and it</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.180" end="00:40:32.780" style="s2">takes a little space even though it</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.440" end="00:40:35.780" style="s2">doesn&#39;t love you or care about you like</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.780" end="00:40:37.819" style="s2">that&#39;s just a really low bar I&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.780" end="00:40:39.799" style="s2">the person have a dog it&#39;s just been</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.819" end="00:40:42.890" style="s2">time with the thing I&#39;m excited about</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.799" end="00:40:44.720" style="s2">with AI and the medicine space and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.890" end="00:40:49.130" style="s2">it&#39;s confusing to even call the a</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.720" end="00:40:51.290" style="s2">machine learning do we want to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.130" end="00:40:52.700" style="s2">machine learning run big datasets to</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.290" end="00:40:54.520" style="s2">find correlations that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.700" end="00:40:57.799" style="s2">currently find of course that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.520" end="00:41:00.290" style="s2">do we wanna like scan all the medical in</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.799" end="00:41:02.210" style="s2">you know medical records in using image</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.290" end="00:41:05.150" style="s2">recognition and run massive big data so</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.210" end="00:41:08.650" style="s2">that we can see early disease indicators</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.150" end="00:41:08.650" style="s2">we don&#39;t currently know that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.540" end="00:41:18.950" style="s2">and so far has an and of course we</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.250" end="00:41:20.839" style="s2">should be augmenting just like we</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.950" end="00:41:22.270" style="s2">augment human memory with books and</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.839" end="00:41:24.950" style="s2">computers we should augment human</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.270" end="00:41:28.099" style="s2">computational process this computational</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.950" end="00:41:29.329" style="s2">process so the ability to take a picture</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.099" end="00:41:32.180" style="s2">of something and have image recognition</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.329" end="00:41:34.760" style="s2">be able to do better diagnosis of skin</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.180" end="00:41:36.829" style="s2">can is like all of that&#39;s great and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.760" end="00:41:39.859" style="s2">actually allows as that gets better it</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.829" end="00:41:43.309" style="s2">allows the doctors to be less focused on</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.859" end="00:41:45.530" style="s2">just memory and computation and more</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.309" end="00:41:48.349" style="s2">focused on actual connection to them</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.530" end="00:41:50.720" style="s2">know how to use that system and to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.349" end="00:41:53.000" style="s2">relate to the person but they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.720" end="00:41:54.890" style="s2">going to be a pretty big gap between the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.000" end="00:41:56.720" style="s2">doctor relating with the person using</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.890" end="00:42:16.220" style="s2">the system and the system acting on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.720" end="00:42:20.540" style="s2">person directly so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.220" end="00:42:22.549" style="s2">availability and we can run this on</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.540" end="00:42:26.680" style="s2">databases as you say but we can also</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.549" end="00:42:30.829" style="s2">turn them into wiki we can inform</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.680" end="00:42:33.260" style="s2">objects that we call robots with machine</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.829" end="00:42:36.619" style="s2">learning abilities so they are able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.260" end="00:42:40.099" style="s2">provide services so what we&#39;re seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.619" end="00:42:42.950" style="s2">that increasingly now there are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.099" end="00:42:45.290" style="s2">robots evolving that are involved and</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.950" end="00:42:47.960" style="s2">what we typically would cause call</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.290" end="00:42:50.510" style="s2">services of care so for example they</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.960" end="00:42:54.110" style="s2">would help in in household activity</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.510" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">helping you know basic getting dressed</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.110" end="00:43:02.210" style="s2">washing ourselves very basic day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:05.240" style="s2">activities and they are helpful for</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.210" end="00:43:11.480" style="s2">people who have incapacity you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.240" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">somehow they don&#39;t have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.480" end="00:43:17.930" style="s2">perform certain activities now but</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:21.770" style="s2">they&#39;re fundamentally different to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.930" end="00:43:23.660" style="s2">nurse coming to the home an extra being</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.770" end="00:43:27.290" style="s2">with this person and providing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.660" end="00:43:28.790" style="s2">support yeah there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.290" end="00:43:32.510" style="s2">development of these technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.790" end="00:43:34.520" style="s2">is awesome and liberating and helpful</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.510" end="00:43:36.590" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about the way we</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.520" end="00:43:38.800" style="s2">are relating to it it is gruesome and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.590" end="00:43:41.510" style="s2">it&#39;s important to understand both</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.800" end="00:43:45.320" style="s2">insofar as we&#39;re talking about a robotic</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.510" end="00:43:47.720" style="s2">exoskeleton that can allow a paralyzed</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.320" end="00:43:49.100" style="s2">person to walk it&#39;s just a better</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.720" end="00:43:50.270" style="s2">wheelchair like me it&#39;s just an</p>

<p begin="00:43:50.270" end="00:43:56.120" style="s2">already been using you&#39;re wearing</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.690" end="00:43:59.270" style="s2">eyeglasses that&#39;s a tool that helps you</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.120" end="00:44:01.610" style="s2">you&#39;re a cyborg to some degree if we had</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.270" end="00:44:04.870" style="s2">ones that could autofocus and do cool</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.610" end="00:44:11.060" style="s2">stuff like okay that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.870" end="00:44:14.620" style="s2">but something that does not actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.060" end="00:44:17.270" style="s2">have the capacity to care about you</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.620" end="00:44:21.770" style="s2">replacing a dynamic where care used to</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.270" end="00:44:23.630" style="s2">occur is tragic now if it&#39;s simply</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.770" end="00:44:25.490" style="s2">helping you get some stuff done you</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.630" end="00:44:27.080" style="s2">couldn&#39;t otherwise and hopefully that</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.490" end="00:44:29.150" style="s2">increases your capacity for authentic</p>

<p begin="00:46:57.829" end="00:47:01.670" style="s2">top-down state surveillance is the kind</p>

<p begin="00:47:22.369" end="00:47:26.210" style="s2">civilian no way so are you saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.650" end="00:47:28.720" style="s2">basically that doesn&#39;t even have to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.210" end="00:47:33.020" style="s2">the death because it&#39;s it&#39;s an innate</p>

<p begin="00:47:33.020" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2">that we are resonating with each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.450" end="00:47:39.410" style="s2">and that we&#39;re realizing if somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:43.069" style="s2">behaving kind of outside of the pact</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.410" end="00:47:46.099" style="s2">then then that is something to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.069" end="00:47:47.900" style="s2">addressed and would you argue that this</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.099" end="00:47:51.680" style="s2">is something that is a it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.900" end="00:47:53.569" style="s2">existential interest of the group of</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.680" end="00:47:55.730" style="s2">quarters of the potential so is this</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.569" end="00:47:58.130" style="s2">like a risk detection system of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.730" end="00:47:59.690" style="s2">group does this mean that nobody can be</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.130" end="00:48:03.500" style="s2">a hermit no of course it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.690" end="00:48:07.329" style="s2">nobody can be a hermit but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.500" end="00:48:07.329" style="s2">mean that in the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.020" end="00:48:13.970" style="s2">decentralized able catastrophe level</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.690" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">technology we have to think about some</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.970" end="00:48:19.880" style="s2">things differently than we did</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:23.119" style="s2">previously and the disposition and</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.880" end="00:48:26.150" style="s2">well-being of people matters more to</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.119" end="00:48:28.460" style="s2">everyone because the one-to-many</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.150" end="00:48:31.010" style="s2">capacity of a person is much much higher</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.460" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">and so the coupling is higher which</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.010" end="00:48:38.030" style="s2">means that the care needs behind coming</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:40.160" style="s2">back to care again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.030" end="00:48:43.339" style="s2">so now we&#39;re looking at care is a group</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.160" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">phenomena so a group caring for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.339" end="00:48:49.910" style="s2">group and caring for individuals for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:51.410" style="s2">sake of the group and for this they</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.910" end="00:48:53.150" style="s2">could be individual and for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.410" end="00:48:54.680" style="s2">the individual so if I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.150" end="00:48:57.230" style="s2">translating this to the healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.680" end="00:48:59.210" style="s2">setting though where we have a group of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.230" end="00:49:00.980" style="s2">people working together and we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.210" end="00:49:04.990" style="s2">individuals walking in and out of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.980" end="00:49:10.460" style="s2">setting and we look at the current I</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.990" end="00:49:14.879" style="s2">want to call it academic of suicides</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.460" end="00:49:14.879" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.230" end="00:49:22.839" style="s2">where we&#39;re failing is it have we become</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.140" end="00:49:28.420" style="s2">them has the system numbed ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.839" end="00:49:29.950" style="s2">have we lost a sensitivity you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.420" end="00:49:33.999" style="s2">specifically talking about suicide</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.950" end="00:49:37.210" style="s2">amongst doctors I don&#39;t know I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.999" end="00:49:41.289" style="s2">studied this I would want to really look</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.210" end="00:49:43.059" style="s2">at is suicide much higher amongst</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.289" end="00:49:45.599" style="s2">doctors than other professionals of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.059" end="00:49:50.650" style="s2">same pay grades and other types of</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.599" end="00:49:51.970" style="s2">similar stress level like I&#39;m sure again</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.650" end="00:49:57.490" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be complex causation</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.970" end="00:50:05.499" style="s2">that&#39;s involved it&#39;s not one thing we</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.490" end="00:50:10.140" style="s2">can talk about why there are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.499" end="00:50:10.140" style="s2">epidemic suicide issues society-wide</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.289" end="00:50:16.119" style="s2">but yeah I wouldn&#39;t want to speak to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.910" end="00:50:17.829" style="s2">with doctors without knowing more but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.119" end="00:50:20.259" style="s2">think it&#39;s pretty easy to see at least</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.829" end="00:50:25.569" style="s2">some things I think it&#39;s pretty easy to</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.259" end="00:50:28.230" style="s2">see that the amount of stress doctors go</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.569" end="00:50:33.970" style="s2">through even in med school I</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.230" end="00:50:37.900" style="s2">experiencing burnout or being on some</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.970" end="00:50:39.519" style="s2">kind of wellbutrin or adderall or</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.900" end="00:50:41.890" style="s2">Ritalin or some kind of upper just to</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.519" end="00:50:43.930" style="s2">make it through in school by the time</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.890" end="00:50:44.980" style="s2">they&#39;re just not even graduating and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.930" end="00:50:46.930" style="s2">then they&#39;re supposed to have a whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.980" end="00:50:50.650" style="s2">career then like you mentioned 72 hour</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.930" end="00:50:53.319" style="s2">shifts and I also think that not having</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.650" end="00:50:57.809" style="s2">a place to process the emotionality of</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.319" end="00:51:00.940" style="s2">it the desensitization of okay so I just</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.809" end="00:51:02.890" style="s2">you know as a part of some kids dying</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.940" end="00:51:04.599" style="s2">today this experience and I&#39;m gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.890" end="00:51:09.009" style="s2">do it tomorrow and where&#39;s the space for</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.599" end="00:51:11.980" style="s2">that and yeah I think I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.009" end="00:51:13.980" style="s2">obviously a lot of stresses both that</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.980" end="00:51:16.930" style="s2">are unavoidably endemic to that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.980" end="00:51:17.799" style="s2">profession that need to be processed in</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.930" end="00:51:20.619" style="s2">ways that they aren&#39;t currently</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.799" end="00:51:23.999" style="s2">processed and ones that are avoidable by</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.619" end="00:51:23.999" style="s2">changing the way the system works</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.589" end="00:51:32.369" style="s2">so we could as a group become all</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.510" end="00:51:34.140" style="s2">proficient in detecting the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.369" end="00:51:38.250" style="s2">the group and taking care of each other</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.140" end="00:51:40.410" style="s2">and we could become more proficient in</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.250" end="00:51:44.099" style="s2">the way that we show up as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.410" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">in the group and that&#39;s showing up more</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.099" end="00:51:52.410" style="s2">proficient with our peer group with our</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:56.460" style="s2">teams and with the patient will help us</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.410" end="00:51:59.190" style="s2">to see the patient better see our</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.460" end="00:52:01.950" style="s2">colleagues better and that might create</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.190" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">a community that is kind of mutually</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.950" end="00:52:10.289" style="s2">supportive in a way that we not so much</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.440" end="00:52:14.339" style="s2">cluttered by by knowledge and red tape</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.289" end="00:52:20.309" style="s2">but we can actually allow ourselves to</p>
