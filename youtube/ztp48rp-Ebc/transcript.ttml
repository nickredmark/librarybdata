<p begin="00:00:07.640" end="00:00:13.460" style="s2">Poirot made a response video - to</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.170" end="00:00:16.340" style="s2">something you said in the Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.460" end="00:00:19.099" style="s2">experience do you have anything to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.340" end="00:00:21.740" style="s2">Oh glad you&#39;re asking that I was hoping</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.099" end="00:00:23.600" style="s2">it would come up so I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.740" end="00:00:25.039" style="s2">many people have seen the video and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.600" end="00:00:27.320" style="s2">it&#39;s responding to but the short version</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.039" end="00:00:32.320" style="s2">is that I said something on the Joe</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.320" end="00:00:32.320" style="s2">Rogan podcast about there being</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.379" end="00:00:37.250" style="s2">different kinds of truth that I argued</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.480" end="00:00:38.690" style="s2">for something I call metaphorical truth</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.250" end="00:00:40.370" style="s2">that something can be literally false</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.690" end="00:00:42.110" style="s2">but it can contain wisdom and the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.370" end="00:00:43.579" style="s2">you know is that if you act as if it</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.110" end="00:00:45.110" style="s2">were true you come out ahead of where</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.579" end="00:00:48.230" style="s2">you would if you act according to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.110" end="00:00:52.489" style="s2">fact that it&#39;s false and I then said</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.230" end="00:00:56.510" style="s2">that scientific truth is the top truth</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.489" end="00:01:00.320" style="s2">in the hierarchy and the response was</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.510" end="00:01:02.149" style="s2">that it was arrogant of me to say that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.320" end="00:01:03.829" style="s2">there was a top truth that you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.149" end="00:01:05.000" style="s2">effectively from what position do I do</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.829" end="00:01:07.280" style="s2">that and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.000" end="00:01:09.380" style="s2">I can you want to go ahead I just want</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.280" end="00:01:10.429" style="s2">to say that&#39;s not the argument the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.380" end="00:01:12.709" style="s2">argument is that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.429" end="00:01:14.840" style="s2">performative contradiction in your in</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.709" end="00:01:17.630" style="s2">your statement because you talked you</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.840" end="00:01:19.819" style="s2">said that factual truth is higher than</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.630" end="00:01:21.530" style="s2">metaphorical truth but then to say that</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.819" end="00:01:23.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a top level truth or that</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.530" end="00:01:26.959" style="s2">there&#39;s an overarching truth is to use a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.300" end="00:01:28.910" style="s2">metaphorical structure to to demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.959" end="00:01:30.619" style="s2">where you&#39;re placing your truth and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.910" end="00:01:32.330" style="s2">within the statement there was a car</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.619" end="00:01:35.030" style="s2">there as a performative contradiction in</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.330" end="00:01:37.220" style="s2">terms of you have to resort to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.030" end="00:01:38.959" style="s2">metaphorical truth to speak of hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.220" end="00:01:41.179" style="s2">because all the language of hierarchy is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.959" end="00:01:42.800" style="s2">metaphorical and therefore to place</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.179" end="00:01:44.539" style="s2">factual truth at the top of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.800" end="00:01:46.670" style="s2">hierarchy is a performative</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.539" end="00:01:49.330" style="s2">contradiction so that&#39;s my argument so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.670" end="00:01:52.550" style="s2">will I will plead guilty to using</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.330" end="00:01:54.349" style="s2">metaphor to defend my position because</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.550" end="00:01:56.030" style="s2">of course language is composed of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.349" end="00:01:57.200" style="s2">metaphors both living and dead and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.030" end="00:01:59.509" style="s2">really hard to communicate anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.200" end="00:02:04.910" style="s2">without running afoul of that standard</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.509" end="00:02:07.129" style="s2">but I will defend in spite of that guilt</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.910" end="00:02:09.979" style="s2">I will defend the idea that scientific</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.129" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">truth is the top truth in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.979" end="00:02:15.560" style="s2">and the reason is really simple it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:18.110" style="s2">because there is no mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.560" end="00:02:18.770" style="s2">sorting between metaphorical truths that</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.110" end="00:02:20.480" style="s2">belong to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.770" end="00:02:22.670" style="s2">from traditions and are in conflict with</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.480" end="00:02:27.140" style="s2">each other so in other words if we take</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.670" end="00:02:29.600" style="s2">to like behave well when you die you go</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.140" end="00:02:33.080" style="s2">to heaven that&#39;s cool you should do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.600" end="00:02:35.600" style="s2">on the other hand if you behave well in</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.080" end="00:02:37.100" style="s2">Brahman Atman system you may be</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.600" end="00:02:39.740" style="s2">reincarnated as something better than</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.100" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">you are now that&#39;s also cool but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.740" end="00:02:44.810" style="s2">not the same truth right so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:46.700" style="s2">sort out these are both kinds of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.810" end="00:02:48.620" style="s2">and I think we know exactly what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.700" end="00:02:51.290" style="s2">wisdom they are or at least we should</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.620" end="00:02:53.480" style="s2">which is if you behave so as to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.290" end="00:02:56.150" style="s2">reincarnated as something better or to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.480" end="00:02:57.640" style="s2">go to heaven what it will do is in all</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.150" end="00:03:00.860" style="s2">probability it will leave your</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.640" end="00:03:05.150" style="s2">descendants really well positioned in</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.860" end="00:03:07.160" style="s2">their in their culture and that means</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.150" end="00:03:08.510" style="s2">that your genes which you might not have</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.160" end="00:03:12.140" style="s2">been in a position to say anything about</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.510" end="00:03:14.810" style="s2">will be well positioned to persist and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.140" end="00:03:17.690" style="s2">spread because your descendants will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.810" end="00:03:19.580" style="s2">well placed so in effect going to heaven</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.690" end="00:03:22.970" style="s2">or being reincarnated as something</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.580" end="00:03:25.310" style="s2">better than you were our stand-ins for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.970" end="00:03:27.350" style="s2">genetic truth that we can&#39;t say and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.310" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">what I&#39;m arguing is that what makes the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.350" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">scientific truth hierarchically superior</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:34.100" style="s2">is that it explains all the subordinate</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:35.630" style="s2">truths in a way that is logically</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.100" end="00:03:38.360" style="s2">consistent whereas if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.630" end="00:03:40.220" style="s2">prioritize heaven as a truth then you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.360" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">would have to say well reincarnation is</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.220" end="00:03:44.390" style="s2">therefore false or you would have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:46.940" style="s2">have them all simultaneously be true in</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.390" end="00:03:48.920" style="s2">some on reconcilable way so the only one</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.940" end="00:03:50.540" style="s2">that has the special characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.920" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">accounting for all the others is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.540" end="00:04:00.709" style="s2">scientific truth okay so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:02.780" style="s2">what you just did was nested your claim</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.709" end="00:04:05.390" style="s2">for the validity of scientific truth</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.780" end="00:04:07.310" style="s2">within a pragmatic framework which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.390" end="00:04:09.860" style="s2">what I claimed when I was talking to Sam</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.310" end="00:04:15.170" style="s2">Harris was necessary because you said I</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.860" end="00:04:18.950" style="s2">believe that the justification for for</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.170" end="00:04:20.930" style="s2">assuming the truth of the of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.950" end="00:04:24.110" style="s2">mythological representation was its</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.930" end="00:04:27.229" style="s2">effect on on something that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.110" end="00:04:29.510" style="s2">with a Darwinian process right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.229" end="00:04:31.250" style="s2">that&#39;s how you used that what you used</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.510" end="00:04:32.580" style="s2">to justify your claim that it was in</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.250" end="00:04:36.030" style="s2">fact true</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.580" end="00:04:37.530" style="s2">so in the discussion that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.030" end="00:04:40.020" style="s2">referencing my point</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.530" end="00:04:41.970" style="s2">so my point was essentially that there</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.020" end="00:04:44.040" style="s2">is something called metaphorical truth</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.970" end="00:04:46.380" style="s2">and that it&#39;s a real thing so I was I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.040" end="00:04:48.450" style="s2">in agreement with you on that where we</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.380" end="00:04:50.070" style="s2">might be in disagreement is that there</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.450" end="00:04:52.110" style="s2">is simultaneously a thing that I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.070" end="00:04:53.580" style="s2">call literal truth or scientific truth</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.110" end="00:04:55.530" style="s2">and by the way I&#39;m not saying that what</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.580" end="00:04:57.540" style="s2">scientists say is in this category</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.530" end="00:04:59.010" style="s2">inherently scientists can be wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.540" end="00:05:01.140" style="s2">the point is truth that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.010" end="00:05:03.960" style="s2">scientifically verifiable that makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.140" end="00:05:07.110" style="s2">predictions has a special priority in</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.960" end="00:05:09.870" style="s2">this hierarchy because it is the one</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.110" end="00:05:12.360" style="s2">objective version it is not contingent</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.870" end="00:05:16.020" style="s2">on being nested in another in a series</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.360" end="00:05:19.590" style="s2">of beliefs so what if it&#39;s a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.020" end="00:05:21.150" style="s2">truth that&#39;s metaphorically wrong oh and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.590" end="00:05:25.740" style="s2">they&#39;re like I can give you an example</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.150" end="00:05:28.650" style="s2">okay so I read this the memoirs of a KGB</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.740" end="00:05:31.950" style="s2">scientist KGB agent who worked with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.650" end="00:05:39.300" style="s2">Russians in this biochemical lab and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.950" end="00:05:43.290" style="s2">their job was to meld Ebola with</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.300" end="00:05:45.000" style="s2">smallpox because smallpox is Ebola is</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.290" end="00:05:46.200" style="s2">not that contagious and so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.000" end="00:05:48.690" style="s2">of annoying if you&#39;re trying to kill</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.200" end="00:05:49.470" style="s2">people whereas smallpox but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.690" end="00:05:51.480" style="s2">fatal</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.470" end="00:05:52.830" style="s2">whereas smallpox is really contagious so</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.480" end="00:05:55.500" style="s2">if you could get the two together and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.830" end="00:05:57.330" style="s2">then develop an aerosol spray you could</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.500" end="00:05:59.460" style="s2">kill a lot of people and in fact they</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.330" end="00:06:00.960" style="s2">did kill about 500 Russians by mistake</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.460" end="00:06:03.420" style="s2">when some of what they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.960" end="00:06:07.110" style="s2">escaped but it isn&#39;t obvious to me that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.420" end="00:06:09.150" style="s2">that&#39;s an invalid scientific pursuit but</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.110" end="00:06:10.920" style="s2">I do think that it&#39;s an invalid ethical</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.150" end="00:06:13.250" style="s2">pursuit and so that seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.920" end="00:06:15.930" style="s2">indicate that the ethical pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.250" end="00:06:20.040" style="s2">supersedes the scientific pursuit with</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.930" end="00:06:22.470" style="s2">regards to truth claim so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.040" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">disagree with you I would say it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.470" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">supersede with respect to the truth</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">claim it supersedes with respect to</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.430" end="00:06:59.900" style="s2">there are restating of the hierarchy the</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.840" end="00:07:08.060" style="s2">the the restating of the hierarchy in</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.000" end="00:07:10.730" style="s2">those two terms have the same effect in</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.060" end="00:07:16.970" style="s2">terms of what we&#39;re saying is that if</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.730" end="00:07:20.090" style="s2">you&#39;re good you will not meld those two</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.970" end="00:07:23.150" style="s2">things together and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.090" end="00:07:28.280" style="s2">hierarchy the hierarchy itself is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.150" end="00:07:31.810" style="s2">capacity to be above quantitative purely</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.280" end="00:07:34.010" style="s2">quantitative considerations and to apply</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.810" end="00:07:36.710" style="s2">qualitative thinking and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.010" end="00:07:39.770" style="s2">language of hierarchy is all a language</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.710" end="00:07:42.320" style="s2">about a movement from from quantity up</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.770" end="00:07:44.090" style="s2">to quality like that it&#39;s it&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.320" end="00:07:46.910" style="s2">it&#39;s about going up a mountain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.090" end="00:07:49.220" style="s2">going up the base and then going up to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.910" end="00:07:53.480" style="s2">you to unity and when you stand in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.220" end="00:07:57.670" style="s2">top place then you can look down and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.480" end="00:08:00.950" style="s2">can judge what facts because there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.670" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">there is an innumerable amounts of fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.950" end="00:08:06.140" style="s2">there&#39;s an infinite quantity of facts</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">you can decide which facts are worth</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.140" end="00:08:12.020" style="s2">pursuing and so that&#39;s what religion is</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:14.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s what the hierarchy is so if</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.020" end="00:08:16.820" style="s2">you take if you take qualitative if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.600" end="00:08:21.220" style="s2">take a quantitative tidbit of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.820" end="00:08:24.380" style="s2">information and you say that is above</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.220" end="00:08:27.620" style="s2">let&#39;s say qualitative judgment how do</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.380" end="00:08:30.410" style="s2">you even why why are you even focusing</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.620" end="00:08:32.030" style="s2">on that quantitative data because</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.410" end="00:08:34.610" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an infinite amount of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.030" end="00:08:37.669" style="s2">them so you have to have a Matt a manner</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.610" end="00:08:39.560" style="s2">by which you focus on something and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.669" end="00:08:41.570" style="s2">is the hierarchy and that is the whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.560" end="00:08:45.500" style="s2">language of of the religious hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.570" end="00:08:46.820" style="s2">so so what do you do where religious</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.500" end="00:08:49.400" style="s2">traditions and what I&#39;m calling</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.820" end="00:08:52.640" style="s2">metaphorical truths conflict so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.400" end="00:08:54.260" style="s2">say mating systems I would argue that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.640" end="00:08:56.960" style="s2">monogamy is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.260" end="00:09:00.410" style="s2">superior mating system because it does</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.960" end="00:09:01.010" style="s2">not sideline any significant population</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.410" end="00:09:03.320" style="s2">of males</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.010" end="00:09:07.400" style="s2">if you sideline a significant population</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.320" end="00:09:09.560" style="s2">of males by having what biologists would</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.400" end="00:09:11.660" style="s2">call a polygynous system or people would</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.560" end="00:09:13.880" style="s2">generally call a polygamous system if</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.660" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">you do that then you have sexually</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.880" end="00:09:18.380" style="s2">frustrated males who are left over and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:20.450" style="s2">inevitably become something like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.380" end="00:09:23.090" style="s2">marauding horde or an army or something</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.450" end="00:09:25.490" style="s2">immoral like that now wait wait</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.090" end="00:09:27.410" style="s2">now you&#39;re assuming that&#39;s bad yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.490" end="00:09:29.720" style="s2">so you&#39;re falling into Jonathan&#39;s trap</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.410" end="00:09:32.090" style="s2">because you&#39;re saying you see you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.720" end="00:09:34.010" style="s2">this a priori framework that monogamy is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.090" end="00:09:36.230" style="s2">better because you&#39;ve already decided</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.010" end="00:09:38.630" style="s2">what constitutes bad you can&#39;t help but</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.230" end="00:09:41.390" style="s2">lay a moral framework over your</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.630" end="00:09:43.070" style="s2">selection of facts and so that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.390" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to trap you I know this</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.070" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">is a crazily complicated problem yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:50.600" style="s2">but but the idea that you that that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">fundamental idea is that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.600" end="00:09:55.490" style="s2">select the damn facts and order them</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:57.380" style="s2">which you have to do you have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.490" end="00:10:00.710" style="s2">without applying an a priori moral</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.380" end="00:10:03.380" style="s2">framework right so I would say I am</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.710" end="00:10:05.300" style="s2">applying an a priori moral framework I</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.380" end="00:10:07.010" style="s2">am NOT treating this as us I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.300" end="00:10:09.140" style="s2">know we could also look at the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.010" end="00:10:10.760" style="s2">of people as a physical process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.140" end="00:10:13.700" style="s2">equally a physical process as it is a</p>

<p begin="00:10:41.720" end="00:10:46.430" style="s2">is different religions that contain</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.039" end="00:11:48.769" style="s2">this my point is you have a thousand</p>

<p begin="00:11:48.769" end="00:11:53.329" style="s2">built out of metaphorical truths in a</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.979" end="00:12:02.719" style="s2">okay now let&#39;s say well which of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.779" end="00:12:05.359" style="s2">is best how are you even going to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.719" end="00:12:07.549" style="s2">that there&#39;s only one of them that has a</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.529" end="00:12:15.169" style="s2">characteristic it explains why all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.569" end="00:12:16.579" style="s2">others work so how is it not just by</p>
