<p begin="00:00:28.320" end="00:00:33.520" style="s2">well thank you</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.599" end="00:00:35.360" style="s2">it&#39;s uh remarkable to see all of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.520" end="00:00:38.559" style="s2">here in this amazing room</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.360" end="00:00:41.680" style="s2">so uh well i hope we have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.559" end="00:00:44.800" style="s2">an interesting and engaging time tonight</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.680" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">that&#39;s the plan i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.800" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">i have a lecture planned so</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.039" end="00:00:54.079" style="s2">it&#39;s got a strange title it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.760" end="00:00:55.360" style="s2">exciting really</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.079" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">the first part of it is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.360" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">socialization of the value hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:05.439" style="s2">and the second is um and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:07.119" style="s2">estimation of the magnitude of error</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.439" end="00:01:08.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like you wouldn&#39;t think you&#39;d come</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.119" end="00:01:11.600" style="s2">and sit in here to listen to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">talk really would you i&#39;m not sure i</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.600" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">but but it is interesting it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:18.080" style="s2">very very interesting problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:19.840" style="s2">um and here here&#39;s part of what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.080" end="00:01:21.520" style="s2">problem is the part of the problem i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.840" end="00:01:25.119" style="s2">trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.520" end="00:01:28.400" style="s2">part is part of it is um</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.119" end="00:01:31.600" style="s2">how is your emotional stability</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.400" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">tied up with your social identity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.600" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">a really important question</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:37.360" style="s2">and and i i think it might be the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">central question that i&#39;ve been pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.360" end="00:01:42.560" style="s2">my entire my as long as i&#39;ve been able</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:43.759" style="s2">to think intellectually that might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:44.560" style="s2">the problem that i&#39;ve been pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.759" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.560" end="00:01:48.399" style="s2">one of the things i&#39;ve been interested</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:51.759" style="s2">in is why is it that people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.399" end="00:01:53.200" style="s2">so committed to their group identity</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.759" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">let&#39;s say or their or their group</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.200" end="00:01:56.479" style="s2">beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">that they will well let&#39;s say go to war</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.479" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">to protect them</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">or to spread them or that they will</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:03.040" style="s2">commit atrocities</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:05.439" style="s2">hypothetically in defense of them so</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.040" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.439" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">um you know because people when when</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:11.920" style="s2">people think about</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:14.319" style="s2">the motivation for war for example they</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.920" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">often attribute it to economic causes</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.319" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:18.560" style="s2">that just never struck me as as</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:21.599" style="s2">plausible sometimes it&#39;s plausible but</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.560" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">um it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a deep solution as</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.599" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">far as i&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s more psychological it&#39;s our beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">are important to us</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">and what does it mean well there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:36.080" style="s2">of questions there</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">what do you mean by belief exactly</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.080" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">um you know physicists generally don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">go to war over their belief</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:44.480" style="s2">in one physical theory over another so</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:46.480" style="s2">it can&#39;t be just as simple as belief it</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.480" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">has to be more complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">and um and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">and and and people are committed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:54.959" style="s2">their beliefs too and it and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">obvious what commitment means</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.959" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">and so those are the things that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:02.159" style="s2">trying to unpack what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">have a belief</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.159" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">and what does it mean how does it how</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">does it how does it</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">why is it important to you why is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:10.239" style="s2">crucial to you there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:12.720" style="s2">associated</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.239" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">deeply there&#39;s a deep association</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">between belief and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">value and so then that brings up another</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">what exactly do you mean by value so</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s three hard questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">and so that&#39;s part of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:29.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s the value hierarchy question</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">part of it and and then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.680" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">error magnitude problem is um well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:37.200" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">let&#39;s say you go to a party and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.200" end="00:03:41.440" style="s2">you tell a joke and uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">you know you think it&#39;s pretty funny</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.440" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">joke and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:50.720" style="s2">you tell your joke and no one laughs</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">and in fact they look at you like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:54.640" style="s2">rather odd</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">and then the question is well how how</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.640" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">should you respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">like what exactly does that indicate</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.480" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">about you i mean does it indicate</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:05.120" style="s2">a minor flaw in an otherwise stellar</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">personality</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.120" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">because that&#39;s a possibility or does it</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">mean that like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.159" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">a creep right and maybe right down to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">the core</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">and you know you could even</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">you could even think the less that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">think that it means that you&#39;re a creep</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">the more likely it is that you are</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:26.320" style="s2">one so but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">to estimate</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.320" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">the magnitude of an error we have how</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">upset</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">should you get when something that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">don&#39;t want to happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">happens and it&#39;s very very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">figure that out if you wake up in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">morning and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">you know you have a pain</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">say in your side um or you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">feeling particularly well</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like well how upset should you get</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">and one answer is well</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">like maybe you&#39;re gonna die in three</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:04:58.160" style="s2">months you know maybe that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">beginning of pancreatic cancer and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.160" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the end of you and so maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">should just be</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.880" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">terrified into paralysis when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:07.759" style="s2">pain that you can&#39;t explain or maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">should just</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.759" end="00:05:11.919" style="s2">brush it off and think well you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll get up and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.919" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">do what i usually do and it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">nothing and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:20.720" style="s2">sometimes you&#39;re right with the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:22.160" style="s2">probably nothing approach and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.720" end="00:05:23.840" style="s2">if you don&#39;t go to the physician</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.160" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">right away because you have some</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">relatively trivial pain</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">then you&#39;re dead and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">this problem of estimating</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:36.720" style="s2">magnitude of error importance of error</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.400" end="00:05:38.720" style="s2">is it&#39;s unbelievably it&#39;s unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.720" end="00:05:40.160" style="s2">difficult problem and so i want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.720" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">address</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">both of those problems at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:48.880" style="s2">tonight so that&#39;s the plan</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:48.880" style="s2">so we&#39;ll see how that goes so</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.039" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">and then i i want to weave in there one</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">more thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:58.400" style="s2">this this relationship between your own</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:00.400" style="s2">psychological structure</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.400" end="00:06:02.319" style="s2">whatever that happens to be your own</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:14.720" style="s2">i was trying to make say in rule one in</p>

<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">as a hierarchy is a structure that tells</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.960" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">well what should you do and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.479" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">well you can&#39;t tell because nothing is</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:45.120" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.400" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">is something like that which you should</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">you know that constitutes importance um</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">that&#39;s also something that&#39;s relevant i</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">would say too because</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:01.039" style="s2">um a lot of the way that we look at the</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.039" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">we look at the world as a place in which</p>

<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:07.759" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">the nature of the world in terms of how</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">in fact the theory that i am putting</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">forth in general</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">is a theory that&#39;s predicated on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">notion that</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:21.199" style="s2">the essential way that we look at the</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.199" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">as if it&#39;s a forum of action like a</p>

<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">forum like a story that that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.560" style="s2">good way of thinking about it that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">we really do view ourselves and our</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:36.160" style="s2">as a story that&#39;s set in a lan in a</p>

<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">and you know you might argue that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">not the case you could say with that</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:43.039" style="s2">viewpoint for example has been</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:45.280" style="s2">superseded by a scientific viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.039" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t obvious to me that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.280" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">the case and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">certainly isn&#39;t it&#39;s certainly not the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:53.759" style="s2">case that we act that way</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s certainly not the case that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.759" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">structure our political systems that way</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s certainly not the case that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">treat each other that way or that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">think that way</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:05.199" style="s2">or that we react emotionally that way</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:07.280" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s also the case that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.280" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">other thing that&#39;s worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">in this regard is you know we&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">been thinking about the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">as an objective place for</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:19.039" style="s2">500 years something like that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">maybe you could chase it back to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.039" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">ancient greeks and go back 2 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:24.080" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:25.599" style="s2">whatever from a from from a historical</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.080" end="00:08:28.639" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.599" end="00:08:29.759" style="s2">500 years or 200 years is the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.639" end="00:08:32.399" style="s2">amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.759" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">and it&#39;s a tiny fraction of the amount</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.399" end="00:08:35.279" style="s2">of time that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">living creatures that were approximately</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.279" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">like us have been around</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">so we got along fine without thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">about the world as an objective place</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:45.440" style="s2">a very very long time we survived and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:48.000" style="s2">here we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a bad idea but it</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.000" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">it does</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">imply that there are other ways of</p>

<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">that are highly functional and that have</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">been conserved for</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">well for let&#39;s say for evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">reasons and so you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">make the case which you might that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">what you evolve to match</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">is reality at least you match it well</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">enough so that reality doesn&#39;t kill you</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">which is more or less the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:18.480" style="s2">evolution if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.440" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">evolve to match reality in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.480" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">sense and the manner in which you evolve</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">predisposes you to view the world as if</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">of sorts then possibly</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">the world is a narrative of sorts at</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">in so far as it concerns you now what</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:38.560" style="s2">that means metaphysically i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:40.959" style="s2">but that&#39;s okay because</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.560" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">who knows anything metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.959" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">virtually by definition</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:46.959" style="s2">what&#39;s metaphysical is beyond what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:50.320" style="s2">know you can speculate</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">but and and and and so you know i would</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.320" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">speculate that</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">there is something narrative about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">structure of the world but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:09:59.200" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to go down that route we</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.760" end="00:09:59.839" style="s2">can we can just think about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.200" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">practically</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.839" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">so the first thing i want to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">about that i think is really</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:07.120" style="s2">important to lay out the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">this argument is something about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.120" end="00:10:11.279" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:14.240" style="s2">between perception and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.279" end="00:10:15.920" style="s2">emotion and motivation and this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.240" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">actually pretty simple</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.920" end="00:10:22.000" style="s2">and but people don&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">and i guess it&#39;s simple in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.000" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">complex things are simple when you think</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2">them through for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">and understand them and then can finally</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">lay them out</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:35.360" style="s2">you know in some manner that&#39;s rather</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">let&#39;s say clear because you understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:37.920" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">i i derived a fair bit of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.920" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">from a book called the neuropsychology</p>

<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:57.440" style="s2">statement anybody ever made about</p>

<p begin="00:12:06.800" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">he said um i can write in a sentence</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:15.680" style="s2">what other people what it takes other</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.680" end="00:12:21.440" style="s2">a book to write and then he said no they</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:24.240" style="s2">know that they can&#39;t even write in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.440" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">book so that&#39;s pretty good eh it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.240" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">arrogant and then he topped it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">yes this is a man who could</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">who could really write anyways um the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">problem with reading a book like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">beyond good and evil say is that every</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">damn</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">sentence is a thought and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.839" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">deep thought and so reading beyond good</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:45.680" style="s2">and evil it&#39;s like just</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">constantly being punched i mean partly</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.680" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">you&#39;re punched because you read</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:51.279" style="s2">part of it you don&#39;t know what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">he says and so then you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.279" end="00:12:55.920" style="s2">stupid and so that&#39;s a punch</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:57.279" style="s2">and then and then and then now and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.920" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">you stumble across something you</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.279" end="00:13:00.399" style="s2">understand and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">it&#39;s hard on you he said he</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.399" end="00:13:04.000" style="s2">philosophized with a hammer you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.000" end="00:13:06.639" style="s2">that he was breaking things apart and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.000" end="00:13:07.839" style="s2">and and there&#39;s no doubt about that so</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">now and then you run across something</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.839" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">you understand and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">and then that breaks you apart because</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">you understand it and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">and it takes a long time to go through</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">the book because you have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:21.120" style="s2">and and and god that&#39;s not good thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:22.880" style="s2">about things</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.120" end="00:13:24.320" style="s2">you know well it isn&#39;t because you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.880" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">when you think about you already know</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.320" end="00:13:27.760" style="s2">everything in some sense you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">got a map that covers the whole world</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.760" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">which is sort of why you can function</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:32.480" style="s2">and so as long as everything&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:33.200" style="s2">fine you don&#39;t really have to adjust</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.480" end="00:13:35.200" style="s2">your map and</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.200" end="00:13:36.240" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to think but then if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.200" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">come across something</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.240" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">that makes you think then what that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:42.320" style="s2">means is that part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">the way you were thinking was wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.320" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:46.000" style="s2">when you think something when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.040" end="00:13:48.480" style="s2">forced to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.000" end="00:13:50.320" style="s2">then some little part of what you were</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.480" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">your map the way you represent the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.320" end="00:13:55.279" style="s2">it has to die because it was wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">then it has to be replaced by this new</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.279" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">thing and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:14:00.240" style="s2">god only knows how much of what it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">that was there has to die that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.240" end="00:14:04.160" style="s2">the magnitude of error problem and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">people don&#39;t like to think and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.160" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">hard to read difficult books</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">like beyond good and evil because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">just forced to</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">think and think and it&#39;s just exhausting</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:15.680" style="s2">you wish you wish that he would just</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">go away you know which is why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.680" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">trying to not</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">teach difficult books in universities</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:21.519" style="s2">anymore so that people don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:24.240" style="s2">undergo the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.519" end="00:14:26.320" style="s2">difficult process of actually having to</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:27.839" style="s2">think and transform themselves anyways i</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.320" end="00:14:31.519" style="s2">read jeffrey gray&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">the neuropsychology of anxiety and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.519" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">it was like that he he was he was</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:38.800" style="s2">something man</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.839" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">student of a psychologist named hans</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.800" end="00:14:42.079" style="s2">isaac</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">who was the most cited psychologist in</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.079" end="00:14:45.199" style="s2">the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">and and really quite a good psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.199" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">he laid a lot of the groundwork for</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:49.120" style="s2">modern</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">theories of of temperament and</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.120" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">personality they&#39;ve been modified since</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:53.760" style="s2">his work but</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">he got extroversion right he was the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.760" end="00:14:56.399" style="s2">first person to really identify</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">extroversion</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.399" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">in a manner that could be measured carl</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">jung actually invented the notion but</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">isaac figured out how to measure it</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">which is a big deal and he also</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:08.000" style="s2">noted that there was another important</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">personality dimension neuroticism which</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.000" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">is the tendency towards negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:13.279" style="s2">and he got that right too because that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:14.639" style="s2">actually happened to be the case and he</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.279" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">figured out how to measure it so</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.639" end="00:15:18.639" style="s2">isaac was the first person who really</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">established um</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.639" end="00:15:23.920" style="s2">conceptually the fact that our two</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">fundamental we have two fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.920" end="00:15:27.279" style="s2">emotional systems one positive and one</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.279" end="00:15:30.800" style="s2">that they weren&#39;t they&#39;re not opposites</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.839" end="00:15:32.880" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.800" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">they&#39;re actually separate biological</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.880" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">systems so some people can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:37.120" style="s2">extroverted which means they&#39;re quite</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">happy and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.120" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">assertive they smile a lot they laugh a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:41.360" style="s2">lot they tell a lot of jokes they like</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:43.040" style="s2">to party</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.360" end="00:15:46.000" style="s2">they always like to be around people</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.040" end="00:15:48.639" style="s2">that&#39;s a extroverted person</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.000" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">and they can also be unhappy worried</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.639" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">anxious depressed frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">disappointed i mean living with someone</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:54.720" style="s2">like that&#39;s quite a trip</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:15:56.399" style="s2">because they&#39;re just all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.720" end="00:15:58.079" style="s2">but you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.399" end="00:15:59.680" style="s2">but there are people like that because</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.079" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">you can be high in negative emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.680" end="00:16:02.959" style="s2">you can be high in positive emotion or</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:04.959" style="s2">low in both or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s useful to know that it&#39;s useful</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.079" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">it&#39;s probably the maternal instinct</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">dimension</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">but it but at least it&#39;s the variance</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:38.639" style="s2">between compassion and competitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:40.000" style="s2">aggression</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.639" end="00:16:41.680" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that and that looks</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.000" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">like a continuum and there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.680" end="00:16:44.560" style="s2">dimension which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">trait conscientiousness which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.560" end="00:16:48.839" style="s2">integrity and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">and uh and dutifulness um orderliness</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.839" end="00:16:52.399" style="s2">industriousness</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:53.519" style="s2">and then finally an uh the fifth</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.399" end="00:16:55.680" style="s2">dimension which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.519" end="00:16:56.639" style="s2">openness which is like a hybrid between</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.680" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">intellect</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">intelligence roughly and creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:02.480" style="s2">so you can go there and find out how you</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:03.519" style="s2">compare to other people and that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.480" end="00:17:05.360" style="s2">of interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.519" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">useful because it&#39;s kind of useful to</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">know who you are</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">and to to know that that&#39;s actually who</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:12.079" style="s2">you are you know that you have a nature</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:13.919" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.079" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">some some of that stuff&#39;s movable but</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.919" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not as movable as you think and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:19.439" style="s2">the farther you want to move it the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:20.559" style="s2">harder it is to move like you can take</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.439" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">an introvert</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.559" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">um you know you&#39;re an introvert if</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:26.000" style="s2">you&#39;re if when you&#39;re around people</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">you get exhausted by it you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.000" end="00:17:30.160" style="s2">off by yourself and recover you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:31.600" style="s2">then you&#39;re an introvert and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.160" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">an introvert you don&#39;t really like being</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.600" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">in groups and so sales you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:38.880" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s not for you you know um and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:40.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing to know because</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.880" end="00:17:42.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re an introvert why go be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.799" end="00:17:44.880" style="s2">salesperson and be miserable</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.960" end="00:17:46.720" style="s2">do some do something where you can spend</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.880" end="00:17:48.400" style="s2">time alone and not be miserable</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.720" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">that&#39;s better you might as well match</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.400" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">your occupation to your temperament</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:54.400" style="s2">rather than the other way around now you</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">know you can take an introvert</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.400" end="00:17:57.600" style="s2">um i&#39;ve worked with lots of introverts</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:00.640" style="s2">who who</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.600" end="00:18:02.080" style="s2">say had made pretty good progress in</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.640" end="00:18:03.360" style="s2">their careers and they were at a point</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.080" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">where they had to do a lot of social</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.360" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">networking</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:07.679" style="s2">you know and otherwise they were going</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:10.960" style="s2">to hit a plateau in their career</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.679" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">and they could be taught the skills of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:15.440" style="s2">extroversion</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:16.640" style="s2">sort of one at a time rather painfully</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.440" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">so they could learn them they could</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.640" end="00:18:20.480" style="s2">accrue the skills and that would</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">broaden their personality outward into</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.480" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">the say extroverted end of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">continuum but it didn&#39;t make them</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">extroverts</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">and so they were still temperamentally</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:31.679" style="s2">introverts and so you know if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">neurotic person high negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.679" end="00:18:34.799" style="s2">you can you can learn to regulate your</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">anxiety and so forth and</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.799" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">and and and but you hit a point of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">diminishing returns</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:43.520" style="s2">and and it&#39;s and it&#39;s difficult it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">effortful</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.520" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">so anyways back to isaac and then back</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:49.679" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:51.280" style="s2">jeffrey gray so isaac identified</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.679" end="00:18:52.880" style="s2">extraversion and introversion or</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.280" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">extroversion and neuroticism and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.880" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">going to be very important in a minute</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">and gray um elaborated isaac&#39;s theories</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">to a large degree but he did that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">neurologically he he was a he was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:07.200" style="s2">master of the animal experimental</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:08.880" style="s2">literature</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">and a lot of that&#39;s being phased out of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.880" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">universities because the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.240" end="00:19:15.440" style="s2">regulations for animal experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:18.400" style="s2">have become so onerous</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.440" end="00:19:19.360" style="s2">and difficult that it&#39;s much easier for</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.400" end="00:19:22.480" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.360" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">scientists just not to bother</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.480" end="00:19:26.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s a real catastrophe because we</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">have learned a lot about the brain</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.720" end="00:19:30.160" style="s2">in the last 50 years a lot and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:32.799" style="s2">learned</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.160" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">very little about the brain from pet</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.799" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">scans and mri scans and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">like that complicated technology that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">used to study human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:44.160" style="s2">an unbelievable amount by studying</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:44.799" style="s2">animals and you might think rats in</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.160" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.799" end="00:19:48.240" style="s2">and you might think well you know rats</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:50.480" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.240" end="00:19:51.760" style="s2">they&#39;re not much like human beings you</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.480" end="00:19:55.200" style="s2">know but but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.760" end="00:19:55.960" style="s2">wrong um um you share i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.200" end="00:19:59.440" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.960" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">98.5 of your genetic structure with rats</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">some of you probably more than that um</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">and and you know we we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:11.440" style="s2">devolved from the common ancestor with</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.600" end="00:20:13.600" style="s2">rats from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:15.200" style="s2">that long ago i mean like it&#39;s millions</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.600" end="00:20:17.919" style="s2">of years ago you know but</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.200" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s short compared to how long ago</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">we devolved</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">let&#39;s say from or we we yeah devolved i</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:24.640" style="s2">think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">good enough from amphibians and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.640" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">a lot like rats man and we have the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2">skeletal structure and our brains are</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">quite similar and the neurochemistry is</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.400" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">very very very similar i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">neurochemistry is similar right down to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">the level of crustaceans which is why i</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">wrote about lobsters in</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:42.240" style="s2">rule one because our because i thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">it was so bloody amazing when i came</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.240" end="00:20:47.360" style="s2">across that literature to see that</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:48.799" style="s2">um when lobsters are defeated in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.360" end="00:20:50.480" style="s2">social contest</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.799" end="00:20:53.039" style="s2">and they lose their hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.480" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">position that they undergo</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.039" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">neurochemical changes that are analogous</p>

<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">that&#39;s so amazing and that the same damn</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:05.360" style="s2">drugs that help</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">us antidepressants essentially also</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.360" end="00:21:08.559" style="s2">cheer up defeated lobsters i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:11.600" style="s2">such a</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.559" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a staggering demonstration of the</p>

<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">unbelievable spans of time you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:21.520" style="s2">critics have</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">complained that i cherry-picked the data</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.520" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">but they don&#39;t know what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">so they don&#39;t they don&#39;t i studied the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.679" end="00:21:28.159" style="s2">serotonin system for a very very long</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:29.919" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.159" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">and i know perfectly well that one of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.919" end="00:21:35.280" style="s2">the things that it does</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">is monitor your position</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.280" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">in a social hierarchy and and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:42.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s more important than that</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:44.960" style="s2">because the serotonin system</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.240" end="00:21:45.520" style="s2">is a it&#39;s a master control neurochemical</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.960" end="00:21:47.360" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.520" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like the conductor of an orchestra</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.360" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">everything in your brain depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:52.400" style="s2">serotonin system which is why</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">you think about it like an</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.400" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">antidepressant um</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">decreases the rate at which neurons will</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">reuptake</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:01.679" style="s2">serotonin you need serotonin to modulate</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">the way your neurons work</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.679" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">you take an antidepressant and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">serotonin works a little longer</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">okay so what&#39;s the consequence of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.919" end="00:22:11.039" style="s2">well let&#39;s say you&#39;re depressed</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:13.039" style="s2">okay we&#39;ve got to think about being</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.039" end="00:22:16.559" style="s2">depressed for a minute so when when</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:16.559" style="s2">you&#39;re depressed this is what happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">all you remember about the past is</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">what&#39;s negative so everything about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:24.400" style="s2">past is negative</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:25.280" style="s2">all you can see in the present is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.400" end="00:22:28.159" style="s2">negative</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.280" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">everything about the present is negative</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.159" end="00:22:30.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.480" end="00:22:32.720" style="s2">nothing about the future is positive at</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.240" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">all and so so that&#39;s interesting a</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.720" end="00:22:35.039" style="s2">because it means that something has</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:36.919" style="s2">shifted</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.039" end="00:22:38.159" style="s2">inside you let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.919" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">neurophysiologically</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.159" end="00:22:45.600" style="s2">that changes the way you view everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">everything your entire past the present</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">and the entire future</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">and what it essentially does is</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:52.799" style="s2">exaggerate negative emotion to a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">tremendous degree that&#39;s depression</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.799" end="00:22:56.960" style="s2">and suppress positive emotion now there</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">can be variants in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.960" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">sometimes you see depressed people and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">they come you can think about your own</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">mood in this way you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:05.280" style="s2">you might say well i&#39;m not that sad but</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:06.640" style="s2">i&#39;ve just sort of lost my interest in</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.280" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.640" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">okay so that means that what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:10.960" style="s2">is your positive emotion system has been</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">suppressed</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.960" end="00:23:14.799" style="s2">because the positive emotion system is</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">what gives you that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.799" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">interest in things that pulls you</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">forward to action</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">okay and the negative emotion system</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:24.080" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:26.400" style="s2">anxiety that&#39;s a huge part of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.080" end="00:23:28.799" style="s2">frustration disappointment grief</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.400" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">pain that kind of covers it anger is</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.799" end="00:23:32.480" style="s2">well though anger is a bit complicated</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">because it&#39;s half a positive emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.480" end="00:23:35.760" style="s2">half a negative emotion which is why it</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">feels so good to get angry</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.760" end="00:23:40.480" style="s2">by the way and why it also impels you to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">action whereas most negative emotions</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.480" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">stop you</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.440" end="00:23:47.279" style="s2">you know so so in in any case</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:48.799" style="s2">um if you&#39;re if your serotonin system if</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.279" end="00:23:51.679" style="s2">your serotonin function</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.799" end="00:23:52.880" style="s2">declines then all of a sudden everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.679" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">is negative</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.880" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">you think well isn&#39;t that interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.559" end="00:23:58.320" style="s2">how the hell can it be that</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">something can change within you that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.320" end="00:24:02.400" style="s2">changes everything</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">and the answer has to be well it must be</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.400" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">a fundamental system that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">changed right because if it changes</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">it has to be a system on which all other</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:13.919" style="s2">depend and that is the case with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.720" end="00:24:15.120" style="s2">serotonin system</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.919" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s really worth knowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.120" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">especially when you also know that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:20.400" style="s2">serotonin system</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:22.640" style="s2">counts where you are in the social</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.400" end="00:24:24.320" style="s2">hierarchy and so there&#39;s this weird kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.640" end="00:24:27.200" style="s2">of one-to-one correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">imagine a social hierarchy has 10 levels</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.200" end="00:24:30.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t care what</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">hierarchy you&#39;re in most people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.640" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">hierarchies are actually quite small</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">they sort of consist of the people that</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.159" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">they compare themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:39.279" style="s2">you know which is a strange thing too</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">because one of the things that you see</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.279" end="00:24:41.360" style="s2">happening with really successful people</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.360" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">they actually don&#39;t get a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">lot happier and a lot less unhappy as</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">they climb the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:55.600" style="s2">the broad social ladder because the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:57.840" style="s2">people they compare themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.600" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">change and so i can tell you a funny</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.840" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">story about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">so i know this guy i worked with him for</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">a long time his name is adeoresi</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:06.320" style="s2">and he&#39;s a hell of a guy he&#39;s like six</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">foot seven and he&#39;s like really</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.320" end="00:25:09.279" style="s2">charismatic and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:11.440" style="s2">and he&#39;s been pretty successful he built</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.279" end="00:25:12.559" style="s2">this company in in san francisco called</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.440" end="00:25:14.400" style="s2">founder institute</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.559" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s only one of many things he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.400" end="00:25:19.600" style="s2">done and um</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">it&#39;s operating in 165 cities</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.600" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a school to teach people how to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:24.559" style="s2">entrepreneurs he&#39;s trying to export</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:26.880" style="s2">silicon valley</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.559" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">um what would you call it know how</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.880" end="00:25:30.880" style="s2">technological and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">and financial to the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.880" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">and in like five years he built 165</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:37.440" style="s2">schools not not physical schools but</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:39.760" style="s2">school-like</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.440" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">organizations around the world and like</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.760" end="00:25:43.520" style="s2">go go try that</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">like that&#39;s really hard you know just to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.520" end="00:25:47.679" style="s2">build one is hard but to do that in</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">multiple languages all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.679" end="00:25:52.159" style="s2">it&#39;s bloody well impossible and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">at the same time he built his</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.159" end="00:25:56.960" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">started 2500 successful companies as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.960" end="00:25:59.919" style="s2">consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">of building this school it&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.919" end="00:26:03.520" style="s2">pretty good you know and</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">and and he was having a rough time and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.520" end="00:26:07.679" style="s2">was talking to me on the phone</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:09.279" style="s2">um about about you know he wasn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">happy about what he&#39;d done with his life</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.279" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">and he said geez</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">i compare myself with my roommate and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve hardly done anything and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.559" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">his roommate was elon musk</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.159" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like i just laughed at him i</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">thought geez</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:27.440" style="s2">really that&#39;s what you&#39;re gonna you</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">haven&#39;t done anything compared to elon</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.440" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">musk</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.320" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">and you&#39;re depressed about it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">yeah well you and the rest of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">i mean look</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">what it must must what did he do he</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:39.279" style="s2">invented an electric car</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">that&#39;s impossible then he made it work</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.279" end="00:26:41.679" style="s2">that&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:43.760" style="s2">and then he built an entire</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.679" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">infrastructure to charge it</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.760" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">and and and that worked and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">impossible</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:51.360" style="s2">and then and then they&#39;re good cars and</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:52.080" style="s2">and then he made them faster than any</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">cars have ever</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.080" end="00:26:56.559" style="s2">been and cheap and so that&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">and then that wasn&#39;t good enough so then</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.559" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">he decided that he would compete with</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:03.919" style="s2">nasa which is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">and build rockets at one tenth the price</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.919" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">they were building them except bigger</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:10.799" style="s2">and then he would shoot his car on his</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">rocket out into space</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.799" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">right and he did all that and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.600" end="00:27:16.640" style="s2">a day i was thinking i&#39;ve hardly done</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:19.600" style="s2">anything with my life</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.640" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh so but my point is is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.600" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">you you primates of our type</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:28.799" style="s2">sort of have an a group size that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:29.840" style="s2">think about as our group of about 200</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.799" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">people so like</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:33.679" style="s2">on facebook for example the probability</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:36.559" style="s2">that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:37.279" style="s2">something approximating reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.559" end="00:27:39.919" style="s2">constant</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.279" end="00:27:40.799" style="s2">communication with more than 200 people</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:42.399" style="s2">is low</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">you just don&#39;t have the time and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.399" end="00:27:46.159" style="s2">can&#39;t keep track of it so</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:47.039" style="s2">so our natural group is something like</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.159" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">200 and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.039" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">our groups tend to fragment when they</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:50.799" style="s2">get bigger than that and so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.799" end="00:27:54.960" style="s2">associated by by the way with cortical</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.799" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">size you see this in primates is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.960" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">as primates get developed larger brains</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:01.440" style="s2">this the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">group size that they seem to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:04.640" style="s2">manage also increases and</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">that might be part of the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.640" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">they develop larger brains</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:10.080" style="s2">who knows but anyways it&#39;s about 200</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.679" end="00:28:11.679" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.080" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">and the problem is is that as you get</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:16.960" style="s2">more successful say</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">in in the global hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.960" end="00:28:22.559" style="s2">uh 100 million people the 200 people</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">that you compare yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.559" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">changes and so that you end up with 100</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:27.440" style="s2">million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:30.080" style="s2">and you&#39;re not very happy because your</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.440" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">50 billion yacht is like 20 feet shorter</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.080" end="00:28:34.320" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">your friends you know 150 million dollar</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.320" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">yacht and</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">so and you&#39;re high in neuroticism so</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:40.320" style="s2">that makes you frustrated and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:43.120" style="s2">disappointed you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.320" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">so anyways anyways it&#39;s important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.120" end="00:28:46.240" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">to understand it&#39;s the the the message</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.240" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">here the point of this is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">you have a system the serotonin system</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.720" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">base of your</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">neural physiology it also sets your</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.720" end="00:28:59.039" style="s2">brain up during embryonic development</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:29:00.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s it really is it&#39;s really is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.039" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">master control system</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.480" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">in many many ways and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">it counts where you are in your</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">and then it decides how much positive</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">emotion and how much negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:16.640" style="s2">you should feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">on average because of your position</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.640" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">and so like if you&#39;re let&#39;s say number</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:22.159" style="s2">one is at the top and number 10 is at</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:23.760" style="s2">the bottom so you&#39;re number 10</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:25.840" style="s2">you&#39;re barely clinging to the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.760" end="00:29:27.440" style="s2">reality your brain says look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.840" end="00:29:28.799" style="s2">dangerous where you are at the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.440" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">the hierarchy you don&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.799" end="00:29:32.720" style="s2">friends</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:34.559" style="s2">it&#39;s uh it&#39;s precarious down there and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.720" end="00:29:35.440" style="s2">so that means any little thing that goes</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.559" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.440" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">any little error you make that might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">the end of you and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">you better be on guard and alert and if</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:46.320" style="s2">something small happens</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:46.720" style="s2">it it better hurt because it might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.320" end="00:29:49.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.720" end="00:29:52.960" style="s2">straw that breaks the camel&#39;s back and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.520" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing pleasant about that like</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.960" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">of course why would there be why would</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">there be anything pleasant about</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:30:02.880" style="s2">us a process that magnifies</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">everything negative you feel about</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:05.520" style="s2">anything that might be wrong and and not</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:07.279" style="s2">just on</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.520" end="00:30:08.640" style="s2">not just on one small dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.279" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">negative emotion not just</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.640" end="00:30:14.480" style="s2">anxiety which is bad enough but anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.000" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">and the pain related emotions so</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.480" end="00:30:19.880" style="s2">pain related emotions are pain obviously</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:21.440" style="s2">that it generally indicates damage to a</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.880" end="00:30:24.080" style="s2">psychophysiological system</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.440" end="00:30:26.240" style="s2">but grief is a pain-like emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.080" end="00:30:28.720" style="s2">frustration is a pain-like emotion</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.240" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">and so is disappointment loneliness as</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.720" end="00:30:32.640" style="s2">well those are all</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:34.880" style="s2">pain-like emotions and have elaborated</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.640" end="00:30:36.799" style="s2">out of an underlying pain system and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.880" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">the so the negative emotion system is</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.799" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">like a tree that has branches</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">and each of the branches is the separate</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:44.799" style="s2">negative emotion you know but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:46.399" style="s2">all tied together at the root and</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.799" end="00:30:47.360" style="s2">positive emotions are like that as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.399" end="00:30:48.399" style="s2">except they&#39;re not quite as</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.360" end="00:30:51.039" style="s2">differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.399" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">and so if your serotonin levels fall</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.039" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">because you&#39;ve suffered a</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">hierarchical defeat then the positive</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">emotion system gets flattened so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:02.320" style="s2">good things no longer feel good because</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:04.080" style="s2">it&#39;s dangerous to take risks perhaps if</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:05.679" style="s2">you&#39;re at the bottom of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.080" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">and you&#39;re not doing very well which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:08.799" style="s2">why you&#39;re at the bottom why should you</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">have any trust in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.799" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have any friends and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:13.840" style="s2">you&#39;re not well situated in</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">in the social world you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.840" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">be enthusiastically</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">moving forward to do new things and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:22.720" style="s2">your motivation for</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:24.799" style="s2">for for engaging in life declines and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">can decline pretty much to zero you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.799" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:28.799" style="s2">if you see people who are seriously</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:30.320" style="s2">depressed they say well i can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.799" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">listen to music anymore</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.320" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">it just sounds flat and dead you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:36.399" style="s2">and you know if you talk to someone who</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:38.559" style="s2">says that about music they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.399" end="00:31:40.159" style="s2">they&#39;re pretty damn depressed because</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.559" end="00:31:42.640" style="s2">music is one of those things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.159" end="00:31:43.360" style="s2">virtually everybody always enjoys you</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.640" end="00:31:46.480" style="s2">know at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">one genre or another and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.480" end="00:31:48.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:50.880" style="s2">depressed person will describe even that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.640" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">the sensory quality has changed</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.880" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">and so and then they also say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:54.960" style="s2">absolutely overwhelmed with negative</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:57.760" style="s2">emotion</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.960" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">and so okay so that&#39;s a good thing so</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.760" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:02.399" style="s2">very interesting thing to know is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:05.679" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.399" end="00:32:07.840" style="s2">the manner in which one of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.679" end="00:32:12.320" style="s2">fundamental neurochemical systems</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.840" end="00:32:15.679" style="s2">is tracking your position in a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.320" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">is crucial to the maintenance of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.679" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">emotional stability okay so</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">so so so now you want to keep you want</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">to keep that in mind because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">first important point okay so now</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:28.320" style="s2">now the next thing i&#39;m going to do is</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">explain to you</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:31.919" style="s2">how it is that the way you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:33.919" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.919" end="00:32:35.760" style="s2">is related to the emotions that i just</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.919" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">described and then i&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.760" end="00:32:40.399" style="s2">about how that</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:41.440" style="s2">in itself is related to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.399" end="00:32:43.200" style="s2">hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.440" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">and and and we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.200" end="00:32:48.159" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna explore from there</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">so when you look at the world you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.159" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">you see you think that the world is made</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:55.519" style="s2">obvious objects and that you look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.120" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.519" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">and then you think about what they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">and then you think about how</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:01.440" style="s2">you evaluate them and then you think</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:02.640" style="s2">about how you use them and then you</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.440" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">decide to act</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.640" end="00:33:06.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s not the case because the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:09.440" style="s2">world doesn&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.240" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">segregated neatly into objects</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.440" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">and it took people a long time to figure</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">this out because</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">when you look at the world there it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">segregated neatly into objects right it</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">takes no effort at all except takes half</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:23.679" style="s2">your damn brain to do that</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.760" end="00:33:25.440" style="s2">right and we&#39;re very visual creatures we</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.679" end="00:33:28.960" style="s2">have great visual systems</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.440" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">and and and so a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.960" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">metabolic energy and evolutionary uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">uh expenditure of time has gone into</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:40.240" style="s2">providing us with a visual system that</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">just breaks the world up into obvious</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.240" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">objects for us</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">and it isn&#39;t that isn&#39;t even right</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:47.440" style="s2">because we don&#39;t actually see</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:48.399" style="s2">objects what we see are more like tools</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.440" end="00:33:49.840" style="s2">and obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.399" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">we just think they&#39;re objects like when</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.840" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">you come in here i can give you an</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:55.840" style="s2">example of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">okay think about a bean bag okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.840" end="00:34:03.039" style="s2">i think about a stump and think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">a stool say those are all chairs</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.039" end="00:34:07.600" style="s2">okay it&#39;s like what do you mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">all chairs what do they have in common</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.600" end="00:34:11.200" style="s2">objectively speaking a bean bag doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:15.040" style="s2">have legs</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.200" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">you know a stump is rock hard and solid</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.040" end="00:34:19.760" style="s2">a stool is is something almost</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">completely unlike a beanbag</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.760" end="00:34:24.399" style="s2">well they&#39;re all chairs well why well</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.879" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.399" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">you can sit on them and so most of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">things that we group together as</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:33.359" style="s2">objects we group together as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">consequence of functional utility</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.359" end="00:34:37.040" style="s2">and not because they share a set of</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">features of</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.040" end="00:34:41.040" style="s2">that are objectively similar and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.359" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">reason that we perceive</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.040" end="00:34:43.919" style="s2">in that manner is because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:45.679" style="s2">really care that much about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.919" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">objective features of the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.679" end="00:34:49.119" style="s2">because we have to care about being</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">alive and so what we actually care about</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.119" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">is what</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:55.280" style="s2">things do and so we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:57.200" style="s2">see things that do things and group</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.280" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">together perceptually things that do</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.200" end="00:34:59.920" style="s2">things and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">you know when you walk into a room like</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.920" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">this there is a trillion things you</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">could look at</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.680" end="00:35:07.599" style="s2">you could look at the color variation in</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">the carpet forever</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.599" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">you know if you if you came in here on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:13.680" style="s2">psychedelic you might even do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:15.760" style="s2">right well it&#39;s interesting because one</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.680" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">of the things psychedelics do is</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.760" end="00:35:21.440" style="s2">they they decrease the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">you view the world in an iconic manner</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.440" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">and then you see the incredible</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:28.560" style="s2">that&#39;s underneath everything and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">absolutely fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:31.920" style="s2">now it&#39;s not good because you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">come in here and just look at the carpet</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.920" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">for an hour you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:37.599" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not that productive unless</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to equate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.599" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">re well re re-equate yourself with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">fundamental wonder of the world you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:44.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:46.880" style="s2">there is some utility in that artists do</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.960" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">that but practically speaking it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.880" end="00:35:49.760" style="s2">that useful</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:51.359" style="s2">what happens when you come in here you</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.760" end="00:35:53.040" style="s2">know you have a goal in mind you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.359" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">going to watch what happens on the stage</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.040" end="00:35:55.839" style="s2">you&#39;re going to listen</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.839" end="00:35:57.839" style="s2">and so you only see what&#39;s relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.839" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">that and so what you see are chairs and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.839" end="00:36:01.599" style="s2">chairs are things you</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:03.760" style="s2">sit on and so they pop up into your</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.599" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">perceptual field just like that and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.760" end="00:36:07.280" style="s2">you you know what to do with the chair</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">you sit on it and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.280" end="00:36:11.119" style="s2">partly the reason you know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">with the chair isn&#39;t because you look at</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.119" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">the chair and you think oh look a chair</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">because you didn&#39;t do that when you came</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">in here right now there wasn&#39;t a single</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">one of you</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:20.000" style="s2">that came in here and looked at at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:22.640" style="s2">rose here and said</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.000" end="00:36:25.119" style="s2">oh look chairs right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.640" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">self-evident that they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.119" end="00:36:28.480" style="s2">what happens is that you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:31.599" style="s2">chair and it maps</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.480" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">the the chair maps itself onto your body</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.599" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">like you prepare yourself that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.760" end="00:36:37.839" style="s2">perception prepares you</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:39.680" style="s2">for the action so as soon as you see the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.839" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">chair which has a certain shape</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.680" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">so imagine it&#39;s a pattern that sustains</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">itself in time</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:46.400" style="s2">right because that&#39;s what a chair is</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a pattern that sustains itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">across time</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.440" end="00:36:51.839" style="s2">and that pattern is transformed into a</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">pattern of light and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.839" end="00:36:54.240" style="s2">transformed into a pattern on your</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">retina</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.240" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s transferred into a pattern on</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:37:00.000" style="s2">your optical nerve and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">transferred into patterns all over your</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.000" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:05.040" style="s2">and some of those patterns are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:07.599" style="s2">patterns that allow you to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.040" end="00:37:09.680" style="s2">the chair consciously and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.599" end="00:37:10.400" style="s2">are patterns that enable your body to</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:12.640" style="s2">prepare</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.400" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">to take this position in the chair</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">because part of what your eyes do</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">is map right onto your motor system so</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">that you look and you know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">and it makes you a lot faster right you</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">look at something you know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">supposed to do with it your body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">prepared to do it</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">and that and that&#39;s kind of also what it</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">means to understand something</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.359" end="00:37:30.640" style="s2">you know if you look at it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.599" end="00:37:32.160" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.640" end="00:37:34.400" style="s2">you know how to use it it means you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.160" end="00:37:36.800" style="s2">just map the thing right onto your body</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.400" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">and so some people people are people are</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.800" end="00:37:40.720" style="s2">very very good at that and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:42.240" style="s2">especially as you develop expertise at</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.720" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">something you just get better and better</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">and better at that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">there are people that have certain forms</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:49.359" style="s2">of brain damage um</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">lermite syndrome i think it was called</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.359" end="00:37:53.119" style="s2">if i remember</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:55.119" style="s2">correctly also known as utilization</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.119" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">syndrome and these are people who have</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.119" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">a degeneration of the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">which is the part of your brain</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">that organizes your behavior i would say</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">at the highest level of abstraction so</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">when you&#39;re thinking voluntarily about</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:08.720" style="s2">what you might do</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:10.240" style="s2">and then you go do it it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:12.640" style="s2">prefrontal cortex that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.240" end="00:38:14.160" style="s2">thought that up voluntarily and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.640" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2">organized the rest of your brain to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.160" end="00:38:17.680" style="s2">do it and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.040" end="00:38:18.240" style="s2">it kind of one of the things it does is</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.680" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">inhibit</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.240" end="00:38:22.240" style="s2">all the other things you might do so one</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">of the things that happens to people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.240" end="00:38:25.040" style="s2">have prefrontal damage</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:26.640" style="s2">especially if it&#39;s on the right hand</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.040" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">side is they get very socially</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.640" end="00:38:29.760" style="s2">inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:31.440" style="s2">because they have all sorts of whims and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.760" end="00:38:34.240" style="s2">motivations and emotions</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.440" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">that would normally be inhibited by you</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.240" end="00:38:38.960" style="s2">know attention to context let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:40.880" style="s2">and the desire for voluntary activity</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.960" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">and they lose that part of the brain and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.880" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">so they get</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:45.920" style="s2">they get disinhibited they can get</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:46.800" style="s2">disinhibited to the point where they</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.920" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">have to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.800" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">institutionalized or jailed because they</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">start acting so inappropriately that</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:54.800" style="s2">they can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:57.119" style="s2">controlled and so anyways lermit</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.800" end="00:38:58.480" style="s2">syndrome is utilization syndrome and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.119" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">one of the things that happens to people</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.480" end="00:39:02.079" style="s2">who have utilization syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:04.240" style="s2">let&#39;s say they&#39;re in an old folks home</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.079" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s consequence of a degenerative</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.240" end="00:39:07.440" style="s2">neurological disease and they&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">down the hallway and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.440" end="00:39:13.119" style="s2">open door and they walk through it</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:14.079" style="s2">they can&#39;t help it because what do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.119" end="00:39:18.079" style="s2">do with a door that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.079" end="00:39:21.119" style="s2">open you walk through it now you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.079" end="00:39:23.440" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing something else right</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.119" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">but if you&#39;re not doing something else</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.440" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">because you haven&#39;t got the part of you</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:27.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">is helping you do something else then</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.760" end="00:39:31.680" style="s2">the object just tells you what to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">you know and you see this with little</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.680" end="00:39:35.839" style="s2">kids too because whenever</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">you present them with an object you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.839" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">they grip they</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:39.920" style="s2">grab it right away they often grab it</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.240" end="00:39:41.440" style="s2">and put it in their mouths and they do</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.920" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">that because their mouths are already</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.440" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">wired up</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2">completely when they&#39;re born right but</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.320" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">from a sensory perspective and from a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.079" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">motor perspective and so kids are always</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.680" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">cramming things into their mouth</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:52.880" style="s2">so that they can investigate them with</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:55.119" style="s2">their tongue and map what they are</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.880" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">it&#39;s important for them to well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.119" end="00:39:59.359" style="s2">how they learn about the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:40:00.000" style="s2">and so anyways if you have utilization</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.359" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.000" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t not utilize things so you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:05.839" style="s2">hand someone</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">a bottle or a cup of water who has</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.839" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">utilization syndrome and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">thirsty and they&#39;ll drink it because</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:12.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a cup of water and what is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.880" end="00:40:18.400" style="s2">object it&#39;s a thing to grip and</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:19.680" style="s2">drink you know and it&#39;s it&#39;s how else</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:22.240" style="s2">can you look at this uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.680" end="00:40:23.359" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a cliff it&#39;s a falling off</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.240" end="00:40:24.720" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.359" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">right and if you&#39;re if you&#39;re one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.720" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">those strange creatures who just think</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a cliff</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:33.040" style="s2">and and and you know you&#39;re i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">what you&#39;re abstracted in thought and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.040" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">you walk off it then you&#39;re dead</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot better to perceive it as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">falling off</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:41.200" style="s2">place which is what you do because you</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">know you you know what it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.200" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">go somewhere that&#39;s steep and you kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:46.240" style="s2">of play with the edge a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:48.560" style="s2">you can feel the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.240" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">falling off place map itself on your</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.560" end="00:40:54.240" style="s2">whole body it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a strange i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.240" end="00:40:57.520" style="s2">an interesting experiment to play with</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.240" end="00:40:58.800" style="s2">that you you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:00.720" style="s2">you might be back here and you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.800" end="00:41:02.079" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not too bad i wonder if i</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.720" end="00:41:04.400" style="s2">can get a little closer</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.079" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">you know and and maybe you can and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">you can get well maybe you can get too</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:08.800" style="s2">close</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">and then you&#39;re an evolutionary mistake</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.800" end="00:41:13.280" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:15.440" style="s2">but but you know you get you get</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.280" end="00:41:17.040" style="s2">close enough maybe you peer over and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.440" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">think yeah that&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.040" end="00:41:21.200" style="s2">and you can feel the falling off place</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:24.000" style="s2">map itself onto your body and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">that&#39;s you perceive with your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.000" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">and your motivations</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:29.040" style="s2">and your action systems way more than</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.240" end="00:41:32.000" style="s2">you think</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.040" end="00:41:32.480" style="s2">so you don&#39;t it isn&#39;t object picture on</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.000" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">your eye</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.480" end="00:41:37.520" style="s2">picture in your brain thought emotion</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">and then action that that&#39;s not how it</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.520" end="00:41:39.839" style="s2">works you&#39;re you&#39;re representing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:42.079" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.839" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">at multiple levels in your nervous</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.079" end="00:41:45.839" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">at the same time and and and you need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:48.400" style="s2">and one of those levels is emotional so</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:50.160" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.400" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">here here goes for the emotional part</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.160" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">now look</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.440" end="00:41:56.000" style="s2">um and this is this is just as important</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:41:58.640" style="s2">as the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.000" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">serotonin idea i would say which means</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.640" end="00:42:02.079" style="s2">it&#39;s really important because the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:03.040" style="s2">serotonin idea is really important to</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.079" end="00:42:05.520" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.040" end="00:42:07.359" style="s2">your position in the social hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.520" end="00:42:08.000" style="s2">determines the balance between your</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.359" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">positive</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.000" end="00:42:11.359" style="s2">and negative emotion that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:13.280" style="s2">crucial insight into</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.359" end="00:42:14.560" style="s2">human behavior and and that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">positive emotion system</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.560" end="00:42:17.599" style="s2">and that we have a negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:21.359" style="s2">system and that they&#39;re separate</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.599" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">those are unbelievably important um</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.359" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">important discoveries all all made by</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:26.400" style="s2">the way virtually all made by animal</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:28.240" style="s2">experimentalists</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">just so you know because they deserve</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.240" end="00:42:34.079" style="s2">some credit um so</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:34.800" style="s2">now the the issue is how is your</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.079" end="00:42:38.160" style="s2">perception</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.800" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">related to your emotion and so it looks</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.160" end="00:42:41.359" style="s2">like it</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:42.480" style="s2">and this is much much of this i learned</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.359" end="00:42:44.800" style="s2">from jeffrey gray</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">now gray was a student of isaac but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.800" end="00:42:47.440" style="s2">also a student of someone named norbert</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:50.560" style="s2">weiner</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.440" end="00:42:53.119" style="s2">who was a uh cyberneticist</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.560" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">at mit he established the field of</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.119" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">cybernetics and he was one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:59.680" style="s2">people who he was one of the founders of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:43:00.640" style="s2">of of computational science he was a big</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.680" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">deal</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.640" end="00:43:04.079" style="s2">norbert winer and his his his his work</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.599" end="00:43:06.560" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.079" end="00:43:08.079" style="s2">tremendous impact on all sorts of fields</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.560" end="00:43:10.079" style="s2">and he was trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.079" end="00:43:11.599" style="s2">uh how to generate autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.079" end="00:43:14.640" style="s2">self-correcting systems</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.599" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">so let&#39;s say intelligence systems and</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.640" end="00:43:21.119" style="s2">us among them because we&#39;re autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:24.000" style="s2">self-correcting systems and so gray knew</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">about norbert weiner&#39;s work and he</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">integrated that with</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:28.079" style="s2">isaac&#39;s work and then with all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:28.800" style="s2">psychobiology and he came up with a</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.079" end="00:43:31.599" style="s2">lovely</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.800" end="00:43:32.160" style="s2">set of ideas that are extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.160" end="00:43:39.200" style="s2">and so here&#39;s one of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">we live inside we perceive this is part</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.200" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">of perceiving the world as a story</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:48.000" style="s2">we perceive the world as a place</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.000" end="00:43:49.599" style="s2">to go from one location to another</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.000" end="00:43:51.599" style="s2">so you can imagine that we&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.599" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">journey that&#39;s our life it&#39;s a journey</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:54.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:55.280" style="s2">it might be a ten 10-minute journey it</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.319" end="00:43:57.119" style="s2">might be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:43:58.800" style="s2">15-minute journey it might be the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.119" end="00:44:00.319" style="s2">journey of a week it might be</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.800" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">the journey of a month or the journey of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.319" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">a lifetime and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">you know maybe what you would want is</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">that the journey of</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:08.319" style="s2">a minute and 10 minutes and a week and a</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:11.839" style="s2">month</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.319" end="00:44:13.359" style="s2">and a year culminate into the journey of</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.839" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">a lifetime you know you could imagine</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.359" end="00:44:16.560" style="s2">that you would want some continuity</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:19.040" style="s2">across all that so that</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.560" end="00:44:20.160" style="s2">that there was some what would integrity</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.040" end="00:44:21.920" style="s2">to your existence</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.160" end="00:44:24.079" style="s2">so that each part of what you were doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.920" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">was related in some intelligible way to</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.079" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">the whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:28.319" style="s2">that would be that would be an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:30.800" style="s2">when you think of someone as ha</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.319" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">as as being integrated right as having</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.800" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">something like that um that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">what you mean is you mean that</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:40.640" style="s2">all the parts of what they do fit</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">somehow into an integrated whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:43.920" style="s2">and so that&#39;s kind of interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">know too because if you have a value</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.920" end="00:44:49.280" style="s2">system that&#39;s well structured then</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">all the little things you do are part of</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.280" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">the big thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:53.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing whatever that big</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.400" end="00:44:56.480" style="s2">thing is</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.280" end="00:44:58.000" style="s2">and you are doing that big thing okay so</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.480" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s another thing to keep</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.000" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">in mind</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.720" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">now so you&#39;re looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.040" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">you&#39;re a creature of action you have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.560" end="00:45:06.560" style="s2">be a creature of action because you</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">have to act in order to live because if</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.560" end="00:45:09.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t act</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:11.359" style="s2">well then you fall apart and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.760" end="00:45:13.280" style="s2">overwhelmed by despair</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.359" end="00:45:15.599" style="s2">and negative emotion and you starve to</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.280" end="00:45:18.800" style="s2">death and you die and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.599" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">not acting not an option</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.800" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">so unless you willing to take the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">consequences i just described so you</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">better look at the world as a place to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">act</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.960" end="00:45:30.880" style="s2">and so how do you act well</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:32.560" style="s2">you&#39;re somewhere you should know where</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.880" end="00:45:35.119" style="s2">you are by the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.560" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">that that&#39;s very helpful psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.119" end="00:45:38.079" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:39.760" style="s2">imagine you have a map you&#39;re in a car</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.079" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.760" end="00:45:43.280" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get somewhere the map&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:44.240" style="s2">not helpful because you don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.280" end="00:45:45.359" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.240" end="00:45:46.960" style="s2">and so even if you know where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.359" end="00:45:48.640" style="s2">going but you don&#39;t know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.960" end="00:45:50.560" style="s2">the map isn&#39;t useful and</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.640" end="00:45:51.680" style="s2">the same applies the same really does</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.560" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">apply to your life</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.680" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know where you are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">very hard to map out where you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">and well that has consequences for</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:03.280" style="s2">emotion as well because going somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">is actually what activates the positive</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:09.359" style="s2">emotion system that&#39;s what it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:09.359" style="s2">the positive emotion system is to</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.760" end="00:46:13.200" style="s2">facilitate movement forward to a better</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:15.119" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.200" end="00:46:16.800" style="s2">that&#39;s its function so that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.119" end="00:46:19.280" style="s2">interesting because it means that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.800" end="00:46:20.160" style="s2">if you&#39;re not moving forward to a better</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.280" end="00:46:23.040" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.160" end="00:46:24.240" style="s2">then you don&#39;t have any positive emotion</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.040" end="00:46:26.400" style="s2">and so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:27.920" style="s2">and there&#39;s another conclusion that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.400" end="00:46:29.760" style="s2">can derive from that too which is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.920" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have a value system</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.760" end="00:46:33.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t have any positive emotion</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:35.040" style="s2">because the value system is what posits</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.440" end="00:46:35.839" style="s2">that one thing is worth doing more than</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.040" end="00:46:38.960" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:39.760" style="s2">and if one thing isn&#39;t worth doing more</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.960" end="00:46:41.760" style="s2">than another</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.760" end="00:46:42.800" style="s2">then you don&#39;t have any value any place</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.760" end="00:46:44.400" style="s2">valuable to go</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.800" end="00:46:46.560" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t have any place valuable</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.400" end="00:46:47.599" style="s2">to go go then you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.560" end="00:46:49.520" style="s2">positive emotion</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.599" end="00:46:51.760" style="s2">and so that&#39;s so when people are</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.520" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">criticizing hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.760" end="00:46:55.280" style="s2">which they do a lot especially</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.240" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">politically there shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.280" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">hierarchies it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">really really there shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:02.560" style="s2">hierarchy say</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:03.760" style="s2">how is it that you propose to look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.560" end="00:47:06.160" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.760" end="00:47:07.680" style="s2">because you look at the thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.160" end="00:47:08.720" style="s2">think is most important to look at at</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.680" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">that point</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:11.680" style="s2">and if you couldn&#39;t you wouldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:12.640" style="s2">know what to look at you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.680" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.640" end="00:47:16.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen videos youtube videos of</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.359" end="00:47:17.440" style="s2">cameras that have been dropped from</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.960" end="00:47:19.920" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.440" end="00:47:21.119" style="s2">accidentally um maybe it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.920" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">accidentally it might have been part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.119" end="00:47:26.000" style="s2">an advertising campaign for maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">one of those you go things what do they</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.000" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">call those</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">what is it yeah gopro that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.520" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">so they dropped one i think from like 30</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">miles up and it spun around all the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:39.359" style="s2">and videotaped it&#39;s like pretty dull</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:43.200" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.359" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">why well because because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.200" end="00:47:46.880" style="s2">pointed at anything it&#39;s not directed</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.839" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">towards anything</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:50.559" style="s2">like it&#39;s a perfectly objective portrait</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">of reality</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.559" end="00:47:55.040" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely pointless right</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:57.599" style="s2">because there&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.040" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">nothing is zeroing in on anything you</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.599" end="00:48:00.000" style="s2">know and you even to organize your damn</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:02.640" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:04.079" style="s2">even to focus your eyes you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.640" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">a value harkey because you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.079" end="00:48:06.240" style="s2">focusing on something that you think is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:07.599" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.240" end="00:48:09.599" style="s2">and if you think it&#39;s important it has</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.599" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">to be more important than other things</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.599" end="00:48:13.520" style="s2">in fact it has to be more important than</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:15.760" style="s2">everything else at that moment because</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:16.960" style="s2">otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be focusing on it</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.760" end="00:48:20.319" style="s2">and so there&#39;s no getting rid of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.960" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">hierarchies not not unless you want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.319" end="00:48:24.800" style="s2">disregulate your perceptual structures</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:27.119" style="s2">entirely</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.800" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">and sacrifice your emotional stability</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.119" end="00:48:31.760" style="s2">no more positive emotion</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:35.040" style="s2">plenty of confusion though</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.760" end="00:48:36.800" style="s2">and be immobilized and then also</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.040" end="00:48:38.160" style="s2">sit there and do nothing and suffer and</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.800" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">die and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.160" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">let the idea that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:44.559" style="s2">intrinsically wrong with hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:44.559" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">it&#39;s wrong it&#39;s wrong it&#39;s really deeply</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.040" end="00:48:52.960" style="s2">wrong it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.839" end="00:48:53.680" style="s2">deeply and stupidly wrong at multiple</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.960" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">levels</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.680" end="00:48:59.440" style="s2">and so then the question becomes more um</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">appropriately well what should the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.440" end="00:49:02.400" style="s2">hierarchy be</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.640" end="00:49:04.559" style="s2">and not whether or not there should be</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.400" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">one it&#39;s like and and you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.559" end="00:49:07.440" style="s2">like i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.200" end="00:49:08.640" style="s2">cognizant of the negative consequences</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.440" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">of hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.640" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not like they&#39;re all positive you</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.720" end="00:49:13.680" style="s2">know i mean no matter what hierarchy we</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">set up</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.680" end="00:49:17.119" style="s2">to pursue what goal it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:18.800" style="s2">what the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.119" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">some people turn out to be better at</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.800" end="00:49:21.440" style="s2">doing that and some people turn out to</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:24.079" style="s2">be worse</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:27.040" style="s2">and the people who turn out to be worse</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.079" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">pay a fairly heavy price for being worse</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.040" end="00:49:31.280" style="s2">and so you set up a hierarchy there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">people and more people</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.280" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">at the bottom that are worse pay a</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:36.880" style="s2">fairly heavy price</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:38.079" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not like hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.880" end="00:49:39.839" style="s2">without cost</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.079" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">and i would say to the degree that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.839" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">left end of the political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">has a valid point their valid point is</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:49.839" style="s2">pay some attention to the people at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.480" end="00:49:51.040" style="s2">bottom of the hierarchies because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.839" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">rough place to be and</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.040" end="00:49:54.480" style="s2">keep the hierarchies fair so that people</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:57.200" style="s2">can move up and keep them</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.480" end="00:49:58.559" style="s2">focused on their tasks so they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.200" end="00:50:00.400" style="s2">useful things</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.559" end="00:50:02.000" style="s2">and aren&#39;t corrupted by people who are</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.400" end="00:50:05.920" style="s2">only seeking power</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.000" end="00:50:08.800" style="s2">all of that fine no hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.920" end="00:50:10.319" style="s2">that&#39;s a bad idea that&#39;s a non-starter</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.800" end="00:50:13.119" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.319" end="00:50:13.599" style="s2">now you&#39;re deciding to go somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.119" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.599" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter where it is small</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:23.200" style="s2">scale journey or large scale journey</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:24.240" style="s2">because a large-scale journey is</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.200" end="00:50:27.599" style="s2">composed of</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:29.359" style="s2">a multitude of small scale journeys so</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.599" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">i&#39;ll give i&#39;ll give you an example of</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.359" end="00:50:33.359" style="s2">this i&#39;m going to build up a moral</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.200" end="00:50:35.359" style="s2">hierarchy for you from from the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.359" end="00:50:36.720" style="s2">okay and and here here&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.359" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">things that&#39;s kind of cool about doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.720" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">this because</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">it actually solves to some degree the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:43.040" style="s2">mind body problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">if you do that and so if you&#39;re sitting</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.040" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">there thinking geez i wish that i could</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:48.880" style="s2">solve the mind body problem tonight then</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">you know maybe tonight&#39;s your lucky</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.880" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">night because maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">going to happen so um imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.559" end="00:51:00.160" style="s2">imagine that you&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.119" end="00:51:03.200" style="s2">something like prepare</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.160" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">dinner you might think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.200" end="00:51:07.119" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:08.960" style="s2">so that&#39;s interesting so it&#39;s an action</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.119" end="00:51:10.960" style="s2">but we&#39;d also put a moral dimension on</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.960" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">it it&#39;s good to feed hungry people</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.960" end="00:51:14.319" style="s2">yourself included maybe you do a good</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">job of making dinner that&#39;d even be</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.319" end="00:51:19.280" style="s2">better not only are you making dinner</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:21.760" style="s2">but you&#39;re making a good dinner and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.280" end="00:51:24.720" style="s2">that that makes making dinner an even</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.760" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">more impressive moral feat because you</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.720" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">could make some wretched</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">cold dismal massive glutinous</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">catastrophe and serve it with contempt</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:36.640" style="s2">and hatred to the people that that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:38.400" style="s2">around you you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.640" end="00:51:39.680" style="s2">you could do that and it would still be</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.400" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">dinner but you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.680" end="00:51:43.119" style="s2">it&#39;d be it&#39;d be a low quality it&#39;d be a</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:46.800" style="s2">low quality</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.119" end="00:51:48.720" style="s2">and and all too common occurrence um</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.800" end="00:51:50.000" style="s2">but let&#39;s say that you do it right you</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.720" end="00:51:51.119" style="s2">know it&#39;s like you&#39;re going to put some</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:53.280" style="s2">effort into it it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.119" end="00:51:54.559" style="s2">delicious that&#39;d be nice it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.280" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">be nutritious it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.559" end="00:51:57.599" style="s2">attractive</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:51:59.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to be served with the</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.599" end="00:52:00.640" style="s2">proper attitude you know you&#39;re happy</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.520" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">that you have some food</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.640" end="00:52:04.400" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of nice hasn&#39;t been all that</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">long that everybody had food</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.400" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">and certainly hasn&#39;t been all that long</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:10.079" style="s2">that everybody had a vast variety of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.400" end="00:52:11.680" style="s2">high quality food and so a little</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.079" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">gratitude would be nice and</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.680" end="00:52:18.800" style="s2">so so you got your so so even</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:20.400" style="s2">so back to the back to the task at hand</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.800" end="00:52:21.920" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re going to make dinner so</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.400" end="00:52:25.200" style="s2">the question is well what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.920" end="00:52:27.280" style="s2">do you do to make dinner and it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.200" end="00:52:28.800" style="s2">of an abstract idea to make dinner let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.280" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">go make dinner you can say that</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.800" end="00:52:31.280" style="s2">abstractly but</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:34.319" style="s2">when you actually go to make dinner it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.280" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">not abstract anymore</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.319" end="00:52:37.839" style="s2">you go into the kitchen and you open the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.960" end="00:52:39.680" style="s2">refrigerator</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.839" end="00:52:41.119" style="s2">and that that&#39;s not abstract right</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.680" end="00:52:43.200" style="s2">that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.119" end="00:52:45.280" style="s2">mental it&#39;s physical you&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:46.160" style="s2">with the world you grab the door handle</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.280" end="00:52:47.520" style="s2">on the refrigerator</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.160" end="00:52:49.200" style="s2">and you open it you don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.520" end="00:52:50.640" style="s2">how you do that you know i mean i know</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.200" end="00:52:51.200" style="s2">you know how to close your hand and move</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.640" end="00:52:53.440" style="s2">your arm</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.200" end="00:52:54.319" style="s2">but you don&#39;t know how you know how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.440" end="00:52:56.880" style="s2">close your hand</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.319" end="00:52:58.400" style="s2">and open the door your your mind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.880" end="00:53:00.720" style="s2">where your mind runs out</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.400" end="00:53:01.599" style="s2">it knows how to operate your voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.720" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">musculature</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.599" end="00:53:06.160" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t know how so your mind</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:08.000" style="s2">grounds out in your body</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.160" end="00:53:09.920" style="s2">and and and and i&#39;m going to make the</p>

<p begin="00:53:09.920" end="00:53:12.480" style="s2">it&#39;s part of this</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:13.760" style="s2">idea that the world is an</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:15.760" style="s2">action-oriented place</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.760" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">you open the fridge you think hey</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.760" end="00:53:18.559" style="s2">carrots</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:19.920" style="s2">we&#39;re going to need some carrots so you</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.559" end="00:53:21.760" style="s2">take the bag of carrots out of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.920" end="00:53:24.079" style="s2">fridge and you put them on the counter</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.760" end="00:53:25.920" style="s2">and you peel the carrots and again same</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.079" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">thing bit of expert behavior there you</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.920" end="00:53:28.880" style="s2">know because you&#39;ve peeled carrots</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.040" end="00:53:30.240" style="s2">before and it&#39;s a bit deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.880" end="00:53:32.319" style="s2">because you&#39;ve learned how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.240" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">habitually and so you peel the carrots</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.319" end="00:53:35.920" style="s2">and you take out the parts that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:38.240" style="s2">so edible if you have any scents</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.920" end="00:53:39.200" style="s2">and then you take out your knife and</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.240" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">maybe you have a nice</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.200" end="00:53:43.200" style="s2">knife with a nice wide blade at the end</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:44.559" style="s2">so you can chop up carrots it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.200" end="00:53:45.280" style="s2">fun to do that if you&#39;re good at it</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.559" end="00:53:47.839" style="s2">because you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.280" end="00:53:49.599" style="s2">you know make 100 slices in 20 or 30</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.839" end="00:53:52.240" style="s2">seconds if you&#39;ve practiced it and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.599" end="00:53:52.720" style="s2">take your carrot and you go and then you</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.240" end="00:53:54.240" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.720" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">all these you don&#39;t have to make that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.240" end="00:53:58.480" style="s2">noise by the way but but but</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:53:59.920" style="s2">you can if you want and then if if</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.480" end="00:54:01.599" style="s2">you&#39;re good at it then all the carrots</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.920" end="00:54:03.359" style="s2">are pretty much the same thickness and</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.599" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of cool you got a little</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.359" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">expertise there and you got all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">carrots lined up and</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.240" end="00:54:09.440" style="s2">maybe then you put them in some foil and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:11.680" style="s2">you add a little butter and some</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.440" end="00:54:12.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know cumin and a bit of pepper</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.680" end="00:54:14.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.880" end="00:54:16.480" style="s2">make them into a foil packet this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.880" end="00:54:18.720" style="s2">what we do in canada</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.480" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">you might do that you guys barbecue i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.720" end="00:54:21.520" style="s2">heard and then you throw the things on</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:24.800" style="s2">the barbecue and</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.520" end="00:54:25.920" style="s2">and you wait till they&#39;re steam puffs up</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.800" end="00:54:27.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.920" end="00:54:29.440" style="s2">foil and you think done and if you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.839" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">any sense at the same time you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.440" end="00:54:32.240" style="s2">you&#39;re cooking the steak and</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:34.079" style="s2">it&#39;s done at the same time in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.240" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">potatoes and it&#39;s all done at the same</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.079" end="00:54:37.680" style="s2">time and it&#39;s caramelized nicely so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:39.040" style="s2">got a bit of sweetness and</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.680" end="00:54:40.960" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve got the right amount of</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.040" end="00:54:41.359" style="s2">butter for the potatoes and you serve it</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.960" end="00:54:43.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.359" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s good that&#39;s good and</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.599" end="00:54:47.760" style="s2">it took you a long time to learn that</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:49.200" style="s2">and there&#39;s a hierarchy there right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.760" end="00:54:51.359" style="s2">the hierarchy is</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.200" end="00:54:53.440" style="s2">the lowest part of the hierarchy is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.359" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">muscular movements say that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.440" end="00:54:56.799" style="s2">you employ when you&#39;re slicing up the</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:54:58.799" style="s2">carrots</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.799" end="00:54:59.839" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing abstract about that and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.799" end="00:55:01.599" style="s2">then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.839" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">the sequencing of the carrots in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.599" end="00:55:05.920" style="s2">foil and the placing them on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:06.880" style="s2">on the uh on the grill and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.920" end="00:55:10.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.880" end="00:55:11.119" style="s2">that&#39;s where the the the rubber hits the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.000" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">road</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.119" end="00:55:14.240" style="s2">and you think well hey i made a good</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:16.799" style="s2">dinner and</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.240" end="00:55:18.640" style="s2">then you might think well what&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.799" end="00:55:21.920" style="s2">a good dinner a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.640" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">you might think well you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.920" end="00:55:26.960" style="s2">a good</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:28.480" style="s2">friend good parent</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.960" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">maybe one of the things that you could</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.480" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">do is make a good dinner like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:34.960" style="s2">the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:37.040" style="s2">that i make a good dinner and so i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.960" end="00:55:39.599" style="s2">good friend it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.040" end="00:55:40.480" style="s2">but maybe that&#39;s one-fifth of it or a</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.599" end="00:55:43.359" style="s2">tenth of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.480" end="00:55:45.280" style="s2">it&#39;s some non-trivial proportion of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.359" end="00:55:48.160" style="s2">necessary but not sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">is that right no no that&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.160" end="00:55:52.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessary</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:53.440" style="s2">um anyways it&#39;s one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.079" end="00:55:54.960" style="s2">could do to be a good friend and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.440" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">you know if you have a friend maybe he</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.960" end="00:55:58.400" style="s2">makes you a good dinner now and then and</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.559" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">there&#39;s some reciprocity there so</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.400" end="00:56:01.920" style="s2">that&#39;s and so you&#39;re capable of engaging</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:03.280" style="s2">in that reciprocity and that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.920" end="00:56:04.079" style="s2">thing that might make you a good friend</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.280" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.079" end="00:56:08.559" style="s2">or a good parent let&#39;s say so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:10.559" style="s2">there&#39;s 10 things like that at that</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.559" end="00:56:14.000" style="s2">level that make you a good parent</p>

<p begin="00:56:17.200" end="00:56:20.559" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing to be able to do you</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.960" end="00:56:22.640" style="s2">can clean up the bathroom um</p>

<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:36.160" style="s2">and and some of the things you negotiate</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.760" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">about are those lower level</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.160" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">tasks that you&#39;re going to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:41.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:42.319" style="s2">i made dinner maybe you could clean up</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.359" end="00:56:43.920" style="s2">the kitchen and</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.319" end="00:56:46.079" style="s2">you know there&#39;d be some reciprocity</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.920" end="00:56:47.680" style="s2">there and if you&#39;re a good</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.079" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">person which is getting a little higher</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.680" end="00:56:50.720" style="s2">up in the value hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:52.400" style="s2">then you can engage in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.720" end="00:56:55.119" style="s2">negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.400" end="00:56:56.400" style="s2">so but and and that is exactly what you</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.119" end="00:56:59.280" style="s2">would be in gate</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.400" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">negotiating is those tasks and so well</p>

<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:06.799" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re the sort of parent that can</p>

<p begin="00:57:10.319" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">food preparation starting at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.480" end="00:57:14.720" style="s2">right i mean maybe you&#39;re not going to</p>

<p begin="00:58:06.480" end="00:58:09.599" style="s2">did i get the spoon on the table right</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.079" end="00:58:11.760" style="s2">did i did i do it right</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.599" end="00:58:14.480" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing did i undertake the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.760" end="00:58:16.640" style="s2">action correctly</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.480" end="00:58:18.640" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing and was it a good</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.640" end="00:58:20.079" style="s2">action right did i do something that was</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.640" end="00:58:21.839" style="s2">morally appropriate they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.079" end="00:58:23.200" style="s2">check both of those out at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.839" end="00:58:26.240" style="s2">and you pat them on the head and you say</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.200" end="00:58:29.040" style="s2">hey good job man you&#39;re growing up and</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.240" end="00:58:31.200" style="s2">by that you also signify to them that</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.040" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">growing up is a good thing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.200" end="00:58:34.480" style="s2">also important and then you say well</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:35.839" style="s2">here&#39;s another spoon you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.480" end="00:58:38.240" style="s2">encounter lots of spoons in your life</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.839" end="00:58:39.760" style="s2">why don&#39;t you go put it on the table too</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.240" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">and so you know they put the spoons on</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.760" end="00:58:43.119" style="s2">the table and then maybe you show them</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:45.200" style="s2">how the spoons might be arranged and</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.119" end="00:58:46.720" style="s2">then maybe you trust them with a fork</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.200" end="00:58:48.799" style="s2">and then they can do the same thing and</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.720" end="00:58:50.559" style="s2">then with the knife and you know a dull</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.799" end="00:58:52.079" style="s2">butter knife sort of thing at least to</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.559" end="00:58:54.880" style="s2">begin with and and with it</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.079" end="00:58:56.000" style="s2">with the with the with the dishes and</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.880" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">you teach them</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.000" end="00:59:01.440" style="s2">bottom up right reflex upward</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">you teach them the mechanics of</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.440" end="00:59:06.240" style="s2">preparing something complex</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.200" end="00:59:09.599" style="s2">and so they have all those micro skills</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.240" end="00:59:10.720" style="s2">embedded in them so to speak and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.599" end="00:59:14.079" style="s2">part of their</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.720" end="00:59:15.040" style="s2">their psychophysiological ability and at</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.079" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">some point with</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.040" end="00:59:19.040" style="s2">a certain amount of training might take</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.960" end="00:59:22.640" style="s2">three months four months six months</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.040" end="00:59:24.240" style="s2">you can say set the table</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:26.000" style="s2">and then the kid knows exactly what to</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.240" end="00:59:28.640" style="s2">do and they don&#39;t know what to do until</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.000" end="00:59:30.240" style="s2">they have all those micro routines</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.640" end="00:59:32.799" style="s2">mastered and so that&#39;s kind of cool</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.240" end="00:59:36.000" style="s2">because what it indicates is that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.799" end="00:59:38.880" style="s2">the command the the macro command</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.000" end="00:59:39.680" style="s2">set the table is only something that has</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.880" end="00:59:41.920" style="s2">a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.680" end="00:59:42.880" style="s2">when the micro processes that are</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.920" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">motoric</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.880" end="00:59:46.559" style="s2">have already been mastered and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.200" end="00:59:48.240" style="s2">really good way of thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.559" end="00:59:49.280" style="s2">you&#39;re constituted like you have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.240" end="00:59:52.559" style="s2">of skills</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.280" end="00:59:54.720" style="s2">things you can do with your body act</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.559" end="00:59:58.400" style="s2">action-oriented skills and perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.720" end="01:00:01.040" style="s2">skills and once you have them</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.400" end="01:00:02.480" style="s2">as part of you then other people can</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:04.960" style="s2">refer to them</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.480" end="01:00:06.640" style="s2">and you understand each other and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.960" end="01:00:07.040" style="s2">partly how we understand each other is</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.640" end="01:00:10.240" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.040" end="01:00:11.920" style="s2">share a hierarchy of skill and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.240" end="01:00:12.319" style="s2">perception that&#39;s built from the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.319" end="01:00:17.119" style="s2">to a very high level of abstraction and</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:19.440" style="s2">also a very high level of isomorphism</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.119" end="01:00:23.359" style="s2">meaning it&#39;s the same for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.440" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">so so so okay i&#39;ll explain that</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.359" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">momentarily here so now</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.400" end="01:00:33.920" style="s2">we already established that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.760" end="01:00:35.680" style="s2">do things and</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.920" end="01:00:38.240" style="s2">i i&#39;m going to elaborate on that claim a</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.680" end="01:00:41.200" style="s2">little bit so you have to do things</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.240" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">and you have emotional systems that help</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.200" end="01:00:44.000" style="s2">you decide</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:45.359" style="s2">whether you&#39;re on the right path because</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.000" end="01:00:46.000" style="s2">if you have to do things you&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.359" end="01:00:48.079" style="s2">path</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.000" end="01:00:49.280" style="s2">and if you&#39;re going somewhere you better</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.079" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">be on the right path</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.280" end="01:00:53.040" style="s2">and so then you need something to tell</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:53.520" style="s2">you whether or not you&#39;re on the right</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.040" end="01:00:55.680" style="s2">path</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.520" end="01:00:56.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s what your emotions do your</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.680" end="01:00:58.640" style="s2">positive emotion</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.640" end="01:01:00.480" style="s2">and your negative emotion they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.640" end="01:01:01.839" style="s2">orienting systems</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.480" end="01:01:03.839" style="s2">that tell you whether you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.839" end="01:01:04.640" style="s2">right path and the path is defined by</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.839" end="01:01:06.960" style="s2">the goal</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.640" end="01:01:08.400" style="s2">so you need a goal so that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.960" end="01:01:10.000" style="s2">thing to think about</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.400" end="01:01:11.440" style="s2">it&#39;s really really really really</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.000" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">important to think about this</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.440" end="01:01:14.880" style="s2">if your life is not the way you want it</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.280" end="01:01:18.079" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.880" end="01:01:19.359" style="s2">it&#39;s possible that your goal is not what</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.079" end="01:01:21.520" style="s2">it should be</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.359" end="01:01:22.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s a fundamental religious</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.520" end="01:01:23.440" style="s2">teaching by the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.480" end="01:01:25.119" style="s2">i would say that might be the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.440" end="01:01:26.319" style="s2">fundamental religious teaching of</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.119" end="01:01:27.520" style="s2">buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.319" end="01:01:29.440" style="s2">right because the buddhists teach in</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.520" end="01:01:33.119" style="s2">some sense that everything is maya or</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.440" end="01:01:36.559" style="s2">illusion and and it&#39;s a complicated idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.119" end="01:01:37.040" style="s2">but partly what it means is the way the</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.559" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:44.799" style="s2">manifests itself to you is in large part</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.640" end="01:01:47.119" style="s2">determined by your aim within the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.799" end="01:01:48.319" style="s2">and so by switching aim you can switch</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.119" end="01:01:49.839" style="s2">whether something is</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.319" end="01:01:51.440" style="s2">positive or negative like let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.839" end="01:01:52.480" style="s2">come home and you find your wife&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.440" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">having an affair</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.480" end="01:01:55.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like man you&#39;re you&#39;re not happy</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.319" end="01:01:58.400" style="s2">you&#39;re one bitter</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.599" end="01:01:59.520" style="s2">twisted angry person and you know you go</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:00.799" style="s2">down to the bar and you have a few</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.520" end="01:02:04.079" style="s2">drinks and you thought</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.799" end="01:02:05.920" style="s2">god you know i really never liked her</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.079" end="01:02:08.160" style="s2">and you think hey this is the best day</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.920" end="01:02:08.559" style="s2">of my life my wife had an affair it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.160" end="01:02:10.799" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.559" end="01:02:12.799" style="s2">i&#39;m free i know this is a ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.799" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">story but you get my point you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.799" end="01:02:15.039" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:16.799" style="s2">you you could make a switch like that</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.039" end="01:02:18.079" style="s2">you think well isn&#39;t it so strange it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.799" end="01:02:20.240" style="s2">like half an hour ago</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.079" end="01:02:22.000" style="s2">i was like bitter and twisted and angry</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.240" end="01:02:24.079" style="s2">and resentful and anxious and</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.000" end="01:02:25.599" style="s2">and frustrated and disappointed because</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.079" end="01:02:27.599" style="s2">there was something i wanted</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.599" end="01:02:29.520" style="s2">and i wasn&#39;t getting it and now all of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.599" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">sudden i&#39;ve decided i didn&#39;t want that</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.520" end="01:02:33.039" style="s2">and everything is switched around and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.400" end="01:02:35.119" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.039" end="01:02:36.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a kind of a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.119" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">miracle that that can happen</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.880" end="01:02:41.200" style="s2">and so in rule six you know i i the rule</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:42.799" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.200" end="01:02:44.480" style="s2">put your house in perfect order before</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.799" end="01:02:46.559" style="s2">you criticize the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.480" end="01:02:48.079" style="s2">well so what&#39;s the idea it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.559" end="01:02:51.440" style="s2">if the world isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.079" end="01:02:53.200" style="s2">up to your standards let&#39;s say first of</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:53.839" style="s2">all you might ask yourself about that to</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.200" end="01:02:56.000" style="s2">begin with</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.839" end="01:02:57.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like the world isn&#39;t up to your</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.000" end="01:03:00.240" style="s2">standards</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.200" end="01:03:00.799" style="s2">really that&#39;s and that&#39;s the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.240" end="01:03:03.520" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.799" end="01:03:04.079" style="s2">somehow it&#39;s it&#39;s not more likely that</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.520" end="01:03:05.599" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.079" end="01:03:10.079" style="s2">given that you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.599" end="01:03:11.920" style="s2">world here it&#39;s not more likely that</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.079" end="01:03:13.200" style="s2">there&#39;s some chance that it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.920" end="01:03:16.400" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.200" end="01:03:18.319" style="s2">and that if you put yourself right then</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.400" end="01:03:20.799" style="s2">the world wouldn&#39;t appear to be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.319" end="01:03:21.680" style="s2">problem and i mean it&#39;s a profound</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.799" end="01:03:24.240" style="s2">question you know and</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.680" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">i&#39;m not throwing that out cynically or</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.240" end="01:03:27.280" style="s2">sarcastically i mean i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:29.280" style="s2">disenchanted with the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.280" end="01:03:30.720" style="s2">a fair number of times personally i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.280" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">including myself in</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.720" end="01:03:34.000" style="s2">in the list of people who make that</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:36.160" style="s2">error but you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.000" end="01:03:38.799" style="s2">knowing that your emotional reactions</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.160" end="01:03:40.400" style="s2">are dependent on your aim</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.799" end="01:03:42.480" style="s2">and that that&#39;s actually technically</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.400" end="01:03:43.359" style="s2">true does immediately open up the</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.480" end="01:03:45.280" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.359" end="01:03:46.640" style="s2">hey man if things aren&#39;t laying</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.280" end="01:03:49.359" style="s2">themselves in front of you</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.640" end="01:03:51.599" style="s2">out in front of you the way that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.359" end="01:03:54.319" style="s2">necessary for you to live a full</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.599" end="01:03:56.000" style="s2">and engaged life and not be cynical and</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.319" end="01:03:56.960" style="s2">bitter and twisted and cruel and</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.000" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">vengeful</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.960" end="01:04:00.480" style="s2">and and disappointed in all of that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.839" end="01:04:02.559" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.480" end="01:04:03.760" style="s2">possible that you&#39;re not aiming at the</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.559" end="01:04:06.799" style="s2">right thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.760" end="01:04:08.559" style="s2">and man that is a question that is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.799" end="01:04:10.160" style="s2">question worth asking</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.559" end="01:04:11.599" style="s2">well it&#39;s the question people do ask</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.160" end="01:04:12.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like well what&#39;s the purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.599" end="01:04:13.760" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.000" end="01:04:16.400" style="s2">well it&#39;s the same question what should</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.760" end="01:04:18.720" style="s2">i aim at those are the same questions</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.400" end="01:04:20.160" style="s2">and you know if if what you&#39;re aiming at</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.720" end="01:04:22.799" style="s2">is producing nothing but</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.160" end="01:04:25.119" style="s2">unrequited misery for you and everyone</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.799" end="01:04:26.000" style="s2">else and it&#39;s a downhill bloody spiral</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.119" end="01:04:28.559" style="s2">into something</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.000" end="01:04:29.599" style="s2">approximating hell then there is some</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.559" end="01:04:31.440" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.599" end="01:04:33.119" style="s2">that you should think that perhaps your</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.440" end="01:04:35.200" style="s2">aim is off</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.119" end="01:04:36.880" style="s2">so and and i don&#39;t want to overplay my</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.200" end="01:04:38.000" style="s2">hand on that either too because i know</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.880" end="01:04:41.039" style="s2">perfectly well that</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.000" end="01:04:42.880" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re suffering if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.039" end="01:04:44.799" style="s2">depressed if you&#39;re miserable</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.880" end="01:04:47.280" style="s2">there might you might be you might just</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.799" end="01:04:48.079" style="s2">it might be a consequence of really bad</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.280" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">luck</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.079" end="01:04:52.480" style="s2">you know like people get sick and good</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:54.079" style="s2">people get sick right everyone knows</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.480" end="01:04:55.920" style="s2">that you know good people they get sick</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.079" end="01:04:56.960" style="s2">and they die and so you can&#39;t say well</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.920" end="01:04:58.720" style="s2">if you&#39;re miserable</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.960" end="01:05:00.960" style="s2">and sick it&#39;s because there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.720" end="01:05:03.599" style="s2">you know bad about you</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.960" end="01:05:04.400" style="s2">because then that would be the case for</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.599" end="01:05:06.079" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.400" end="01:05:07.599" style="s2">always whenever they get ill and you</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.079" end="01:05:08.720" style="s2">could just blame the old people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.599" end="01:05:10.799" style="s2">like well it&#39;s seriously right that</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.720" end="01:05:12.400" style="s2">you&#39;re sick because you&#39;re a bad person</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.799" end="01:05:14.000" style="s2">it happens a lot actually with ill</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.400" end="01:05:14.480" style="s2">people you know and it&#39;s an unfortunate</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.000" end="01:05:16.400" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.480" end="01:05:19.839" style="s2">so i know there&#39;s an element of chance</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.400" end="01:05:23.039" style="s2">to all this and i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.839" end="01:05:24.880" style="s2">downplay that you know we are</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.039" end="01:05:27.280" style="s2">dust in the wind to use a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.880" end="01:05:31.200" style="s2">cliche from a 70s rock song</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.280" end="01:05:32.640" style="s2">um we&#39;re blowing hither and thither by</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.200" end="01:05:35.039" style="s2">events that are somewhat beyond our</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.640" end="01:05:37.359" style="s2">control but that&#39;s still not the point</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.039" end="01:05:39.119" style="s2">the point is that to a large degree you</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.359" end="01:05:40.960" style="s2">can determine the manner in which the</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.119" end="01:05:43.119" style="s2">world manifests itself to you</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.960" end="01:05:45.359" style="s2">by changing your aim and so then that</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.119" end="01:05:47.039" style="s2">opens up that opens up the entire</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.359" end="01:05:49.119" style="s2">domain of philosophy you think what good</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.039" end="01:05:50.640" style="s2">is philosophy and people think that all</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.119" end="01:05:51.200" style="s2">the time what good is philosophy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.640" end="01:05:53.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.200" end="01:05:54.799" style="s2">hey philosophy is about value well what</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.839" end="01:05:57.119" style="s2">use is value</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.799" end="01:05:58.480" style="s2">well value determines your aim well who</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.119" end="01:06:00.880" style="s2">cares what your aim is</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.480" end="01:06:01.680" style="s2">well your aim determines the manner in</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.880" end="01:06:04.799" style="s2">which the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.680" end="01:06:07.200" style="s2">lays itself out to you emotionally</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.799" end="01:06:08.240" style="s2">well who cares about that no one says</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.200" end="01:06:10.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.240" end="01:06:12.160" style="s2">the argument stops there because no one</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.319" end="01:06:12.720" style="s2">especially no one who&#39;s been seriously</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.160" end="01:06:15.119" style="s2">hurt</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.720" end="01:06:16.079" style="s2">or seriously depressed like in pain no</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.119" end="01:06:18.000" style="s2">one ever says</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.079" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">oh well who cares about that because if</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.000" end="01:06:22.000" style="s2">you can say that about your pain</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.839" end="01:06:23.119" style="s2">all that means is you actually haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.000" end="01:06:24.480" style="s2">been in pain</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.119" end="01:06:26.799" style="s2">because if you&#39;re in enough pain you</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.480" end="01:06:33.839" style="s2">will not say that that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.799" end="01:06:33.839" style="s2">so you need to know what to aim at so</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.240" end="01:06:37.359" style="s2">now you aim at something you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.000" end="01:06:39.520" style="s2">goal and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.359" end="01:06:41.520" style="s2">you see that you&#39;re making progress</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.520" end="01:06:45.119" style="s2">towards the goal</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.520" end="01:06:48.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing that makes you</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.119" end="01:06:50.559" style="s2">happy it actually technically</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.240" end="01:06:51.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a system dopamine system</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.559" end="01:06:53.920" style="s2">neurochemical system</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.839" end="01:06:55.359" style="s2">same system by the way that cocaine and</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.920" end="01:06:57.599" style="s2">methamphetamine and</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.359" end="01:06:59.119" style="s2">and opiates activate which is why people</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.599" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">like to take those drugs</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.119" end="01:07:04.799" style="s2">and it tells you that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.280" end="01:07:06.559" style="s2">you&#39;re moving forward in the manner that</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.799" end="01:07:08.720" style="s2">you should be according to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.559" end="01:07:10.160" style="s2">dictates of your plan doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.720" end="01:07:10.880" style="s2">necessarily tell you whether you have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.160" end="01:07:12.640" style="s2">good plan</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.880" end="01:07:13.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a more complicated problem</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.640" end="01:07:14.400" style="s2">because who knows if you have a good</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.920" end="01:07:16.240" style="s2">plan</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.400" end="01:07:17.920" style="s2">but but one thing that you could know is</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:20.799" style="s2">that a plan</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.920" end="01:07:22.079" style="s2">is better than no plan that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.799" end="01:07:23.359" style="s2">useful thing to know especially if</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.079" end="01:07:25.280" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of drifting</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.359" end="01:07:26.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like well i&#39;m going to find myself</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.280" end="01:07:30.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.960" end="01:07:30.640" style="s2">just pick something and and move towards</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.240" end="01:07:32.240" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.640" end="01:07:34.160" style="s2">and as you move towards it you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.240" end="01:07:36.720" style="s2">to succeed and fail</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.160" end="01:07:38.160" style="s2">specifically and then you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.720" end="01:07:39.440" style="s2">learn something about success</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.160" end="01:07:40.839" style="s2">specifically and you&#39;re going to learn</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.440" end="01:07:43.039" style="s2">something about failure</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.839" end="01:07:44.079" style="s2">specifically and then you can learn what</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.039" end="01:07:47.920" style="s2">you use</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.079" end="01:07:49.520" style="s2">to fix your plan so so a stupid plan is</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.920" end="01:07:51.520" style="s2">way better than no plan and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.520" end="01:07:52.720" style="s2">you&#39;re likely to have a stupid plan or</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.520" end="01:07:54.240" style="s2">at least to be able to make one so</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.720" end="01:07:56.000" style="s2">that&#39;s good news for everybody you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.240" end="01:07:58.799" style="s2">make a stupid plan and so i would</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.000" end="01:08:00.799" style="s2">say make a stupid plan and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.799" end="01:08:02.400" style="s2">implement it not any stupider than it</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.799" end="01:08:03.200" style="s2">has to be you know you could think about</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.400" end="01:08:05.280" style="s2">it a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.200" end="01:08:07.440" style="s2">but then implement it and have your</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.280" end="01:08:09.520" style="s2">successes and failures along the way</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.440" end="01:08:10.960" style="s2">and learn from them and then you can rig</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.520" end="01:08:12.880" style="s2">you can rejig the goal</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.960" end="01:08:14.400" style="s2">you can move the target that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.880" end="01:08:16.000" style="s2">fine that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.400" end="01:08:18.159" style="s2">game it doesn&#39;t have to be fixed</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.000" end="01:08:19.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a movable target and maybe what</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.159" end="01:08:20.400" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do is to move the</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.520" end="01:08:23.359" style="s2">target to an</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.400" end="01:08:25.120" style="s2">ever better place so so you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.359" end="01:08:26.640" style="s2">towards a target and at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.120" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">you&#39;re moving the target</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.640" end="01:08:30.000" style="s2">right and and and you&#39;re trying to move</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.640" end="01:08:31.520" style="s2">the target towards something like an</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.000" end="01:08:33.040" style="s2">ultimate ideal you&#39;re trying to find out</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.520" end="01:08:34.400" style="s2">what that ultimate ideal is</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.040" end="01:08:36.159" style="s2">and part of the way you figure that out</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.400" end="01:08:37.679" style="s2">is by moving towards a target</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.159" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">and by learning about success and</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.679" end="01:08:41.759" style="s2">failure along the way because then you</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:44.000" style="s2">can inform yourself with regards to what</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.759" end="01:08:45.359" style="s2">might constitute a reasonable aim</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.000" end="01:08:47.520" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the reason to go out in</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.359" end="01:08:48.159" style="s2">the world and like make some mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.520" end="01:08:50.080" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.159" end="01:08:51.440" style="s2">and then you&#39;re going to and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.080" end="01:08:53.279" style="s2">okay because</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.440" end="01:08:54.960" style="s2">it&#39;s okay to make the mistakes it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.279" end="01:08:56.880" style="s2">so okay not to learn from them</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.960" end="01:08:58.080" style="s2">because then you make the mistakes again</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.880" end="01:08:59.839" style="s2">that seems pointless</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.080" end="01:09:02.319" style="s2">and so you&#39;re moving towards wherever</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.839" end="01:09:05.279" style="s2">you&#39;re going and it&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.319" end="01:09:06.480" style="s2">and so you get some positive emotion you</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.279" end="01:09:08.719" style="s2">get some</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.480" end="01:09:09.839" style="s2">motivation from this dopaminergic system</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.719" end="01:09:12.400" style="s2">that adds</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.839" end="01:09:14.640" style="s2">zest to life it adds interest and</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.400" end="01:09:17.040" style="s2">engagement and meaning to life it</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.640" end="01:09:18.480" style="s2">pulls you into life and so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.040" end="01:09:20.640" style="s2">worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.480" end="01:09:22.400" style="s2">i would say because if you think about</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.640" end="01:09:24.000" style="s2">it you know you have</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.400" end="01:09:25.520" style="s2">might wonder about whether or not you</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.000" end="01:09:27.120" style="s2">should be engaged in life</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.520" end="01:09:28.880" style="s2">and then if all of a sudden you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.120" end="01:09:30.719" style="s2">something and because you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.880" end="01:09:33.679" style="s2">you get engaged in life</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.719" end="01:09:34.000" style="s2">then it seems like that might be the</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.679" end="01:09:36.960" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.000" end="01:09:38.719" style="s2">definition of a good thing it&#39;s evidence</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.960" end="01:09:40.799" style="s2">the engagement is evidence that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:11:09.280" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2">now and then if you&#39;re engaged in</p>

<p begin="01:11:13.120" end="01:11:16.000" style="s2">you know and you kind of have to wake up</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.800" end="01:11:17.520" style="s2">because if you&#39;re engaged in it you</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.000" end="01:11:18.320" style="s2">don&#39;t quite notice right because you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:11:18.320" end="01:11:22.320" style="s2">but afterwards you might think oh i just</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.880" end="01:11:25.120" style="s2">spent an hour</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.320" end="01:11:27.360" style="s2">and i didn&#39;t notice that it was an hour</p>

<p begin="01:11:34.880" end="01:11:38.719" style="s2">and maybe like you&#39;re not in good shape</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.480" end="01:11:40.960" style="s2">and that happened to you like 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.719" end="01:11:42.400" style="s2">once in two weeks it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.960" end="01:11:44.239" style="s2">pretty dismal and the rest of the time</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.400" end="01:11:45.679" style="s2">it was wretched it&#39;s like okay fine well</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.239" end="01:11:47.360" style="s2">maybe in the next two weeks you can see</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.679" end="01:11:49.440" style="s2">if you can do it for half an hour</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.360" end="01:11:51.120" style="s2">and then maybe for 45 minutes and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.440" end="01:11:52.239" style="s2">maybe for an hour right you can start</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.120" end="01:11:55.360" style="s2">practicing</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.239" end="01:11:56.960" style="s2">being in that place that&#39;s a very useful</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.360" end="01:11:58.560" style="s2">thing to learn it&#39;s like oh look i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:12:05.199" end="01:12:07.920" style="s2">here more often</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.400" end="01:12:09.360" style="s2">those are all questions you have to ask</p>

<p begin="01:12:10.960" end="01:12:14.640" style="s2">and you think well why bother and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.480" end="01:12:15.600" style="s2">answer is well do you want to be engaged</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.640" end="01:12:18.640" style="s2">in your life</p>

<p begin="01:12:26.159" end="01:12:29.760" style="s2">it&#39;s good for you practically speaking</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.239" end="01:12:31.520" style="s2">generally speaking if you have an aim</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.760" end="01:12:32.800" style="s2">and you&#39;re moving forward you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.520" end="01:12:34.719" style="s2">forward to something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.800" end="01:12:36.719" style="s2">psychologically valuable but also</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.719" end="01:12:37.520" style="s2">practically valuable if it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.719" end="01:12:40.640" style="s2">good aim</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.520" end="01:12:41.840" style="s2">also it&#39;s good for you now tomorrow the</p>

<p begin="01:12:41.840" end="01:12:45.600" style="s2">because you&#39;re smart enough to generally</p>

<p begin="01:12:45.600" end="01:12:50.000" style="s2">to calibrate yourself so that things</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.800" end="01:12:53.040" style="s2">that are really bad for</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.000" end="01:12:55.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t have that engaging quality now</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.040" end="01:12:56.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not perfect especially if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.040" end="01:12:58.000" style="s2">messed yourself up psychologically by</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.880" end="01:12:59.760" style="s2">lying to yourself</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.000" end="01:13:02.159" style="s2">in all sorts of different ways but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.760" end="01:13:03.679" style="s2">still not a bad orienting system</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.159" end="01:13:06.000" style="s2">and then the other thing you can also</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.679" end="01:13:09.600" style="s2">notice is well when are you doing things</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.000" end="01:13:09.600" style="s2">that make you feel really awful</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.400" end="01:13:13.440" style="s2">by your own standards it&#39;s like oh look</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.400" end="01:13:15.120" style="s2">i just did something had some</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.440" end="01:13:15.679" style="s2">interaction with someone and now i feel</p>

<p begin="01:13:15.679" end="01:13:20.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like well maybe you could not do</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.199" end="01:13:22.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.960" end="01:13:24.080" style="s2">whatever it was you might have to think</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.880" end="01:13:26.719" style="s2">it through</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.080" end="01:13:28.960" style="s2">what were the routines that constituted</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.719" end="01:13:29.920" style="s2">that ill-advised set of actions</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.960" end="01:13:31.600" style="s2">and maybe you&#39;re gonna have to think</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.920" end="01:13:32.719" style="s2">really deeply about it you know because</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.600" end="01:13:34.880" style="s2">god only knows</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.719" end="01:13:36.000" style="s2">how much of your personality structure</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.880" end="01:13:38.159" style="s2">is involved in that</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.000" end="01:13:39.760" style="s2">error but if it made you wretched it</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.159" end="01:13:40.560" style="s2">made you feel like life wasn&#39;t worth</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.760" end="01:13:42.239" style="s2">living then</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.560" end="01:13:44.080" style="s2">that might be a hint that that wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.239" end="01:13:45.840" style="s2">good thing to do and so then maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.080" end="01:13:47.280" style="s2">could start doing more of the things</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.840" end="01:13:48.960" style="s2">that make you engaged</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.280" end="01:13:50.320" style="s2">and less of the things that make you</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.960" end="01:13:52.719" style="s2">hate life</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.320" end="01:13:53.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s worthy that&#39;s worthy of</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.719" end="01:13:55.440" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.520" end="01:13:58.080" style="s2">let&#39;s say you might think about that as</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.440" end="01:13:59.920" style="s2">a it&#39;s a fundamental ethical requirement</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.080" end="01:14:01.440" style="s2">or i would say it&#39;s a fundamental form</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.920" end="01:14:03.120" style="s2">of religious meditation</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.440" end="01:14:04.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a better way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.120" end="01:14:06.480" style="s2">and so then you&#39;re on the path that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.640" end="01:14:09.199" style="s2">the straight and narrow path it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.480" end="01:14:10.320" style="s2">i&#39;m moving forward i&#39;ve got name i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.199" end="01:14:12.400" style="s2">moving forward</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.320" end="01:14:13.520" style="s2">as i move forward i&#39;m engaged it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.400" end="01:14:16.080" style="s2">bloody well worth</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.520" end="01:14:17.520" style="s2">walking down this pathway and you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.080" end="01:14:19.679" style="s2">on the left of me is</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.520" end="01:14:21.040" style="s2">terror and horror and hell and pain and</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.679" end="01:14:22.800" style="s2">i&#39;m avoiding that</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.040" end="01:14:24.239" style="s2">and to the right of me perhaps is ego</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.800" end="01:14:25.360" style="s2">and arrogance and the things that can</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.239" end="01:14:27.280" style="s2">get out of control</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.360" end="01:14:28.960" style="s2">with regards to positive emotion but</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.280" end="01:14:30.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve got that balance right i&#39;m on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.960" end="01:14:31.600" style="s2">right pathway</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.000" end="01:14:34.400" style="s2">okay now we think about what might</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.600" end="01:14:37.440" style="s2">constitute the right pathway</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.400" end="01:14:38.000" style="s2">well um i can tell you a pathway that</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.440" end="01:14:40.880" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.000" end="01:14:43.120" style="s2">for me to some degree so this is a value</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.880" end="01:14:46.400" style="s2">structure that&#39;s characteristic of</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.120" end="01:14:49.760" style="s2">me of things i do</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.400" end="01:14:52.239" style="s2">i type because i write and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.760" end="01:14:52.880" style="s2">pure action right i type letters i type</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.239" end="01:14:55.280" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.880" end="01:14:56.000" style="s2">i type phrases i type sentences i type</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.280" end="01:15:00.000" style="s2">paragraphs</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.000" end="01:15:01.760" style="s2">i type chapters i write books</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.000" end="01:15:03.280" style="s2">and then people and then i talk about</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.760" end="01:15:04.880" style="s2">the books and people read the books and</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.280" end="01:15:05.840" style="s2">the reason that they can understand the</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.880" end="01:15:08.320" style="s2">books is because</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.840" end="01:15:09.760" style="s2">we&#39;re a lot the same you know like</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.320" end="01:15:10.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things that have to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.760" end="01:15:11.920" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.000" end="01:15:13.520" style="s2">same about you and me before i can write</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.920" end="01:15:15.120" style="s2">a book that you can read</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.520" end="01:15:17.199" style="s2">and i have to be able to take them for</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.120" end="01:15:18.480" style="s2">granted and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.199" end="01:15:20.560" style="s2">the reason i&#39;m telling you that is</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.480" end="01:15:23.920" style="s2">because there&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.560" end="01:15:24.560" style="s2">relationship between my hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.920" end="01:15:26.719" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.560" end="01:15:28.480" style="s2">and your hierarchy of values if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.719" end="01:15:30.000" style="s2">going to be able to communicate and if</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.480" end="01:15:31.840" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be able to occupy the</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.000" end="01:15:33.280" style="s2">same place at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.840" end="01:15:35.360" style="s2">you know so if i&#39;m writing a book like</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.280" end="01:15:37.440" style="s2">12 rules for life and it</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.360" end="01:15:38.560" style="s2">has a discussion about what constitutes</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.440" end="01:15:41.280" style="s2">the good in it</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.560" end="01:15:43.280" style="s2">then i have to start with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.280" end="01:15:46.320" style="s2">presupposition that</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.280" end="01:15:49.360" style="s2">we share some fundamental intuition</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.320" end="01:15:53.040" style="s2">about what constitutes the good or</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.360" end="01:15:56.239" style="s2">my words will fall on deaf ears</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.040" end="01:15:56.239" style="s2">okay and it&#39;s partly because</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.360" end="01:16:00.880" style="s2">and then and this is this is maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.520" end="01:16:02.640" style="s2">relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.880" end="01:16:04.400" style="s2">the social world and the psychological</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.640" end="01:16:08.320" style="s2">world that i wanted to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.400" end="01:16:09.360" style="s2">as i build up my hierarchy of skill and</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.320" end="01:16:11.760" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.360" end="01:16:12.880" style="s2">perception and emotional regulation you</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.760" end="01:16:15.840" style="s2">know from</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.880" end="01:16:18.080" style="s2">slicing carrots upwards you know i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.840" end="01:16:20.080" style="s2">i&#39;m a good cook i&#39;m a good parent</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.080" end="01:16:21.199" style="s2">maybe i&#39;m a good man maybe i&#39;m a good</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.080" end="01:16:22.880" style="s2">person you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.199" end="01:16:24.560" style="s2">and all of those cover a broader and</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.880" end="01:16:26.320" style="s2">broader range of abstractions and</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.560" end="01:16:28.000" style="s2">abilities</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.320" end="01:16:30.000" style="s2">there has to be a relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.000" end="01:16:33.440" style="s2">that and what other people think</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.000" end="01:16:35.040" style="s2">you know because look if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.440" end="01:16:37.520" style="s2">your kid you teach your kid to set the</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.040" end="01:16:39.360" style="s2">table and then he goes to someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.520" end="01:16:40.640" style="s2">house and sets the table and he gets a</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.360" end="01:16:42.640" style="s2">swat</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.640" end="01:16:43.679" style="s2">it&#39;s like well what&#39;s the consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.640" end="01:16:45.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.679" end="01:16:47.040" style="s2">well the consequence of that is that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.120" end="01:16:50.080" style="s2">kid is going to be unhappy</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.040" end="01:16:51.440" style="s2">well why well it&#39;s because the kid did a</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.080" end="01:16:54.640" style="s2">lot of work</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.440" end="01:16:57.040" style="s2">building up all those separate skills to</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.640" end="01:16:58.560" style="s2">undertake that complex activity and it</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.040" end="01:17:00.719" style="s2">really is a complex activity you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.560" end="01:17:02.320" style="s2">have a robot at home that sets the table</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.719" end="01:17:04.000" style="s2">you know you have a cell phone and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.320" end="01:17:06.239" style="s2">smart but it can&#39;t set the damn</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.000" end="01:17:07.679" style="s2">table it&#39;s complicated to do that sort</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.239" end="01:17:10.400" style="s2">of thing and so your kid</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.679" end="01:17:12.960" style="s2">had built this complicated neurological</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.400" end="01:17:15.600" style="s2">structure as a consequence of reward</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.960" end="01:17:17.120" style="s2">primarily because reward helps build</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.600" end="01:17:19.440" style="s2">neurological structures</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.120" end="01:17:21.520" style="s2">built this whole structure and now what</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.440" end="01:17:23.679" style="s2">he&#39;s hoping is that all the work that</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.520" end="01:17:25.360" style="s2">went into building that structure</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.679" end="01:17:27.679" style="s2">is something that other people will</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.360" end="01:17:30.480" style="s2">appreciate as well</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.679" end="01:17:31.360" style="s2">so that&#39;s where you need the isomorphism</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.480" end="01:17:33.840" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.360" end="01:17:35.360" style="s2">the intra-psychic structure the</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.840" end="01:17:35.920" style="s2">psychological structure and the social</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.360" end="01:17:37.920" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.920" end="01:17:39.040" style="s2">which is why we have to have a shared</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.920" end="01:17:40.640" style="s2">social reality</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.040" end="01:17:42.560" style="s2">this is partly why i think the</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.640" end="01:17:44.159" style="s2">postmodernists went off the rails so</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.560" end="01:17:46.080" style="s2">badly with their insistence that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.159" end="01:17:48.560" style="s2">world was only language</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.080" end="01:17:49.679" style="s2">it&#39;s like it is in some sense very</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.560" end="01:17:52.560" style="s2">important that</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.679" end="01:17:53.679" style="s2">you construe the world the same way i do</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.560" end="01:17:55.440" style="s2">even though there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.679" end="01:17:57.120" style="s2">wide range of ways of construing the</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.440" end="01:17:58.320" style="s2">world we come to some negotiated</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.120" end="01:18:00.480" style="s2">agreement about</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.320" end="01:18:02.000" style="s2">what&#39;s good and what isn&#39;t so that when</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.480" end="01:18:04.800" style="s2">i do things that i think</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.000" end="01:18:06.880" style="s2">are good you also think they&#39;re good so</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.800" end="01:18:07.440" style="s2">that i get rewarded for my good behavior</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.880" end="01:18:09.280" style="s2">and i get</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.440" end="01:18:10.960" style="s2">let&#39;s say punished for my bad behavior</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.280" end="01:18:11.600" style="s2">because that&#39;s often a relief as well by</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.960" end="01:18:14.719" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.600" end="01:18:16.560" style="s2">and so we have to have our own</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.719" end="01:18:18.159" style="s2">internal structure of values that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.560" end="01:18:19.280" style="s2">pursuing</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.159" end="01:18:21.040" style="s2">because otherwise we don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.280" end="01:18:21.520" style="s2">meaning in our life and that&#39;s no damn</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.040" end="01:18:23.840" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.520" end="01:18:24.719" style="s2">and then it has to be nested inside a</p>

<p begin="01:18:44.000" end="01:18:48.400" style="s2">and then we master it through reciprocal</p>

<p begin="01:19:54.239" end="01:19:58.800" style="s2">home and they punish you</p>

<p begin="01:20:17.679" end="01:20:21.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.880" end="01:20:22.560" style="s2">mismatch between what we expect</p>

<p begin="01:20:26.800" end="01:20:30.880" style="s2">right and so that that&#39;s partly how we</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.880" end="01:20:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s partly a complicated</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.880" end="01:20:34.639" style="s2">explanation of how we regulate our</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.480" end="01:20:35.520" style="s2">emotions you know we regulate them by</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.639" end="01:20:38.480" style="s2">aiming</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.520" end="01:20:40.560" style="s2">that&#39;s important we we regulate them by</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.480" end="01:20:44.000" style="s2">walking the straight narrow path</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.560" end="01:20:45.920" style="s2">but then we also regulate them by being</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.000" end="01:20:48.639" style="s2">fortunate enough to be in a situation</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.920" end="01:20:49.120" style="s2">where if we walk the straight and narrow</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.639" end="01:20:51.840" style="s2">path</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.120" end="01:20:53.440" style="s2">properly then other people respond</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.840" end="01:20:56.080" style="s2">positively to us</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.440" end="01:20:57.600" style="s2">and then you have this lovely harmony</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.080" end="01:20:59.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s a right way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.600" end="01:20:59.440" style="s2">it it&#39;s a musical way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.120" end="01:21:02.400" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.440" end="01:21:04.159" style="s2">there&#39;s you composed of this very</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.400" end="01:21:06.480" style="s2">unbelievably complex</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.159" end="01:21:08.239" style="s2">nested set of patterns beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.480" end="01:21:08.639" style="s2">patterns that you spent forever working</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.239" end="01:21:10.400" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.639" end="01:21:11.840" style="s2">and then they&#39;re nested inside a social</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.400" end="01:21:13.679" style="s2">structure that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.840" end="01:21:15.840" style="s2">patterned in the same way and those are</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.679" end="01:21:16.800" style="s2">working harmoniously together like a</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.840" end="01:21:18.639" style="s2">dance</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.800" end="01:21:20.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s perfect it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.639" end="01:21:21.679" style="s2">the it&#39;s the meeting of the individual</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.560" end="01:21:24.639" style="s2">with society</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.679" end="01:21:26.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s the secret to harmonious</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.639" end="01:21:28.000" style="s2">emotional regulation and and more into</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.800" end="01:21:30.719" style="s2">cooperation and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.000" end="01:21:32.639" style="s2">to proper competition and to and to and</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.719" end="01:21:33.360" style="s2">to movement forward practically in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.639" end="01:21:36.800" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.360" end="01:21:37.440" style="s2">all of that and so okay well i&#39;ll i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.800" end="01:21:39.199" style="s2">close with</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.440" end="01:21:41.120" style="s2">just a description of what a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.199" end="01:21:43.679" style="s2">might look like um</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.120" end="01:21:45.440" style="s2">and and a brief description of of how it</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.679" end="01:21:48.719" style="s2">is that you calculate when you make</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.440" end="01:21:50.800" style="s2">a major mistake so my hierarchy would be</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.719" end="01:21:53.120" style="s2">something like this</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.800" end="01:21:54.800" style="s2">i type letters i type words phrases</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.120" end="01:21:56.960" style="s2">sentences</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.800" end="01:21:58.080" style="s2">paragraphs i sequence the paragraphs i</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.960" end="01:22:01.760" style="s2">make chapters</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.080" end="01:22:03.920" style="s2">i write books it&#39;s all coherently laid</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.760" end="01:22:06.639" style="s2">out towards some higher order aim</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.920" end="01:22:08.000" style="s2">all of that and the aim is as far as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.639" end="01:22:09.840" style="s2">concerned</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.000" end="01:22:11.920" style="s2">to share my clinical knowledge and to</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.840" end="01:22:14.000" style="s2">educate people and that makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.920" end="01:22:15.679" style="s2">because i&#39;m a clinician and a researcher</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.000" end="01:22:17.679" style="s2">and a professor and so if i was going to</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.679" end="01:22:18.400" style="s2">do that i&#39;ve decided i&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.679" end="01:22:20.560" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.400" end="01:22:22.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m doing and hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.560" end="01:22:24.639" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing and</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.880" end="01:22:26.000" style="s2">hopefully people respond to it as if</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.639" end="01:22:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a good thing because then</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.000" end="01:22:29.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing for me and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.440" end="01:22:31.280" style="s2">good thing for them and so that seems to</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.520" end="01:22:31.920" style="s2">be like the very definition of a good</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.280" end="01:22:34.880" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.920" end="01:22:35.280" style="s2">and i&#39;m trying to set things straight</p>

<p begin="01:25:15.040" end="01:25:21.040" style="s2">well because we&#39;ve also decided hey man</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.639" end="01:25:22.400" style="s2">you can do it and not only that no one</p>

<p begin="01:25:22.400" end="01:25:26.080" style="s2">and so that&#39;s something to know and</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.400" end="01:25:27.600" style="s2">might be something to take seriously</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.080" end="01:25:29.199" style="s2">it&#39;s like who knows what the hell you&#39;d</p>

<p begin="01:25:36.239" end="01:25:40.080" style="s2">and you&#39;d have started to take advantage</p>

<p begin="01:25:40.080" end="01:25:43.920" style="s2">to build yourself out of that potential</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.000" end="01:25:46.480" style="s2">into god only knows what</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.920" end="01:25:48.000" style="s2">you know and then and then maybe with</p>

<p begin="01:25:48.000" end="01:25:51.679" style="s2">the structures around you in order at</p>

<p begin="01:25:51.679" end="01:25:55.440" style="s2">or maybe to disintegrate them a bit when</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.840" end="01:25:56.800" style="s2">they need it and to restructure them so</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.440" end="01:25:59.600" style="s2">they&#39;re even better than they are</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.800" end="01:26:01.040" style="s2">and you can push back nature and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.600" end="01:26:03.440" style="s2">its horrible form and</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.040" end="01:26:05.199" style="s2">invite it forward in its positive form</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.440" end="01:26:07.120" style="s2">and make things better for you and</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.199" end="01:26:09.199" style="s2">for your family and for your community</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.120" end="01:26:11.360" style="s2">and you can approach the unknown itself</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.199" end="01:26:12.159" style="s2">and you can explore that the potential</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.360" end="01:26:14.080" style="s2">that&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.159" end="01:26:16.320" style="s2">and you can bring back the treasure</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.080" end="01:26:18.880" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the unknown potential</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.320" end="01:26:20.080" style="s2">and you can distribute that and that is</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.880" end="01:26:22.000" style="s2">what you can do</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.080" end="01:26:24.320" style="s2">and then not only that&#39;s what you need</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.000" end="01:26:27.760" style="s2">to do because you need to have</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.320" end="01:26:28.800" style="s2">a meaning in your life a name a value</p>

<p begin="01:26:48.000" end="01:26:51.120" style="s2">and and there&#39;s and and and to play it</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.000" end="01:26:54.159" style="s2">wrong is is</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.120" end="01:26:55.120" style="s2">is to risk suffering in hell and and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.159" end="01:26:56.800" style="s2">not talking about</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.120" end="01:26:58.719" style="s2">afterlife i&#39;m not talking about</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.800" end="01:26:59.760" style="s2">something metaphysical you can generate</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.719" end="01:27:02.320" style="s2">plenty of hell</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.760" end="01:27:03.600" style="s2">right here around you plenty an</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.320" end="01:27:06.159" style="s2">unlimited amount</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.600" end="01:27:07.679" style="s2">and so you can move towards that</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.159" end="01:27:09.040" style="s2">direction or you can move towards a</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.679" end="01:27:11.760" style="s2">positive direction</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.040" end="01:27:13.520" style="s2">and you can orient yourself and you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.760" end="01:27:15.360" style="s2">you can know you can learn</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.520" end="01:27:17.199" style="s2">this is why the postmodernists are so</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.360" end="01:27:20.480" style="s2">incorrect it&#39;s like look</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.199" end="01:27:23.360" style="s2">you need a name you need a name</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.480" end="01:27:25.040" style="s2">you cannot organize the way you look at</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.360" end="01:27:27.520" style="s2">the world without a name</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.040" end="01:27:28.159" style="s2">it&#39;s not optional and then the question</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.520" end="01:27:32.320" style="s2">is well</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.159" end="01:27:35.280" style="s2">what should the aim be well</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.320" end="01:27:37.360" style="s2">not to radically increase the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.280" end="01:27:38.960" style="s2">misery and suffering that you experience</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.360" end="01:27:41.920" style="s2">in everyone else i mean maybe you want</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.960" end="01:27:41.920" style="s2">to go that route but</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.800" end="01:27:46.239" style="s2">and people do but i think they only do</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.880" end="01:27:48.239" style="s2">when they become bitter</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.239" end="01:27:50.320" style="s2">and they give up you know they and they</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.239" end="01:27:52.560" style="s2">make mistakes they know they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.320" end="01:27:53.520" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s conscious decision to go</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.560" end="01:27:55.120" style="s2">down that route</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.520" end="01:27:58.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not like they think that&#39;s okay to</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.120" end="01:28:01.520" style="s2">begin with their aim&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.080" end="01:28:04.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like straighten out your aim so</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.520" end="01:28:06.080" style="s2">there&#39;s an old idea this idea of sin sin</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.480" end="01:28:07.280" style="s2">is a word that was derived from a greek</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.080" end="01:28:09.280" style="s2">word hamartia</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.280" end="01:28:10.639" style="s2">and hamartia is an archery term and it</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.280" end="01:28:13.600" style="s2">means to miss</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.639" end="01:28:15.120" style="s2">the target and so you think well how can</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.600" end="01:28:18.880" style="s2">you miss the target</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.120" end="01:28:22.560" style="s2">well you have no weapon</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.880" end="01:28:25.520" style="s2">well then you miss the target you</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.560" end="01:28:25.840" style="s2">you have no target you have no aim well</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.520" end="01:28:28.080" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.840" end="01:28:29.199" style="s2">then you miss the target you don&#39;t pick</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.080" end="01:28:30.800" style="s2">up your bow</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.199" end="01:28:33.040" style="s2">well then you miss the target you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.800" end="01:28:35.600" style="s2">draw it back then you miss the target</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.040" end="01:28:36.639" style="s2">you don&#39;t practice and and miss many</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.600" end="01:28:38.719" style="s2">times right</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.639" end="01:28:40.239" style="s2">because you have to do that to develop</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.719" end="01:28:41.600" style="s2">the skill to hit the target</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.239" end="01:28:44.400" style="s2">so you&#39;re not willing to take the risk</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.600" end="01:28:47.040" style="s2">to miss you you do none of that</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.400" end="01:28:48.000" style="s2">and so you miss the target and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.040" end="01:28:50.960" style="s2">the sin</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.000" end="01:28:53.199" style="s2">and then you miss your life and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.960" end="01:28:54.800" style="s2">what happens around you is that</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.199" end="01:28:56.880" style="s2">well there&#39;s far more hell than there</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.800" end="01:28:58.000" style="s2">has to be and there&#39;s much less heaven</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.880" end="01:29:01.679" style="s2">than there could be</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.000" end="01:29:03.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s on you and that&#39;s part of your</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.679" end="01:29:04.880" style="s2">what would you say your divine value</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.600" end="01:29:07.840" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.880" end="01:29:08.960" style="s2">that that sets you aside along with</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.840" end="01:29:11.920" style="s2">everyone else as</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.960" end="01:29:13.040" style="s2">as something someone some being that</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.920" end="01:29:15.920" style="s2">even the law</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.040" end="01:29:18.560" style="s2">itself has to respect intrinsically and</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.920" end="01:29:20.880" style="s2">it&#39;s marked out in our culture by</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.560" end="01:29:21.760" style="s2">the sovereignty that you possess and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.880" end="01:29:23.600" style="s2">notion that</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.760" end="01:29:25.120" style="s2">there&#39;s something in you that&#39;s made in</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.600" end="01:29:26.960" style="s2">the image of god</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.120" end="01:29:28.719" style="s2">something that can confront the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.960" end="01:29:30.719" style="s2">and to create</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.719" end="01:29:33.600" style="s2">habitable order out of chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.719" end="01:29:36.960" style="s2">potential and to do that properly</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.600" end="01:29:39.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s all true as far as i can tell</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.960" end="01:29:41.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s all necessary to know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.840" end="01:29:43.600" style="s2">coded in the deepest stories</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.679" end="01:29:45.440" style="s2">that are at the base of our culture and</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.600" end="01:29:47.840" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re in danger of not</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.440" end="01:29:49.760" style="s2">understanding them and not believing</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.840" end="01:29:53.520" style="s2">them and it&#39;s a big mistake</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.760" end="01:29:56.800" style="s2">because they&#39;re heavy and profound</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.520" end="01:29:59.600" style="s2">and weighty and fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.800" end="01:30:01.280" style="s2">and necessary because you have to stand</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.600" end="01:30:04.000" style="s2">on something that&#39;s solid</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.280" end="01:30:04.560" style="s2">or everything is sand and you you fall</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.000" end="01:30:06.639" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.560" end="01:30:09.199" style="s2">and you&#39;re done and so is everything</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.639" end="01:30:09.199" style="s2">around you</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.480" end="01:30:15.360" style="s2">well so that&#39;s what was the name of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.080" end="01:30:18.000" style="s2">talk</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.360" end="01:30:19.920" style="s2">what was the name of the talk i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.000" end="01:30:21.920" style="s2">even remember what the hell i titled it</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.920" end="01:30:24.080" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.920" end="01:30:26.159" style="s2">part of it is yes the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.080" end="01:30:28.000" style="s2">between your internal psychological</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.159" end="01:30:32.159" style="s2">structure and the social world</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.000" end="01:30:34.639" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s part of it and then the</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.159" end="01:30:36.239" style="s2">manner by which you estimate magnitude</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.639" end="01:30:38.560" style="s2">of error i suppose that&#39;s the last thing</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.239" end="01:30:40.719" style="s2">i should say</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.560" end="01:30:42.159" style="s2">you have a value hierarchy and we</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.719" end="01:30:44.320" style="s2">already described what that is</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.159" end="01:30:46.840" style="s2">ranging from the trivial motor actions</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.320" end="01:30:50.800" style="s2">that you undertake to the highest order</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.840" end="01:30:53.679" style="s2">aims what makes you upset</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.800" end="01:30:54.719" style="s2">your determination of how far up in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.679" end="01:30:57.440" style="s2">hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.719" end="01:30:58.719" style="s2">the error you have made has disrupted</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.440" end="01:31:02.400" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.719" end="01:31:04.080" style="s2">you know so you tell your kid</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.400" end="01:31:06.159" style="s2">you didn&#39;t put that spoon on the table</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.080" end="01:31:07.520" style="s2">quite right and they&#39;re a little upset</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.159" end="01:31:11.040" style="s2">you know but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.520" end="01:31:13.280" style="s2">whatever you twist the spoon it&#39;s fixed</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.040" end="01:31:14.800" style="s2">or you say you know you&#39;re a rotten kid</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.280" end="01:31:16.159" style="s2">and you&#39;ve always been a rotten kid and</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.800" end="01:31:17.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t see that there&#39;s much hope for</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.159" end="01:31:20.000" style="s2">you in the future</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.520" end="01:31:21.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like well well people do that when</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.000" end="01:31:22.400" style="s2">they argue with people they love and</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.360" end="01:31:24.239" style="s2">they do that quite a bit</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.400" end="01:31:26.239" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re taking them out at the</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.239" end="01:31:26.639" style="s2">highest level of their value hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.239" end="01:31:28.719" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.639" end="01:31:30.960" style="s2">and that makes people really upset and</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.719" end="01:31:32.320" style="s2">the reason for that is well it wipes up</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.960" end="01:31:34.719" style="s2">their whole map</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.320" end="01:31:36.239" style="s2">and so there&#39;s also a relationship this</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.719" end="01:31:39.520" style="s2">is an interesting thing to know</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.239" end="01:31:42.080" style="s2">between how upset you get emotionally</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.520" end="01:31:43.920" style="s2">and how important it is how important</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.080" end="01:31:45.199" style="s2">the thing that you&#39;re pursuing is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.920" end="01:31:47.280" style="s2">being criticized</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.199" end="01:31:49.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s oh and with a practical note</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.280" end="01:31:51.920" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re arguing with someone</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.760" end="01:31:54.159" style="s2">here&#39;s something you can think about you</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.920" end="01:31:56.480" style="s2">want them to change their behavior</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.159" end="01:31:58.000" style="s2">the first thing you want to do is you</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.480" end="01:32:00.400" style="s2">want to sort of pat them on the head</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.000" end="01:32:00.400" style="s2">and say</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.440" end="01:32:04.480" style="s2">you weren&#39;t horrible all the time in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.960" end="01:32:05.840" style="s2">past and you&#39;re not horrible all the</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.480" end="01:32:07.120" style="s2">time now and you probably won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.840" end="01:32:09.600" style="s2">horrible all the time</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.120" end="01:32:10.480" style="s2">in the future so we&#39;ll just get that out</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.600" end="01:32:13.920" style="s2">of the way</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.480" end="01:32:16.880" style="s2">but there&#39;s this small thing that you do</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.920" end="01:32:17.679" style="s2">that could use a little improvement and</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.880" end="01:32:20.159" style="s2">here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.679" end="01:32:21.920" style="s2">how you can improve it and i would be</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.159" end="01:32:25.120" style="s2">satisfied and happy with that</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.920" end="01:32:28.080" style="s2">if you tried it would you be willing to</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.120" end="01:32:28.960" style="s2">and then they improve incrementally and</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.080" end="01:32:30.960" style="s2">over time</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.960" end="01:32:32.400" style="s2">maybe if you&#39;re very careful with such</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.960" end="01:32:34.480" style="s2">things and you don&#39;t do them too often</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.400" end="01:32:35.520" style="s2">and you also allow the other person to</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.480" end="01:32:38.000" style="s2">do that to you</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.520" end="01:32:39.120" style="s2">as well then you get incremental</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.000" end="01:32:41.600" style="s2">improvements without</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.120" end="01:32:43.199" style="s2">taking chopping people off at the knees</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.600" end="01:32:46.239" style="s2">so to speak when you&#39;re criticizing the</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.199" end="01:32:46.239" style="s2">way that they&#39;re behaving</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.120" end="01:32:56.400" style="s2">all right well how to conclude all that</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.040" end="01:32:58.639" style="s2">you can&#39;t look at the world without a</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.400" end="01:32:58.639" style="s2">name</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.800" end="01:33:02.159" style="s2">literally you can&#39;t even perceive it you</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.360" end="01:33:05.679" style="s2">cannot</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.159" end="01:33:08.400" style="s2">regulate your emotions without a name</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.679" end="01:33:09.199" style="s2">the better your aim the more precise</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.400" end="01:33:11.760" style="s2">your aim</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.199" end="01:33:13.760" style="s2">the more elevated your aim you remember</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.760" end="01:33:15.679" style="s2">in in pinocchio when when gepetto wants</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.760" end="01:33:18.320" style="s2">to turn pinocchio into a real boy</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.679" end="01:33:18.719" style="s2">he wishes on a star it&#39;s a strange thing</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.320" end="01:33:20.400" style="s2">eh</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.719" end="01:33:22.000" style="s2">but everybody just accepts it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.400" end="01:33:23.280" style="s2">well yeah if you&#39;ve got a puppet</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.000" end="01:33:25.920" style="s2">you just made a puppet and you want to</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.280" end="01:33:28.080" style="s2">turn it into a boy the logical thing to</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.920" end="01:33:29.679" style="s2">do is open the window and wish on a star</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.080" end="01:33:31.199" style="s2">everyone knows that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.679" end="01:33:32.880" style="s2">none of that makes the least bit of</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.199" end="01:33:34.480" style="s2">sense obviously</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.880" end="01:33:36.320" style="s2">except metaphorically but we do</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.480" end="01:33:37.600" style="s2">understand it because we can watch that</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.320" end="01:33:39.360" style="s2">and it makes sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.600" end="01:33:40.800" style="s2">something magical about it and there is</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.360" end="01:33:42.320" style="s2">something magical about it</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.800" end="01:33:44.400" style="s2">because the truth of the matter is is</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.320" end="01:33:46.159" style="s2">that if you want to transform</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.400" end="01:33:48.159" style="s2">something that&#39;s nothing but a wooden</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.159" end="01:33:49.280" style="s2">headed puppet into something that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:33:52.560" end="01:33:56.400" style="s2">then what you do is you elevate your</p>

<p begin="01:34:30.239" end="01:34:33.440" style="s2">so he might have some dirty tricks up</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.080" end="01:34:35.920" style="s2">his sleeve but he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.440" end="01:34:38.159" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t have much of a reach on him</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.920" end="01:34:42.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.159" end="01:34:42.400" style="s2">trudeau trudeau</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.480" end="01:34:49.520" style="s2">he can box so he</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.119" end="01:34:53.119" style="s2">he&#39;d probably get me on technical skills</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.520" end="01:34:53.119" style="s2">and i&#39;m i&#39;m quite a bit older but</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.440" end="01:35:00.320" style="s2">i i think i&#39;d get up a lot of times</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.440" end="01:35:00.880" style="s2">so well hopefully it won&#39;t come to that</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.320" end="01:35:02.560" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.880" end="01:35:06.000" style="s2">but i tell you there is part of me that</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.560" end="01:35:08.719" style="s2">that thinks it would be interesting</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.000" end="01:35:11.119" style="s2">all right all right so and there was 137</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.719" end="01:35:15.760" style="s2">of you who thought that one was</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.119" end="01:35:17.679" style="s2">worth discussing so that&#39;s good so</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.760" end="01:35:19.600" style="s2">is the sole purpose of religious ideas</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.679" end="01:35:22.639" style="s2">to propagate the species</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.600" end="01:35:26.800" style="s2">no it&#39;s not the sole purpose</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.639" end="01:35:29.520" style="s2">um we discussed that a lot today</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.800" end="01:35:31.119" style="s2">the sole purpose of religious ideas the</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.520" end="01:35:34.000" style="s2">sole purpose</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.119" end="01:35:35.600" style="s2">first of all the questioner assumes that</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.000" end="01:35:37.040" style="s2">there is a sole purpose and</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.600" end="01:35:39.280" style="s2">and i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.040" end="01:35:41.199" style="s2">accurate so you want to be careful about</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.280" end="01:35:43.199" style="s2">reducing something complex to a single</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.199" end="01:35:44.000" style="s2">explanation that&#39;s generally the purview</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.199" end="01:35:46.639" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.000" end="01:35:48.800" style="s2">ideologues right they have one idea and</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.639" end="01:35:50.480" style="s2">it just covers the world</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.800" end="01:35:52.400" style="s2">and the world is a little bit too</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.480" end="01:35:53.600" style="s2">complex more too complicated to be</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.400" end="01:35:57.760" style="s2">covered by</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.600" end="01:36:01.920" style="s2">by one one idea unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.760" end="01:36:03.920" style="s2">um the purpose of religious ideas as far</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.920" end="01:36:05.520" style="s2">as i could tell is to remind us who we</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.920" end="01:36:08.159" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.520" end="01:36:10.159" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t live that long right</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.159" end="01:36:11.840" style="s2">and and we&#39;re really complicated</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.159" end="01:36:14.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s not easy to learn how to be a</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.840" end="01:36:15.840" style="s2">person you know i mean it takes you like</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.000" end="01:36:16.560" style="s2">40 years before you can learn to be a</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.840" end="01:36:18.000" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.560" end="01:36:19.600" style="s2">enough so that you can get out of your</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.000" end="01:36:22.840" style="s2">mother&#39;s basement</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.600" end="01:36:24.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s hard that&#39;s half your life</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.840" end="01:36:27.600" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.960" end="01:36:28.400" style="s2">well maybe not 40 but but certainly</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.600" end="01:36:30.159" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.400" end="01:36:31.920" style="s2">um it takes a long time to learn how to</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.159" end="01:36:34.080" style="s2">be a human being and</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.920" end="01:36:36.239" style="s2">and we&#39;re very very complicated we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.080" end="01:36:37.199" style="s2">we&#39;re way more complicated than we can</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.239" end="01:36:38.560" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.199" end="01:36:40.719" style="s2">you know and we&#39;ve been watching each</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.560" end="01:36:42.560" style="s2">other for a long time watching ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.719" end="01:36:44.960" style="s2">telling stories about ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.560" end="01:36:46.159" style="s2">trying to draw some wisdom from our self</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.960" end="01:36:47.760" style="s2">observations</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.159" end="01:36:49.360" style="s2">to teach to our children and to our</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.760" end="01:36:51.360" style="s2">grandchildren and so forth and</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.360" end="01:36:52.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve codified them in all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.360" end="01:36:55.840" style="s2">strange ways in these</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.880" end="01:36:57.440" style="s2">memorable stories fairy tales and myths</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.840" end="01:36:59.679" style="s2">and religious stories all of those</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.440" end="01:37:02.639" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.679" end="01:37:02.639" style="s2">and what are they there for</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.880" end="01:37:06.000" style="s2">they&#39;re there to remind us who we are</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.360" end="01:37:08.080" style="s2">because we need</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.000" end="01:37:09.840" style="s2">to know who we are and you know we</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.080" end="01:37:13.119" style="s2">talked about that a little bit tonight i</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.840" end="01:37:13.920" style="s2">i believe the the notion that i i</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.119" end="01:37:19.280" style="s2">believe the</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.920" end="01:37:23.040" style="s2">most important idea that&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.280" end="01:37:24.560" style="s2">being generated is the the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.040" end="01:37:26.320" style="s2">men and women are made in the image of</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.560" end="01:37:29.360" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.320" end="01:37:32.560" style="s2">i think that a culture that doesn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.360" end="01:37:34.719" style="s2">isn&#39;t predicated on that belief</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.560" end="01:37:35.920" style="s2">knowingly or unknowingly and better</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.719" end="01:37:40.080" style="s2">knowingly is</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.920" end="01:37:44.000" style="s2">doomed to absolute catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.080" end="01:37:45.280" style="s2">because there&#39;s no reason to assume that</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.000" end="01:37:48.480" style="s2">there isn&#39;t something about</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.280" end="01:37:52.159" style="s2">us that&#39;s of transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.480" end="01:37:52.159" style="s2">value i mean</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.639" end="01:37:57.199" style="s2">if if for no other reason than the fact</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.280" end="01:37:59.119" style="s2">of our consciousness you know like here</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.199" end="01:38:02.719" style="s2">we are we&#39;re aware</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.119" end="01:38:03.360" style="s2">of of what there is and it isn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.719" end="01:38:05.760" style="s2">obvious</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.360" end="01:38:06.480" style="s2">that there could be what there is if</p>

<p begin="01:38:10.639" end="01:38:16.639" style="s2">is plays an integral role in the fact of</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.840" end="01:38:18.639" style="s2">being itself you know and metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.639" end="01:38:20.960" style="s2">aside it&#39;s hard to see that anything</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.639" end="01:38:23.040" style="s2">could be more</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.960" end="01:38:24.639" style="s2">vital than that more important than that</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.040" end="01:38:27.199" style="s2">and then it isn&#39;t only that we</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.639" end="01:38:28.560" style="s2">apprehend reality you know and and</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.199" end="01:38:31.199" style="s2">therefore give it</p>

<p begin="01:38:31.199" end="01:38:36.080" style="s2">it&#39;s also clearly the case</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.960" end="01:38:38.159" style="s2">that we partake in its shaping</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.080" end="01:38:40.400" style="s2">and and and we call ourselves on that</p>

<p begin="01:38:40.400" end="01:38:44.400" style="s2">feel guilty and ashamed when</p>

<p begin="01:40:41.520" end="01:40:48.560" style="s2">and then to alert us to</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.679" end="01:40:51.440" style="s2">the vital importance of the</p>

<p begin="01:40:51.440" end="01:40:55.760" style="s2">because i do believe that we shape the</p>

<p begin="01:40:55.760" end="01:41:00.239" style="s2">we move it towards heaven or we move it</p>

<p begin="01:41:00.239" end="01:41:04.239" style="s2">and we do that with every conscious</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.239" end="01:41:07.440" style="s2">decision we make</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.239" end="01:41:11.280" style="s2">and it moves in the direction</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.440" end="01:41:13.199" style="s2">that we determine and so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.280" end="01:41:18.080" style="s2">religious stories are there to</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.199" end="01:41:20.560" style="s2">remind us of</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.080" end="01:41:23.520" style="s2">fifty percent of queensland queensland</p>

<p begin="01:41:25.360" end="01:41:29.199" style="s2">intelligently and effectively into this</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.440" end="01:41:32.560" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.199" end="01:41:35.920" style="s2">um what percentage of queensland police</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.560" end="01:41:38.800" style="s2">are now currently women is it</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.920" end="01:41:40.800" style="s2">like 20 or 10 percent or does anybody</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.800" end="01:41:44.080" style="s2">know is it a low percentage</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.800" end="01:41:46.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s what it&#39;s five okay so this</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.080" end="01:41:49.040" style="s2">basically means that as a bloke applying</p>

<p begin="01:41:49.040" end="01:41:52.800" style="s2">right which is why uh 200 people thought</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.280" end="01:41:55.280" style="s2">this was an important question</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.800" end="01:41:57.199" style="s2">well as far as i&#39;m concerned it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.280" end="01:41:59.520" style="s2">what the hell are you sitting around for</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.199" end="01:42:02.080" style="s2">it&#39;s time for some political action</p>

<p begin="01:42:18.000" end="01:42:21.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like what percentage of women are</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.760" end="01:42:23.199" style="s2">bricklayers i know i talked about</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.360" end="01:42:25.760" style="s2">bricklayers already tonight but</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.199" end="01:42:27.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a good example i i went on the u.s</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.760" end="01:42:29.840" style="s2">if you go on on</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.040" end="01:42:31.760" style="s2">on this this statistical site that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:42:31.760" end="01:42:37.360" style="s2">you can look at uh occupations by gender</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.040" end="01:42:39.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s an interesting thing to do um</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.360" end="01:42:41.360" style="s2">here&#39;s an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.119" end="01:42:44.960" style="s2">you know the most common occupation for</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.360" end="01:42:46.560" style="s2">women back in the 1950s was secretary</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.960" end="01:42:48.639" style="s2">you know what the most common occupation</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.560" end="01:42:51.600" style="s2">for women is now</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.639" end="01:42:53.040" style="s2">it&#39;s secretary they don&#39;t call them</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.600" end="01:42:54.639" style="s2">secretaries now that</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.040" end="01:42:56.080" style="s2">it&#39;s usually executive assistant or</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.639" end="01:42:57.760" style="s2">something like that and that may</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.080" end="01:42:59.920" style="s2">indicate some elevation genuine</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.760" end="01:43:02.080" style="s2">elevation and status but fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.920" end="01:43:03.119" style="s2">the the the most common occupation</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.080" end="01:43:05.199" style="s2">hasn&#39;t changed in</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.119" end="01:43:06.560" style="s2">what what&#39;s that 70 years so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.199" end="01:43:10.000" style="s2">pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.560" end="01:43:13.600" style="s2">brick layers 99.9 of bricklayers</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.000" end="01:43:16.080" style="s2">are men okay so and and then</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.600" end="01:43:18.480" style="s2">it&#39;s the same for like heavy duty uh</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.080" end="01:43:20.480" style="s2">construction equipment operators and</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.480" end="01:43:22.080" style="s2">um people who are working with heavy</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.480" end="01:43:23.840" style="s2">machinery tend to be men</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.080" end="01:43:25.600" style="s2">people who are building things uh</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.840" end="01:43:29.280" style="s2">especially outside tend to be men</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.600" end="01:43:29.280" style="s2">overwhelmingly so um</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.760" end="01:43:33.520" style="s2">far more even than engineers there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.840" end="01:43:35.280" style="s2">fair number of female engineers</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.520" end="01:43:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like well what are we gonna do here</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.280" end="01:43:39.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like we&#39;re gonna enforce</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.760" end="01:43:42.159" style="s2">gender equality of outcome across the</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.280" end="01:43:42.639" style="s2">board sexy quality of outcome across the</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.159" end="01:43:45.600" style="s2">board</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.639" end="01:43:46.960" style="s2">is that the theory and how are we going</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.600" end="01:43:48.880" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.960" end="01:43:50.320" style="s2">exactly or are we going to just do it</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.880" end="01:43:52.880" style="s2">hit and miss it&#39;s like oh well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.320" end="01:43:55.600" style="s2">policeman this year</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.880" end="01:43:57.040" style="s2">well how about bricklayers it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.600" end="01:43:57.679" style="s2">what why don&#39;t we pass a law like</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.040" end="01:44:00.560" style="s2">tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.679" end="01:44:01.600" style="s2">that now 50 of bricklayers have to be</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.560" end="01:44:02.960" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.600" end="01:44:05.199" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t bloody well matter if the</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.960" end="01:44:06.960" style="s2">women want to be bricklayers how it has</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.199" end="01:44:08.320" style="s2">that&#39;s irrelevant who says anything</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.960" end="01:44:12.400" style="s2">about want</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.320" end="01:44:14.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like the only reason that women</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.400" end="01:44:14.760" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be bricklayers is because</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.320" end="01:44:17.840" style="s2">they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.760" end="01:44:20.239" style="s2">internalized their misogyny</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.840" end="01:44:21.040" style="s2">right well that that&#39;s the standard</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.239" end="01:44:23.520" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.040" end="01:44:26.320" style="s2">for that sort of gender inequality and</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.520" end="01:44:29.840" style="s2">like is and where is it going to stop</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.320" end="01:44:32.239" style="s2">so i i think i&#39;ve thought for a long</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.840" end="01:44:34.800" style="s2">time that the left can go too far</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.239" end="01:44:36.960" style="s2">and i i think that if you don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.800" end="01:44:40.400" style="s2">that the left can go too far then</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.960" end="01:44:41.280" style="s2">your head is so far stuck down in the</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.400" end="01:44:45.760" style="s2">sand that</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.280" end="01:44:48.800" style="s2">you&#39;re that i need an ending for that</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.760" end="01:44:50.800" style="s2">metaphor i was thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.800" end="01:44:52.159" style="s2">something far ruder and just made it</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.800" end="01:44:55.199" style="s2">polite um</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.159" end="01:45:00.159" style="s2">anyways i guess that&#39;s the ending to it</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.199" end="01:45:02.560" style="s2">um obviously the left can go too far</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.159" end="01:45:05.199" style="s2">the 20th century is a testament to that</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.560" end="01:45:07.360" style="s2">venezuela is a testament to that</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.199" end="01:45:08.400" style="s2">okay so when does the left go too far</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.360" end="01:45:09.840" style="s2">because the left isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.400" end="01:45:12.159" style="s2">particularly interested in answering</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.840" end="01:45:14.159" style="s2">that question and i would say the left</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.159" end="01:45:17.920" style="s2">goes too far when they insist</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.159" end="01:45:19.520" style="s2">upon equality of outcome legislation</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.920" end="01:45:20.960" style="s2">now equality of opportunity is a</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.520" end="01:45:22.719" style="s2">different thing because i think that if</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.960" end="01:45:24.560" style="s2">you have any sense</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.719" end="01:45:26.960" style="s2">imagine just imagine that you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.560" end="01:45:31.119" style="s2">greedy you know and self-centered</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.960" end="01:45:33.840" style="s2">and and that you want the most for you</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.119" end="01:45:35.679" style="s2">so we won&#39;t be too optimistic about your</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.840" end="01:45:37.040" style="s2">motivations</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.679" end="01:45:38.719" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think that most people are</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.040" end="01:45:41.440" style="s2">like that by the way i think that</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.719" end="01:45:43.040" style="s2">people are by and large pretty good at</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.440" end="01:45:45.119" style="s2">reciprocal interactions</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.040" end="01:45:46.719" style="s2">and they do like to have you know nice</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.119" end="01:45:47.679" style="s2">things for themselves but they&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.719" end="01:45:49.600" style="s2">hard on themselves</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.679" end="01:45:51.040" style="s2">but they&#39;re they care about the people</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.600" end="01:45:51.760" style="s2">they love and they care about their</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.040" end="01:45:53.679" style="s2">families and</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.760" end="01:45:55.360" style="s2">they&#39;re pretty good at reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.679" end="01:45:56.840" style="s2">interaction with other people too so i</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.360" end="01:45:59.760" style="s2">don&#39;t think we are just</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.840" end="01:46:02.080" style="s2">innately selfish to the core it</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.760" end="01:46:03.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work but let&#39;s assume you are</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.080" end="01:46:06.560" style="s2">for a moment</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.440" end="01:46:07.840" style="s2">well and then let&#39;s assume that you know</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.560" end="01:46:08.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of things you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.840" end="01:46:10.080" style="s2">how to do and</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.639" end="01:46:11.520" style="s2">there&#39;s some people out there who have</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.080" end="01:46:12.480" style="s2">some talent that might be able to do</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.520" end="01:46:14.639" style="s2">them and if they</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.480" end="01:46:15.840" style="s2">did them then you&#39;d get to benefit you</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.639" end="01:46:16.400" style="s2">know like you don&#39;t know how to make an</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.840" end="01:46:18.239" style="s2">iphone</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.400" end="01:46:19.600" style="s2">well some of you might but not the whole</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.239" end="01:46:21.040" style="s2">thing but you know</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.600" end="01:46:23.360" style="s2">some people know how to make an iphone</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.040" end="01:46:25.760" style="s2">and you get to have one and so</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.360" end="01:46:26.639" style="s2">stopping someone who could make an</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.760" end="01:46:28.560" style="s2">iphone</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.639" end="01:46:30.719" style="s2">from making one for some arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.560" end="01:46:33.040" style="s2">reason because of their sex or their</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.719" end="01:46:33.840" style="s2">ethnicity or their race just seems</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.040" end="01:46:36.000" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.840" end="01:46:38.239" style="s2">counterproductive and it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.000" end="01:46:40.000" style="s2">obvious if you look around the world</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.239" end="01:46:41.440" style="s2">and you look at countries that are</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.000" end="01:46:43.920" style="s2">developing economically</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.440" end="01:46:44.639" style="s2">here&#39;s one good indicator you know the</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.920" end="01:46:47.840" style="s2">countries</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.639" end="01:46:49.760" style="s2">that have um there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.840" end="01:46:51.199" style="s2">high there&#39;s a very powerful</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.760" end="01:46:53.920" style="s2">relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.199" end="01:46:54.719" style="s2">the rights granted to women and the</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.920" end="01:46:57.760" style="s2">economic</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.719" end="01:46:59.040" style="s2">viability of a given country it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.760" end="01:47:00.800" style="s2">tightly associated</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.040" end="01:47:02.239" style="s2">so that&#39;s quite cool because it seems to</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.800" end="01:47:04.560" style="s2">indicate well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.239" end="01:47:06.400" style="s2">openness to the participation of women</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.560" end="01:47:08.800" style="s2">in in traditional societies</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.400" end="01:47:10.400" style="s2">is also an indicator of openness to the</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.800" end="01:47:12.159" style="s2">new you know to the novel</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.400" end="01:47:14.560" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a good predictor of of</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.159" end="01:47:16.880" style="s2">economic success or maybe it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.560" end="01:47:18.880" style="s2">women have 50 percent of the talent and</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.880" end="01:47:21.280" style="s2">we could use the damn talent so</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.880" end="01:47:23.119" style="s2">how about we invite them into play too</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.280" end="01:47:24.000" style="s2">that seems perfectly reasonable and the</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.119" end="01:47:26.960" style="s2">same goes for</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.000" end="01:47:28.560" style="s2">as i said for ethnicity and and for race</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.960" end="01:47:31.440" style="s2">and so i think you have to be a damn</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.560" end="01:47:31.440" style="s2">fool not to</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.679" end="01:47:36.400" style="s2">open up the hierarchies to those who are</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.040" end="01:47:38.480" style="s2">competent</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.400" end="01:47:40.320" style="s2">right to the maximal possible degree and</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.480" end="01:47:42.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s an error not to do that</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.320" end="01:47:44.159" style="s2">but to insist that the outcome is the</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.400" end="01:47:48.000" style="s2">same it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.159" end="01:47:49.920" style="s2">it&#39;s so it&#39;s it&#39;s vile</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.000" end="01:47:52.000" style="s2">as far as i&#39;m concerned for a variety of</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.920" end="01:47:54.159" style="s2">reasons the first reason is</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.000" end="01:47:55.760" style="s2">there&#39;s no indication that any attempt</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.159" end="01:47:58.320" style="s2">to do that in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.760" end="01:47:59.280" style="s2">ended up in any other manner than</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.320" end="01:48:01.119" style="s2">catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.280" end="01:48:02.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first thing the second</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.119" end="01:48:07.520" style="s2">thing is</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.880" end="01:48:10.320" style="s2">think it through think it through</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.520" end="01:48:10.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.639" end="01:48:15.760" style="s2">50 of every occupation has to be</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.679" end="01:48:17.520" style="s2">men and women okay you&#39;re really willing</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.760" end="01:48:19.440" style="s2">to do that are you</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.520" end="01:48:22.400" style="s2">and we could start with bricklayers it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.440" end="01:48:22.400" style="s2">like how are you going to do that</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.480" end="01:48:25.760" style="s2">you&#39;re going to start forcing girls when</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.800" end="01:48:29.440" style="s2">they&#39;re like 13</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.760" end="01:48:30.800" style="s2">to learn to lay bricks</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.440" end="01:48:32.719" style="s2">and and how are you going to force them</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.800" end="01:48:34.480" style="s2">to do that because maybe they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.719" end="01:48:37.199" style="s2">interested i i can tell you something</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.480" end="01:48:41.040" style="s2">that&#39;s quite interesting about</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.199" end="01:48:45.199" style="s2">the stem fields in women so um</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.040" end="01:48:47.600" style="s2">as societies become more egalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.199" end="01:48:48.800" style="s2">so their equality of opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.600" end="01:48:51.760" style="s2">legislation</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.800" end="01:48:52.880" style="s2">is more widespread and arguably more</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.760" end="01:48:54.639" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.880" end="01:48:56.400" style="s2">and so that would be in countries like</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.639" end="01:48:58.000" style="s2">australia but more particularly in</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.400" end="01:48:59.280" style="s2">countries like the scandinavian</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.000" end="01:49:01.520" style="s2">countries because they&#39;ve taken it</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.280" end="01:49:04.400" style="s2">farther than anywhere else</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.520" end="01:49:05.600" style="s2">fewer women go into the stem fields</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.400" end="01:49:08.719" style="s2">fewer</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.600" end="01:49:10.000" style="s2">not more and so if you rank order</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.719" end="01:49:13.599" style="s2">countries by</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.000" end="01:49:16.000" style="s2">how free women are there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.599" end="01:49:17.360" style="s2">negative relationship with how probable</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.000" end="01:49:19.040" style="s2">it is that they&#39;ll go into</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.360" end="01:49:21.840" style="s2">science technology engineering and</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.040" end="01:49:23.599" style="s2">mathematics fields</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.840" end="01:49:25.280" style="s2">now and and the evidence for that is</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.599" end="01:49:27.040" style="s2">very very strong by the way this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.280" end="01:49:28.880" style="s2">just a few casual studies</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.040" end="01:49:30.320" style="s2">these are large-scale international</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.880" end="01:49:32.159" style="s2">studies with tens of thousands of</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.320" end="01:49:35.199" style="s2">participants</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.159" end="01:49:38.560" style="s2">replicated multiple times by</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.199" end="01:49:39.040" style="s2">researchers who did not expect to find</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.560" end="01:49:43.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.040" end="01:49:45.760" style="s2">nor want it so it&#39;s reliable</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.119" end="01:49:48.000" style="s2">okay so why well there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.760" end="01:49:50.560" style="s2">different theories one is that</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.000" end="01:49:51.760" style="s2">um the average iq of men and women is</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.560" end="01:49:54.400" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.760" end="01:49:56.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s quite clear but the male</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.400" end="01:49:57.199" style="s2">curve is flatter than the female curve</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.480" end="01:49:59.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.199" end="01:50:01.760" style="s2">what they call that the enhanced male</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.760" end="01:50:03.679" style="s2">variability hypothesis which is</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.760" end="01:50:05.119" style="s2">almost now become impossible to publish</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.679" end="01:50:06.880" style="s2">on because it&#39;s politically incorrect</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.119" end="01:50:09.599" style="s2">and what it suggests is that there are</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.880" end="01:50:11.119" style="s2">more men at the very upper end of the</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.599" end="01:50:13.679" style="s2">intelligence distribution</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.119" end="01:50:15.760" style="s2">and more men at the very lower end and</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.679" end="01:50:17.520" style="s2">that explains some things like why there</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.760" end="01:50:18.880" style="s2">are far more boys for example who have</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.520" end="01:50:19.520" style="s2">learning disabilities than there are</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.880" end="01:50:21.040" style="s2">girls</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.520" end="01:50:22.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s some evidence that men are</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.040" end="01:50:24.080" style="s2">more neurologically vulnerable than</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.960" end="01:50:26.480" style="s2">women because they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.080" end="01:50:27.679" style="s2">specialized neurologically and the</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.480" end="01:50:29.360" style="s2">advantage to that is</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.679" end="01:50:31.920" style="s2">this enhanced variability but the</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.360" end="01:50:33.360" style="s2">disadvantage is the specialization makes</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.920" end="01:50:34.800" style="s2">them less robust and resilient</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.360" end="01:50:37.360" style="s2">neurologically</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.800" end="01:50:38.560" style="s2">be that as it may that&#39;s one possibility</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.360" end="01:50:39.599" style="s2">and i think there&#39;s a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.560" end="01:50:42.159" style="s2">evidence for that</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.599" end="01:50:44.159" style="s2">and and it&#39;s often the case that</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.159" end="01:50:45.280" style="s2">differences at the extreme even if there</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.159" end="01:50:46.960" style="s2">aren&#39;t differences in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.280" end="01:50:47.920" style="s2">differences at the extreme actually make</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.960" end="01:50:49.040" style="s2">a big difference</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.920" end="01:50:51.520" style="s2">you know because like let&#39;s say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.040" end="01:50:53.760" style="s2">going to be an engineer maybe one person</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.520" end="01:50:56.320" style="s2">in 100 is an engineer</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.760" end="01:50:58.159" style="s2">and you have to be really interested in</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.320" end="01:50:59.920" style="s2">gadgets to be an engineer</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.159" end="01:51:02.320" style="s2">you know you have to be more interested</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.920" end="01:51:03.119" style="s2">in 99 out of 100 people to be an</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.320" end="01:51:04.480" style="s2">engineer</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.119" end="01:51:06.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s not that many people that</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.480" end="01:51:09.440" style="s2">are like that and most of them</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.400" end="01:51:10.800" style="s2">happen to be men now people have</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.440" end="01:51:12.719" style="s2">criticized the</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.800" end="01:51:14.800" style="s2">male variability hypothesis because</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.719" end="01:51:15.599" style="s2">they&#39;ve looked at the performance of</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.800" end="01:51:18.159" style="s2">girls</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.599" end="01:51:18.960" style="s2">in mathematics in junior high school and</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.159" end="01:51:21.280" style="s2">it turns out that</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.960" end="01:51:23.599" style="s2">girls do pretty much as well as boys do</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.280" end="01:51:24.000" style="s2">in mathematics in high school in junior</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.599" end="01:51:26.000" style="s2">high</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.000" end="01:51:27.360" style="s2">at the upper end and so those would be</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.000" end="01:51:29.280" style="s2">the people you&#39;d expect to go into the</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.360" end="01:51:30.560" style="s2">stem fields right because they have the</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.280" end="01:51:32.320" style="s2">what would you call they have the</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.560" end="01:51:34.880" style="s2">intellectual ability for it</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.320" end="01:51:36.880" style="s2">but what you see is that the women who</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.880" end="01:51:40.239" style="s2">have high mathematical ability</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.880" end="01:51:41.679" style="s2">also tend to have high verbal ability</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.239" end="01:51:43.520" style="s2">whereas the men that have high</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.679" end="01:51:46.000" style="s2">mathematical ability tend to have</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.520" end="01:51:47.520" style="s2">less high verbal ability and so one of</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.000" end="01:51:50.000" style="s2">the things that implies is that the</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.520" end="01:51:54.080" style="s2">women who have high mathematical ability</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.000" end="01:51:56.000" style="s2">have more vocational choice</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.080" end="01:51:57.760" style="s2">and so they&#39;re statistically less likely</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.000" end="01:51:59.360" style="s2">to go into the stem fields</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.760" end="01:52:00.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of an interesting no one</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.360" end="01:52:01.679" style="s2">expected that so that&#39;s kind of an</p>

<p begin="01:52:01.679" end="01:52:05.119" style="s2">observation and then there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.040" end="01:52:07.360" style="s2">observation too that&#39;s that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.119" end="01:52:09.040" style="s2">extraordinarily germane there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:52:09.040" end="01:52:12.719" style="s2">looking at the psychological differences</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.040" end="01:52:14.080" style="s2">and similarities between men and women</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.719" end="01:52:16.080" style="s2">and the first thing that you might</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.080" end="01:52:18.320" style="s2">want to know is that men and women are</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.080" end="01:52:20.639" style="s2">more similar than they are different on</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.320" end="01:52:22.239" style="s2">all the personality dimensions so the</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.639" end="01:52:24.239" style="s2">overlap is quite strong</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.239" end="01:52:25.520" style="s2">the biggest differences are there&#39;s five</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.239" end="01:52:27.440" style="s2">personality dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.520" end="01:52:29.280" style="s2">i mentioned them extroversion</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.440" end="01:52:31.840" style="s2">neuroticism</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.280" end="01:52:32.880" style="s2">uh agreeableness conscientiousness and</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.840" end="01:52:35.520" style="s2">openness</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.880" end="01:52:36.400" style="s2">the biggest differences are in</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.520" end="01:52:38.159" style="s2">neuroticism</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.400" end="01:52:40.080" style="s2">women are higher in negative emotion and</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.159" end="01:52:43.040" style="s2">that kicks in at puberty because</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.080" end="01:52:43.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not the case for boys and girls and</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.040" end="01:52:46.159" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.599" end="01:52:47.840" style="s2">higher in agreeableness which is partly</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.159" end="01:52:49.119" style="s2">why there are far more men in prison</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.840" end="01:52:50.880" style="s2">which is another thing we might think</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.119" end="01:52:53.920" style="s2">about is like what what is that</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.880" end="01:52:56.639" style="s2">is that gender discrimination precisely</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.920" end="01:52:58.080" style="s2">i&#39;m bloody well dead serious about this</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.639" end="01:53:00.000" style="s2">i went to a nato conference</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.080" end="01:53:01.280" style="s2">25 years ago and there were a group of</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.000" end="01:53:04.000" style="s2">female scientists there</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.280" end="01:53:06.000" style="s2">who claimed that the psychiatric</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.000" end="01:53:07.199" style="s2">diagnostic criteria for childhood</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.000" end="01:53:10.480" style="s2">conduct disorder</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.199" end="01:53:13.199" style="s2">should be re-vamped because there were</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.480" end="01:53:15.840" style="s2">far more boys diagnosed with childhood</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.199" end="01:53:17.599" style="s2">conduct disorder than there were girls</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.840" end="01:53:19.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s the precursor by the way to</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.599" end="01:53:23.280" style="s2">adult anti-social personality disorder</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.760" end="01:53:26.639" style="s2">or to criminality and the way that you</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.280" end="01:53:29.280" style="s2">equate it by sex if you want to do that</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.639" end="01:53:30.960" style="s2">is you get rid of the violence so one of</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.280" end="01:53:32.000" style="s2">the criteria for childhood conduct</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.960" end="01:53:35.840" style="s2">disorder is</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.000" end="01:53:38.560" style="s2">kicking hitting biting and stealing like</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.840" end="01:53:40.560" style="s2">criminal behavior if you take that out</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.560" end="01:53:42.159" style="s2">of the diagnostic criteria</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.560" end="01:53:44.080" style="s2">then you get the same number of boys and</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.159" end="01:53:45.679" style="s2">girls and that&#39;s what they were</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.080" end="01:53:47.760" style="s2">advocating for</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.679" end="01:53:50.320" style="s2">25 years ago and i thought you people</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.760" end="01:53:51.760" style="s2">are completely out of your bloody minds</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.320" end="01:53:53.599" style="s2">because the only reason that we ever</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.760" end="01:53:54.719" style="s2">came up with the diagnosis for childhood</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.599" end="01:53:56.719" style="s2">conduct disorder</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.719" end="01:53:58.639" style="s2">was because we were worried that the</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.719" end="01:54:00.239" style="s2">violent kids would become violent</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.639" end="01:54:00.960" style="s2">adolescents and that they would become</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.239" end="01:54:03.040" style="s2">violent</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.960" end="01:54:04.719" style="s2">adults which is exactly what happens by</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.040" end="01:54:06.639" style="s2">the way because</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.719" end="01:54:09.199" style="s2">aggressive behavior is unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.639" end="01:54:10.719" style="s2">stable and difficult to alter</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.199" end="01:54:12.880" style="s2">but they were perfectly willing to</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.719" end="01:54:15.599" style="s2">gerrymander the diagnostic criteria</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.880" end="01:54:16.800" style="s2">so that the sex difference disappeared</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.599" end="01:54:18.960" style="s2">even though that would completely</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.800" end="01:54:20.639" style="s2">invalidate the utility of the diagnosis</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.960" end="01:54:22.000" style="s2">and their and their and their</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.639" end="01:54:24.480" style="s2">fundamental claim was</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.000" end="01:54:25.119" style="s2">um the reason that there were more men</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.480" end="01:54:28.639" style="s2">in prison</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.119" end="01:54:30.400" style="s2">than women was because um</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.639" end="01:54:32.239" style="s2">it was a form of it was a form of</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.400" end="01:54:35.520" style="s2">arbitrary prejudice</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.239" end="01:54:37.679" style="s2">and that this is absolutely insane</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.520" end="01:54:39.360" style="s2">so you know it is the case if you look</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.679" end="01:54:41.040" style="s2">at domestic violence statistics by the</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.360" end="01:54:41.599" style="s2">way women hit men more than men hit</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.040" end="01:54:44.480" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.599" end="01:54:45.119" style="s2">just so you know um it actually doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.480" end="01:54:48.400" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.119" end="01:54:50.080" style="s2">mostly not that it&#39;s pleasant that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.400" end="01:54:51.199" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying is that men are a lot</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.080" end="01:54:52.960" style="s2">stronger than women</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.199" end="01:54:54.719" style="s2">they have a lot more powerful upper</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.960" end="01:54:58.000" style="s2">bodies and so when when</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.719" end="01:55:00.000" style="s2">men hit women the the consequences tend</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.000" end="01:55:01.679" style="s2">to be very dire and when women hit men</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.000" end="01:55:03.119" style="s2">well they&#39;re less dire and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.679" end="01:55:05.280" style="s2">saying that it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.119" end="01:55:07.280" style="s2">but i but i am pointing out that you</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.280" end="01:55:09.599" style="s2">know this this does happen</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.280" end="01:55:11.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not the point the point is that you</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.599" end="01:55:13.920" style="s2">know we&#39;re concerned about criminality</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.760" end="01:55:15.520" style="s2">because we don&#39;t want violent people</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.920" end="01:55:17.679" style="s2">attacking other people</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.520" end="01:55:19.440" style="s2">in the streets disrupting the harmony of</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.679" end="01:55:21.920" style="s2">society and generally</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.440" end="01:55:23.360" style="s2">corrupting the integrity of the state</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.920" end="01:55:26.800" style="s2">and so we put them in prison</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.360" end="01:55:29.440" style="s2">and most of them are men it&#39;s like 10 to</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.800" end="01:55:33.280" style="s2">15 to 1 and it&#39;s like that worldwide</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.440" end="01:55:36.239" style="s2">okay what we&#39;re gonna 50</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.280" end="01:55:36.239" style="s2">are now going to be women</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.320" end="01:55:41.599" style="s2">so seriously look if the if the if this</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.760" end="01:55:43.440" style="s2">if the theory is the only goddamn</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.599" end="01:55:45.119" style="s2">difference between men and women</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.440" end="01:55:48.239" style="s2">is a consequence of the oppressive</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.119" end="01:55:51.360" style="s2">social structure that cuts both ways</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.239" end="01:55:53.520" style="s2">and what that means is that if 85 or 90</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.360" end="01:55:55.119" style="s2">of the people who are in prison are male</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.520" end="01:55:58.560" style="s2">then the prison system is</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.119" end="01:56:01.040" style="s2">unbelievably prejudiced against men</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.560" end="01:56:02.080" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to act on that and how</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.040" end="01:56:03.920" style="s2">that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.080" end="01:56:05.119" style="s2">we lower the standards of criminal</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.920" end="01:56:07.040" style="s2">behavior for women</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.119" end="01:56:10.000" style="s2">until we equate the number of men and</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.040" end="01:56:15.840" style="s2">women who are imprisoned</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.000" end="01:56:15.840" style="s2">look that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.159" end="01:56:20.480" style="s2">yeah you know you think that&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.320" end="01:56:22.239" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens in the military</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.480" end="01:56:24.719" style="s2">especially at the higher ends you know</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.239" end="01:56:26.239" style="s2">in in in the operations like navy seals</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.719" end="01:56:28.320" style="s2">or the places where there&#39;s tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.239" end="01:56:31.520" style="s2">emphasis on physical readiness</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.320" end="01:56:34.400" style="s2">the only way you can equate by gender</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.520" end="01:56:36.560" style="s2">is to reduce the performance criteria</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.400" end="01:56:38.400" style="s2">that the women have to attain</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.560" end="01:56:40.400" style="s2">so if you can do it there then why the</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.400" end="01:56:43.040" style="s2">hell can&#39;t you do it for criminality</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.400" end="01:56:44.639" style="s2">if the goal is equality of outcome where</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.040" end="01:56:47.440" style="s2">are you going to stop</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.639" end="01:56:50.239" style="s2">and then that&#39;s easy if the goal is</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.440" end="01:56:54.159" style="s2">equality of outcome</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.239" end="01:56:56.159" style="s2">you stop when the outcomes are equal</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.159" end="01:56:57.840" style="s2">and not just the desirable outcomes you</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.159" end="01:56:59.440" style="s2">know you hear about the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.840" end="01:57:00.880" style="s2">well if you look at the c-suites of</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.440" end="01:57:03.199" style="s2">major corporations that</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.880" end="01:57:05.040" style="s2">a majority of the people are men it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.199" end="01:57:05.520" style="s2">like well the first thing i think about</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.040" end="01:57:08.159" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.520" end="01:57:10.719" style="s2">well what the hell&#39;s your point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.159" end="01:57:14.480" style="s2">like that&#39;s hardly anyone right</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.719" end="01:57:17.040" style="s2">99 of men 99.9</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.480" end="01:57:18.080" style="s2">of men are not on the c-suites of large</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.040" end="01:57:19.440" style="s2">corporations</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.080" end="01:57:21.199" style="s2">so we&#39;re talking about a very tiny</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.440" end="01:57:22.719" style="s2">proportion of the population and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.199" end="01:57:25.599" style="s2">strange people</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.719" end="01:57:27.119" style="s2">right they are they are they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.599" end="01:57:28.960" style="s2">normal people</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.119" end="01:57:30.639" style="s2">and the reason i say that is because</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.960" end="01:57:31.440" style="s2">first of all they&#39;re very intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.639" end="01:57:33.520" style="s2">most of them</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.440" end="01:57:34.480" style="s2">so so that that that takes the first</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.520" end="01:57:37.679" style="s2">slice</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.480" end="01:57:41.280" style="s2">and the second slice is all they do</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.679" end="01:57:43.119" style="s2">is work like 80 hours a week</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.280" end="01:57:44.639" style="s2">and not everybody wants to do that and</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.119" end="01:57:46.239" style="s2">and why should they it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.639" end="01:57:48.400" style="s2">whoever said that you should work 80</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.239" end="01:57:49.920" style="s2">hours a week but if you&#39;re gonna rise to</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.400" end="01:57:51.599" style="s2">that level in any profession</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.920" end="01:57:53.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t give a damn what the profession</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.599" end="01:57:55.760" style="s2">is if you want to hit the</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.280" end="01:57:56.480" style="s2">top one tenth of one percent in your</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.760" end="01:57:59.840" style="s2">profession</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.480" end="01:58:01.760" style="s2">then all you do is work and not only do</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.840" end="01:58:03.520" style="s2">you work you work hard and efficiently</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.760" end="01:58:05.199" style="s2">and you do it better than anyone else</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.520" end="01:58:06.880" style="s2">plus you need the talent and you need</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.199" end="01:58:08.000" style="s2">the intelligence and you need the luck</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.880" end="01:58:09.440" style="s2">and you need the health and</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.000" end="01:58:11.280" style="s2">all the other things that might go along</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.440" end="01:58:14.719" style="s2">with that and so the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.280" end="01:58:15.280" style="s2">a majority of them happen to be men that</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.719" end="01:58:17.520" style="s2">that says</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.280" end="01:58:18.400" style="s2">nothing about the structural what would</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.520" end="01:58:20.080" style="s2">you call this</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.400" end="01:58:21.520" style="s2">it says nothing about the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.080" end="01:58:22.320" style="s2">structure of the state as far as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.520" end="01:58:24.159" style="s2">concerned</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.320" end="01:58:25.440" style="s2">and why are we concentrating only on the</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.159" end="01:58:27.679" style="s2">upper end</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.440" end="01:58:29.440" style="s2">like why is it that it&#39;s the ceos that</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.679" end="01:58:31.040" style="s2">count and not the bricklayers</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.440" end="01:58:32.639" style="s2">you know and when there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.040" end="01:58:34.320" style="s2">things we can talk about with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.639" end="01:58:35.520" style="s2">that that&#39;s straightforward okay so</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.320" end="01:58:37.440" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference between men and</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.520" end="01:58:39.280" style="s2">women with regards to occupation</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.440" end="01:58:41.040" style="s2">okay men are way more likely to work</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.280" end="01:58:42.800" style="s2">outside okay so now</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.040" end="01:58:44.880" style="s2">half the women who work outside half the</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.800" end="01:58:46.719" style="s2">people who work outside have to be women</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.880" end="01:58:49.280" style="s2">men are way more likely to work in</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.719" end="01:58:51.440" style="s2">dangerous jobs they&#39;re overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.280" end="01:58:53.760" style="s2">more likely to be injured and killed on</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.440" end="01:58:55.520" style="s2">the job it&#39;s like okay time to equate</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.760" end="01:58:56.400" style="s2">for that i don&#39;t know exactly how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.520" end="01:59:00.639" style="s2">going to do that</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.400" end="01:59:00.639" style="s2">maybe we just injure women randomly</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.880" end="01:59:05.520" style="s2">until it&#39;s equal or we force them to</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.920" end="01:59:08.880" style="s2">take the jobs</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.520" end="01:59:11.199" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know how we do that okay</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.880" end="01:59:12.000" style="s2">men are way more likely to move that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.199" end="01:59:13.679" style="s2">another thing</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.000" end="01:59:15.840" style="s2">they&#39;re also much more likely to work</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.679" end="01:59:17.040" style="s2">longer hours women are way more likely</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.840" end="01:59:18.560" style="s2">to work part-time</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.040" end="01:59:20.639" style="s2">that&#39;s particularly true by the way in</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.560" end="01:59:22.159" style="s2">scandinavia and the reason they do that</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.639" end="01:59:24.960" style="s2">is because well you know they hit their</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.159" end="01:59:27.119" style="s2">30s early 30s usually and they think</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.960" end="01:59:28.560" style="s2">especially often if they&#39;re successful</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.119" end="01:59:29.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen this happen with women all the</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.560" end="01:59:32.159" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.040" end="01:59:33.040" style="s2">so i worked with women in in in in law</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.159" end="01:59:35.360" style="s2">firms</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.040" end="01:59:37.679" style="s2">really unbelievably accomplished women</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.360" end="01:59:40.400" style="s2">because the the firms would send us</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.679" end="01:59:41.199" style="s2">their best performers and our job was to</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.400" end="01:59:42.800" style="s2">see if we could</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.199" end="01:59:44.960" style="s2">make them a little bit more productive</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.800" end="01:59:46.320" style="s2">because if they were high performers and</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.960" end="01:59:48.159" style="s2">they were even five percent more</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.320" end="01:59:50.880" style="s2">productive it was unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.159" end="01:59:52.639" style="s2">valuable for the company and so all the</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.880" end="01:59:55.440" style="s2">loft the law firms they just lose</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.639" end="01:59:56.719" style="s2">all their women in the 30s in their 30s</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.440" end="01:59:58.320" style="s2">and it happens everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.719" end="01:59:59.760" style="s2">and the reason it happens is very</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.320" end="02:00:00.800" style="s2">straightforward and all the female</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.760" end="02:00:02.960" style="s2">lawyers know this</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.800" end="02:00:05.679" style="s2">they won&#39;t talk about it publicly but</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.960" end="02:00:05.679" style="s2">they all know it</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.840" end="02:00:09.840" style="s2">they did very well in high school then</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.080" end="02:00:11.599" style="s2">they did very well in university</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.840" end="02:00:12.960" style="s2">then they did very well in law school</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.599" end="02:00:14.159" style="s2">then they went and articled and they did</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.960" end="02:00:16.880" style="s2">extremely well as</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.159" end="02:00:17.199" style="s2">articles as articling students then they</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.880" end="02:00:19.040" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.199" end="02:00:20.320" style="s2">hired as associates and did very well</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.040" end="02:00:22.560" style="s2">and then they made partner</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.320" end="02:00:24.000" style="s2">and it was just like linear progression</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.560" end="02:00:25.599" style="s2">and there wasn&#39;t a lot of questioning</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.000" end="02:00:26.000" style="s2">that went along with it because most of</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.599" end="02:00:28.080" style="s2">the people</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.000" end="02:00:29.599" style="s2">who do that are very conscientious so</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.080" end="02:00:30.320" style="s2">they&#39;re duty-bound and so you know they</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.599" end="02:00:32.320" style="s2">hit it they</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.320" end="02:00:34.400" style="s2">they they have an aim and they just</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.320" end="02:00:36.159" style="s2">execute man they execute and</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.400" end="02:00:37.599" style="s2">conscientiousness by the way is the best</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.159" end="02:00:40.159" style="s2">predictor of success</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.599" end="02:00:41.520" style="s2">in law after intelligence and so you</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.159" end="02:00:42.960" style="s2">have to be a conscientious person</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.520" end="02:00:44.719" style="s2">detail-oriented and so</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.960" end="02:00:46.639" style="s2">if you happen to be a woman like that</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.719" end="02:00:47.199" style="s2">extraordinarily hard-working very very</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.639" end="02:00:49.840" style="s2">bright</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.199" end="02:00:52.719" style="s2">you just make a beeline to partnership</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.840" end="02:00:55.440" style="s2">but then you&#39;re 30.</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.719" end="02:00:58.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a problem and it&#39;s a problem for</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.440" end="02:01:00.400" style="s2">a bunch of reasons the first is</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.800" end="02:01:02.080" style="s2">you&#39;ve hit the target and now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.400" end="02:01:05.119" style="s2">surrounded by these guys</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.080" end="02:01:06.560" style="s2">and women who are partners and you</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.119" end="02:01:07.119" style="s2">thought that was a hell of a fine place</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.560" end="02:01:09.520" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.119" end="02:01:10.960" style="s2">but when you get there you find out that</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.520" end="02:01:13.040" style="s2">it&#39;s rough</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.960" end="02:01:14.159" style="s2">it&#39;s aggressive it&#39;s competitive it can</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.040" end="02:01:16.400" style="s2">be nasty</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.159" end="02:01:17.599" style="s2">and most of the people who are doing it</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.400" end="02:01:19.679" style="s2">are not happy</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.599" end="02:01:21.280" style="s2">it&#39;s hard work i&#39;ve met lawyers who like</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.679" end="02:01:23.280" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing but they&#39;re rare</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.280" end="02:01:24.800" style="s2">it&#39;s very competitive and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.280" end="02:01:27.040" style="s2">harsh and</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.800" end="02:01:28.800" style="s2">you&#39;re going to work man if your parents</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.040" end="02:01:32.000" style="s2">get paid 750</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.800" end="02:01:32.639" style="s2">an hour you&#39;re working whenever there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.000" end="02:01:34.880" style="s2">work to do</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.639" end="02:01:36.320" style="s2">no matter what else you have to do and</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.880" end="02:01:37.520" style="s2">you know you might and you might be</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.320" end="02:01:38.880" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.520" end="02:01:40.239" style="s2">three hundred and fifty thousand four</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.880" end="02:01:41.679" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars a year and</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.239" end="02:01:43.360" style="s2">that&#39;s good but you&#39;re probably married</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.679" end="02:01:44.560" style="s2">to someone who&#39;s making approximately</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.360" end="02:01:46.159" style="s2">the same amount of money</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.560" end="02:01:48.159" style="s2">so you actually don&#39;t need that much</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.159" end="02:01:49.920" style="s2">money and you certainly don&#39;t need more</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.159" end="02:01:52.960" style="s2">you might want it but you don&#39;t need it</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.920" end="02:01:52.960" style="s2">and then you start thinking</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.920" end="02:01:57.679" style="s2">why the hell would anyone in the right</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.440" end="02:01:59.280" style="s2">mind do this</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.679" end="02:02:01.119" style="s2">which is the right question by the way</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.280" end="02:02:04.320" style="s2">to ask about the people who sit</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.119" end="02:02:07.199" style="s2">in the c-suites in major corporations</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.320" end="02:02:07.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like they&#39;re working 70 80 hours a</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.199" end="02:02:10.239" style="s2">week for</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.840" end="02:02:11.679" style="s2">30 or 40 years you know that often they</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.239" end="02:02:12.560" style="s2">sacrifice their families for it and</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.679" end="02:02:14.080" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.560" end="02:02:15.679" style="s2">and they&#39;re they&#39;re a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.080" end="02:02:16.639" style="s2">person who does that usually hyper</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.679" end="02:02:19.119" style="s2">conscientious</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.639" end="02:02:21.280" style="s2">but like the question why you would do</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.119" end="02:02:24.719" style="s2">that is a really good question</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.280" end="02:02:27.199" style="s2">how about you have a life how about you</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.719" end="02:02:28.560" style="s2">have a partner that you see sometime how</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.199" end="02:02:30.800" style="s2">about you have some children</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.560" end="02:02:33.040" style="s2">that you actually get to see and take</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.800" end="02:02:34.800" style="s2">care of and so then you think well maybe</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.040" end="02:02:36.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t need to work 80 hours a week to</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.800" end="02:02:38.400" style="s2">continue my rise through the</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.560" end="02:02:40.159" style="s2">you know upper strategy stratosphere of</p>

<p begin="02:02:58.560" end="02:03:01.840" style="s2">you know they&#39;ve enforced gender</p>

<p begin="02:03:10.159" end="02:03:14.080" style="s2">and the reason for that was that wasn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="02:03:14.080" end="02:03:18.880" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t systemic oppression</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.119" end="02:03:20.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a multitude of reasons that men</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.880" end="02:03:22.880" style="s2">and women take different</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.960" end="02:03:24.560" style="s2">pathways in their careers and they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="02:03:25.440" end="02:03:30.560" style="s2">women so women are different</p>

<p begin="02:03:30.560" end="02:03:33.280" style="s2">agreeableness both the same in</p>

<p begin="02:03:33.280" end="02:03:37.040" style="s2">um openness and extroversion there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.599" end="02:03:37.520" style="s2">some differences but they&#39;re relatively</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.040" end="02:03:39.040" style="s2">minor</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.520" end="02:03:40.639" style="s2">pretty much the same in terms of</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.040" end="02:03:42.000" style="s2">intelligence doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="02:03:42.000" end="02:03:45.280" style="s2">for most for most professions with the</p>

<p begin="02:03:47.599" end="02:03:50.719" style="s2">that might have to do with like upper</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.040" end="02:03:51.599" style="s2">level mathematical genius but we can</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.719" end="02:03:54.000" style="s2">leave that aside</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.599" end="02:03:55.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s debatable there is a</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.000" end="02:03:56.560" style="s2">different other difference between men</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.440" end="02:03:58.159" style="s2">and women and this is the biggest</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.560" end="02:04:01.440" style="s2">difference that psychologists have</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.159" end="02:04:02.800" style="s2">discovered and that&#39;s of interest men</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.440" end="02:04:05.840" style="s2">are more interested in</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.800" end="02:04:06.560" style="s2">things on average and women are more</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.840" end="02:04:09.199" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.560" end="02:04:10.880" style="s2">people on average and the difference is</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.199" end="02:04:12.719" style="s2">actually quite big it&#39;s one standard</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.880" end="02:04:14.320" style="s2">deviation which means that</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.719" end="02:04:17.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a little more than that which means</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.320" end="02:04:20.719" style="s2">that if you were a man</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.360" end="02:04:21.280" style="s2">as interested in people as the typical</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.719" end="02:04:24.000" style="s2">woman</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.280" end="02:04:25.599" style="s2">is interested in people you would be you</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.000" end="02:04:28.400" style="s2">would have to be more interested in</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.599" end="02:04:30.480" style="s2">people than 85 percent of men</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.400" end="02:04:31.599" style="s2">and if you were a woman who was as</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.480" end="02:04:34.480" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.599" end="02:04:35.920" style="s2">things as the average man is interested</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.480" end="02:04:38.239" style="s2">in things you&#39;d have to be more</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.920" end="02:04:38.880" style="s2">interested in things than 85 percent of</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.239" end="02:04:40.719" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.880" end="02:04:41.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s actually quite a big difference</p>
<p begin="02:04:40.719" end="02:04:44.800" style="s2">and so thing</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.920" end="02:04:46.320" style="s2">interest is a big determination of</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.800" end="02:04:48.880" style="s2">interest in the stem fields</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.320" end="02:04:50.880" style="s2">and women just aren&#39;t that interested in</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.880" end="02:04:52.480" style="s2">things now some of them are and they go</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.880" end="02:04:53.119" style="s2">into the stem fields but most of them</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.480" end="02:04:56.239" style="s2">aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.119" end="02:04:57.599" style="s2">so what are you going to do about that</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.239" end="02:04:59.280" style="s2">so you know one of the things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.599" end="02:05:01.199" style="s2">trying to do in the in</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.280" end="02:05:03.520" style="s2">in the scandinavian countries is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.199" end="02:05:07.199" style="s2">going to really start to socialize</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.520" end="02:05:08.480" style="s2">boys and girls different in preschool</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.199" end="02:05:10.159" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s good so that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.480" end="02:05:10.800" style="s2">you&#39;re going to allow is it this is the</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.159" end="02:05:12.960" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.800" end="02:05:14.400" style="s2">you&#39;re going to discount the notion</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.960" end="02:05:16.400" style="s2">entirely</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.400" end="02:05:17.760" style="s2">that there might actually be differences</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.400" end="02:05:19.360" style="s2">between men and women</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.760" end="02:05:21.119" style="s2">even though that wouldn&#39;t necessarily be</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.360" end="02:05:21.840" style="s2">a bad thing but we&#39;re going to discount</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.119" end="02:05:23.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.840" end="02:05:25.440" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to assume that all the</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.520" end="02:05:26.400" style="s2">differences in outcome are a consequence</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.440" end="02:05:29.679" style="s2">of systemic</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.400" end="02:05:31.840" style="s2">oppression and then we&#39;re going to give</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.679" end="02:05:33.679" style="s2">enough power to the state</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.840" end="02:05:34.960" style="s2">so that they&#39;re going to transform the</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.679" end="02:05:38.480" style="s2">way that our children</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.960" end="02:05:41.599" style="s2">are treated when they&#39;re three and four</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.480" end="02:05:42.880" style="s2">by teachers by preschool teachers and</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.599" end="02:05:45.119" style="s2">we&#39;re going to try to rejig</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.880" end="02:05:46.560" style="s2">the entire culture predicated on that</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.119" end="02:05:49.599" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.560" end="02:05:51.199" style="s2">that&#39;s the solution well if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.599" end="02:05:52.000" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a totalitarian</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.199" end="02:06:03.840" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.000" end="02:06:03.840" style="s2">then you are not thinking</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.840" end="02:06:10.400" style="s2">and this is the last one i&#39;ll answer a</p>

<p begin="02:06:11.040" end="02:06:14.079" style="s2">apparently what do you think of our</p>
