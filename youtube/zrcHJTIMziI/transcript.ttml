<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:23.200" style="s2">uh in a different medium and seeing how</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">it goes so that&#39;s the idea of</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.360" end="00:01:51.119" style="s2">for that intro uh i guess for the people</p>

<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">kind of the mechanics of how it works</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">it&#39;s a place for</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:04.960" style="s2">any two people to have an exchange</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:06.640" style="s2">the conversation by the exchange of</p>

<p begin="00:02:06.640" end="00:02:13.120" style="s2">but really it&#39;s a place that&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">repair the health of discourse by</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.120" end="00:02:16.640" style="s2">bringing people together who disagree</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">but when they disagree view</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.640" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">each other as collaborators rather than</p>

<p begin="00:02:25.840" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">outstanding examples</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:33.040" style="s2">of the kinds of individuals that are</p>

<p begin="00:02:33.040" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">online</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">um you know letter has hosted hundreds</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">and i think in reading those</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">conversations we&#39;re all invited to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">take a journey to try and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">what&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">i think that overlaps incredibly well</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">with what the star</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:58.879" style="s2">is attempting and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a real</p>

<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">but actually very eloquent</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.199" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">and articulate about this position and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">lot of articles on medium</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:45.600" style="s2">um and i&#39;m super excited to do this um</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">it started off with just a question</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.600" end="00:05:49.120" style="s2">of you know what i think it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">sort of a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.120" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">perfectly stupid question which is um</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">does every single gun sold in america</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:00.400" style="s2">that add to book about add to violence</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">in the word in the country or</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.400" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">reduce violence in the country um i</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:06.800" style="s2">stated that purposefully vague because</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:08.560" style="s2">you could think of you know some people</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">think of guns as a defense and some</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.560" end="00:06:13.120" style="s2">people think of the guns as a menace</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:13.440" style="s2">and in both cases they want to that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.440" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">concept of safety is sort of core to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:20.319" style="s2">whole argument around guns and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">it is so simple to reduce it down to</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">like do they just simply</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:26.160" style="s2">make the number go up or that number go</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:28.479" style="s2">down um and bj quickly corrected me</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.160" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">and um sort of teased apart and said</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.479" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">like you know there&#39;s the suicide number</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">there&#39;s the homicide number there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">you know the just violence in general um</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">there&#39;s like replacement violence that</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">would happen with guns</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">um we tried to basically solve this</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:48.319" style="s2">by in several steps teaching apart</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:51.759" style="s2">like um you know how many how many</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.319" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">um suicides happen how many um homicides</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.759" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">happen how much of accidental how much</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">uh related to the to the policies out</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:07:00.479" style="s2">there my position</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">is and still remains that we would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.479" end="00:07:06.080" style="s2">safer with fewer guns</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:07.919" style="s2">um that&#39;s you know a position that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.080" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">um i still feel strongly about but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.919" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">question that&#39;s really hard that i</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">really did shift sort of existentially</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">on this position is</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">how do we do that um and i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">one of the things that i really learned</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:22.639" style="s2">from this conversation was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">you know many of us come to this</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">question with like let&#39;s get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">assault rifles let&#39;s stop</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.919" end="00:07:30.080" style="s2">you know selling them my gun shows let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">do background checks let&#39;s you know do</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.080" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">the waiting period let&#39;s do all these</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.759" end="00:07:35.360" style="s2">things um</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">a couple things became clear as you talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.360" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">to someone like bj is like</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">well a lot of states already have this</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:40.319" style="s2">stuff it doesn&#39;t necessarily reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">guns</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.319" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">the gun violence in this country in</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">those states</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">and the the policies that we&#39;re pushing</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">are oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">it&#39;s really a hard stretch to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:53.759" style="s2">how they would actually impact</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">the numbers of homicides and sort of gun</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.759" end="00:07:57.440" style="s2">homicides</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:07:59.039" style="s2">and so we really try to zero in on what</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">would be the highest impact policy that</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.039" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">we could both agree on</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:07.199" style="s2">to do this and after a long period of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:09.360" style="s2">back and forth we settled on i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.199" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">a position around rather than federal</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.360" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">sort of run</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:14.720" style="s2">organizations with universal background</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:16.720" style="s2">checks lean on the existing</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.720" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">nics database which people already do</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.720" end="00:08:21.759" style="s2">for background checks</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">and allow states to basically build a</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.759" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">dmv for guns</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">which means that at point of you know at</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">point of purchase you have to show your</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">state um sort of licensed gun purchasing</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">license</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">that has already proven that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">been some kind of background check for</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:37.200" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.760" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">but you haven&#39;t you&#39;re not a fellow and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.200" end="00:08:39.279" style="s2">you&#39;re not you know you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:41.279" style="s2">domestic abuser</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.279" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">you haven&#39;t been deemed mentally ill by</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.279" end="00:08:45.279" style="s2">a judge all these things</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">and then from then on as long as you</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.279" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">have the license you can buy guns</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">um and by doing the math and bjo will</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">have much more</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">like sort of data on this because i was</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">really you know surfing on his ability</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">to like produce all this all these</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">studies that have been made</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">um this could be this could result</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">in a five percent reduction um in</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">in in homicides across the board</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:11.680" style="s2">and a larger number of just gone</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">homicides</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.680" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">and because we know this because certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">states have done this</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">and certain studies have been done to</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:21.519" style="s2">show how the delta has been reached</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">in small pockets of the country and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.519" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">that was you know we ended up coming</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:26.959" style="s2">down to a five percent reduction</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">every single state has to do this so</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.959" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">there are definitely challenges but</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">um and it&#39;s not a huge number but to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:35.600" style="s2">making any progress is is the foot in</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">the door</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.600" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">to making more progress we&#39;ll learn</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:39.839" style="s2">something by doing this if we can do it</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">it&#39;s local</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.839" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">people can decide to um sort of do this</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">on a smaller battlefield of their state</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:49.920" style="s2">we can sort of take the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">down from this ideological you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.920" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">thing in the sky to something more on</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">the ground</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">and that really appealed to me and in</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">the meantime i&#39;ll wrap it up quick</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:09:59.519" style="s2">um some concessions i think should be</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">made one of them being like</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.519" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">you know we should also try to tackle</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">suicides directly we should try to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:07.120" style="s2">tackle domestic abuse</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">directly and sort of you know tackle</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.120" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">these really acute</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">um sources of gun violence</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">um in a way that um handles them as</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">people and not just through policies</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.480" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">and that could also be unstable and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">also things like the ability to to give</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">your gun to someone else if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">suicidal</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:26.399" style="s2">um it&#39;s currently illegal um and i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2">that could be illegal and so like we had</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.399" end="00:10:31.200" style="s2">a couple concessions that were really</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:32.480" style="s2">small to me but big to be to get because</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.200" end="00:10:35.360" style="s2">they are sort of backwards</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.480" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">um and then a couple vice versa where</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">things that seemed big to</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">to to me were easier for bj to</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:42.959" style="s2">to take on because just moving from</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">federal to state was pretty easy for me</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.959" end="00:10:46.399" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">um and anyway that&#39;s the summary i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.399" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">we can dive into it it&#39;s a giant organic</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">topic</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:53.120" style="s2">um but we came out of it i think both</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">feeling pretty jazzed about</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.120" end="00:10:58.320" style="s2">um finding a point of agreement and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">we have since gone around and tried to</p>

<p begin="00:12:29.200" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">i got up my first print article in</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.160" end="00:12:37.680" style="s2">recoil this past edition in recoil 50</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">and yesterday this</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.680" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">long chain of events led me to doing a</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">an over</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:47.200" style="s2">hour an hour long</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.480" end="00:12:52.800" style="s2">gun research guy at boston university</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:55.279" style="s2">who studies that i was</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.800" end="00:12:56.959" style="s2">heavily referencing in my letter thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.279" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">with buster</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.959" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">and it was an amazing experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:04.000" style="s2">and through all of this what i&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">is that if you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.000" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">open dialogue that is looking at</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:09.279" style="s2">statistics</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">and you&#39;re willing to set ideology at</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:12.639" style="s2">the door</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">you come to um some resounding</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.639" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">conclusions about what we can do and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">what we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">and what kinds of things we can give</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.959" end="00:13:22.959" style="s2">back to gun owners to convince them that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:24.560" style="s2">um that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.959" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">the gun control people are coming into</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.560" end="00:13:27.680" style="s2">the are argument with good faith</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">and this is something that michael</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">stressed heavily in the um</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">in the interview i did with him</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:33.519" style="s2">yesterday which i believe will be live</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">on recoil tv</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.519" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">next week sometime and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:41.040" style="s2">his position as someone who is deeper in</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:45.440" style="s2">the numbers than</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.040" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">me or buster was that</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.440" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">generally there are some laws that have</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">been shown to work</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:54.000" style="s2">most laws have been shown explicitly not</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2">to work</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.000" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">and that we can probably get the laws</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.600" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">that do work</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">past if we give the candy back that</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:08.079" style="s2">they stole and that part of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">is but the most important thing to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.079" end="00:14:12.800" style="s2">to that point is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:14.560" style="s2">um is earning the respect</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.800" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">and faith from gun owners so that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.560" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">can get behind board because they feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:18.720" style="s2">like they&#39;ve been burned</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:20.959" style="s2">i bet they&#39;ve been burned a lot and when</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.720" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">the an ordinary gun opera opens up some</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.959" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">immediate piece that says something</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:25.199" style="s2">about a gun policy researcher they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">just like yeah fuck it and they throw it</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:29.040" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:31.519" style="s2">right and further i mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.040" end="00:14:32.959" style="s2">michael was very critical of um some of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.519" end="00:14:34.160" style="s2">the things that people are that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.959" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">politicians in the media have been</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:37.680" style="s2">saying like be you know beeto</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">and his you know yes we are coming to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.680" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">take your guns it&#39;s like well this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">helping</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">and there won&#39;t you know so when you the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:46.480" style="s2">reason it isn&#39;t helping is obviously get</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">into the numbers because the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.480" end="00:14:49.199" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about taking isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:51.519" style="s2">responsible for any of the deaths</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.199" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">right you know i think you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.519" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">rifles are responsible for like one</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:57.199" style="s2">percent of gun deaths in the country so</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">the whole argument about rifles it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.199" end="00:14:59.920" style="s2">basically a red herring it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">with what&#39;s scary and it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">playing to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.959" end="00:15:04.800" style="s2">people&#39;s fears to try and get votes or</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">to try and get clicks</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.800" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">right you know and one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">that the gun</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">discussion has now is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:20.320" style="s2">um it has pivoted into this</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">instead of it being about um</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.320" end="00:15:24.399" style="s2">trying to save lives it&#39;s about trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:26.720" style="s2">to attack cultures</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.399" end="00:15:27.760" style="s2">and michael became very aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.720" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">recently through this</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.760" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">most recent study that he did this thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.920" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">ah there it is um he this is uh this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">available now and it&#39;s it&#39;s free it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:39.600" style="s2">from the american journal of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">preventative medicine and it was a poll</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.600" end="00:15:41.600" style="s2">that he</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:43.519" style="s2">did uh with some research to be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.600" end="00:15:45.120" style="s2">follow-up poll next year to check on it</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.519" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">um and it&#39;s called the meaning of guns</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.120" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">to gun owners in the united states the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:51.279" style="s2">2019 national</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:52.720" style="s2">lawful use of guns survey so this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">part of what his group at boston</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.720" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">university has done and his group</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:58.399" style="s2">of all the researchers that are doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">this stuff they&#39;re approaching it from</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.399" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">the least ideological and the most</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">mathematical position</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:04.639" style="s2">and i really appreciate all the work</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.839" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">that they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.639" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">even more than a lot of the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">that i&#39;ve read if you&#39;re gonna go and do</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">your own homework</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">f dig up michael siegel see what</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">whatever he&#39;s written and whatever his</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.360" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">group has written that he has his name</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">on it it&#39;s gonna be good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">um and the conclusion generally like</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">part of this is about us our position um</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">in in the whole deal is is kind of this</p>

<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:35.680" style="s2">um gun policy that addresses the</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.680" end="00:16:40.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter doesn&#39;t work um if</p>

<p begin="00:16:40.000" end="00:16:42.000" style="s2">they&#39;re going to murder</p>

<p begin="00:16:47.519" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve had could have been</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">just as easily done with the glock nine</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:54.399" style="s2">millimeter that&#39;s on the side of</p>

<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:16:59.600" style="s2">these kinds of things right um the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.880" end="00:17:03.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:07.439" style="s2">does work is the stuff that addresses</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">who gets the gun so um</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">universal background checks for instance</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:14.799" style="s2">are something that are shown to work</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:16.240" style="s2">and the reason why is because you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.799" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">about ninety percent of guns that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.240" end="00:17:19.360" style="s2">sold they have a background check anyway</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:21.199" style="s2">you have to get a next check when you go</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.360" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">to the store to buy a gun</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.199" end="00:17:25.439" style="s2">the other remaining 10 percenter</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">peer-to-peer gun sales from one gun</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.439" end="00:17:28.559" style="s2">owner to another gun owner</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">and those don&#39;t have a background check</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.559" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">i couldn&#39;t get a background check if i</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:32.559" style="s2">wanted i wanted to sell a gun to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">friend i don&#39;t have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.559" end="00:17:38.640" style="s2">background check him</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.559" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">and when most universal background check</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.640" end="00:17:42.080" style="s2">laws are proposed</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:43.760" style="s2">they are proposed with this writer</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.080" end="00:17:45.520" style="s2">attached that says and also we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.760" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">to have a national firearms registry</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.520" end="00:17:48.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s the thing that causes all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">gun owners to freak out and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.799" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">one of the things that siegel did in</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.640" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">this in this study is that he</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:56.960" style="s2">looked at the opinions of gun owners</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">about different kinds of gun laws</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.960" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">and it was the support for universal</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">background check was very high</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">but he also disaggregated that and said</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">the per the support for a national gun</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">registry is very low</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">so if those things can be pulled apart</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">by the policy makers they might be able</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">to get one through without having to tag</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">the other one on it&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:15.919" style="s2">trojan horse thing that they keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">and they don&#39;t under</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.919" end="00:18:18.799" style="s2">i think that maybe either they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:20.320" style="s2">understand it or they&#39;re trying to sneak</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.799" end="00:18:23.200" style="s2">it in one of the two i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.320" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">know to to speak to them about it um and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.200" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">then the other thing it</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:27.440" style="s2">that is i think an important piece of</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">the puzzle is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.440" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">since we know all those other laws don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">work if you package that up</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">i mean you know if you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:36.960" style="s2">compromised positions</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:38.640" style="s2">give all that other stuff back you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.960" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">let the people in california have their</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.640" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">ar-15s with their drum magazines because</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:43.600" style="s2">those laws against those</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:45.280" style="s2">literally don&#39;t work because nobody uses</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.600" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">those in crime anyway you can&#39;t knock a</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.280" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">liquor store over with a big</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">unwieldy gun you have to have something</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">to hide in your pants right you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">so the um so there&#39;s a lot of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:18:56.559" style="s2">can be given back</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">while you ask for the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.559" end="00:19:00.720" style="s2">worth it another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">always pops in in sigel&#39;s research is um</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.720" end="00:19:03.760" style="s2">there&#39;s not a lot of states that have</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:07.280" style="s2">done this but there&#39;s a few that have</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.760" end="00:19:08.559" style="s2">um they will add people who have violent</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.280" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">misdemeanors</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.559" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">to the next check so if you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:16.720" style="s2">you know a misdemeanor battery on your</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">record you know maybe you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.720" end="00:19:21.760" style="s2">buy a gun right</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:23.200" style="s2">and most gun owners are cool with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.760" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">like yeah okay keep the gun out of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.200" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">guy&#39;s hand i don&#39;t want him at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:30.160" style="s2">shooting range with me right so</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">there&#39;s things that can be done but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.160" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">things that can be done have to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:39.679" style="s2">the kinds of people who end up with guns</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">and not on what the shape of the gun is</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.679" end="00:19:44.799" style="s2">that you&#39;re allowed to buy</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">right and that&#39;s the um and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.799" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">give</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">all this stuff back while asking for</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:49.760" style="s2">this other stuff it&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">position that you would be able to go</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.760" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">and the thing that um that siegel beat</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:57.280" style="s2">on the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.679" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">was that in order for the gun owning</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.280" end="00:20:01.039" style="s2">public to get behind this</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">the gun-owning public has to have trust</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.039" end="00:20:05.280" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">uh gun policy research are entering into</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.280" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">their research in good faith and some of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.080" end="00:20:10.400" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">don&#39;t appear to be doing that by my read</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">of some of the studies michael is</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:16.559" style="s2">because of his like you know he was a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">tobacco researcher for many years</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.559" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">and his approach to tobacco research was</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.120" end="00:20:23.280" style="s2">not to</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:25.360" style="s2">demonize tobacco users it was to enter</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.280" end="00:20:26.080" style="s2">into it as if we&#39;re trying to reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.360" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">number of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.080" end="00:20:30.559" style="s2">dead tobacco dead smokers right</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:32.880" style="s2">you know that&#39;s one of the reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.559" end="00:20:36.400" style="s2">instance off on the side he&#39;s very pro</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.880" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">vaping and um gets frustrated when</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.400" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">the cdc comes in as an with an</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:42.000" style="s2">anti-vaping stance because</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:43.600" style="s2">of the same kind of thing right you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.000" end="00:20:46.840" style="s2">instead of it being against</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.600" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">gun culture have it be pro</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.840" end="00:20:52.400" style="s2">safety and the um the other thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:53.919" style="s2">think is important to mention with me</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.400" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">and buster&#39;s dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">and is that you know homicides are only</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">a third of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">one-third two-thirds are suicides</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:03.360" style="s2">two-thirds of gun deaths in the country</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">are people</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.360" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">intentionally killing themselves with</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">their own guns it doesn&#39;t matter what</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">kind of gun you have to do that a one</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.480" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">bullet gun will do that for you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">it ain&#39;t like you&#39;re gonna miss and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:20.240" style="s2">while three uh men outnumber women</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">three three to one in suicides they</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.240" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">outnumber women</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:25.120" style="s2">seven to one in gun suicides and female</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:26.960" style="s2">suicides</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.120" end="00:21:28.159" style="s2">aren&#39;t uh correlated at all with gun</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.960" end="00:21:30.960" style="s2">ownership rates but male</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.159" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">male suicides are so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.960" end="00:21:36.400" style="s2">unique about the male mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:38.320" style="s2">and what leads them to suicide it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.400" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">probably hastier and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.320" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">you know when you make a hasty decision</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">with a gun you don&#39;t have time to undo</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">the decision</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:48.559" style="s2">right and the gun</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:49.919" style="s2">gun culture is slowly becoming aware of</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:46.799" style="s2">um i can&#39;t wait to hear what your</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.880" end="00:22:49.840" style="s2">conversation was with him um</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.799" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">i i think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">the the thing that seems so like obvious</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:54.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">coming out of the conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.960" end="00:22:58.720" style="s2">wasn&#39;t obvious</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:00.159" style="s2">it just seems too small to really have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.720" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">big impact is</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.159" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">that why don&#39;t why don&#39;t we self-reflect</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">on our policies</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">actually try to disentangle just the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:11.039" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">of every single policy must be pushed</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.039" end="00:23:14.159" style="s2">because we just</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">have to get momentum in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.159" end="00:23:17.360" style="s2">and it will create a snowball</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">because that&#39;s not how it works what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.360" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">have to do is really be smart about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:20.720" style="s2">policies we have to roll back for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">ones that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.720" end="00:23:24.320" style="s2">have been proven not to work um the ones</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">that are the sticking points that people</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.320" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">still feel resentful for because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:28.960" style="s2">bad policies</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">that you know punish people for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.960" end="00:23:32.720" style="s2">wrong reasons</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">um and just because we they can&#39;t relate</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">to them</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:38.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s such a it seems small but i</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.799" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">think it&#39;s the the key here right to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.799" end="00:23:43.919" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">to actually um</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">trust that there is some kind of not</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.840" end="00:23:48.559" style="s2">only one-way push from both sides it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">two-way</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:55.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a two-way give-and-take um and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:57.039" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how that happens with</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.440" end="00:23:58.720" style="s2">large groups it can happen with</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.039" end="00:23:59.520" style="s2">one-on-one conversations and i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.720" end="00:24:01.279" style="s2">that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:02.880" style="s2">we got there but when even in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.279" end="00:24:04.880" style="s2">one-on-one conversation where i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.880" end="00:24:05.440" style="s2">to represent my demographic and my sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.880" end="00:24:08.640" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.440" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">like my position group um i</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:12.159" style="s2">you do revert back to that like i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:14.400" style="s2">gonna push for everything</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.159" end="00:24:15.679" style="s2">um and try to whack you as much as i can</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.400" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">on your weak points</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.679" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">um but it&#39;s just so unhealthy it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">unproductive</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">make any progress in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:30.240" style="s2">that way so</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:32.720" style="s2">um two people that are trying to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.240" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">these kind of conversations i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">you know one of the things that has uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">has worked for us</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">in this conversation and in other words</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">is just to right up front</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:44.559" style="s2">try to listen to the criticisms that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">seem obviously</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.559" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">accurate and unimportant right because</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:52.000" style="s2">those are oftentimes things like</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.559" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">um that you know that&#39;s we think so</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">little of them because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">important to us but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:59.120" style="s2">important to somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.360" end="00:25:00.240" style="s2">um and if we can give those back that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.120" end="00:25:01.760" style="s2">the first sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.240" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">sort of a gift into the conversation to</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.760" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">the dialogue that then creates the good</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">will because you have to generate this</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:08.960" style="s2">good will</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">somehow and this is one way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.960" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">other than like establishing a really</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">long relationship with that other person</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">and trusting them as a human</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">your gifts are one way to it&#39;s like why</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">we do this in diplomacy why we do it in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">sort of traditions um and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">you know i think in fact in our</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">conversation bj was the first one to</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">make concessions to me which</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">you know it was and it was shocking how</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:32.159" style="s2">effective it was for like like just sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.279" end="00:25:35.039" style="s2">of softening</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.159" end="00:25:36.159" style="s2">my tone a little bit because he was</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.039" end="00:25:37.440" style="s2">talking about things that were</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.159" end="00:25:39.919" style="s2">a little bit over my head in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.440" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">policies and and organizations and data</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.919" end="00:25:43.279" style="s2">and then in a follow-up letter he said</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">like oh actually i i double checked that</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.279" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">thing i said two letters ago</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:48.960" style="s2">um and that was wrong um i forget</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">exactly what it was um about but i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">it was about the uk</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">um sort of violence rates um in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.799" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">beginning and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:57.360" style="s2">where they weren&#39;t actually measuring</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:58.799" style="s2">apples and apples and i</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.360" end="00:26:00.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t dig deep enough to actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.799" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">confirm that but he volunteered that as</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.720" end="00:26:04.480" style="s2">this information right up front and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:07.520" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.480" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">so eye opening for me i think it really</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.520" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">opened the conversation up because</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">when you can volunteer to like expose</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">your own mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">um suddenly you realize you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">same side</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.640" end="00:26:20.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s a position where these</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">conversations can happen</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.799" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">so most of the shifts i made i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:27.840" style="s2">sort of like policy wise were things</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.840" end="00:26:30.559" style="s2">that i don&#39;t even care that much about</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.840" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">um and and i don&#39;t like i i ca and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">both care about the same thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">reducing</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">you know death and violence and homicide</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">so those are that was just a really</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:42.320" style="s2">standout thing for me um</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">and i feel lucky to have like been in</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.320" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">conversation with bj because i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:47.200" style="s2">you know in my background i did a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.520" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">of salons in my house</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.200" end="00:26:50.799" style="s2">and tried to do them online around gun</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:52.720" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.799" end="00:26:54.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s so hard to even get people into</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.720" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">the same room because</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.240" end="00:26:57.520" style="s2">everyone thinks it&#39;s a trap everyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">thinks that like oh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.520" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna you know pretend to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:01.919" style="s2">friendly</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:03.039" style="s2">and you&#39;re gonna bring all these people</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.919" end="00:27:04.159" style="s2">in that you disagree with and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.039" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna attack them</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.159" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">um and that&#39;s just a sign of like how</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">much bad will</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:11.520" style="s2">is fostering in this like we&#39;re not only</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.720" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.520" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">strong and sort of entrenched in our</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:16.400" style="s2">positions but we have given up on even</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.799" end="00:27:17.120" style="s2">talking to the people because we think</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.400" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.120" end="00:27:21.760" style="s2">going to come in and um not even talk to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">us as humans</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.760" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s one thing that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:29.039" style="s2">at the meta level like</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">it it was really nice to to find bj</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.039" end="00:27:34.159" style="s2">and find other people on letter that</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:37.279" style="s2">have this ability to</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.159" end="00:27:40.559" style="s2">sort of be in disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.279" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">and also admit mistakes admit sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.559" end="00:27:43.919" style="s2">the weak points and invite people to</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.039" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">come in and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.919" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">tweak them and try to figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">going on there so michael was worried</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:49.520" style="s2">about that with the recoil interview</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">yesterday he</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.520" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">you know the first thing he asked me was</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">like art you know is rico gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:55.760" style="s2">chop this up and edit it he was worried</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:27:57.279" style="s2">that it would be an</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.760" end="00:27:59.039" style="s2">hour discussion and then they would cut</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.279" end="00:28:01.840" style="s2">five minutes out that was the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">uh uh undermining or whatever take stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.840" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">out of context or whatnot because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">what media does nowadays that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:09.120" style="s2">they give you an hour and and they and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.000" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">they do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.120" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">um that&#39;s why podcasts are so great yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:15.520" style="s2">yeah absolutely absolutely and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:16.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve got i you know might be putting my</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">foot in them out there i really hope</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">that recoil doesn&#39;t do that with what</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:21.279" style="s2">i&#39;m going to give them because i&#39;m about</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:23.039" style="s2">to pass them an hour and 20 minutes but</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.279" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">every they&#39;ve been very positive very</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.039" end="00:28:27.440" style="s2">open about it and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">um and so i think that they&#39;re um i</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.440" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:31.039" style="s2">i doubt that they&#39;ll do anything like</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:32.640" style="s2">that but you know i think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.039" end="00:28:35.039" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.640" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">possibly unique in the in the gun media</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.039" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">space that</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.919" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">it being a a you know an outlet that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:43.679" style="s2">right um because that&#39;s how the wars are</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">fought</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.679" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">the wars are fought by taking people out</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">of context and sticking them in media</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">and then trolling and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:51.200" style="s2">splashing that into an echo chamber and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:52.080" style="s2">trying to get the echo chamber to share</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.200" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">it around</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:56.320" style="s2">right this is the thing that that kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:28:57.919" style="s2">of pivoted me away from writing about</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:28:59.440" style="s2">guns and into writing about media</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.919" end="00:29:00.960" style="s2">criticism and culture war stuff my</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.440" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">personal blog because i started to see</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.960" end="00:29:03.679" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:05.039" style="s2">once i got five or six articles into the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:06.480" style="s2">into writing and stuff and i started to</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.039" end="00:29:07.600" style="s2">see which ones got traffic and which one</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.480" end="00:29:09.039" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:10.880" style="s2">the stuff that got the traffic was the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.039" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">culture war stuff was anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.880" end="00:29:13.279" style="s2">useful in a cultural argument the arms</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:15.039" style="s2">dealing</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.279" end="00:29:16.399" style="s2">in the culture war is what makes you</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:20.960" style="s2">our modern media landscape because um</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.279" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what people share in facebook</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.960" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">and so that connection</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.720" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">is tremendously unhealthy and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:32.240" style="s2">just in the gun space it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:33.600" style="s2">all of the spaces it&#39;s everywhere it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.240" end="00:29:34.159" style="s2">about everything whether you keep a</p>

<p begin="00:29:40.159" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like what how can i turn this into</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:44.799" style="s2">a culture war weapon to get clicks out</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">of it is the first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.799" end="00:29:51.039" style="s2">you know journalists nowaday does</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">and um that&#39;s horribly interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.039" end="00:29:53.600" style="s2">it&#39;s horrible interesting to see how</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:55.039" style="s2">even like the pandemic like at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.600" end="00:29:56.399" style="s2">beginning we were all thinking that like</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.039" end="00:29:57.440" style="s2">this we all have this in common we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.399" end="00:29:59.200" style="s2">want to get sick and die</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.440" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">we want each other to get to kundai and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:02.799" style="s2">then it collapsed into these polarized</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">sort of political positions around masks</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.799" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">and about</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:07.600" style="s2">you know sort of you know your personal</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:09.120" style="s2">freedoms and and i was i was surprised</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.600" end="00:30:10.399" style="s2">i was at first i was surprised that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:11.279" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen immediately because i was</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.399" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.279" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">well i think it happened when people</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.640" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">started talking about coming off the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">lockdown i think that was from the first</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">everybody bought into the flattening the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:19.279" style="s2">curve and then once the curve was flat</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">icus weren&#39;t overloaded then suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:24.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.320" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">that was right when it got polarized was</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.080" end="00:30:27.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay now it&#39;s time to get on</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:29.279" style="s2">with business</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.200" end="00:30:30.960" style="s2">and then people are like no we have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.279" end="00:30:32.640" style="s2">extinguish the disease</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:34.480" style="s2">and there are people like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.640" end="00:30:36.399" style="s2">extinguishable in that way and then at</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.480" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">that point everything</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.399" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">everything got turned into a first stem</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:42.640" style="s2">thing and and then it helped</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">the experts like just uh turned out to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.640" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.440" end="00:30:46.720" style="s2">highly competent and then ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:49.919" style="s2">wrong around masks um</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.720" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">that was not just against well not just</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.919" end="00:30:52.960" style="s2">the masks but the imperial college</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">projections on where things are going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.960" end="00:30:56.159" style="s2">go turned out to be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">you know there was a lot of because you</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:30:58.799" style="s2">know i mean you&#39;re kind of rolling dice</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">with this thing anyway nobody really</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.799" end="00:31:00.720" style="s2">knows anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:03.519" style="s2">you can&#39;t predict something you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">seen before right and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.519" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">yeah that was and i don&#39;t want to turn</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">this whole thing in a covid you know we</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">should still talk about guns instead of</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:11.679" style="s2">covet but</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:13.760" style="s2">um that was just one example of the that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:15.679" style="s2">happens on every space and it has been</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.760" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">happening for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">and um it&#39;s it in my mind it all goes</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">back to that</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">when i talked to michael yesterday he</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.600" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">i asked him this specifically i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:30.159" style="s2">do you think</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">that you can get that you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.159" end="00:31:33.519" style="s2">use this research that you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:34.399" style="s2">because his conclusion was basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.519" end="00:31:36.320" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.399" end="00:31:37.679" style="s2">uh gun policy reacher search need to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.320" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">better about reaching out to gun people</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.679" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">and understanding gun stuff and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:42.720" style="s2">yielding the fact that it&#39;s okay to buy</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:44.640" style="s2">a gun and then let&#39;s talk about what we</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.720" end="00:31:47.039" style="s2">can do instead of what we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.640" end="00:31:48.240" style="s2">because you can&#39;t reduce the you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.039" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">reduce number guns the united states</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.240" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not feasible um you could you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:54.799" style="s2">there&#39;s some argument that if you get</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">we&#39;re able to get the united states down</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.799" end="00:31:59.039" style="s2">to the boundary area where like</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:00.559" style="s2">england is that you might create enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.039" end="00:32:03.279" style="s2">scarcity to where</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.559" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">criminals could buy guns find a gun but</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.279" end="00:32:05.120" style="s2">we&#39;ve got so many guns here right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">you could</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.120" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">magically evaporate half the guns in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:09.760" style="s2">country and a criminal could still find</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.080" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">five if they needed them we&#39;ve got so</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.760" end="00:32:13.519" style="s2">many that that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">not an attainable goal and and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.519" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">would be true whether i was pro-gun or</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:16.799" style="s2">anti-gun</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">you know you got a lot of guns around</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.799" end="00:32:23.440" style="s2">here and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">so um but what he was saying was that</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.440" end="00:32:26.799" style="s2">um policy researchers need to be you</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.799" end="00:32:30.159" style="s2">he thinks he thought the policy reachers</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">could be more honest could be more open</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.159" end="00:32:32.799" style="s2">could enter into things with a little</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">bit more faith and could try and prove</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:35.039" style="s2">to the gun people that there is good</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">faith there</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.039" end="00:32:37.919" style="s2">and i was like do you think that would</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:38.880" style="s2">extend to the politicians he says yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.919" end="00:32:40.960" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.880" end="00:32:42.399" style="s2">and i just i didn&#39;t want to disagree</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.960" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">with him in the interview</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.399" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">um but i disagree with him i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:49.360" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">that jump is is i don&#39;t think that he</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.360" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:52.880" style="s2">that it can make that jump and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.760" end="00:32:54.640" style="s2">reason why i don&#39;t think it can make</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.880" end="00:32:57.279" style="s2">that jump is because of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.640" end="00:32:59.120" style="s2">the media engine and the politics engine</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.279" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">the feedback on each other</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.120" end="00:33:03.279" style="s2">if they don&#39;t if you find it some if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:05.039" style="s2">find a conclusion they&#39;d want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.279" end="00:33:07.360" style="s2">on either side then they&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.039" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">listen that&#39;s i mean i find that helpful</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:09.519" style="s2">i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">the reason i&#39;m so interested in</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.519" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">productive disagreement as a skill that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:14.320" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:15.840" style="s2">develop and you practice is because it</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.320" end="00:33:17.919" style="s2">has to be bottoms up it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:21.039" style="s2">something that you practice individually</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.919" end="00:33:22.559" style="s2">and as soon as you know we sort of amass</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.039" end="00:33:24.720" style="s2">enough people that can that have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.559" end="00:33:25.679" style="s2">skill then the politicians have to get</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.720" end="00:33:27.039" style="s2">in line because they&#39;re there to</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.679" end="00:33:29.039" style="s2">represent the people</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.039" end="00:33:30.159" style="s2">um would we only project our worst sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.039" end="00:33:32.240" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.159" end="00:33:33.360" style="s2">sort of cynical you know nightmarish</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.240" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">hellscape you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.360" end="00:33:36.399" style="s2">world onto our politicians and ask them</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">to be our you know our</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.399" end="00:33:42.399" style="s2">our generals then that&#39;s what to become</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">um and somehow we have to work with</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.399" end="00:33:47.519" style="s2">ourselves and figure out like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">create more productive conversations in</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.519" end="00:33:51.279" style="s2">the streets in our rooms in our</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:53.440" style="s2">you know you know in our families and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">our friend groups um in our online</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.440" end="00:33:56.559" style="s2">interactions</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:33:58.159" style="s2">do you think that&#39;s possible on a large</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.559" end="00:33:59.760" style="s2">scale yeah i think i mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">it&#39;s one of my like most hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">probably beliefs i mean be optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:04.840" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.320" style="s2">i think i&#39;ve seen it happen to</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.840" end="00:34:07.760" style="s2">individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.320" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">you know the fact that this exists at</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.760" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">the store exists and like medical</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:11.839" style="s2">mediation</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">all the stuff that&#39;s coming to you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.839" end="00:34:14.079" style="s2">i i know you still think it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:16.960" style="s2">tiny little bubble</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.079" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">in a gigantic grass sea but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.960" end="00:34:18.720" style="s2">that that bubble wasn&#39;t there two years</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.320" end="00:34:21.760" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.720" end="00:34:22.079" style="s2">and now it is um i think is is hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.079" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">these things do have to first appear as</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.240" end="00:34:28.320" style="s2">a bubble and then they</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">can become you know a bigger thing but</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.320" end="00:34:31.839" style="s2">yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">i mean my my perception of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.839" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">stoa and of</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">you know productive disagreements and</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">letter to wiki you know that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:38.800" style="s2">thing is i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.879" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">i feel like there&#39;s this giant war</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.800" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in a big battlefield</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:44.079" style="s2">and then when people get injured enough</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.560" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">from the battlefield they wander off</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.079" end="00:34:46.480" style="s2">into the woods and then they meet each</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:47.839" style="s2">other and they sit down and they talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:49.040" style="s2">about why they&#39;re roaring and they think</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.839" end="00:34:50.079" style="s2">it was kind of stupid and they figured</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.040" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">they&#39;d rather talk it out instead of</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.079" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">participating the war</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think there&#39;s very many</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">people out back here in the woods with</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">and i wouldn&#39;t i wouldn&#39;t call us the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">wounded and i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">there is still hope and optimism that</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:05.520" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t have if you were just</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:07.839" style="s2">dying in a ditch in the woods right like</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.520" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">i think these i think some of the people</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.839" end="00:35:10.240" style="s2">in doing this kind of thing are some of</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.240" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">most you know the kindest strongest like</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:20.000" style="s2">um sphere right now but oh i agree with</p>

<p begin="00:35:20.000" end="00:35:23.680" style="s2">i agree with that but you know the fact</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:24.960" style="s2">is i mean i don&#39;t know what might i want</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:26.000" style="s2">to say the fact that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.960" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">inferring in fact that</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.000" end="00:35:29.760" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not true i don&#39;t know but my</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:32.079" style="s2">perception is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.760" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">the fact that what we have here let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.079" end="00:35:35.040" style="s2">say for instance that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">the you know the kind of most thoughtful</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.040" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">most so in such people and we&#39;re off</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">here into what&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">you know are you sure you can get all</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:44.800" style="s2">those people in</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:45.680" style="s2">in the field over here i don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.800" end="00:35:48.640" style="s2">can i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.680" end="00:35:50.480" style="s2">i&#39;m i am pessimistic that you can get</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.640" end="00:35:54.160" style="s2">that many of them off the battlefield</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.480" end="00:35:56.800" style="s2">and i&#39;m curious what strategy you&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.160" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">to do to get people off that battlefield</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.800" end="00:35:59.680" style="s2">i think letter.wiki is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">approach and i think that what they</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.680" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">nailed</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">first off was that a lot of the reasons</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.520" end="00:36:22.400" style="s2">about who can farm the most clicks from</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:26.640" style="s2">hot takes</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">but but uh you know even even that aside</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.640" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">you know how many how many people in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:30.400" style="s2">public discourse right now could even</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:32.320" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.400" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">uh even have the skills to step up and</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:37.599" style="s2">the wiki exchange i don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:39.040" style="s2">there&#39;s that many people that do anymore</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.599" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">i&#39;m worried about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">well that&#39;s what&#39;s at skill we have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:42.880" style="s2">develop i think that even more important</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:45.520" style="s2">than the ui</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.880" end="00:36:46.960" style="s2">is the design the incentive structures</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.520" end="00:36:49.119" style="s2">of the platforms themselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">and you know just hearing clyde ending</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.119" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:55.280" style="s2">they want to build how they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:57.680" style="s2">create the incentives for themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.280" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">most likely encourage them to build a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.680" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">platform that most of the most likely</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">develop these skills and people</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:05.440" style="s2">i think that&#39;s you know where you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">you know i was at twitter for five years</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.440" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">and i i saw how like when the incentives</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">are to</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:15.040" style="s2">um get people to click on ads um</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">it just informs every single one of your</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.040" end="00:37:17.760" style="s2">decisions and it puts the power into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:20.000" style="s2">wrong place</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.760" end="00:37:21.760" style="s2">um the fact that they&#39;re trying to now</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.000" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">think about a you know pro</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.760" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">account kind of thing um and are</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">you know you know they i think they</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">admit that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">facebook and twitter and youtube have</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">severely damaged our culture um in many</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">that you know maybe they didn&#39;t intend</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">to but they did and it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:43.280" style="s2">i think they are starting to commit</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.320" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">themselves to to changing the incentives</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.280" end="00:37:47.680" style="s2">for themselves and their their companies</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.400" end="00:37:50.400" style="s2">are going to move fast if they want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.680" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know if they want to but they</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.400" end="00:37:53.839" style="s2">could if they</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:55.119" style="s2">that was had reached that point um in</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.839" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.119" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">their shift this might be a good point</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.800" end="00:38:03.200" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">pivot to some questions in the chat box</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.200" end="00:38:08.720" style="s2">um let&#39;s go oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">oh man okay megan had a good question</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">yeah yeah megan had a really good</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">question let&#39;s go with megan first</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">um thanks both um to me there&#39;s a sticky</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.880" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">in the in the background check idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">which is about</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">um about mental illness um on the one</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">hand obviously that really does need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.000" end="00:38:28.560" style="s2">be part of a background check but um on</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:30.000" style="s2">the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.560" end="00:38:32.720" style="s2">i think that it has huge potential for</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.000" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">weaponization um the definition of it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.720" end="00:38:35.520" style="s2">really subjective</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">um there&#39;s some shady stuff going on</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.520" end="00:38:38.640" style="s2">with pharmaceuticals that&#39;s affecting</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:39.760" style="s2">the definition of what&#39;s a mental</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.640" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">illness</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.760" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">um and then there&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:44.800" style="s2">opinions of you know our neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">as someone else pointed out you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.800" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">what your neighbor can report you um and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">extremely subjective and uh potentially</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">weaponizable</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:57.119" style="s2">um i i can&#39;t really see a solution to</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">that to that problem there is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.119" end="00:39:00.800" style="s2">something that either of you have some</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:03.839" style="s2">thoughts you could share with us</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.800" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">hi good morning i&#39;ll they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.839" end="00:39:06.160" style="s2">quick but i think you know more about</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">this than i do but</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.160" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">i think that&#39;s why we put that aside</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:13.119" style="s2">to a large extent like you know all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">studies that have been made are about</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.119" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">existing structures that exist like so</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">the next database does have a mental</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:19.359" style="s2">illness</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:20.960" style="s2">i think it&#39;s just like if you&#39;re in if</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.359" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">you&#39;re judged mentally unfit in a court</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.960" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:27.839" style="s2">law or by judge which is a lot further</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.800" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">you know away than um you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.839" end="00:39:31.200" style="s2">you&#39;re on you know prozac or something</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">by just saying that like the data we we</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:36.480" style="s2">found showed that</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">even at that like really extreme level</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.480" end="00:39:40.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.839" end="00:39:43.520" style="s2">that there that it could still impact</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.880" end="00:39:45.040" style="s2">the the homicide rate the violence rate</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.520" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">once we have more nuance and i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.040" end="00:39:47.359" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:49.520" style="s2">a follow-up question like if this works</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.359" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">to reduce finance</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.520" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">and we can continue to start to</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">collaborate with each other on policy</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">then addressing mental illness like much</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">bigger problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">i think than even guns</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.160" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">me and michael talked about red flag</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.920" end="00:40:09.359" style="s2">laws in the thing yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:11.760" style="s2">and um red flag laws were surprisingly</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">popular in his poll which i thought was</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.760" end="00:40:14.640" style="s2">i was very surprising because all the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">gun owners i know freaked out about red</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:20.240" style="s2">flag laws</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:21.680" style="s2">and uh the</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.240" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">the devil with those things is in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.680" end="00:40:27.520" style="s2">details right</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">so if um what michael was advocating in</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.520" end="00:40:30.319" style="s2">the discussion was</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.560" end="00:40:32.160" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like okay if you decide</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.319" end="00:40:32.960" style="s2">because red flag laws are mostly meant</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">to protect</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.960" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">suicidal people and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:39.680" style="s2">if you&#39;re a family member you discover</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:41.280" style="s2">that you know your</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.680" end="00:40:42.880" style="s2">dad or something like that is having</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.280" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">suicidal thoughts or tendencies or</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.880" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">something like that you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:48.480" style="s2">you know get your family member red flag</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:49.520" style="s2">get the guns out of the house or</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.480" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.520" end="00:40:54.640" style="s2">and michael&#39;s approach was that his his</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.200" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">understanding of those things was that</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.640" end="00:40:57.520" style="s2">it was voluntary that they would come</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.880" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">and say</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:01.119" style="s2">would you like us to hold on to your</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:02.079" style="s2">guns for you voluntarily and then they</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:05.119" style="s2">say yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.079" end="00:41:05.520" style="s2">so that might not be so bad right um if</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.119" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.520" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">if it gets up to the point where your</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">neighbor can call you can you know red</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:12.319" style="s2">flag you because they know you have guns</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:13.920" style="s2">and they&#39;re pissed off that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.319" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">mow your lawn for two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.920" end="00:41:18.079" style="s2">that can be a very different thing and</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:20.400" style="s2">so the devil in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.079" end="00:41:21.119" style="s2">in in the details of that is is really</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.400" end="00:41:22.400" style="s2">extreme</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.119" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">the other problem with just talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.400" end="00:41:26.800" style="s2">about um</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">uh you know in the united states it</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.800" end="00:41:30.319" style="s2">would be untenable to</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.240" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">flag somebody for a next check for being</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.319" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">on a</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">psychoactive drug because a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:37.680" style="s2">huge number of people in the united</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:39.520" style="s2">states are on this damn drugs</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.680" end="00:41:40.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like 20 or 30 percent or something</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.520" end="00:41:42.160" style="s2">like that it&#39;s out right now</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.720" end="00:41:43.599" style="s2">don&#39;t quote me on that look it up and</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.160" end="00:41:44.640" style="s2">whatever number you look up is going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.599" end="00:41:47.040" style="s2">be you&#39;re going to be like</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.640" end="00:41:49.760" style="s2">you&#39;re kidding me it&#39;s outrageous how</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:52.319" style="s2">many of how many people are on a routine</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.760" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">uh pharmaceutical and that has</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.319" end="00:41:55.760" style="s2">psychotropic</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:57.119" style="s2">effects you know and you&#39;ll often see oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.760" end="00:41:58.400" style="s2">well you know the mass shooter he had</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.119" end="00:42:00.400" style="s2">that he was taking this drug or that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.400" end="00:42:04.319" style="s2">drug or whatnot and it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.400" end="00:42:06.480" style="s2">well gracious so is everybody else and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.319" end="00:42:08.480" style="s2">so and then you know the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.480" end="00:42:11.119" style="s2">that goes that ties in with that too</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.480" end="00:42:13.040" style="s2">is that if you were to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.119" end="00:42:14.560" style="s2">law that said that anybody had suicidal</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.040" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">tendencies got their guns taken away</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.560" end="00:42:19.839" style="s2">unilaterally by the government</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:22.560" style="s2">then less people who are gun owners</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.839" end="00:42:23.920" style="s2">who were having a rough patch would seek</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.560" end="00:42:25.839" style="s2">treatment</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.920" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">and you&#39;ve created a disincentive for</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.839" end="00:42:28.560" style="s2">them to seek treatment in the first</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">place which makes things worse instead</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.560" end="00:42:32.480" style="s2">of better and that&#39;s got to get taken</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:35.599" style="s2">into the discussion too</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.480" end="00:42:36.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s very yeah it is as sticky as it</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.599" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">gets</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.079" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">you&#39;re absolutely correct it is so</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">sticky and but all those things have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">be factored in</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">and in some cases state laws like you</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">know buster mentioned um</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:49.599" style="s2">you know uh you know you&#39;re not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:52.480" style="s2">to exchange guns it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.599" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">um i can hand my guns to a friend to for</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.480" end="00:42:56.720" style="s2">safekeeping in georgia</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:58.400" style="s2">today no problem if i were living in</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.720" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">california i would have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.400" end="00:43:02.480" style="s2">take them to a gun store i&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:04.079" style="s2">take my friend to a gun store</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.480" end="00:43:05.760" style="s2">they would have to run the background</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.079" end="00:43:06.800" style="s2">check on the friend they&#39;d have to hold</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.760" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">the guns there for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.800" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">whatever the waiting period is before</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:12.319" style="s2">they can give them to the friend</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">and then if i ended up committed for</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.319" end="00:43:16.000" style="s2">some reason between now and the time</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.319" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">when i wanted my guns back i might be</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.000" end="00:43:21.359" style="s2">prohibited from getting the back</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:23.599" style="s2">and so all of those things would tend to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.359" end="00:43:26.720" style="s2">make it so that i as a california gun</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.599" end="00:43:30.079" style="s2">owner would just not do any of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.720" end="00:43:32.160" style="s2">right um so they they act take</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.079" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">that problem and they make it worse now</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.160" end="00:43:35.440" style="s2">does that worstness show up in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">statistics</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.440" end="00:43:40.319" style="s2">i can&#39;t say yes i don&#39;t know for sure</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know anybody studied that deeply</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.319" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">i tried to look at it a little bit and i</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.839" end="00:43:45.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:46.560" style="s2">much difference so i don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.200" end="00:43:47.440" style="s2">answer to that like i&#39;m going to put</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.560" end="00:43:50.560" style="s2">that out</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.440" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">um but intuitively it would seem to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.560" end="00:43:53.280" style="s2">that some of these things were</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">supposedly passed for people safety</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.280" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">you&#39;re making them more</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:57.440" style="s2">unsafe because they weren&#39;t totally</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:43:58.640" style="s2">thought out about the um the unintended</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.440" end="00:44:00.560" style="s2">consequences of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.640" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">so that&#39;s it it&#39;s a very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:03.520" style="s2">thing that needs to be teased out and</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:05.839" style="s2">and people we need to be honest about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.520" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">you know yeah whenever i have this</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.839" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">conversation i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:10.480" style="s2">the i always nine out of 10 times i come</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:12.800" style="s2">away thinking that i know</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.480" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">a lot less about anything than i do more</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.800" end="00:44:17.280" style="s2">like we have we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">in our own you know time come up with</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:20.400" style="s2">pretty simple</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">cl you know and confident positions</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.400" end="00:44:24.079" style="s2">about things and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:25.839" style="s2">if you actually look at how hard it is i</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.079" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">think it&#39;s okay to feel this feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.839" end="00:44:28.319" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:30.160" style="s2">oh man there&#39;s there isn&#39;t an easy</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.319" end="00:44:32.079" style="s2">solution here let&#39;s not even try to</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.160" end="00:44:34.319" style="s2">solve that one yet let&#39;s try to</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.079" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">you know let&#39;s work on the easier ones</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.319" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s okay i think because</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">you know we&#39;re not gonna this problem&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:41.599" style="s2">not gonna go away um and if we tackle</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">the hardest one first and we get it</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.599" end="00:44:45.280" style="s2">wrong because we&#39;re not good at this yet</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">then that&#39;s gonna disincentivize us from</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.280" end="00:44:47.920" style="s2">continuing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:49.440" style="s2">like oh that we tried that you came up</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:51.599" style="s2">with something stupid that didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.440" end="00:44:53.280" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to try that again so i</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.599" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">really like trying to focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.280" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">the lower hanging fruit as we develop</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">the skill</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:00.079" style="s2">before we go to another question i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.720" end="00:45:01.119" style="s2">there&#39;s something else to insert here</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.079" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">and that is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.119" end="00:45:05.920" style="s2">not everything requires a government fix</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">some things can be fixed culturally</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.920" end="00:45:10.079" style="s2">and that particularly with the suicide</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.800" end="00:45:12.720" style="s2">thing that&#39;s something that can</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.079" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">you we can make a lot of progress inside</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.720" end="00:45:16.160" style="s2">the gun community</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:17.359" style="s2">just culturally with awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.160" end="00:45:21.440" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.359" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">um and uh and i&#39;ve i mean i know if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.440" end="00:45:24.800" style="s2">working with one group that&#39;s working on</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:26.800" style="s2">that um i might end up re</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.800" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">interviewing them for recoil um and</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:32.160" style="s2">there&#39;s at least one other group</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:35.760" style="s2">um uh i think his name is dan voss and</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.160" end="00:45:36.079" style="s2">and voss and pinker got together this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.760" end="00:45:37.920" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.079" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">former head of the brady campaign</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.920" end="00:45:41.200" style="s2">abandoned the brady campaign because he</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">was so sick of the people at the brady</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.200" end="00:45:45.040" style="s2">campaign attacking gun culture instead</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:48.079" style="s2">of trying to save gun owners lives</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.040" end="00:45:48.880" style="s2">and joined up with a prior gun rights</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.079" end="00:45:50.640" style="s2">advocate</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.880" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">who is kind of a lightning rod himself</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.640" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">to come up with you know cultural</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.160" end="00:45:56.240" style="s2">solutions to the suicide problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:57.520" style="s2">and uh so that&#39;s but but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.240" end="00:46:00.160" style="s2">relatively new</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.520" end="00:46:02.560" style="s2">and so the some of the in cultural like</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.160" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">enculturation effects of trying to fix</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.560" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">that problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:08.560" style="s2">just among us on our end are in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">early stages and might</p>

<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:11.440" style="s2">of self-protection</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.800" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t own a gun um my grandfather</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">owns a bunch of guns</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:16.400" style="s2">a couple of my aunts and uncles do i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:17.359" style="s2">fired guns i&#39;ve gone to shooting ranges</p>

<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:26.640" style="s2">but i don&#39;t have one i don&#39;t plan to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.240" end="00:47:28.000" style="s2">one i think you could probably say that</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:29.839" style="s2">you know one of the things that really</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.000" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2">changed my position on this actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.839" end="00:47:36.319" style="s2">early on was to say like well what if</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:40.480" style="s2">what can i do to make you know guns</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.319" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">um less uh less proliferating everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.480" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">um i was like what if i what if there</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:46.400" style="s2">was a contract that i could sign</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">to like wave my right to guns</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.400" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">permanently</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">um and would i do that and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">was no and it made me think like okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.040" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">i want the right to have a gun i just</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:00.319" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have a gun</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">and then it sort of fit into this other</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.319" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">many other sort of positions i have</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">like yeah i don&#39;t want to do that but i</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:05.680" style="s2">don&#39;t want to remove the right to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.680" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">and especially when i start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:10.880" style="s2">about domestic violence and women</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:11.839" style="s2">in you know abusive relationships like i</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.880" end="00:48:13.359" style="s2">think that&#39;s one of the only</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.839" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">demographics of people that if they do</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.359" end="00:48:17.280" style="s2">have a gun</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">they&#39;re less likely to die and</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.280" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">like so i would never want to unevenly</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.720" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">roll this out and say like you know you</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:25.440" style="s2">know women can&#39;t have guns that would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">terrible like</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.440" end="00:48:29.359" style="s2">you know you know minorities and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:29.760" style="s2">disenfranchised people can&#39;t have guns</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.359" end="00:48:31.119" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.760" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">that would be terrible you really have</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.119" end="00:48:33.760" style="s2">to start with the people that have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">most power</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.760" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">and work your way down um which means</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:41.280" style="s2">you know but that said like i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2">one i don&#39;t plan to have one i probably</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.280" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">became a little bit more likely to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:45.839" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:47.920" style="s2">um when you know as like these federal</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.839" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">agents are coming to oakland or you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.920" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">portland</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">like but i&#39;m i&#39;m still thinking i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:55.040" style="s2">more likely to kill myself or my family</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:49:03.040" style="s2">than anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.040" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">or by having one</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.040" end="00:49:06.880" style="s2">and then the question i had for both of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.119" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">you was um</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.880" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">you know because i read the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:11.680" style="s2">again recently for the competition</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">and it was so awesome and i felt like</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.680" end="00:49:15.040" style="s2">real progress was made</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:16.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s not clear to me how that</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.040" end="00:49:19.839" style="s2">translates into</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.720" end="00:49:21.280" style="s2">you know the real world you know um and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.839" end="00:49:24.480" style="s2">i wondered what</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.280" end="00:49:26.800" style="s2">your take is uh both of you on what the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.480" end="00:49:28.640" style="s2">future of gun law actually looks like</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.800" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">in the united states if you were to kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.640" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">of put on your</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">uh predictor app</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.720" end="00:49:42.839" style="s2">do i give a try um</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">you know gracious uh well okay so first</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.839" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">i can probably take a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">sprinkles from buster&#39;s last question</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:52.240" style="s2">and and put it in and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">gun ownership changes in the past six</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.240" end="00:49:56.720" style="s2">months due to uncertainties</p>

<p begin="00:51:36.480" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">if you look at the overall numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.160" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">you follow nssf</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:44.559" style="s2">estimates of how many are new um</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:46.160" style="s2">if you were to take a random sample of</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.559" end="00:51:46.880" style="s2">20 gun owners in the united states one</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.160" end="00:51:50.400" style="s2">out of 20</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.880" end="00:51:53.440" style="s2">bought their gun this year</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.400" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">what you see in policy</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.440" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">is that generally places with a higher</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:52:02.000" style="s2">gun ownership rate</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:02.000" style="s2">have less gun laws and</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.480" end="00:52:06.720" style="s2">and sometimes you&#39;ll see uh studies</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.359" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">research studies they&#39;re like look</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.720" end="00:52:10.960" style="s2">there&#39;s less gun</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:13.440" style="s2">deaths in states that have you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.960" end="00:52:14.720" style="s2">higher gun loss but that&#39;s probably just</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.440" end="00:52:16.400" style="s2">related to the fact there&#39;s fewer gun</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.720" end="00:52:17.760" style="s2">owners</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.400" end="00:52:19.680" style="s2">so there&#39;s less people with access to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">gun or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.680" end="00:52:24.000" style="s2">their reason and and it&#39;s it&#39;s a reverse</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:26.800" style="s2">thing it&#39;s the people the</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.000" end="00:52:28.480" style="s2">states with more gun owners are more</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.800" end="00:52:31.359" style="s2">inclined to vote against</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:33.520" style="s2">gun laws right so the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.359" end="00:52:35.280" style="s2">number of gun owners is growing and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.520" end="00:52:37.280" style="s2">going to be a tremendous spike</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.280" end="00:52:39.440" style="s2">the likes of which we have never seen</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.280" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">probably in at least the last 50 or 60</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.440" end="00:52:43.839" style="s2">years on a differential basis</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.960" end="00:52:45.440" style="s2">this year is going to impa impact how</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.839" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">many gun laws get passed</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.440" end="00:52:52.880" style="s2">and um so there&#39;s that um the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:54.559" style="s2">is that you know where where gun</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.880" end="00:52:56.160" style="s2">laws go nationally it&#39;s going to depend</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.559" end="00:52:57.520" style="s2">who wins all right and we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.160" end="00:53:01.200" style="s2">who&#39;s going to win</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.520" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">um the biden has adopted</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.200" end="00:53:04.960" style="s2">a general gun control position that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:08.079" style="s2">very similar to what the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.960" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">uh um</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.079" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">the state legislature in virginia</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">adopted and a lot of those guys won</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">and they&#39;re so virginia&#39;s generally a</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:21.040" style="s2">red state flipped below this past time</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">around back during the midterms</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.040" end="00:53:25.839" style="s2">uh democratic governor and uh now they</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:27.280" style="s2">have a democratic majority in their</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.839" end="00:53:28.960" style="s2">state legislature</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.280" end="00:53:31.599" style="s2">but that democratic majority lives</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.960" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">almost entirely outside of washington dc</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.599" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">and in the richmond suburbs and around</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:36.960" style="s2">norfolk the whole rest of the state</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:40.160" style="s2">geographically is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.960" end="00:53:42.720" style="s2">red okay but there&#39;s enough population</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.160" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">in those centers where they control it</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.720" end="00:53:45.920" style="s2">they walked in and they dropped an</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:47.920" style="s2">entire uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.920" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">the their first you know legislation</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.920" end="00:53:50.640" style="s2">period they dropped a stack of</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.440" end="00:53:51.920" style="s2">gun laws that were this thick they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.640" end="00:53:53.119" style="s2">going to pass these 10 different gun</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.920" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">laws right</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.119" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">and you know they they ran on it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:54:01.440" style="s2">when they got elected</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:54:01.440" style="s2">and what happened there was that</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.599" end="00:54:05.359" style="s2">every county outside of those counties</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:06.640" style="s2">that had those</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.359" end="00:54:08.400" style="s2">democrat things they all declared</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.640" end="00:54:08.960" style="s2">themselves sanctuary counties they said</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.400" end="00:54:10.160" style="s2">we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.960" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to enforce these laws if</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.160" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">he passed them it was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:14.880" style="s2">deal and there was a lot of friction</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:16.160" style="s2">about it this whole thing was going</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.880" end="00:54:18.000" style="s2">around in january</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.160" end="00:54:20.800" style="s2">and right before they started voting on</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.000" end="00:54:23.839" style="s2">them there was a big protest in richmond</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.800" end="00:54:25.599" style="s2">where over 30 000 i think the official</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.839" end="00:54:26.880" style="s2">number was 24 but i&#39;ve talked to some</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.599" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">people who are down there and they said</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:30.559" style="s2">over 30 000 people marching peacefully</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:32.400" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.559" end="00:54:34.000" style="s2">open carrying air 15 rifles walking up</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.400" end="00:54:35.599" style="s2">and down the street right</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:36.799" style="s2">and nobody got shot they cleaned up</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.599" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">after themselves they left they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.799" end="00:54:41.359" style="s2">break anything but</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:43.280" style="s2">um you know and then when all the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.359" end="00:54:46.079" style="s2">counties went sanctuary</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.280" end="00:54:48.319" style="s2">you know a lot of the legislatures the</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.079" end="00:54:49.520" style="s2">legislators they passed some other laws</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.319" end="00:54:50.960" style="s2">but they didn&#39;t pass that assault</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.520" end="00:54:52.400" style="s2">weapons ban because they were they were</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.960" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">scared to they were like it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.400" end="00:54:55.280" style="s2">work how are we gonna enforce it</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.839" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">you know the number of people who showed</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.280" end="00:55:00.319" style="s2">up at that rally</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:01.599" style="s2">was on the order of five times the total</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.319" end="00:55:04.079" style="s2">i think it was five i have to go back</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.599" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">and look the total amount of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.079" end="00:55:09.119" style="s2">active duty national guard in virginia</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.839" end="00:55:11.119" style="s2">so how they&#39;re going to enforce that</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.119" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">stuff they can&#39;t right so</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.119" end="00:55:14.160" style="s2">if biden gets elected interest to push</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:16.160" style="s2">that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:18.559" style="s2">then you&#39;re going to see some flavor of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.160" end="00:55:22.400" style="s2">that happen at the national scale</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.559" end="00:55:25.599" style="s2">um if trump wins then</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.400" end="00:55:26.079" style="s2">um it&#39;s like well so first off before</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.599" end="00:55:27.440" style="s2">trump</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.079" end="00:55:28.880" style="s2">before the election it&#39;s likely that</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.440" end="00:55:30.720" style="s2">trump&#39;s going to rattle off a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.880" end="00:55:32.400" style="s2">executive orders that clean up some gun</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.720" end="00:55:35.520" style="s2">laws and stuff like that that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.400" end="00:55:36.960" style="s2">buying votes from gun owners um</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.520" end="00:55:39.359" style="s2">afterwards i don&#39;t think he&#39;s gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.960" end="00:55:41.599" style="s2">anything else than what&#39;s already done</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.359" end="00:55:42.880" style="s2">and i also don&#39;t think by my read on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.599" end="00:55:44.319" style="s2">current supreme court</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.880" end="00:55:46.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that they&#39;re gonna grant</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.319" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.799" end="00:55:49.839" style="s2">any of the the major gun cases that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:52.319" style="s2">brought up</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.839" end="00:55:53.119" style="s2">for the supreme court um i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.319" end="00:55:54.559" style="s2">they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.119" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">rule them even though technically</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.559" end="00:55:58.400" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of a republican majority if</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:55:59.520" style="s2">you want to call them that on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.400" end="00:56:01.920" style="s2">current supreme court</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.520" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">because i don&#39;t think they necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.920" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">have the</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:08.079" style="s2">votes to try and push any major second</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:09.359" style="s2">amendment stuff so i think if trump wins</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.079" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be about the state we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.359" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">um and i think if biden wins we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">to see some kind of national replay of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:18.960" style="s2">what happened in virginia and</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:20.880" style="s2">that&#39;s my read on it i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.960" end="00:56:24.319" style="s2">whether it&#39;s true or not but you asked</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.880" end="00:56:24.319" style="s2">me to speculate so there it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.520" end="00:56:31.440" style="s2">cool so we&#39;re approaching the hour</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.599" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to end shortly do you</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.440" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">guys have any closing thoughts before i</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">close out today&#39;s session</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:41.119" style="s2">i really like the questions in here that</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.280" end="00:56:43.680" style="s2">we didn&#39;t get to as well so i</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.119" end="00:56:45.119" style="s2">i&#39;m bummed to get those but uh i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.680" end="00:56:45.520" style="s2">always open to a conversation on a</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.119" end="00:56:46.799" style="s2">letter</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.520" end="00:56:49.200" style="s2">if you anyone talks about anyone wants</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.799" end="00:56:53.440" style="s2">to talk about it um about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.200" end="00:56:56.319" style="s2">and uh yeah it&#39;s just i see this as like</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:56:56.640" style="s2">one doorway into a complex problem which</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.319" end="00:56:59.280" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.640" end="00:57:00.880" style="s2">what i always just think of as just the</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.280" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">the inability to have conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.880" end="00:57:03.200" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:04.480" style="s2">because if we can&#39;t talk to people that</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.200" end="00:57:06.000" style="s2">we disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.480" end="00:57:07.680" style="s2">everything is going to break all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:09.839" style="s2">conversations are going to fall over</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.680" end="00:57:11.359" style="s2">um guns is a hard one but so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.839" end="00:57:13.920" style="s2">immigration so is you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.359" end="00:57:14.640" style="s2">every every other you know education and</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.920" end="00:57:15.920" style="s2">health</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.640" end="00:57:18.000" style="s2">health care and all these things have</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.920" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">the same exact problem and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.000" end="00:57:21.359" style="s2">if we expect the politicians to solve it</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">for us we&#39;re going to be waiting a long</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.359" end="00:57:25.440" style="s2">time we have to solve it for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.359" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">first so that we can then imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.440" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to have a great</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:31.119" style="s2">a good conversation and then start to</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.799" end="00:57:32.720" style="s2">expect our leaders and elected officials</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.119" end="00:57:34.319" style="s2">to actually have the skill too</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.720" end="00:57:35.920" style="s2">um and i think that&#39;s the only way</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.319" end="00:57:37.359" style="s2">forward like i don&#39;t think politicians</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.920" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">are gonna solve this regardless of who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.359" end="00:57:39.599" style="s2">elected</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.160" end="00:57:41.520" style="s2">i think they can make it worse in very</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.599" end="00:57:45.119" style="s2">different ways um</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:48.240" style="s2">and uh or do no harm which is also great</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.119" end="00:57:51.280" style="s2">don&#39;t make it worse um but yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.240" end="00:57:52.640" style="s2">i yeah that said you know i</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.280" end="00:57:54.400" style="s2">definitely have a preference for for</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.640" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">politicians and candidates that get</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:57:59.359" style="s2">elected</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:57:59.359" style="s2">for other reasons</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">i&#39;ll piggyback off that um</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.400" end="00:58:10.079" style="s2">i think there&#39;s i think there&#39;s two kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:11.760" style="s2">there well you know you can you can do</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.079" end="00:58:12.960" style="s2">binary models of everybody there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.760" end="00:58:13.839" style="s2">kinds of people right you know or</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.960" end="00:58:17.119" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.839" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">um but i think that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.119" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">um some of the frustrations that people</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.520" end="00:58:25.599" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:28.960" style="s2">now about politics are that</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.599" end="00:58:29.359" style="s2">um there&#39;s no good leaders and i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.960" end="00:58:31.200" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.359" end="00:58:32.640" style="s2">two kinds of people there&#39;s some people</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.200" end="00:58:34.319" style="s2">who are like you know they make their</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.640" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">own decisions they decide things for</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.319" end="00:58:37.599" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.960" end="00:58:39.760" style="s2">and then they don&#39;t really need a leader</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.599" end="00:58:41.200" style="s2">to tell them what to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.760" end="00:58:43.280" style="s2">but there&#39;s some people that do need a</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.200" end="00:58:47.359" style="s2">leader to tell them what to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.280" end="00:58:49.040" style="s2">um and they i think are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.359" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">are in the most turmoil</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.040" end="00:58:55.200" style="s2">right now um</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.240" end="00:58:55.680" style="s2">with the leadership that we have right</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.200" end="00:58:58.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.680" end="00:59:00.160" style="s2">i think that in order to foster these</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.319" end="00:59:01.599" style="s2">productive conversations and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.160" end="00:59:03.280" style="s2">i think one of the things we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.599" end="00:59:06.240" style="s2">is we have to look to</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.280" end="00:59:08.079" style="s2">how do we make it so that people are not</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.240" end="00:59:12.079" style="s2">so dependent on leadership to</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.079" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">do their thinking for them and</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.079" end="00:59:16.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know the answer to that question</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:19.200" style="s2">and i wish i did</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.839" end="00:59:21.359" style="s2">um because i haven&#39;t been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.200" end="00:59:24.480" style="s2">it long</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.359" end="00:59:26.000" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s hopeless and maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.480" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">need to reframe the question and</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.000" end="00:59:28.400" style="s2">come up with a different approach but</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:30.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing i&#39;ve been chewing on</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.400" end="00:59:32.799" style="s2">for the last couple of days</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.000" end="00:59:34.319" style="s2">and i you know i don&#39;t know the answer</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.799" end="00:59:37.839" style="s2">my problem is when i get into these</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.319" end="00:59:39.520" style="s2">these difficult um i get into difficult</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.839" end="00:59:39.839" style="s2">conversations and i start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.520" end="00:59:42.559" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.839" end="00:59:43.280" style="s2">you know how would we solve it and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.559" end="00:59:45.280" style="s2">know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.280" end="00:59:47.839" style="s2">buster&#39;s an optimist and i admire that</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.280" end="00:59:49.599" style="s2">and buster and i&#39;m just a pessimist</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.839" end="00:59:51.680" style="s2">and maybe we should do a whole letter</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.599" end="00:59:53.359" style="s2">thing on optimism and pessimism i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.680" end="00:59:57.119" style="s2">know but um</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.359" end="00:59:58.799" style="s2">but uh i don&#39;t you know i spend a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.119" end="01:00:00.000" style="s2">time looking for hope and i sometimes i</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.799" end="01:00:01.359" style="s2">just can&#39;t find it because every time</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:02.640" style="s2">somebody&#39;s like oh we can just do this</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.359" end="01:00:04.400" style="s2">and i&#39;m like yeah but that&#39;s not gonna</p>

<p begin="01:01:03.920" end="01:01:06.319" style="s2">next time</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.640" end="01:01:07.839" style="s2">uh it might iterate with some of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.319" end="01:01:09.200" style="s2">kind of the conversational techniques</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.839" end="01:01:10.319" style="s2">and then make it more interactive maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.200" end="01:01:11.440" style="s2">going breakout rooms</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.319" end="01:01:14.240" style="s2">and also figure out how to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.440" end="01:01:17.280" style="s2">integrate it with the letter platform</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.240" end="01:01:18.559" style="s2">um so i&#39;d love to talk to you bj buster</p>
