<p begin="00:03:15.150" end="00:03:19.590" style="s2">actually to be here because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:21.960" style="s2">watching Peter for a little bit I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.590" end="00:03:24.840" style="s2">I first came across him when the culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.960" end="00:03:27.570" style="s2">war white paper came out and I found out</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.840" end="00:03:29.220" style="s2">to be fascinating and I&#39;ve also been</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.570" end="00:03:32.880" style="s2">sort of running in some of the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.220" end="00:03:35.670" style="s2">circles as Peter by talking to Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.880" end="00:03:37.740" style="s2">and John and John Robb as he said and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.670" end="00:03:39.960" style="s2">Jim rut and I have had some some</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.740" end="00:03:42.750" style="s2">dialogues over the last couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.960" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">as well and so I&#39;m actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.750" end="00:03:46.500" style="s2">excited to be here but I - and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:49.170" style="s2">getting a little sense of nerves and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.500" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">that I think comes from one just being</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.170" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">happy to be here but - I am the extent</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">of my philosophy background in education</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:04:00.240" style="s2">is limited to like intro to political</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:02.700" style="s2">philosophy in college and then I took a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.240" end="00:04:05.160" style="s2">Marx class and then from there I just</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.700" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">trans transferred into economics so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.160" end="00:04:10.370" style="s2">not not like a philosopher by any means</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:12.870" style="s2">and there&#39;s certainly gaps in my</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.370" end="00:04:14.790" style="s2">academic understanding of the world but</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.870" end="00:04:16.890" style="s2">I would consider myself to be sort of on</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.790" end="00:04:19.769" style="s2">the in the trenches and sort of on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.890" end="00:04:23.160" style="s2">ground and and sort of discovering</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.769" end="00:04:25.050" style="s2">philosophy through practice and trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.160" end="00:04:28.350" style="s2">to learn the terms of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.050" end="00:04:30.510" style="s2">we&#39;re discovering and trying to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.350" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">fit ourselves and when I say we I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.510" end="00:04:34.860" style="s2">the the guys the men of the limo order</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:37.350" style="s2">and sort of my social media audience fit</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.860" end="00:04:37.740" style="s2">us into the world and what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.350" end="00:04:41.730" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.740" end="00:04:43.080" style="s2">a lot a lot of what we do is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.730" end="00:04:45.030" style="s2">wanna say it&#39;s reactionary because that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.080" end="00:04:47.100" style="s2">word has a lot of a lot of weight to it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.030" end="00:04:49.560" style="s2">but we&#39;re sort of adapting and just</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.100" end="00:04:51.240" style="s2">moving on the fly and then I&#39;m learning</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.560" end="00:04:53.160" style="s2">from you guys and from other people what</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.240" end="00:04:56.669" style="s2">the big words are that describe what</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.160" end="00:04:59.370" style="s2">we&#39;re doing and John John Rob especially</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.669" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">in Jordan Hall especially have been very</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.370" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">helpful in helping give me context and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:05.700" style="s2">also help give me some direction so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:07.380" style="s2">first discovered Jordan talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.700" end="00:05:08.790" style="s2">the blue church and the situational</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.380" end="00:05:13.410" style="s2">assessment I&#39;m sure many of you read</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.790" end="00:05:16.260" style="s2">back in 20 16 or 17 or so where I began</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.410" end="00:05:18.270" style="s2">to understand the legacy media the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.260" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">top-down centralized communication</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.270" end="00:05:24.570" style="s2">structures of the past the one-to-many</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:25.470" style="s2">communication and the total domination</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.570" end="00:05:27.450" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.470" end="00:05:30.330" style="s2">active control from a small cabal of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.450" end="00:05:32.250" style="s2">people who wanted to to manage us and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.330" end="00:05:33.720" style="s2">everyone else then and and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.250" end="00:05:35.210" style="s2">understanding the value that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.720" end="00:05:38.130" style="s2">brought in terms of social cohesion</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.210" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">where we all sort of believed and could</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.130" end="00:05:43.050" style="s2">believe in a story that we held in our</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:45.000" style="s2">head and and United around that imagined</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.050" end="00:05:47.940" style="s2">order that gives us a society and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.000" end="00:05:49.800" style="s2">civilization but as I you know got to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.940" end="00:05:51.060" style="s2">know Jordan better and got to understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.800" end="00:05:52.680" style="s2">the material better and got to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.060" end="00:05:54.150" style="s2">understand where we were in the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.680" end="00:05:57.030" style="s2">you know I&#39;m understanding that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.150" end="00:05:59.130" style="s2">now talking many-to-many and the</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.130" end="00:06:06.150" style="s2">flow has been disrupted in a major way</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.460" end="00:06:20.040" style="s2">inspirational and motivational for me</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.669" end="00:06:22.710" style="s2">because it did reveal gaps and it does</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.040" end="00:06:25.430" style="s2">reveal sort of the problems and things</p>

<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:41.030" style="s2">deepest and darkest corners of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.730" end="00:06:44.310" style="s2">internet over time starting in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.030" end="00:06:47.250" style="s2">2005-2010 range and it was just it was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.310" end="00:06:50.280" style="s2">response to radical feminism and some</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.250" end="00:06:52.200" style="s2">crazy super out there ideas that people</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.280" end="00:06:55.110" style="s2">found to be oppressive and it was just a</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.200" end="00:06:57.900" style="s2">way for people to link up network share</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.110" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">notes and information and develop a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.900" end="00:07:04.100" style="s2">cohesion in a story for themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:07.669" style="s2">and even just on the ground tactical</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.100" end="00:07:10.830" style="s2">ways to improve their lives and and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.669" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">evolved over time and there were other</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.830" end="00:07:15.419" style="s2">movements sort of like a gamergate which</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:17.340" style="s2">is another decentralized political</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.419" end="00:07:19.590" style="s2">movement that happened I&#39;m sure some of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.340" end="00:07:21.330" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with that and then also</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.590" end="00:07:22.710" style="s2">the canceled culture which is not my</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.330" end="00:07:25.350" style="s2">friend it&#39;s not something I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.710" end="00:07:28.169" style="s2">in but that is a also another form of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.350" end="00:07:30.220" style="s2">decentralized effort where people will</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.169" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">congregate around</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.220" end="00:07:35.230" style="s2">common goal which in my case was like</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:37.690" style="s2">getting myself getting me doxed and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.230" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">fired from my whole job and it happens</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.690" end="00:07:41.230" style="s2">to other people in certain other ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:44.740" style="s2">and then those networks sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.230" end="00:07:47.260" style="s2">dissipate after that so I&#39;m living I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.740" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">product of I&#39;m learning about and sort</p>

<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">time this affective decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.610" end="00:07:56.890" style="s2">information networks in decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:58.690" style="s2">political movements and the talk of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.890" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">we what we want to talk about today is</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.690" end="00:08:05.260" style="s2">this disturb info militia and I actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:07.090" style="s2">just sort of first started writing about</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.260" end="00:08:08.860" style="s2">that a couple of weeks ago it just kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.090" end="00:08:12.550" style="s2">of came out in conversation and it had a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.860" end="00:08:14.860" style="s2">really nice ring to it and it really</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.550" end="00:08:19.180" style="s2">summarized what we&#39;re doing in the lemon</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.860" end="00:08:22.540" style="s2">order which is itself a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.180" end="00:08:27.370" style="s2">sense making apparatus and during this</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.540" end="00:08:29.320" style="s2">time of Corona and kovat we have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.370" end="00:08:32.169" style="s2">proven the thesis of little order which</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.320" end="00:08:34.390" style="s2">is that we need to have our own sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.169" end="00:08:36.610" style="s2">making apparatus our own ability to</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.390" end="00:08:40.210" style="s2">discern what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.610" end="00:08:41.710" style="s2">and then to carry Jordans personal</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.210" end="00:08:43.089" style="s2">sovereignty notions further you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.710" end="00:08:45.910" style="s2">then then we want to take that</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.089" end="00:08:48.339" style="s2">information and then we want to embody</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.910" end="00:08:50.410" style="s2">it in what we&#39;re doing we want to embody</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.339" end="00:08:52.690" style="s2">these ideals and we want to build the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.410" end="00:08:54.850" style="s2">integrity and the strength that we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.690" end="00:08:59.950" style="s2">in order to embody those ideals and to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.850" end="00:09:01.990" style="s2">sort of move forward and what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.950" end="00:09:04.150" style="s2">discovered it using this word info</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.990" end="00:09:06.040" style="s2">militias which was sort of offhand but</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.150" end="00:09:08.650" style="s2">now have sort of gone back to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.040" end="00:09:10.900" style="s2">look at the definitions behind info and</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.650" end="00:09:12.790" style="s2">militias and to try to put it into a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.900" end="00:09:15.130" style="s2">framework I think we all know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.790" end="00:09:17.770" style="s2">information is but a militia in</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.130" end="00:09:20.170" style="s2">particular the definition of militia is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.770" end="00:09:22.690" style="s2">a military force that is raised from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.170" end="00:09:27.190" style="s2">civil population to supplement a regular</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.690" end="00:09:29.980" style="s2">army in an emergency and so it got me</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.190" end="00:09:33.880" style="s2">thinking we&#39;re clearly in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.980" end="00:09:36.400" style="s2">crisis in a number of different ways the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.880" end="00:09:39.190" style="s2">first one just obvious right now is</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.400" end="00:09:41.920" style="s2">Corona and Cohen covert right</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.190" end="00:09:45.009" style="s2">but larger than that we have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.920" end="00:09:48.430" style="s2">making crisis we have a narrative crisis</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.009" end="00:09:51.250" style="s2">we have a social cohesion crisis we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.430" end="00:09:52.600" style="s2">community crisis we have a number we</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.250" end="00:09:55.389" style="s2">have a loss of with the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.600" end="00:09:57.550" style="s2">confidence and the may be the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.389" end="00:09:59.470" style="s2">powerful crisis we&#39;re facing is a sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.550" end="00:10:02.170" style="s2">of overwhelming complexity in the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.470" end="00:10:06.250" style="s2">so there is an emergency a state of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.170" end="00:10:09.130" style="s2">emergency out there that it requires the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.250" end="00:10:13.930" style="s2">raising of a private army to both make</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.130" end="00:10:16.209" style="s2">sense of and then to not only endure but</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.930" end="00:10:18.759" style="s2">to thrive in this environment and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.209" end="00:10:21.940" style="s2">is the fundamental notion behind the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.759" end="00:10:23.949" style="s2">liminal order is that we&#39;re living in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.940" end="00:10:27.220" style="s2">crisis and we have to do things on our</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.949" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">own and so what we&#39;ve seen during Corona</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.220" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">which I think has been for all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:34.509" style="s2">negatives obviously there&#39;s too many to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:37.810" style="s2">list there have been some positives and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.509" end="00:10:39.610" style="s2">one of the positives is seeing how the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.810" end="00:10:42.819" style="s2">decentralized informations are</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.610" end="00:10:46.240" style="s2">sense-making apparatus worldwide has</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.819" end="00:10:48.010" style="s2">really stepped up I think and and there</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:51.250" style="s2">are a number of different nodes out</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.010" end="00:10:54.250" style="s2">there where people are able to do the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.250" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">research do the analysis clear signal</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.250" end="00:10:59.980" style="s2">from noise and come to a cohesive</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:02.500" style="s2">understanding of either what the virus</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.980" end="00:11:04.360" style="s2">is or what the government is going to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.500" end="00:11:06.190" style="s2">that&#39;s been my main focus I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.360" end="00:11:08.110" style="s2">know anything about viruses but I do</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.190" end="00:11:09.730" style="s2">can&#39;t predict what the government is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.110" end="00:11:13.000" style="s2">going to do and so in the liminal order</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.730" end="00:11:15.339" style="s2">for example we were in mid-february</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.000" end="00:11:17.290" style="s2">we were already at a state of emergency</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.339" end="00:11:19.240" style="s2">within the liminal order we had</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.290" end="00:11:21.939" style="s2">recommended to all of our people that</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.240" end="00:11:25.689" style="s2">they start stockpiling masks they you</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.939" end="00:11:27.130" style="s2">know hydrochloric wean vitamin C you</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.689" end="00:11:29.500" style="s2">know a million different things we were</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.130" end="00:11:31.329" style="s2">really prepared because we are dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.500" end="00:11:32.860" style="s2">to actually making sense of what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.329" end="00:11:35.439" style="s2">on out there in the world because we</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.860" end="00:11:38.139" style="s2">realized that there is crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.439" end="00:11:40.300" style="s2">complexity crisis of leadership you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.139" end="00:11:42.430" style="s2">continuing on from 2008-2009 financial</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.300" end="00:11:44.410" style="s2">crisis you know the corruption and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.430" end="00:11:45.930" style="s2">academia etc etc all those things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.410" end="00:11:47.910" style="s2">you guys know about</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.930" end="00:11:50.220" style="s2">so we knew that we had to be proactive</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.910" end="00:11:52.790" style="s2">about going out and finding the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.220" end="00:11:55.980" style="s2">information that we needed in order to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.790" end="00:11:58.380" style="s2">survive basically this became an issue</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.980" end="00:12:00.089" style="s2">you know obviously not millions people</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.380" end="00:12:02.279" style="s2">are dying but you know it seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.089" end="00:12:04.260" style="s2">and it is for many people matter of life</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.279" end="00:12:06.089" style="s2">or death and the information that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.260" end="00:12:08.550" style="s2">getting from CDC and from the World</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.089" end="00:12:11.060" style="s2">Health Organization and from you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.550" end="00:12:13.740" style="s2">the administration and from corporations</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.060" end="00:12:17.370" style="s2">not helpful not helpful enough by any</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.740" end="00:12:19.830" style="s2">means and so the liminal order is a has</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.370" end="00:12:23.580" style="s2">proven the thesis that there&#39;s a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.830" end="00:12:26.339" style="s2">is a crisis of information and that in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.580" end="00:12:29.459" style="s2">time of crisis - in order to supplement</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.339" end="00:12:32.670" style="s2">the regular forces these militias need</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.459" end="00:12:34.709" style="s2">to arise and they have arisen and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.670" end="00:12:37.529" style="s2">have risen and the limit order is just</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.709" end="00:12:41.100" style="s2">bought one of these info militias that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.529" end="00:12:43.290" style="s2">have risen up to fill the gap to make to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.100" end="00:12:45.420" style="s2">cover up for complexity it&#39;s make sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.290" end="00:12:46.980" style="s2">and in our case we really are trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.420" end="00:12:49.350" style="s2">then to carry it even a few steps</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.980" end="00:12:53.220" style="s2">further and then go into the both</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.350" end="00:12:55.350" style="s2">embodiment and integrity and choice of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.220" end="00:12:57.170" style="s2">how to live our lives and to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.350" end="00:12:59.730" style="s2">represent the ideals that we have so</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.170" end="00:13:01.500" style="s2">that was the the main thrust of why</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.730" end="00:13:04.410" style="s2">Peter reached out to me was to talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.500" end="00:13:06.900" style="s2">about the info militia term the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.410" end="00:13:10.050" style="s2">theme that I wanted that that sort of is</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.900" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">overarching all of this is is the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.050" end="00:13:15.570" style="s2">fact that we&#39;re at the end of the era of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:18.450" style="s2">indiscriminate connection right so</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.570" end="00:13:20.450" style="s2">through internet social media World</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.800" end="00:13:37.050" style="s2">reach and expansion was sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.550" end="00:13:38.130" style="s2">number-one goal and there was you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.050" end="00:13:41.760" style="s2">I&#39;m calling it indiscriminate</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.130" end="00:13:43.980" style="s2">connections and now we&#39;re seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.760" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">that era is over and that we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.980" end="00:13:49.860" style="s2">moving into an age of strategic</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:51.870" style="s2">disconnection so all the value of just</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.860" end="00:13:54.150" style="s2">running out and connecting with people</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.870" end="00:13:57.180" style="s2">all over the world has been wrung out I</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.150" end="00:13:58.960" style="s2">believe and now the next phase the next</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.180" end="00:14:00.850" style="s2">leg up of value is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.960" end="00:14:05.020" style="s2">and actually making strategic decisions</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.850" end="00:14:06.820" style="s2">of disconnection and again liminal order</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.020" end="00:14:09.730" style="s2">is embodying that we&#39;re living that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.820" end="00:14:11.980" style="s2">we&#39;ve decided to step back away from</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.730" end="00:14:13.720" style="s2">social media and the random connections</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.980" end="00:14:16.780" style="s2">that can be made that way and to focus</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.720" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">our energy and relationship building and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.780" end="00:14:21.700" style="s2">networking within a high trust high</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:24.580" style="s2">value Private Network that&#39;s got high</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.700" end="00:14:27.790" style="s2">security and is committed to the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.580" end="00:14:30.840" style="s2">goals so all this is in the same theme</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.790" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">the end of like this the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.840" end="00:14:37.000" style="s2">expanding era is over and we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:39.370" style="s2">now towards strategic disconnection and</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.000" end="00:14:41.620" style="s2">as by way of example we saw Japan just</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.370" end="00:14:43.480" style="s2">recently announced that they are</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.620" end="00:14:45.820" style="s2">spending like two billion dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.480" end="00:14:47.740" style="s2">figure out how to get businesses and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.820" end="00:14:50.590" style="s2">factories out of China and back into</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.740" end="00:14:52.780" style="s2">into Japan so this is a process that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.590" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">just beginning sort of like an unwinding</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.780" end="00:14:59.080" style="s2">of the great expansion era of the last</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:15:00.970" style="s2">20 30 40 years and the the smart money</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.080" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">is figuring out ways to strategically</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.970" end="00:15:07.050" style="s2">disconnect and to create a higher trust</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:10.120" style="s2">higher value network and that&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.050" end="00:15:13.930" style="s2">trade government political networks</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.120" end="00:15:17.260" style="s2">social media military alliances even</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.930" end="00:15:20.680" style="s2">social distancing right and our regular</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.260" end="00:15:23.350" style="s2">day to day relationships so those are</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.680" end="00:15:25.360" style="s2">the general themes that Peter wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.350" end="00:15:27.760" style="s2">talk about and you know I can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.360" end="00:15:29.620" style="s2">any one of those dig down for four hours</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.760" end="00:15:31.900" style="s2">on any one of those subjects there but I</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.620" end="00:15:33.910" style="s2">just want to throw that out there and</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.900" end="00:15:35.890" style="s2">sort of get the discussion started and</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.460" end="00:15:44.350" style="s2">have a good discussion coming up after</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.400" end="00:16:01.180" style="s2">eventually call on you to mute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.410" end="00:16:03.490" style="s2">if you want me to read it on your behalf</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.180" end="00:16:04.900" style="s2">just indicate that I&#39;m gonna use my</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.490" end="00:16:06.490" style="s2">discernment what questions Theresa they</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.900" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">might not be read in order and we might</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.490" end="00:16:12.529" style="s2">not get to all the questions okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:16.100" style="s2">first one just sort like a practical</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.529" end="00:16:17.420" style="s2">um question and and I understand if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.100" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">don&#39;t want to answer all of these due to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.420" end="00:16:21.290" style="s2">secrecy or whatever but like how did the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:23.449" style="s2">liminal order start like how many</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.290" end="00:16:25.670" style="s2">members like how do you like organize</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.449" end="00:16:26.509" style="s2">like this like real brass tacks of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.670" end="00:16:29.329" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.509" end="00:16:31.610" style="s2">so we are just over 200 active members</p>

<p begin="00:16:45.889" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">general theme is this is an answer to</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.870" end="00:16:51.319" style="s2">the culture war we don&#39;t want to fight</p>

<p begin="00:18:18.690" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">we will have other multiple channels of</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:30.630" style="s2">and and this is a partly a genesis of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.720" end="00:18:33.000" style="s2">working with Jordan is that we wanted to</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.310" end="00:18:49.380" style="s2">so we work on meditation we work on</p>

<p begin="00:19:26.270" end="00:19:32.940" style="s2">starting by improving ourselves then our</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.060" end="00:19:35.310" style="s2">family then our community and if you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.940" end="00:19:37.050" style="s2">get that far then maybe you can have</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.310" end="00:19:39.360" style="s2">some impact on the nation or on the</p>

<p begin="00:19:39.360" end="00:19:44.670" style="s2">general gist and we have a waiting list</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.390" end="00:19:47.640" style="s2">of 1,500 people and we&#39;ve got the doors</p>

<p begin="00:19:53.490" end="00:20:00.570" style="s2">capacity to take them on and so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.810" end="00:20:02.490" style="s2">coming up it&#39;s interesting so as you</p>

<p begin="00:21:41.880" end="00:21:45.789" style="s2">the reason the manosphere existed in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.260" end="00:21:48.690" style="s2">first place is because of the crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.789" end="00:21:52.179" style="s2">masculinity and attack on masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.690" end="00:21:54.250" style="s2">there is an ongoing decades-long war on</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.179" end="00:21:55.870" style="s2">masculinity and if someone wants to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.250" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">into the details and the numbers I can</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.870" end="00:22:01.659" style="s2">share those with you there has been an</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.960" end="00:22:02.860" style="s2">ongoing feminization of science and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.659" end="00:22:04.899" style="s2">economy there has been ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.860" end="00:22:07.390" style="s2">de-risking of the economy and of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.899" end="00:22:09.700" style="s2">politics and all these things are tied</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.390" end="00:22:11.470" style="s2">together I discovered that that which</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.700" end="00:22:13.539" style="s2">upsets the bedroom in our personal</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.470" end="00:22:15.070" style="s2">relationships is also the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.539" end="00:22:17.140" style="s2">that&#39;s disrupting our economy and our</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.070" end="00:22:20.289" style="s2">politics and they&#39;re all tied together</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.140" end="00:22:22.510" style="s2">and one of the answers and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.289" end="00:22:25.570" style="s2">answers for me and for a lot of my guys</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.510" end="00:22:28.240" style="s2">is to focus on developing a new sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.570" end="00:22:30.640" style="s2">positive masculinity and using that as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.240" end="00:22:31.990" style="s2">foundation to improve ourselves our</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.640" end="00:22:33.730" style="s2">family our community and the nation</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.990" end="00:22:37.270" style="s2">they&#39;re all tied together they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.730" end="00:22:39.490" style="s2">tied together and because of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.270" end="00:22:41.710" style="s2">wild to me that the the answers that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.490" end="00:22:44.370" style="s2">came up with 10 12 15 years ago which by</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.710" end="00:22:47.430" style="s2">the way are not new right these are</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.370" end="00:22:49.590" style="s2">like old-time stuff ancient wisdom but</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.430" end="00:22:51.780" style="s2">that has been lost right and it needed</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.590" end="00:22:53.130" style="s2">to be refined Andrea dressed for today</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.780" end="00:22:56.370" style="s2">and put into terms that we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.130" end="00:22:58.290" style="s2">understand the answers to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.370" end="00:23:00.180" style="s2">crisis of masculinity are also some of</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.290" end="00:23:02.700" style="s2">the answers to solve the crisis in our</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.180" end="00:23:05.070" style="s2">political sphere today so it&#39;s to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.700" end="00:23:07.020" style="s2">it&#39;s all linked and it&#39;s all been part</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.070" end="00:23:08.640" style="s2">of one journey for me I started pulling</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.020" end="00:23:11.400" style="s2">the thread for me this all started when</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.640" end="00:23:14.280" style="s2">I got divorced in 2009 I started pulling</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.400" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">the thread and I&#39;ve been pulling the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.280" end="00:23:19.050" style="s2">same thread and has led me to this</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:21.330" style="s2">conversation right here so to me I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.050" end="00:23:28.710" style="s2">it&#39;s no great leap it&#39;s all it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.330" end="00:23:31.260" style="s2">perfectly connected hmm yeah question</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.710" end="00:23:34.350" style="s2">you know it was good yeah the question</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.260" end="00:23:36.510" style="s2">that&#39;s coming up is sort of like I</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.350" end="00:23:40.170" style="s2">imagine putting myself in your shoes</p>

<p begin="00:23:40.170" end="00:23:44.550" style="s2">of like the you know losing your job and</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.910" end="00:23:46.350" style="s2">all the type of stuff there do there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.550" end="00:23:48.300" style="s2">like a felt sense resentment would</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.350" end="00:23:50.280" style="s2">emerge like any anger like a fuck you</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.300" end="00:23:53.309" style="s2">anger towards the blue church or whoever</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.280" end="00:23:55.620" style="s2">kind of like that construct would place</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.309" end="00:23:57.870" style="s2">and put in this place so I&#39;m curious how</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.620" end="00:23:59.550" style="s2">that you dealt with that energy may be</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.870" end="00:24:02.490" style="s2">transmuted it and how it&#39;s currently</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.550" end="00:24:06.179" style="s2">present that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.490" end="00:24:08.490" style="s2">that&#39;s a great question so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.179" end="00:24:10.200" style="s2">multiple layers to that yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.490" end="00:24:12.870" style="s2">definitely fuck you energy which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.200" end="00:24:14.730" style="s2">about not losing like I can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.870" end="00:24:17.340" style="s2">defeated that&#39;s part of it right like</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.730" end="00:24:19.050" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna let an Tifa like</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.340" end="00:24:21.420" style="s2">legitimately antifa there&#39;s not like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.050" end="00:24:24.809" style="s2">it&#39;s not like me guessing right it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.420" end="00:24:28.170" style="s2">like the actual flag on her banner</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.809" end="00:24:30.120" style="s2">Twitter header leader of DC and Tifa</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.580" end="00:24:40.470" style="s2">through the mud there definitely a sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.160" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">of I can&#39;t I can&#39;t be defeated I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.470" end="00:24:44.010" style="s2">gonna let them win so that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:46.050" style="s2">element and I&#39;ve been able to transmute</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.010" end="00:24:47.070" style="s2">as you say that energy into just trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.050" end="00:24:50.850" style="s2">to be proactive</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.070" end="00:24:53.190" style="s2">the second thing is that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.850" end="00:24:55.470" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna solve the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.190" end="00:24:58.860" style="s2">issues or political issues at least I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.470" end="00:25:01.170" style="s2">not by like writing papers and and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.860" end="00:25:03.150" style="s2">know trying to lobby Congress right this</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.170" end="00:25:07.050" style="s2">is this is a top this is a bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.150" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">solution and so I wanted to my response</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.050" end="00:25:10.800" style="s2">to this and and channeling my anger and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:13.260" style="s2">direction into something productive is</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.800" end="00:25:16.230" style="s2">to is to get out of that all that and to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.260" end="00:25:18.810" style="s2">go deep in private and secure in a high</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.230" end="00:25:20.610" style="s2">trust so we can build communities to</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.810" end="00:25:25.740" style="s2">have roots and they have actual impact</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.610" end="00:25:27.780" style="s2">and there&#39;s definitely a sense of anger</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.740" end="00:25:31.020" style="s2">but it has dissipated you know that was</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.780" end="00:25:33.240" style="s2">I got docs in January 2018</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.020" end="00:25:35.040" style="s2">I&#39;ll admit that the 12 months following</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.240" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">that were really tough you know imagine</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.040" end="00:25:39.510" style="s2">you&#39;re 43 years old and your whole</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:04.860" style="s2">because I see us in doing something very</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:25.890" style="s2">good for good for the country good for</p>

<p begin="00:26:25.890" end="00:26:31.800" style="s2">with it that that spite they might think</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.270" end="00:26:34.200" style="s2">and and I do appreciate that question</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.800" end="00:26:36.650" style="s2">because it&#39;s good for me to consider my</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.200" end="00:26:39.780" style="s2">motivations at the same time so thanks</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.650" end="00:26:41.490" style="s2">so I&#39;ll hand it over to the Q&amp;A in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.780" end="00:26:45.150" style="s2">moment but another question is coming up</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.490" end="00:26:47.040" style="s2">I saw this tweet quite liked and it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.150" end="00:26:50.610" style="s2">word it was pithy is like the virus</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.040" end="00:26:52.200" style="s2">broke woke and I&#39;m curious what you</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.610" end="00:26:53.790" style="s2">think about that if the whole kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.200" end="00:26:57.120" style="s2">the social justice warrior you know the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.790" end="00:26:58.620" style="s2">meta tribe what is their power dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.120" end="00:27:00.110" style="s2">what&#39;s the power dynamics like in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.620" end="00:27:02.240" style="s2">liminal space that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.110" end="00:27:04.850" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good question I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.240" end="00:27:06.169" style="s2">right now it&#39;s only been a couple you</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.850" end="00:27:08.659" style="s2">know it&#39;s only been what a month or so a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.169" end="00:27:10.279" style="s2">bit really being in the news so it the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.659" end="00:27:13.429" style="s2">most definitive thing we can say that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.279" end="00:27:17.870" style="s2">put a pause on it right like I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.429" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">the the traffic in those areas and those</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.870" end="00:27:22.669" style="s2">words and those those battles has slowed</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:24.919" style="s2">but then again everything else is paused</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.669" end="00:27:27.470" style="s2">- right so it&#39;s gonna be hard to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.919" end="00:27:29.630" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m hopeful that the virus broke</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.470" end="00:27:31.909" style="s2">the woke maybe I&#39;m hopeful about that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.630" end="00:27:33.139" style="s2">has I think for a lot of us hoping you</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.909" end="00:27:35.720" style="s2">know put us in a situation of</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.139" end="00:27:37.669" style="s2">prioritizing what is important what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.720" end="00:27:41.029" style="s2">valuable where should we be spending our</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.669" end="00:27:43.870" style="s2">attention but I do suspect unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.029" end="00:27:47.090" style="s2">that because of the pervasiveness of</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.870" end="00:27:48.200" style="s2">woke thinking and academia critical Siri</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.090" end="00:27:50.620" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.200" end="00:27:53.840" style="s2">social justice warriors everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.620" end="00:27:57.080" style="s2">corporations media you know it HR</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.840" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">everywhere you know my before the virus</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.080" end="00:28:01.940" style="s2">my thought was it was gonna take decades</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:05.090" style="s2">even to work that stuff out of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.940" end="00:28:06.649" style="s2">system so to the extent that this may</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.090" end="00:28:11.690" style="s2">accelerate things a little bit I would</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.649" end="00:28:14.630" style="s2">I&#39;ll be hopeful but you know once we get</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.690" end="00:28:16.340" style="s2">back to some semblance of normal even if</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.630" end="00:28:18.470" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look like it did you know two</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.340" end="00:28:19.880" style="s2">months ago I have a feeling that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.470" end="00:28:21.139" style="s2">of that stuff is gonna come back and how</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.880" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing some of it in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.139" end="00:28:25.940" style="s2">people are calling them the virus racist</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:28.070" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s how a virus can be racist it</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.940" end="00:28:29.630" style="s2">can impact people differently but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.070" end="00:28:33.110" style="s2">not like it&#39;s choosing to do so but</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.630" end="00:28:35.929" style="s2">anyway I do I do have hope for that but</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.110" end="00:28:38.000" style="s2">at the same time you know that woke shit</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.929" end="00:28:41.240" style="s2">is really embedded in our culture right</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.000" end="00:28:43.399" style="s2">now cool so I&#39;m gonna hand it over to QA</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.240" end="00:28:46.970" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s prudent for me to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.399" end="00:28:49.429" style="s2">this so I think it&#39;s safe to say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.970" end="00:28:53.720" style="s2">my most controversial I guess so far the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.429" end="00:28:55.220" style="s2">vast OA I imagine because I&#39;m using I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.720" end="00:28:57.950" style="s2">viewing this dough as a digital campfire</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.220" end="00:28:59.659" style="s2">for anyone to come and we might have you</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.950" end="00:29:02.120" style="s2">know intersectional feminist coming to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.659" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">speak here we have all sorts of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.120" end="00:29:06.200" style="s2">nomadic tribes coming here and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:08.090" style="s2">welcoming them as long as they respect</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.200" end="00:29:09.080" style="s2">kind of the space and the fire that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.090" end="00:29:11.750" style="s2">burning</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.080" end="00:29:14.029" style="s2">but I&#39;m thinking just being prudent</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.750" end="00:29:15.799" style="s2">right now so if someone&#39;s triggered</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.029" end="00:29:16.999" style="s2">they&#39;re emotionally sensitive in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.799" end="00:29:18.710" style="s2">audience about something that was said</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.999" end="00:29:21.590" style="s2">you can feel free to ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.710" end="00:29:23.149" style="s2">Jacqueline loves being challenged but no</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.590" end="00:29:24.919" style="s2">more than one follow up question I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.149" end="00:29:26.809" style="s2">just gonna cut it off at that justice up</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.919" end="00:29:27.889" style="s2">that kind of framing parameter because</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.809" end="00:29:29.239" style="s2">it&#39;s not just going to be some messy</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.889" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">debate it&#39;s gonna form or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.239" end="00:29:38.049" style="s2">that so with that preface Daniel his</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:40.369" style="s2">engine could you unmute yourself yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.049" end="00:29:44.299" style="s2">first of all Jack thank you so much for</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.369" end="00:29:46.369" style="s2">sharing I&#39;m not I&#39;m feeling like that</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.299" end="00:29:47.899" style="s2">you have like this earnest like</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.369" end="00:29:50.809" style="s2">groundedness in the way that you speak</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.899" end="00:29:52.249" style="s2">that you&#39;re genuinely trying to say what</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.809" end="00:29:53.539" style="s2">you believe to be true and I really</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.249" end="00:29:55.159" style="s2">appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.539" end="00:29:56.690" style="s2">this question I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.159" end="00:29:58.519" style="s2">actually the right person for me to ask</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.690" end="00:30:01.399" style="s2">it to so feel free to this sidestep it</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.519" end="00:30:02.839" style="s2">but it emerged as you were talking I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.399" end="00:30:05.210" style="s2">wondering if you have any insights on</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.839" end="00:30:06.859" style="s2">the role of the positive feminine I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.210" end="00:30:08.659" style="s2">heard Jordan Hall allude to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.859" end="00:30:10.639" style="s2">particular importance of the feminine to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.659" end="00:30:13.159" style="s2">rise up in response to the meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.639" end="00:30:15.080" style="s2">and I&#39;m partial to your diagnosis that</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.159" end="00:30:16.609" style="s2">there has been some sort of attack on</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.080" end="00:30:18.589" style="s2">masculinity I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d use</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.609" end="00:30:20.359" style="s2">those words in particular but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.589" end="00:30:21.739" style="s2">something resonant about that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.359" end="00:30:22.969" style="s2">another way to praise it that you might</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.739" end="00:30:24.950" style="s2">be able to respond to is where do you</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.969" end="00:30:29.089" style="s2">see the limits of the positive masculine</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.950" end="00:30:32.330" style="s2">in the current crisis yeah that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.089" end="00:30:34.039" style="s2">good question in you know perhaps Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.330" end="00:30:35.659" style="s2">Peterson might be better to feel this</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.039" end="00:30:37.609" style="s2">one I know that they you know is very</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.659" end="00:30:40.219" style="s2">into the notion of the Great Mother and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.609" end="00:30:42.499" style="s2">like all things so you know masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.219" end="00:30:44.029" style="s2">can exist without femininity it&#39;s yin</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.499" end="00:30:46.940" style="s2">and yang and I think you need equal</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.029" end="00:30:51.679" style="s2">parts the words Berrien singh right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.940" end="00:30:53.599" style="s2">is like any disequilibrium and and i</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.679" end="00:30:56.059" style="s2">would even argue that there is also a</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.599" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">crisis of femininity as well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.059" end="00:31:01.639" style="s2">there&#39;s been a great just general</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:04.999" style="s2">neutering of gender expression or the</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.639" end="00:31:07.700" style="s2">archetypical experiences of who we are</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.999" end="00:31:09.559" style="s2">based on our biology and our experiences</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.700" end="00:31:12.349" style="s2">and in my book I really explore a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.559" end="00:31:14.869" style="s2">these questions about determinism versus</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.349" end="00:31:16.879" style="s2">blank slate and what how essential is</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.869" end="00:31:18.589" style="s2">our biology to our behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.879" end="00:31:21.649" style="s2">therefore into our society and our</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.589" end="00:31:23.929" style="s2">structures and you know I wouldn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.649" end="00:31:25.999" style="s2">would never say that we don&#39;t need from</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.929" end="00:31:27.410" style="s2">an in fact we need it we need it just as</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.999" end="00:31:29.750" style="s2">much as we need</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.410" end="00:31:33.140" style="s2">of masculinity we need we need as</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.750" end="00:31:35.540" style="s2">champions for both and I feel like what</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.140" end="00:31:39.050" style="s2">happened over the last 20 30 40 years is</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.540" end="00:31:44.090" style="s2">that there has become no no champion for</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.050" end="00:31:46.300" style="s2">either the the sense of a traditional</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.090" end="00:31:49.280" style="s2">and you can define this however you want</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.300" end="00:31:52.580" style="s2">femininity was sort of cast aside for a</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.280" end="00:31:54.830" style="s2">champion of a male ideal but then at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.580" end="00:31:57.400" style="s2">same time for men that male ideal was</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.830" end="00:32:01.220" style="s2">diminished and and pushed aside and</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.400" end="00:32:04.190" style="s2">devalued so in fact we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got both</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.220" end="00:32:07.070" style="s2">pushing the wrong and up and pushing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.190" end="00:32:09.800" style="s2">right down at the same time and we need</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.070" end="00:32:12.970" style="s2">to sort of reimburse at as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.800" end="00:32:15.350" style="s2">and and I don&#39;t ever put a value on</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.970" end="00:32:18.800" style="s2">either one as being higher or lower</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.350" end="00:32:21.560" style="s2">they&#39;re essential repairs were designed</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.800" end="00:32:25.010" style="s2">to be complementary not to compete with</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.560" end="00:32:29.110" style="s2">each other and I would just like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.010" end="00:32:32.350" style="s2">little bit more honesty about that right</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.110" end="00:32:37.520" style="s2">an honesty and embracing our differences</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.350" end="00:32:39.290" style="s2">you know like as the name escaping made</p>

<p begin="00:39:41.960" end="00:39:46.670" style="s2">team and then together you can figure</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.359" end="00:39:47.990" style="s2">out how to navigate so one of the one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.670" end="00:39:50.869" style="s2">the issues and I wrote down the wrote</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.990" end="00:39:53.390" style="s2">this down it and get to it was Oh de</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.869" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">dooda dooda so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.390" end="00:39:59.059" style="s2">basically our philosophy is our the OODA</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:40:00.920" style="s2">loop is a way of orienting to the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.059" end="00:40:04.430" style="s2">and then changing and then adapting</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.920" end="00:40:06.849" style="s2">right and our goal is to create a system</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.430" end="00:40:10.069" style="s2">where the goal isn&#39;t an outcome a</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.849" end="00:40:11.720" style="s2">specific outcome but rather designing</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.069" end="00:40:12.110" style="s2">for emergence this is with title one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.720" end="00:40:14.900" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.110" end="00:40:16.910" style="s2">chess was and designing a system where</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.900" end="00:40:18.980" style="s2">we iterate faster than anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.910" end="00:40:20.750" style="s2">that&#39;s the goal that&#39;s that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.980" end="00:40:23.510" style="s2">thing that we can do right now is figure</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.750" end="00:40:25.130" style="s2">out how to iterate faster so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.510" end="00:40:26.810" style="s2">adapt to the changing environments and</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.130" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">the changing information flow and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.810" end="00:40:30.230" style="s2">figure out what to do I have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">what it&#39;s going to be like so in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.230" end="00:40:34.910" style="s2">meantime I&#39;m just gonna tune up my</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.240" end="00:40:37.490" style="s2">instrument at best I can and to build a</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.910" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">system that provides answers at the time</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.490" end="00:40:42.050" style="s2">that the answers reveal themselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:52.280" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.050" end="00:40:54.950" style="s2">okay Tyson hey I&#39;m curious about some of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.280" end="00:40:57.110" style="s2">the main challenges or obstacles have</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.950" end="00:41:00.530" style="s2">kept you from growing beyond 200 and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.110" end="00:41:02.660" style="s2">liminal order so far and like to what</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.530" end="00:41:04.880" style="s2">extent it might you feel that it could</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.660" end="00:41:06.980" style="s2">be optimal so I&#39;ll keep it to a limited</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:09.290" style="s2">quantity like Dunbar&#39;s number for</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.980" end="00:41:12.440" style="s2">example and people you can have proper</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.290" end="00:41:15.950" style="s2">clearance and then maybe just add on to</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.440" end="00:41:18.680" style="s2">that like in the early stages like when</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.950" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">you were before well before 200 like</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.680" end="00:41:22.060" style="s2">what was like a starting point of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:24.950" style="s2">number of members so I guess something</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.060" end="00:41:26.330" style="s2">going and happening and yeah it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.950" end="00:41:30.860" style="s2">what you learned from that or what is in</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.330" end="00:41:33.770" style="s2">you see is like an optimal group - yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.860" end="00:41:36.290" style="s2">surprising right so there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.770" end="00:41:38.060" style="s2">things there yeah it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.290" end="00:41:40.190" style="s2">maintain personal relationships over a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.060" end="00:41:41.660" style="s2">certain amount whether it&#39;s 150 or</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.190" end="00:41:43.640" style="s2">whatever or whether you count the ones</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.660" end="00:41:45.620" style="s2">that are online or your personal ones or</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.640" end="00:41:47.120" style="s2">your family it is hard to maintain a</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.620" end="00:41:49.970" style="s2">huge number of personal relationships</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.120" end="00:41:53.600" style="s2">but the the limiting factor for us right</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.970" end="00:41:54.920" style="s2">now is communication technology we</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.600" end="00:41:56.570" style="s2">haven&#39;t figured out the right software</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.920" end="00:42:00.530" style="s2">or the right application that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.570" end="00:42:02.840" style="s2">allow us to incorporate too many more</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.530" end="00:42:05.330" style="s2">people you know it&#39;s a si over 500 or</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.840" end="00:42:07.190" style="s2">something like that at this point the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.330" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">goal within the liminal order though is</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.190" end="00:42:12.890" style="s2">to is and I brainstormed about this</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:14.450" style="s2">quite a bit and I haven&#39;t come up with</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.890" end="00:42:16.670" style="s2">the right word yet I want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.450" end="00:42:18.380" style="s2">atomizing but that&#39;s not really it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.670" end="00:42:21.410" style="s2">sort of like creating micro universes</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.380" end="00:42:23.810" style="s2">within so there&#39;s power to network right</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.410" end="00:42:25.349" style="s2">with a certain point each additional</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.810" end="00:42:28.279" style="s2">member to the network doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.349" end="00:42:30.869" style="s2">at plus one yeah you know the all the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.279" end="00:42:33.269" style="s2">relationships it&#39;s greater than one so</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.869" end="00:42:35.039" style="s2">each person you add the marginal return</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.269" end="00:42:38.039" style="s2">is even bigger than just one person so</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.039" end="00:42:39.930" style="s2">you want to have a network that brings a</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.039" end="00:42:41.420" style="s2">new network power right but you get</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.930" end="00:42:44.729" style="s2">limited through infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.420" end="00:42:47.699" style="s2">bottlenecks and you get limited by when</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.729" end="00:42:49.140" style="s2">the signal-to-noise ratio changes so</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.699" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">what I&#39;ve encouraged guys in a little</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.140" end="00:42:53.130" style="s2">more order to do and there&#39;s a number of</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:55.229" style="s2">them here in the chat right now is to</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.130" end="00:42:58.289" style="s2">create sub groups and sub universes</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.229" end="00:43:00.930" style="s2">within so we&#39;re united overall through a</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.289" end="00:43:03.299" style="s2">similar worldview we can participate at</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.930" end="00:43:06.930" style="s2">large in in large group sessions and</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.299" end="00:43:08.819" style="s2">large group events but then the real</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.930" end="00:43:12.059" style="s2">deeper personal connections come from</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.819" end="00:43:14.719" style="s2">the micro ization or atomization or just</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.059" end="00:43:17.579" style="s2">keeping your groups sort of small within</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.719" end="00:43:19.410" style="s2">within the larger organization and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.579" end="00:43:22.499" style="s2">we&#39;re working on building that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.410" end="00:43:23.519" style="s2">culture right now and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.499" end="00:43:26.699" style="s2">different little it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.519" end="00:43:28.589" style="s2">mindset for some people but we take on</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.699" end="00:43:31.259" style="s2">you know maybe 30 or 40 or 50 people</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.589" end="00:43:33.449" style="s2">every couple of months digest them into</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.259" end="00:43:34.799" style="s2">the system get everybody acclimated and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.449" end="00:43:37.680" style="s2">part of it also is really just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.799" end="00:43:39.390" style="s2">preserving the culture right if we</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.680" end="00:43:41.099" style="s2">brought in 500 people all at once then</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.390" end="00:43:43.259" style="s2">the culture just becomes whatever those</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.099" end="00:43:45.329" style="s2">people are bringing with them whereas is</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.259" end="00:43:48.059" style="s2">we trickle people through our onboarding</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.329" end="00:43:49.380" style="s2">processes is extensive and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.059" end="00:43:51.959" style="s2">just get thrown in there you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.380" end="00:43:55.739" style="s2">through a whole system of things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.959" end="00:43:57.089" style="s2">trying to really get them to adapt into</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.739" end="00:44:00.180" style="s2">our culture so we can preserve the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.089" end="00:44:01.739" style="s2">culture itself so it&#39;s strategic growth</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.180" end="00:44:04.440" style="s2">rather than just growth for growth&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.739" end="00:44:05.670" style="s2">sake at this point but eventually we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.440" end="00:44:08.519" style="s2">also going to need some new some new</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.670" end="00:44:10.769" style="s2">tech so we&#39;re looking at Herbet we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.519" end="00:44:13.140" style="s2">looking at dry i/o we&#39;re looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.769" end="00:44:14.699" style="s2">few ways to code and create our own</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.140" end="00:44:19.259" style="s2">systems that are completely independent</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.699" end="00:44:21.390" style="s2">and off the main networks as well - so</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.259" end="00:44:22.829" style="s2">here&#39;s a question I&#39;m going to read it</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.390" end="00:44:24.869" style="s2">and it&#39;s anonymous so you know is going</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.829" end="00:44:28.349" style="s2">to be good or they asked to be anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.869" end="00:44:30.089" style="s2">so I&#39;m interested in the type of private</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.349" end="00:44:32.219" style="s2">and public narratives that will emerge</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.089" end="00:44:34.430" style="s2">from your militia or your order if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.219" end="00:44:39.980" style="s2">have an exclusive group of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.430" end="00:44:41.420" style="s2">that&#39;s a question so private public</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.980" end="00:44:43.849" style="s2">narratives that emerge from our</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.420" end="00:44:45.319" style="s2">exclusive group well the private</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.849" end="00:44:46.970" style="s2">narrative that saved a bunch of lives</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.319" end="00:44:48.890" style="s2">and money in the last couple of months</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.970" end="00:44:50.569" style="s2">was like hey this Corona thing is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.890" end="00:44:53.569" style="s2">be a big deal you better get your she</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.569" end="00:44:55.970" style="s2">better get your shit in order and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.569" end="00:44:58.069" style="s2">narrative was ahead of the others so we</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.970" end="00:45:00.890" style="s2">were definitely at least three or four</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.069" end="00:45:03.230" style="s2">weeks in advance and we put out posture</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.890" end="00:45:05.180" style="s2">papers and position papers to our to our</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.230" end="00:45:09.260" style="s2">community that allow people to get to</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.180" end="00:45:12.410" style="s2">get to get prepared in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.260" end="00:45:14.630" style="s2">we&#39;re going to put out publicly I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.410" end="00:45:16.220" style="s2">looking at my buddy here right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.630" end="00:45:17.900" style="s2">still we&#39;re still trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.220" end="00:45:22.609" style="s2">to what extent we&#39;re going to engage</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.900" end="00:45:24.770" style="s2">publicly it&#39;s really really the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.609" end="00:45:30.160" style="s2">about us as individuals within this</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.770" end="00:45:33.200" style="s2">network to create a grassroots movement</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.160" end="00:45:35.510" style="s2">that&#39;s going to mature and evolve in</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.200" end="00:45:37.700" style="s2">into positions of power where you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.510" end="00:45:40.490" style="s2">make change on the margins you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.700" end="00:45:42.349" style="s2">that&#39;s that sort of our goal is just the</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.490" end="00:45:44.029" style="s2">same way the blue church raised people</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.349" end="00:45:46.460" style="s2">up and got them you know and</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.029" end="00:45:47.660" style="s2">indoctrinated that&#39;s a bad word I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.460" end="00:45:49.730" style="s2">going to use that word but you know what</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.660" end="00:45:52.460" style="s2">I mean and in it to positions of power</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.730" end="00:45:54.950" style="s2">where they&#39;re able to have high leverage</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.460" end="00:45:57.020" style="s2">impact on society that&#39;s sort of our</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.950" end="00:45:59.210" style="s2">goal too but that&#39;s going to take a long</p>

<p begin="00:46:11.779" end="00:46:16.970" style="s2">answers I&#39;m trying to design a system</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.720" end="00:46:20.390" style="s2">that&#39;s going to surface the best answer</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.970" end="00:46:21.740" style="s2">the collective answer for us and you</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.390" end="00:46:24.020" style="s2">know design something that will allow</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.740" end="00:46:26.210" style="s2">allow the right thing to emerge rather</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.020" end="00:46:28.190" style="s2">than for me to just start off saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.210" end="00:46:29.869" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be this you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.190" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">too rigid that&#39;s not what this world is</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.869" end="00:46:34.039" style="s2">about right now right this world is</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:36.920" style="s2">about iterating and iterating the</p>

<p begin="00:46:41.089" end="00:46:45.100" style="s2">thing and adjust on the fly so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.130" end="00:46:47.510" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re going with</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.100" end="00:46:49.790" style="s2">dan you had a question that was similar</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.510" end="00:46:55.430" style="s2">but I liked the framing of it would you</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.790" end="00:46:57.980" style="s2">like to ask it to Jack sure I asked two</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.430" end="00:47:01.400" style="s2">questions which is the first or the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.980" end="00:47:05.660" style="s2">second the the most recent one about the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.400" end="00:47:07.850" style="s2">optimal grip on reality okay first of</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.660" end="00:47:09.710" style="s2">all I want to thank you jack for for</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.850" end="00:47:12.650" style="s2">speaking with us today I appreciate your</p>

<p begin="00:47:12.650" end="00:47:19.730" style="s2">coming forward in this dialogue my</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.820" end="00:47:22.040" style="s2">question is given the isolated culture</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.730" end="00:47:25.910" style="s2">that you are developing what are you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.040" end="00:47:28.600" style="s2">doing if anything to reach out to other</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.910" end="00:47:34.040" style="s2">cultures to ensure that you maintain an</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.600" end="00:47:36.620" style="s2">optimal grip on reality that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.040" end="00:47:39.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question the scott adams</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.620" end="00:47:43.190" style="s2">in me says what is reality and what is</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.320" end="00:47:45.650" style="s2">optimal right so there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.190" end="00:47:47.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot there if we&#39;re getting the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.650" end="00:47:49.100" style="s2">outcomes that we want then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.300" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">optimizing our sense in our grip on</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.100" end="00:47:53.770" style="s2">reality that&#39;s one sort of throwaway</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.960" end="00:47:56.570" style="s2">comment which you can write a book on</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.770" end="00:47:59.540" style="s2">the the more practical answer to your</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.570" end="00:48:03.580" style="s2">question is that most all of us within</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.540" end="00:48:06.850" style="s2">hello are also outwardly tuned into</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.020" end="00:48:44.060" style="s2">our own culture that&#39;s for sure and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.050" end="00:48:48.470" style="s2">did that because we see it as something</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.060" end="00:48:51.110" style="s2">that&#39;s beneficial but you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.470" end="00:48:53.890" style="s2">way that we stay connected is by having</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.110" end="00:48:56.540" style="s2">everybody experiencing their own</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.890" end="00:48:58.370" style="s2">universe their own their own culture</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.540" end="00:49:00.410" style="s2">their own communities and what reach and</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.370" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">not and then bringing it in and then we</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.410" end="00:49:06.140" style="s2">process and analyze it and then move</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:08.330" style="s2">forward the outreach that we do in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.140" end="00:49:11.240" style="s2">mortar as someone just mentioned is on</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.330" end="00:49:13.250" style="s2">an individual basis anyway so where we</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.240" end="00:49:14.360" style="s2">would these are like you know your</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.250" end="00:49:16.100" style="s2">friends or your colleagues or your</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.360" end="00:49:17.810" style="s2">associates or someone that you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.100" end="00:49:19.580" style="s2">online social media you reach out to</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.810" end="00:49:22.220" style="s2">them and you invite them and you explain</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.580" end="00:49:24.410" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing and so there is a sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.220" end="00:49:27.410" style="s2">of outreach but really where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.410" end="00:49:29.830" style="s2">meeting a demand there&#39;s so many people</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.410" end="00:49:32.030" style="s2">out there that are hunger hungry for</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.830" end="00:49:32.900" style="s2">community right that&#39;s like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.030" end="00:49:35.630" style="s2">first things that we&#39;re offering</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.900" end="00:49:37.430" style="s2">community is a way to connect with</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.630" end="00:49:38.630" style="s2">people actually care about you and one</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.430" end="00:49:40.640" style="s2">of the things that we didn&#39;t even talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.630" end="00:49:43.130" style="s2">about here is I mentioned it in passing</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.640" end="00:49:44.900" style="s2">is but we&#39;re like a mutual aid Society</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.130" end="00:49:47.300" style="s2">at the same time we&#39;ve had guys go</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.900" end="00:49:49.730" style="s2">through crisis where they lose their job</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.300" end="00:49:52.820" style="s2">or the wife you know well then their</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.730" end="00:49:56.150" style="s2">children dies or you know his wedding is</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.820" end="00:49:57.890" style="s2">in doubt and you just instantly snap to</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.150" end="00:50:00.380" style="s2">and raised thousands of dollars and sent</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.890" end="00:50:02.480" style="s2">it to them within an hour you know and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.380" end="00:50:04.700" style="s2">like save the day save the day for them</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.480" end="00:50:07.490" style="s2">in some small way that we could you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.700" end="00:50:09.830" style="s2">so this is about building personal</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.490" end="00:50:11.990" style="s2">relationships in a way where you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.830" end="00:50:15.110" style="s2">that the common worldview is there first</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.990" end="00:50:15.920" style="s2">right so for a lot of us you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.110" end="00:50:18.650" style="s2">right-of-center</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.920" end="00:50:20.840" style="s2">mostly Trump supporters definitely part</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.650" end="00:50:24.590" style="s2">of the red insurgency totally anti blue</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.840" end="00:50:27.230" style="s2">Church etc most of us are high</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.590" end="00:50:29.870" style="s2">concentrations are DC New York Austin</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.230" end="00:50:32.870" style="s2">San Francisco so we&#39;re already living in</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.870" end="00:50:34.790" style="s2">isolation and sort of stressful fear and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.870" end="00:50:36.440" style="s2">like you can&#39;t talk at work and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.790" end="00:50:38.150" style="s2">can&#39;t share your ideas with your</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.440" end="00:50:39.950" style="s2">neighbors and you can&#39;t you have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.150" end="00:50:42.890" style="s2">whisper when how did bars and</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.950" end="00:50:45.290" style="s2">restaurants and whatever and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.890" end="00:50:47.930" style="s2">this is fulfilling a real sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.290" end="00:50:50.240" style="s2">I need brothers right like I need men</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.930" end="00:50:53.570" style="s2">that I can relate to and depend on and</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:55.810" style="s2">care about brotherly love right like</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.570" end="00:50:58.070" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely a sense of love and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.810" end="00:51:02.060" style="s2">compassion and empathy that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.070" end="00:51:03.860" style="s2">fostered for each other so it&#39;s it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.060" end="00:51:05.840" style="s2">these things that we&#39;re talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.860" end="00:51:07.580" style="s2">from sense making and all that stuff all</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.840" end="00:51:10.190" style="s2">the way just down to like man I just</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.580" end="00:51:11.390" style="s2">need I need a brother to love and to</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.190" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">love me back</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.390" end="00:51:15.920" style="s2">where you start with this common</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:19.280" style="s2">worldview which is a novel way of</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.920" end="00:51:21.860" style="s2">organizing community because in the past</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.280" end="00:51:24.860" style="s2">it&#39;s been oh you&#39;re my college roommate</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.860" end="00:51:26.630" style="s2">or oh you work next door to me in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.860" end="00:51:29.030" style="s2">office or oh you live next door to me</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.630" end="00:51:30.410" style="s2">but none of those things ensure the fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.030" end="00:51:32.600" style="s2">that you&#39;re gonna see the world the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.410" end="00:51:35.930" style="s2">way or have the same concerns or it seem</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.600" end="00:51:37.730" style="s2">the same passions that way with this</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.930" end="00:51:40.130" style="s2">group we can start with the passions in</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.730" end="00:51:42.650" style="s2">the worldview and then fill form the</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.130" end="00:51:48.560" style="s2">personal relationships from the personal</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.650" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">relationships after that cool so this</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.560" end="00:51:52.490" style="s2">will be the last question</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:53.730" style="s2">Malcom Ocean can you ask your shorter</p>

<p begin="00:52:00.350" end="00:52:04.190" style="s2">it&#39;s like naturally it was coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.180" end="00:52:05.720" style="s2">this sort of Manos to your thing but</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.190" end="00:52:06.980" style="s2">that there could also be liminal teams</p>

<p begin="00:52:20.420" end="00:52:24.380" style="s2">some shared cultural platform so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.490" end="00:52:27.410" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering like what do you see as</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.380" end="00:52:28.850" style="s2">possible collaborations between liminal</p>

<p begin="00:52:44.090" end="00:52:49.430" style="s2">interested in your take on that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.280" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">well I think I&#39;m doing it right now you</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.430" end="00:52:55.520" style="s2">know this is this is exactly the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:57.530" style="s2">that I see these things evolving and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.520" end="00:52:59.510" style="s2">outreach and just trying to cross over</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.530" end="00:53:01.070" style="s2">networks and try to share information I</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.510" end="00:53:02.630" style="s2">mean one thing that popped into my mind</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.070" end="00:53:04.250" style="s2">is I mean sure we could like produce</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.630" end="00:53:05.900" style="s2">like a tech product or something that</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.250" end="00:53:07.970" style="s2">facilitated this kind of stuff but you</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.900" end="00:53:10.720" style="s2">know more importantly it&#39;s is having</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.970" end="00:53:15.050" style="s2">these cross pollinating conversations</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:18.380" style="s2">you know the form and of this</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.050" end="00:53:20.180" style="s2">conversation here I found to be very</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.380" end="00:53:23.330" style="s2">beneficial I&#39;m going to take some of</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.180" end="00:53:24.859" style="s2">this with me back to my conversations</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.330" end="00:53:27.799" style="s2">I&#39;m usually a facilitator in these</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.859" end="00:53:29.989" style="s2">zooom chats like this so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.799" end="00:53:32.950" style="s2">ways for us to cross pollinate and to</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.989" end="00:53:35.930" style="s2">reach out and to share and compare notes</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.950" end="00:53:38.359" style="s2">and you know networks working with</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.930" end="00:53:41.630" style="s2">networks is just one bigger network you</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.359" end="00:53:43.730" style="s2">know and of itself right so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.630" end="00:53:45.289" style="s2">important that we all just keep talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.730" end="00:53:46.579" style="s2">which is another reason why I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.289" end="00:53:49.249" style="s2">hoping to talk to anybody</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.579" end="00:53:51.319" style="s2">basically because these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.249" end="00:53:54.559" style="s2">are very powerful they helped us evolve</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.319" end="00:53:56.329" style="s2">our thinking I mean just just the fact</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.559" end="00:53:58.940" style="s2">that Jordan Hall decided to come talk to</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.329" end="00:54:01.279" style="s2">me and then share and we related and</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.940" end="00:54:02.960" style="s2">then we had a follow up that that was</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.279" end="00:54:05.029" style="s2">part of the genesis for a liminal order</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.960" end="00:54:07.670" style="s2">which now has 200 guys which has changed</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.029" end="00:54:10.640" style="s2">lives across the country which in mound</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.670" end="00:54:14.869" style="s2">in powerful ways so the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.640" end="00:54:16.130" style="s2">there it&#39;s easy to just look at this and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.869" end="00:54:18.710" style="s2">be like oh it&#39;s just a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.130" end="00:54:20.390" style="s2">talking on the internet but no man if</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.710" end="00:54:21.769" style="s2">you&#39;re paying attention and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.390" end="00:54:23.660" style="s2">engaged and you&#39;re putting out your</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.769" end="00:54:26.299" style="s2">energy and you&#39;re receptive to other</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.660" end="00:54:28.430" style="s2">people&#39;s energy you synthesize that and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.299" end="00:54:30.109" style="s2">then in two weeks or a month you have an</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.430" end="00:54:32.599" style="s2">idea that percolates up into your</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.109" end="00:54:34.130" style="s2">consciousness and then you take action</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.599" end="00:54:35.839" style="s2">and you build something and then all of</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.130" end="00:54:38.779" style="s2">a sudden you&#39;re having real-world impact</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.839" end="00:54:40.730" style="s2">and you&#39;re you&#39;re helping people and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.779" end="00:54:42.890" style="s2">all came from the talk that you had you</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.730" end="00:54:45.140" style="s2">know three months ago so these these</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.890" end="00:54:47.839" style="s2">kinds of experiences are very important</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.140" end="00:54:49.279" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I&#39;m here and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.839" end="00:54:52.339" style="s2">keep doing it and I&#39;m just really</p>
