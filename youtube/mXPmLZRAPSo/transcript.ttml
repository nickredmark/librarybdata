<p begin="00:00:14.190" end="00:00:19.920" style="s2">Q&amp;A so I&#39;ll start with a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.970" end="00:00:24.400" style="s2">announcements</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:27.700" style="s2">first I suppose is that I&#39;m leaving</p>

<p begin="00:00:27.700" end="00:00:34.710" style="s2">know that that&#39;s I suppose in protest</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.360" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">over their treatment of Carl Benjamin</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.710" end="00:00:41.589" style="s2">perhaps better known as sargon of akkad</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:44.670" style="s2">patreon like many companies seems to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.589" end="00:00:48.670" style="s2">believe that their role now is to act as</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.670" end="00:00:50.949" style="s2">censor for speech patterns or speech</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.670" end="00:00:54.550" style="s2">content that they regard as unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.949" end="00:00:57.129" style="s2">and I think that they made a big mistake</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.550" end="00:00:59.620" style="s2">with Sargon and so both Dave Rubin and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.129" end="00:01:01.569" style="s2">and also sam Harris have decided to</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.620" end="00:01:05.290" style="s2">leave patreon and that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.569" end="00:01:08.710" style="s2">official as of January 15th so those of</p>

<p begin="00:01:24.850" end="00:01:29.229" style="s2">least in principle might work as a</p>

<p begin="00:01:29.229" end="00:01:33.399" style="s2">that&#39;s a couple of months away but we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:01:50.649" end="00:01:55.719" style="s2">free speech so I think this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.590" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">bad precedent that patroness and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.719" end="00:02:00.100" style="s2">credit card companies - I can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:02.969" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult to imagine a more</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.100" end="00:02:06.700" style="s2">dystopian scenario than to have the</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.239" end="00:02:48.049" style="s2">I can tell you what the rules are maybe</p>

<p begin="00:04:24.229" end="00:04:28.729" style="s2">next six months and I have a first draft</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:31.219" style="s2">done and I&#39;m working hard on the repeat</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.729" end="00:04:33.949" style="s2">edits it&#39;s going to be published</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.219" end="00:04:36.680" style="s2">simultaneously in the UK and the US and</p>

<p begin="00:04:36.680" end="00:04:42.949" style="s2">editors and so that&#39;s that part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.909" end="00:04:44.569" style="s2">announcement so I&#39;m hoping I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.949" end="00:04:47.270" style="s2">hoping that I can make the next book</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.569" end="00:04:49.159" style="s2">better they&#39;re gonna be a pair it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.270" end="00:04:50.210" style="s2">a paired coffee with the first one I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.159" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">probably going to publish it with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.210" end="00:04:55.039" style="s2">black cover to go with the white cover</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:57.139" style="s2">of 12 rules and I&#39;m hoping that I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.039" end="00:04:58.939" style="s2">make it into a better book and that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.139" end="00:05:02.479" style="s2">two together will make a very complete</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.939" end="00:05:03.080" style="s2">set so that&#39;s the plan we&#39;ll see how it</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.479" end="00:05:05.960" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.080" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">the last announcement I guess no two</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.960" end="00:05:13.699" style="s2">more announcements I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:15.409" style="s2">Switzerland tomorrow my daughter is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.699" end="00:05:18.020" style="s2">having surgery there to get her ankle</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.409" end="00:05:20.449" style="s2">fixed again we&#39;re hoping that that will</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.020" end="00:05:23.620" style="s2">go well I&#39;m also doing a talk in Zurich</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.449" end="00:05:26.210" style="s2">then I have three talks in California</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.620" end="00:05:29.659" style="s2">information for them is at Jordan B</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.210" end="00:05:32.959" style="s2">Peterson comm forward-slash events and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.659" end="00:05:34.759" style="s2">then in February my wife and I are going</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.959" end="00:05:37.009" style="s2">my wife Tammy and I are going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.759" end="00:05:40.610" style="s2">Australia New Zealand and I believe we</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.009" end="00:05:43.490" style="s2">have 15 talks scheduled there over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.610" end="00:05:44.689" style="s2">course of about a month and then I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.490" end="00:05:46.339" style="s2">in March and April I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.689" end="00:05:48.499" style="s2">concentrate mostly on writing and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.339" end="00:05:51.319" style="s2">perhaps we&#39;re going to go to Europe and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.499" end="00:05:52.759" style="s2">so that&#39;s for a month or two that will</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.319" end="00:05:55.099" style="s2">depend to some degree on the writing</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.759" end="00:05:57.169" style="s2">schedule but that&#39;s the plan at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.099" end="00:05:58.339" style="s2">moment I have some good podcasts coming</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.169" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">up I talked to General Stanley</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.339" end="00:06:04.399" style="s2">McChrystal last week about his new book</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:07.879" style="s2">on leadership and the myths that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.399" end="00:06:09.649" style="s2">surround it and some of the initiatives</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.879" end="00:06:11.689" style="s2">that he&#39;s been working on in the United</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.649" end="00:06:13.759" style="s2">States and so McChrystal was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.689" end="00:06:16.370" style="s2">commander of the American forces in</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.759" end="00:06:20.990" style="s2">Afghanistan and so it was very</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.370" end="00:06:23.089" style="s2">interesting to talk to him and well</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.990" end="00:06:25.909" style="s2">there&#39;s a variety of other things going</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.089" end="00:06:27.529" style="s2">on too but I won&#39;t tell you any more</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.909" end="00:06:29.209" style="s2">about those for the time being I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.529" end="00:06:33.740" style="s2">what I&#39;ll do instead is turn to some</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.209" end="00:06:37.879" style="s2">questions so I guess maybe I could also</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.740" end="00:06:39.750" style="s2">give a bit of a recap for 2018 so Tammy</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.879" end="00:06:42.420" style="s2">and I have gone to about</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.750" end="00:06:46.230" style="s2">fifteen cities now something like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.420" end="00:06:48.750" style="s2">her google trip trackers showed that she</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.230" end="00:06:50.940" style="s2">had gone six times around the world mine</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.750" end="00:06:53.310" style="s2">said twenty and so that&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.940" end="00:06:55.200" style="s2">wrong because I traveled mostly with her</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.310" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">but there was a lot of traveling last</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.200" end="00:06:58.830" style="s2">year and I spoke to about two hundred</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:01.020" style="s2">and fifty thousand people and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.830" end="00:07:03.180" style="s2">very all of that was very positive</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.020" end="00:07:09.180" style="s2">experience that lectures have been</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.180" end="00:07:11.670" style="s2">really well heartwarming to use an old</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.180" end="00:07:14.450" style="s2">term I mean it&#39;s really something to see</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.670" end="00:07:17.700" style="s2">that many people gather together and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.450" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">listen and happen and participate in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.700" end="00:07:26.880" style="s2">discussion about about psychological and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:29.760" style="s2">and philosophical and spiritual issues</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.880" end="00:07:32.040" style="s2">that&#39;s as deep as I can manage anyways</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.760" end="00:07:33.780" style="s2">and it seems to be quite gripping for</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.040" end="00:07:35.190" style="s2">the audience and good for everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.780" end="00:07:37.919" style="s2">so they&#39;re very very positive</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.190" end="00:07:40.290" style="s2">experiences which is partly why we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.919" end="00:07:45.800" style="s2">been able to sustain this speaking pace</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.290" end="00:07:49.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s been good oh we also have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.800" end="00:07:56.090" style="s2">discount by the way we my partners and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.200" end="00:07:59.580" style="s2">decided to encourage everybody to make</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.580" end="00:08:04.290" style="s2">sophisticated and comprehensive way and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.040" end="00:08:06.810" style="s2">so we have this program some of you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.290" end="00:08:09.990" style="s2">heard about this at self authoring calm</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.810" end="00:08:12.270" style="s2">called future authoring and the future</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.990" end="00:08:15.540" style="s2">authoring program helps you write out a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.270" end="00:08:17.669" style="s2">vision for the future to think through</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.540" end="00:08:18.930" style="s2">what you&#39;d like your life to be like if</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.669" end="00:08:21.240" style="s2">you were taking care of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.930" end="00:08:22.740" style="s2">properly to consider your friends and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.240" end="00:08:25.860" style="s2">your family and your career and your</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.740" end="00:08:28.169" style="s2">education and your use of time outside</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.860" end="00:08:30.570" style="s2">of work and your ability to resist</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.169" end="00:08:35.130" style="s2">temptation the kind of temptation that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.570" end="00:08:36.780" style="s2">might drag you down and and how you</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.130" end="00:08:38.130" style="s2">might take care of yourself mentally and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.780" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">physically and to write about that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.130" end="00:08:43.620" style="s2">then to write a counter story which was</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:44.970" style="s2">where you might be three to five years</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.620" end="00:08:47.130" style="s2">down the road if you let all your bad</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.970" end="00:08:49.800" style="s2">habits get out of control and then to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.130" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">write a strategic plan it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.800" end="00:08:52.950" style="s2">useful program we&#39;ve used it with</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:55.019" style="s2">lots of university students in</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.950" end="00:08:58.500" style="s2">particular although it&#39;s for adults of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.019" end="00:09:00.120" style="s2">all ages and if you&#39;re a university</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.500" end="00:09:01.829" style="s2">student and you complete the program it</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.120" end="00:09:03.360" style="s2">seems to increase the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.829" end="00:09:06.300" style="s2">you&#39;ll stay in university by about</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.360" end="00:09:08.459" style="s2">twenty-five percent something like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.300" end="00:09:10.079" style="s2">it seems particularly useful by the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.459" end="00:09:12.510" style="s2">for men for reasons that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.079" end="00:09:14.550" style="s2">exactly understand maybe because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.510" end="00:09:17.430" style="s2">underperforming women academically and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.550" end="00:09:19.620" style="s2">it also improves people&#39;s grades but</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.430" end="00:09:21.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a large literature in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.620" end="00:09:24.930" style="s2">industrial organizational area also</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.450" end="00:09:28.649" style="s2">indicating that if you&#39;re like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.930" end="00:09:30.980" style="s2">working and you make a personal plan of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.649" end="00:09:33.390" style="s2">this sort then your overall productivity</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.980" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">increases by about ten percent which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.390" end="00:09:38.100" style="s2">a lot and you&#39;re you&#39;re more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:41.100" style="s2">be physically and mentally healthy and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.100" end="00:09:43.170" style="s2">so I would really recommend trying this</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.100" end="00:09:44.760" style="s2">even you can try the program you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.170" end="00:09:46.380" style="s2">have to do a perfect job at it it</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.760" end="00:09:47.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.380" end="00:09:49.589" style="s2">trying to set out a bit of a vision and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.970" end="00:09:52.079" style="s2">a plan for your life and you need that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.589" end="00:09:54.450" style="s2">because you need direction and you need</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.079" end="00:09:56.519" style="s2">purpose and you need the constraints of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.450" end="00:10:00.180" style="s2">a vision to help you be less anxious and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.519" end="00:10:03.000" style="s2">uncertain and and you you have that</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.180" end="00:10:05.370" style="s2">anxiety and uncertainty reduction does</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.000" end="00:10:07.260" style="s2">occur if you have a decent map of where</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.370" end="00:10:13.589" style="s2">it is that you&#39;re headed the coupon code</p>

<p begin="00:10:25.890" end="00:10:29.970" style="s2">I think the total price is seven dollars</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.690" end="00:10:32.760" style="s2">and forty-five cents which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.970" end="00:10:35.339" style="s2">pretty damn cheap if what it does is</p>

<p begin="00:10:42.060" end="00:10:47.699" style="s2">psychological principles allied with I</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.310" end="00:10:54.480" style="s2">would say a certain degree of optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.699" end="00:10:59.070" style="s2">philosophy and it&#39;s well it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.480" end="00:11:00.839" style="s2">thing to do and this is a good time to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.070" end="00:11:02.250" style="s2">do it so if you&#39;re interested all that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.839" end="00:11:04.350" style="s2">information will be in the description</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.250" end="00:11:05.460" style="s2">of the video as well so that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.350" end="00:11:08.460" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.460" end="00:11:12.570" style="s2">as far as I can tell I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.460" end="00:11:14.370" style="s2">have anything else to tell you Oh 12</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.570" end="00:11:16.290" style="s2">rules for life has sold about 3 million</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.370" end="00:11:18.570" style="s2">copies now so I guess I&#39;m telling you</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.290" end="00:11:20.790" style="s2">that it&#39;s become very popular in Korea</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.570" end="00:11:22.830" style="s2">where it&#39;s sold about 200,000 copies</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.790" end="00:11:25.760" style="s2">which is quite interesting and something</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.830" end="00:11:29.190" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t have necessarily expected so</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.760" end="00:11:34.050" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s answer some questions</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.190" end="00:11:37.350" style="s2">and see how that goes can you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.050" end="00:11:40.590" style="s2">your own specific experiences / methods</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.350" end="00:11:47.550" style="s2">used with integrating the shadow yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.590" end="00:11:49.460" style="s2">well I can actually I think a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.550" end="00:11:54.420" style="s2">amount of what you might regard as</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.460" end="00:11:56.130" style="s2">shadow integration which in the parlance</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.420" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">of behavioral psychologists would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.130" end="00:11:59.700" style="s2">something like assertiveness training</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:02.310" style="s2">all right it&#39;s training and how to stand</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.700" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">up for yourself and and for your let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.310" end="00:12:06.990" style="s2">say for your better self which would be</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:09.720" style="s2">the self that you could use productively</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.990" end="00:12:12.330" style="s2">over a medium to long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.720" end="00:12:14.700" style="s2">that would be of use to you but also of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.330" end="00:12:17.670" style="s2">use to people around you so it&#39;s a self</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.700" end="00:12:19.380" style="s2">that&#39;s founded by the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.670" end="00:12:21.390" style="s2">taking care of yourself but also</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.380" end="00:12:28.590" style="s2">simultaneously taking care of the people</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.390" end="00:12:32.520" style="s2">around you I think that the simplest way</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.590" end="00:12:35.400" style="s2">to start that work is to consult your</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.520" end="00:12:37.470" style="s2">resentment you know it&#39;s easy to become</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.400" end="00:12:40.890" style="s2">bitter about life and to become angry</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.470" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">because of course life is difficult and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.890" end="00:12:46.680" style="s2">it&#39;s full of disappointments and people</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:48.270" style="s2">are also subject to be trail on the part</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.680" end="00:12:50.070" style="s2">of themselves and on the part of people</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.270" end="00:12:52.230" style="s2">that hypothetically care for them and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.070" end="00:12:55.380" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to get bitter and to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.230" end="00:12:57.240" style="s2">resentful and resentment is a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.380" end="00:13:01.110" style="s2">useful emotion even though I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.240" end="00:13:02.850" style="s2">one of the most damaging emotions if</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.110" end="00:13:06.210" style="s2">it&#39;s not dealt with properly so if</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.850" end="00:13:07.950" style="s2">you&#39;re resentful basically means only</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.210" end="00:13:10.500" style="s2">one of two things it either means you</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.950" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">should grow up and quit whining and get</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.500" end="00:13:16.140" style="s2">on with your life or it means that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">you&#39;re being subject to tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.140" end="00:13:18.990" style="s2">forces of one form or another maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.240" end="00:13:21.240" style="s2">emanating</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.990" end="00:13:22.709" style="s2">you may be a consequence of the natural</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.240" end="00:13:24.930" style="s2">environment may be a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.709" end="00:13:28.850" style="s2">society your being subject to tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.930" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">forces and you&#39;re not putting your own</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.850" end="00:13:34.410" style="s2">best interests forward like in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:36.930" style="s2">broader sense that I described I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.410" end="00:13:39.330" style="s2">mean your selfish narrow interests that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.930" end="00:13:41.730" style="s2">only serve the purposes of instantaneous</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.330" end="00:13:43.410" style="s2">gratification I mean your own best</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.730" end="00:13:46.290" style="s2">interests in terms of developing your</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.410" end="00:13:49.290" style="s2">character over the span of your life if</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.290" end="00:13:50.580" style="s2">you&#39;re resentful it either means that</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.290" end="00:13:52.260" style="s2">you&#39;re immature and that you should grow</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.580" end="00:13:54.930" style="s2">the hell up and so you need to figure</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.260" end="00:13:57.480" style="s2">out how much of your resentment is is is</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.930" end="00:14:00.810" style="s2">that and maybe allied with the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.480" end="00:14:03.330" style="s2">find other things or people to blame but</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.810" end="00:14:06.330" style="s2">the other possible option is that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.330" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">have something to say or do right</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.330" end="00:14:11.399" style="s2">because you&#39;re in a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:13.649" style="s2">you&#39;re violating your own internal</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.399" end="00:14:16.290" style="s2">ethical standards and you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.649" end="00:14:18.060" style="s2">required pressured let&#39;s say to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.290" end="00:14:20.459" style="s2">things you don&#39;t believe or to do things</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.060" end="00:14:23.550" style="s2">that you believe to be wrong and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.459" end="00:14:26.279" style="s2">need to determine you need to start to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.550" end="00:14:28.260" style="s2">strategize and plan how you can rectify</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.279" end="00:14:29.550" style="s2">that so that you can say what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.260" end="00:14:31.200" style="s2">like if you&#39;re negotiating with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.550" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">marital partner for example and there</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.200" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">are issues in your marriage that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:38.370" style="s2">making you happy well the first thing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:40.860" style="s2">you have to take note of that right to</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.370" end="00:14:42.600" style="s2">see that you&#39;re actually unhappy the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.860" end="00:14:44.700" style="s2">second is that you have to be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.600" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2">engage in a certain amount of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.700" end="00:14:48.480" style="s2">because in order to sort out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.800" end="00:14:50.640" style="s2">disturbing you you&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.480" end="00:14:53.070" style="s2">lay your concerns out on the table and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.640" end="00:14:55.079" style="s2">say well look this is bothering me you</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.070" end="00:14:57.089" style="s2">don&#39;t have to say well I&#39;m right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.079" end="00:14:59.160" style="s2">you&#39;re wrong and you have to fix this</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.089" end="00:15:03.810" style="s2">you have to say well I&#39;ve noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.160" end="00:15:06.440" style="s2">this pattern of interaction or lack of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.810" end="00:15:09.570" style="s2">interaction say in our relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.440" end="00:15:10.980" style="s2">making me resentful and angry and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.570" end="00:15:12.420" style="s2">danger of that of course is you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.980" end="00:15:12.839" style="s2">to take it out on yourself and your</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.420" end="00:15:15.089" style="s2">partner</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.839" end="00:15:16.950" style="s2">the danger is passion passive</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.089" end="00:15:18.540" style="s2">aggressiveness you know you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.950" end="00:15:19.770" style="s2">to respond to your partner positively</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.540" end="00:15:22.170" style="s2">when they do something good if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.770" end="00:15:23.850" style="s2">resentful about them and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.170" end="00:15:24.870" style="s2">going to respond to yourself properly</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.850" end="00:15:26.490" style="s2">and so you have to lay it out on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.870" end="00:15:29.370" style="s2">table but sort of in a spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.490" end="00:15:31.709" style="s2">ignorant humility it&#39;s like look I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.370" end="00:15:32.920" style="s2">frustrated I&#39;m feeling this way about</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.709" end="00:15:35.079" style="s2">our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.920" end="00:15:37.779" style="s2">here&#39;s what I think might be going wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.079" end="00:15:40.209" style="s2">maybe on my part and maybe on your part</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.779" end="00:15:42.579" style="s2">and here&#39;s what I envision as a possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.209" end="00:15:45.459" style="s2">solution that&#39;s also really necessary if</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.579" end="00:15:47.350" style="s2">you&#39;re going to say what you have to say</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.459" end="00:15:49.119" style="s2">which is to manifest yourself properly</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.350" end="00:15:51.790" style="s2">in the world is you can&#39;t just complain</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.119" end="00:15:53.980" style="s2">about what&#39;s wrong you have to think</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.790" end="00:15:56.290" style="s2">well what would my minimal preconditions</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.980" end="00:15:57.549" style="s2">for satisfaction be you have to offer</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.290" end="00:16:01.149" style="s2">that to the person that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.549" end="00:16:04.149" style="s2">negotiating with and so then you learn</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.149" end="00:16:05.589" style="s2">to abide by the truth to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.149" end="00:16:09.910" style="s2">you can do that and no one does it</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.589" end="00:16:14.069" style="s2">perfectly you know but it&#39;s very useful</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.910" end="00:16:16.720" style="s2">because you&#39;re not storing up a whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.069" end="00:16:19.559" style="s2">sequence of memories about how you were</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.720" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">unfairly treated and abused and betray</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.559" end="00:16:24.189" style="s2">instead you&#39;re trying to stay on top of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:26.259" style="s2">it and to note your unhappiness and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.189" end="00:16:29.319" style="s2">dissatisfaction when it manifests itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.259" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">and to accept that that&#39;s the case and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.319" end="00:16:33.519" style="s2">then to analyze that to see if it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:35.829" style="s2">problem like I said with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.519" end="00:16:40.239" style="s2">maturity or if it indicates that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.829" end="00:16:41.889" style="s2">an injustice in the manner in which you</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.239" end="00:16:43.929" style="s2">and the world are interacting and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.889" end="00:16:46.269" style="s2">to work to set that right even in small</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.929" end="00:16:48.009" style="s2">ways and so it&#39;s it&#39;s a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.269" end="00:16:51.489" style="s2">character logical development and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.009" end="00:16:53.949" style="s2">makes you that makes you stronger over</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.489" end="00:16:55.389" style="s2">time and partly what you need you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.949" end="00:16:57.819" style="s2">in order to do that is you have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.389" end="00:16:59.649" style="s2">really understand and we do this this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.819" end="00:17:01.329" style="s2">why we built in the future authoring</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.649" end="00:17:04.149" style="s2">program we built this section where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.329" end="00:17:05.829" style="s2">have to outline your most dismal future</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.149" end="00:17:07.240" style="s2">right what your future would be like if</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.829" end="00:17:09.339" style="s2">you let all your bad habits and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.240" end="00:17:11.470" style="s2">characterological weaknesses have the</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.339" end="00:17:15.909" style="s2">upper hand and the reason we did this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.470" end="00:17:17.889" style="s2">because you can&#39;t be you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.909" end="00:17:19.990" style="s2">straighten yourself out merely as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.889" end="00:17:21.579" style="s2">consequence of hope let&#39;s say you lay on</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.990" end="00:17:23.620" style="s2">a vision for the future and you think</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.579" end="00:17:25.449" style="s2">about what your life would be what you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.620" end="00:17:27.010" style="s2">like your life to be like and then that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.449" end="00:17:27.880" style="s2">makes you hopeful and it motivates you</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.010" end="00:17:30.669" style="s2">because it gives you something</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.880" end="00:17:33.279" style="s2">worthwhile and higher order to work for</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.669" end="00:17:35.529" style="s2">right and that&#39;s useful that&#39;s positive</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.279" end="00:17:37.210" style="s2">emotion working for you because positive</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.529" end="00:17:38.919" style="s2">emotion is experienced in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.210" end="00:17:41.440" style="s2">to goals but it&#39;s not as if not as</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.919" end="00:17:43.659" style="s2">useful as also being chased by something</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.440" end="00:17:45.820" style="s2">you&#39;re terrified by and if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.659" end="00:17:46.540" style="s2">good sense of how you can fall apart if</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.820" end="00:17:48.820" style="s2">you stay</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.540" end="00:17:52.150" style="s2">week and just exactly what kind of hell</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.820" end="00:17:53.950" style="s2">that would be then when you determine to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.150" end="00:17:55.780" style="s2">do something like to tell the truth and</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.950" end="00:17:58.840" style="s2">to say what you think and to not do</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.780" end="00:18:01.000" style="s2">things that you hate then you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.840" end="00:18:02.860" style="s2">to be pulled along by the purpose that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.000" end="00:18:05.410" style="s2">your vision has provided for you but</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.860" end="00:18:07.270" style="s2">also pushed along by your desire to</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.410" end="00:18:08.800" style="s2">avoid the worst forms of Hell that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.270" end="00:18:11.470" style="s2">you&#39;ve already outlined for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.800" end="00:18:13.780" style="s2">personally and that can also help you be</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.470" end="00:18:15.700" style="s2">brave enough to stand up in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.780" end="00:18:17.860" style="s2">situation that we would require a</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.700" end="00:18:19.990" style="s2">conflict because if you have something</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.860" end="00:18:22.690" style="s2">to say and you have something to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.990" end="00:18:23.860" style="s2">negotiate about with someone then</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.690" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.860" end="00:18:30.820" style="s2">conflictual dialogue that accompanies</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:34.090" style="s2">that right to lay out a set of problems</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.820" end="00:18:35.980" style="s2">and to describe the fact forthrightly</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.090" end="00:18:37.600" style="s2">that those problems characterize a</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.980" end="00:18:39.910" style="s2">relationship and then to seek for</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.600" end="00:18:42.580" style="s2">solutions is quite stressful in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.910" end="00:18:44.440" style="s2">short term and it&#39;s really easy to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.580" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">and so people avoid it all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.440" end="00:18:49.930" style="s2">then they store up grievances across the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:51.640" style="s2">span of the relationships and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.930" end="00:18:54.160" style="s2">the grievances mount to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.640" end="00:18:56.020" style="s2">they return in monstrous form and just</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:58.090" style="s2">eat everything up that&#39;s where you get</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.020" end="00:19:00.280" style="s2">divorces or that&#39;s where you explode it</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.090" end="00:19:01.990" style="s2">your boss and end up fired or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.280" end="00:19:03.970" style="s2">where you you know you develop high</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.990" end="00:19:08.020" style="s2">blood pressure over 15 years because you</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.970" end="00:19:10.420" style="s2">can&#39;t stand all the accumulated months</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.020" end="00:19:12.580" style="s2">all the accumulated monsters in your</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.420" end="00:19:14.320" style="s2">closet and and you drink yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.580" end="00:19:17.140" style="s2">oblivion because he can&#39;t stand your</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:19.450" style="s2">life that&#39;s all you know very</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.140" end="00:19:21.520" style="s2">counterproductive but it&#39;s easy to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.450" end="00:19:23.740" style="s2">that necessary conflict on a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.520" end="00:19:26.950" style="s2">moment-to-moment basis because it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.740" end="00:19:28.750" style="s2">stressful to speak forthrightly about</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.950" end="00:19:30.070" style="s2">genuine conflicts especially when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.750" end="00:19:32.200" style="s2">dealing with important parts of your</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.070" end="00:19:33.640" style="s2">life but otherwise you don&#39;t straighten</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.200" end="00:19:36.010" style="s2">them out and then you have to carry all</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.640" end="00:19:38.560" style="s2">that forward so you need to be terrified</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.010" end="00:19:41.350" style="s2">of the consequences of not speaking your</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.560" end="00:19:43.270" style="s2">piece and that can counterbalance the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.350" end="00:19:47.170" style="s2">terror of actually trying to have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.270" end="00:19:49.000" style="s2">conversation so well you know and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.170" end="00:19:52.600" style="s2">also have to look with regards to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.000" end="00:19:55.090" style="s2">the shadow ideas like you have to get in</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.600" end="00:19:57.160" style="s2">touch with the depths of your anger you</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.090" end="00:19:58.600" style="s2">know lots of people are resentful about</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.160" end="00:20:00.460" style="s2">all sorts of things they&#39;re resentful</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.519" end="00:22:13.419" style="s2">because you know if you have that desire</p>

<p begin="00:22:24.249" end="00:22:32.769" style="s2">you&#39;re a lot more movable right and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.299" end="00:22:34.149" style="s2">a lot more of a force to contend with it</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.769" end="00:22:36.070" style="s2">can give you some respect for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.149" end="00:22:38.379" style="s2">when you realize that you&#39;re a force of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.070" end="00:22:39.940" style="s2">destruction as well as creation and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.379" end="00:22:41.769" style="s2">you&#39;re also more likely to treat</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.940" end="00:22:45.070" style="s2">yourself with a bit more intelligent</p>

<p begin="00:22:50.919" end="00:22:55.119" style="s2">tried a bit more lightly around yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.779" end="00:22:56.889" style="s2">and and maybe you encourage people to</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.119" end="00:22:58.869" style="s2">tread a bit more lightly around you as</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.889" end="00:23:00.459" style="s2">well which isn&#39;t such a bad thing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.869" end="00:23:03.489" style="s2">all the people that I really admired</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.459" end="00:23:07.209" style="s2">that I know have a clearly dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.489" end="00:23:09.039" style="s2">side and you don&#39;t want to get you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:23:10.959" end="00:23:16.899" style="s2">them respectable and strong especially</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.119" end="00:23:18.489" style="s2">if they have that under control so well</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.899" end="00:23:22.950" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit of a dialogue about shadow</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.489" end="00:23:26.369" style="s2">integration it&#39;s a very challenging</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.950" end="00:23:29.709" style="s2">undertaking you know to pull in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.369" end="00:23:31.119" style="s2">dark side of your character and and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.709" end="00:23:33.999" style="s2">would be all the things that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.119" end="00:23:36.399" style="s2">repressed or failed to develop as a</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.399" end="00:23:45.129" style="s2">and well let&#39;s say a harmless and</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.940" end="00:23:47.799" style="s2">harmless citizen who looks virtuous on</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.129" end="00:23:50.440" style="s2">the surface that&#39;s the union persona and</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.799" end="00:23:52.659" style="s2">you need that because everybody needs a</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.440" end="00:23:55.739" style="s2">mask that they wear in public like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.659" end="00:23:58.329" style="s2">suit you know so that we can tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.739" end="00:24:00.399" style="s2">seeing each other on the street we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.329" end="00:24:02.619" style="s2">have to look right into our depths every</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.399" end="00:24:06.849" style="s2">time we interact we need that persona</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.619" end="00:24:09.129" style="s2">but that has to be transcendent and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.849" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">way to transcend that is to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.129" end="00:24:12.999" style="s2">the darker parts of the character</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:15.940" style="s2">they&#39;re very useful that aggression</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.999" end="00:24:18.309" style="s2">that&#39;s sexual demand for example all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.940" end="00:24:21.669" style="s2">that&#39;s very difficult to socialize that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.309" end="00:24:23.799" style="s2">competitiveness but unbelievably useful</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.669" end="00:24:26.429" style="s2">in terms of force of character if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.799" end="00:24:26.429" style="s2">could manage it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.300" end="00:24:33.980" style="s2">richard asks how can i help my parents</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.710" end="00:24:36.260" style="s2">to sort themselves out that&#39;s question</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.980" end="00:24:38.270" style="s2">one how can i talk about the resentments</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.260" end="00:24:40.970" style="s2">of my childhood a way that benefits them</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.270" end="00:24:43.000" style="s2">instead of giving them guilt yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.970" end="00:24:45.410" style="s2">those are two very difficult questions</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.000" end="00:24:47.630" style="s2">how can you help your parents to sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.410" end="00:24:51.410" style="s2">themselves out well I guess the first</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.630" end="00:24:54.710" style="s2">question would be or do they want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.410" end="00:24:56.660" style="s2">sort themselves so because it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.710" end="00:24:59.870" style="s2">easy to help people if they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.660" end="00:25:02.290" style="s2">to be helped if they do want to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.870" end="00:25:04.450" style="s2">helped like listening is really a good</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.290" end="00:25:08.450" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.450" end="00:25:09.890" style="s2">you know people you&#39;ve got the question</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.450" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">right because you said how can I help my</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.890" end="00:25:13.940" style="s2">parents to sort themselves out which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:18.290" style="s2">very different than how can I sort my</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.940" end="00:25:20.810" style="s2">parents out you help people to sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.290" end="00:25:24.110" style="s2">themselves out once they have decided to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.810" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">do so by giving them the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.110" end="00:25:29.030" style="s2">talk about their concerns and also to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:31.670" style="s2">outline what potential solutions might</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.030" end="00:25:34.130" style="s2">be and you don&#39;t want to offer too many</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.670" end="00:25:36.380" style="s2">pieces of advice while you&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.130" end="00:25:39.350" style="s2">because it turns out that people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.380" end="00:25:41.450" style="s2">much more likely to implement a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.350" end="00:25:43.640" style="s2">of improvement if they generate it</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.450" end="00:25:45.500" style="s2">themselves and then also you don&#39;t steal</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.640" end="00:25:47.210" style="s2">the accomplishment from them like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.500" end="00:25:49.220" style="s2">say you came to me with a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.210" end="00:25:53.240" style="s2">problems and I said well here&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.220" end="00:25:55.460" style="s2">can do about that and then you went out</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.240" end="00:25:56.630" style="s2">and did it and it worked and and then in</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.460" end="00:25:58.520" style="s2">some sense that&#39;s not your</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.630" end="00:26:01.160" style="s2">accomplishment I mean it is insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.520" end="00:26:04.430" style="s2">you implement it but it&#39;s not insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.160" end="00:26:06.740" style="s2">it was something that I planned and your</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.430" end="00:26:11.000" style="s2">intimation of that your intubation of</p>

<p begin="00:26:13.880" end="00:26:17.560" style="s2">have been stolen from you by</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.680" end="00:26:20.030" style="s2">well-meaning advice is going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.560" end="00:26:23.120" style="s2">interfere with the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.030" end="00:26:25.850" style="s2">you&#39;ll implement the solution and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.120" end="00:26:27.680" style="s2">it&#39;s best to let people talk through</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.850" end="00:26:30.200" style="s2">their own problems like well what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.680" end="00:26:31.580" style="s2">problem that&#39;s what you ask what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.200" end="00:26:33.380" style="s2">problem what do you think it&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.580" end="00:26:34.550" style="s2">about your life and then people will</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.380" end="00:26:36.290" style="s2">throw up with a bunch of things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.550" end="00:26:37.450" style="s2">they&#39;re complaining about or resentful</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.290" end="00:26:38.890" style="s2">about and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.450" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">and it might be quite an extensive list</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.890" end="00:26:41.680" style="s2">and they&#39;ll feel guilty about it because</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:43.300" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to burden you with it</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.680" end="00:26:44.950" style="s2">and but they need to get it all off</p>

<p begin="00:26:44.950" end="00:26:48.100" style="s2">cards on the table so also some things</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:50.500" style="s2">know when you&#39;re talking to your wife or</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.100" end="00:26:52.120" style="s2">your husband or your intimate partner or</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.500" end="00:26:53.620" style="s2">a child for that matter so when you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.120" end="00:26:55.270" style="s2">a close relationship with this if</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.620" end="00:26:57.670" style="s2">they&#39;ve got some things to complain</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.270" end="00:26:59.530" style="s2">about which they undoubtedly do they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.670" end="00:27:01.810" style="s2">going to complain about a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.530" end="00:27:03.870" style="s2">things than they&#39;re actually upset about</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.810" end="00:27:05.050" style="s2">because they&#39;ll have gathered up</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.870" end="00:27:08.020" style="s2">irritations</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.050" end="00:27:10.870" style="s2">that have been unspoken and aggravations</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.020" end="00:27:13.750" style="s2">and fears and they&#39;ll all be upsetting</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.870" end="00:27:15.400" style="s2">them emotionally and they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.750" end="00:27:17.440" style="s2">exactly what they are until they</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.400" end="00:27:19.300" style="s2">articulate them you know we say well</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.440" end="00:27:21.970" style="s2">what are you upset about well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.300" end="00:27:23.380" style="s2">know well how can you not know well the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.970" end="00:27:25.060" style="s2">answer is there&#39;s all sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.380" end="00:27:27.070" style="s2">that you respond to emotionally before</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.060" end="00:27:28.840" style="s2">you can articulate them then you get</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.070" end="00:27:30.610" style="s2">upset and you explode and you yell and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.840" end="00:27:32.200" style="s2">you lay out all the things you might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.610" end="00:27:34.630" style="s2">angry about and you&#39;re impulsive and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.200" end="00:27:35.920" style="s2">overstate your case and you accuse</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.630" end="00:27:38.470" style="s2">people of things that you don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.920" end="00:27:40.420" style="s2">believe all of that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.470" end="00:27:43.450" style="s2">process of laying your cards out on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.420" end="00:27:45.340" style="s2">table you have complex situations that</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.450" end="00:27:47.170" style="s2">are disturbing you and you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.340" end="00:27:48.850" style="s2">what they are exactly you have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.170" end="00:27:50.290" style="s2">of guess so you say well it might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.850" end="00:27:52.300" style="s2">this it might be that it might be this</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.290" end="00:27:56.980" style="s2">it might be you and this is why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.300" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">your fault and you get accusatory and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.980" end="00:28:02.560" style="s2">then if you&#39;re listening to all that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:04.150" style="s2">have to just be patient and let the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.560" end="00:28:06.100" style="s2">person get all their cards out on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.150" end="00:28:07.960" style="s2">table even if some of that involves</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.100" end="00:28:09.460" style="s2">accusations about you which you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.960" end="00:28:11.260" style="s2">have to immediately you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.460" end="00:28:13.270" style="s2">immediately jump to the conclusion that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.260" end="00:28:15.970" style="s2">those accusations are accurate or that</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.270" end="00:28:17.530" style="s2">you have to defend yourself you know and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.970" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">I&#39;m not believe me I&#39;m not saying this</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.530" end="00:28:21.970" style="s2">is easy because it&#39;s not but you listen</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:24.040" style="s2">to the person lay out there their deck</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.970" end="00:28:26.560" style="s2">of complaints and the first thing you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.040" end="00:28:30.160" style="s2">find is that they will take 50 percent</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.560" end="00:28:32.050" style="s2">or maybe more 75 percent of the cards</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.160" end="00:28:34.450" style="s2">off the table right away because once</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.050" end="00:28:36.760" style="s2">they&#39;ve articulated out those concerns</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.450" end="00:28:38.860" style="s2">they&#39;ll find that they&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.760" end="00:28:40.990" style="s2">central they&#39;re not really the issue and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.860" end="00:28:44.500" style="s2">so that leaves a smaller number of</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.990" end="00:28:47.380" style="s2">genuine problems and then you can ask</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.500" end="00:28:49.270" style="s2">people again well here&#39;s the problem can</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.380" end="00:28:51.460" style="s2">you think of any way if you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.270" end="00:28:53.649" style="s2">conceptualize how</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.460" end="00:28:55.450" style="s2">would be better in relationship to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.649" end="00:28:59.110" style="s2">problem well what would a solution look</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.450" end="00:29:00.580" style="s2">like even in principle and then they</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.110" end="00:29:01.960" style="s2">might say well I don&#39;t know and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.580" end="00:29:03.909" style="s2">they have to guess and lay their cards</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.960" end="00:29:06.010" style="s2">out on the table about what a solution</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.909" end="00:29:08.799" style="s2">might look like if they say they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.010" end="00:29:10.120" style="s2">know that often means they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.799" end="00:29:12.520" style="s2">think about it and a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.120" end="00:29:15.490" style="s2">encouragement isn&#39;t in order and maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.520" end="00:29:17.409" style="s2">little bit of pressure but you want</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.490" end="00:29:19.240" style="s2">people to formulate a vision of what the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.409" end="00:29:21.250" style="s2">situation would look like if the problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.240" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">was solved and then they might find it</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.250" end="00:29:24.730" style="s2">very daunting because the solution looks</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:26.950" style="s2">so difficult that they don&#39;t see any</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.730" end="00:29:29.770" style="s2">pathway to it and so then the next part</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.950" end="00:29:31.659" style="s2">of the discussion is well are there some</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.770" end="00:29:34.210" style="s2">things that you could do that would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.659" end="00:29:36.370" style="s2">small steps that you would be interested</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.210" end="00:29:39.220" style="s2">in doing that you think you would do</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.370" end="00:29:41.320" style="s2">that would move you to the solution and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.220" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">maybe those things could be implemented</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.320" end="00:29:46.120" style="s2">tentatively and behavioral psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:47.559" style="s2">call that collaborative empiricism so</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.120" end="00:29:49.659" style="s2">you&#39;ll come and see a behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.559" end="00:29:51.370" style="s2">psychologist and lay out your problems</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.659" end="00:29:54.159" style="s2">and then the two of you will negotiate</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.370" end="00:29:56.649" style="s2">towards the beginnings of a solution</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.159" end="00:30:00.070" style="s2">what could you do this week that might</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.649" end="00:30:02.860" style="s2">make that problem slightly better and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.070" end="00:30:04.299" style="s2">you talk through what&#39;s practical and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.860" end="00:30:06.429" style="s2">what&#39;s implementable you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.299" end="00:30:08.740" style="s2">honest about that because you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.429" end="00:30:10.750" style="s2">to set yourself up with a plan that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.740" end="00:30:12.279" style="s2">complicated you won&#39;t implement it then</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.750" end="00:30:14.110" style="s2">you say to the person if you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.279" end="00:30:15.880" style="s2">psychologist you say well look we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.110" end="00:30:17.710" style="s2">a couple of ideas about what you can do</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.880" end="00:30:19.690" style="s2">this week that might make this situation</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.710" end="00:30:21.700" style="s2">slightly better why do you go and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.690" end="00:30:23.049" style="s2">implement them and then come back next</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.700" end="00:30:25.419" style="s2">week and we&#39;ll talk about whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.049" end="00:30:28.059" style="s2">that worked and work would be you did</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.419" end="00:30:29.770" style="s2">implement it and that it did have the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.059" end="00:30:32.529" style="s2">desired solution and if it didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.770" end="00:30:34.740" style="s2">meaning you didn&#39;t implement it or the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.529" end="00:30:36.850" style="s2">solution didn&#39;t emerge then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.740" end="00:30:39.309" style="s2">there&#39;s the opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.850" end="00:30:42.700" style="s2">renegotiation so you can think about it</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.309" end="00:30:44.500" style="s2">strategically the first issue is well if</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.700" end="00:30:46.390" style="s2">something needs to be sorted out the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.500" end="00:30:49.299" style="s2">first question is what the hell is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.390" end="00:30:51.190" style="s2">problem and the answer that is you</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.299" end="00:30:53.110" style="s2">probably don&#39;t know the problem is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.190" end="00:30:54.669" style="s2">upset and disturbed and angry and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.110" end="00:30:57.940" style="s2">resentful and bitter and unhappy and</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.669" end="00:31:00.010" style="s2">anxious and in pain and lonesome I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.940" end="00:31:01.870" style="s2">suffering from an excess of negative</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.010" end="00:31:03.940" style="s2">emotion and perhaps from a certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.870" end="00:31:05.380" style="s2">amount of hopelessness so the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.940" end="00:31:06.700" style="s2">the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.380" end="00:31:09.010" style="s2">circumstance and that might be</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.700" end="00:31:11.799" style="s2">associated with some real problems right</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.010" end="00:31:13.480" style="s2">some real practical problems so you lay</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.799" end="00:31:16.780" style="s2">all that out and say okay well what is</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.480" end="00:31:19.150" style="s2">the problem landscape look like right so</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.780" end="00:31:20.919" style="s2">that&#39;s the strategic move and then as I</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.150" end="00:31:23.410" style="s2">said that will generally simplify the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.919" end="00:31:24.789" style="s2">problem landscape then you do think the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.410" end="00:31:27.640" style="s2">same thing with a set of potential</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.789" end="00:31:30.010" style="s2">solutions well what would the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.640" end="00:31:31.660" style="s2">look like cuz you&#39;re not gonna be able</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.010" end="00:31:33.039" style="s2">to solve a problem unless you at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.660" end="00:31:35.679" style="s2">know what a solution might look like</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:37.840" style="s2">that would actually what would you say</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.679" end="00:31:40.270" style="s2">that would that you would find</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.840" end="00:31:42.250" style="s2">acceptable and then the next Pro issue</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.270" end="00:31:44.409" style="s2">is to lay out the strategies for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.250" end="00:31:46.809" style="s2">attainment of that solution and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.409" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">sometimes it might be some of these</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.809" end="00:31:50.919" style="s2">solutions might be dismal like you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:51.580" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got someone who&#39;s ill in your</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.919" end="00:31:55.210" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.580" end="00:31:57.490" style="s2">the solution might be well well we need</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.210" end="00:31:59.740" style="s2">a cure you know that&#39;s the only solution</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.490" end="00:32:02.530" style="s2">that will suffice but you don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.740" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">to pursue the cure or maybe one doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.530" end="00:32:09.010" style="s2">exist so then you have to think of well</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:11.770" style="s2">a lower order and less satisfying</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.010" end="00:32:13.659" style="s2">solution which would be well maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.770" end="00:32:15.340" style="s2">can cope we&#39;re gonna learn to cope with</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.659" end="00:32:19.179" style="s2">this so that it&#39;s the least amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.340" end="00:32:21.159" style="s2">Hell possible and and maybe that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.179" end="00:32:22.929" style="s2">that even that&#39;s too much you might have</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.159" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">to say well we&#39;re gonna try to make this</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.929" end="00:32:28.090" style="s2">next week when we&#39;re coping with this</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:30.940" style="s2">better than the last week you know and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.090" end="00:32:33.730" style="s2">and maybe you can&#39;t even do that it has</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.940" end="00:32:35.830" style="s2">to just be the next day you look for</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.730" end="00:32:38.020" style="s2">whatever small steps forward you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.830" end="00:32:40.450" style="s2">take that will make things less wretched</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.020" end="00:32:42.039" style="s2">and horrible than they currently are you</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.450" end="00:32:44.470" style="s2">know to put it rather bluntly</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.039" end="00:32:47.230" style="s2">and that requires the willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.470" end="00:32:48.820" style="s2">face the problem the humility to know</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.230" end="00:32:51.070" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have the solution at hand</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.820" end="00:32:53.190" style="s2">the willingness to listen to how the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.070" end="00:32:56.350" style="s2">other people that you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.190" end="00:32:58.330" style="s2">formulate the problems and formulate the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.350" end="00:33:00.280" style="s2">solutions it&#39;s crucially important right</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.330" end="00:33:02.409" style="s2">to have them do that work themselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.280" end="00:33:04.900" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s also you could think about it</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.409" end="00:33:06.809" style="s2">this way too is that if you listen to</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.900" end="00:33:10.470" style="s2">someone come up with a solution</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.809" end="00:33:13.179" style="s2">you don&#39;t undergo the neurological</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.470" end="00:33:15.280" style="s2">transformations necessary to change your</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.179" end="00:33:17.559" style="s2">character but if you come up with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.280" end="00:33:18.970" style="s2">solutions yourself you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.559" end="00:33:20.950" style="s2">articulate the problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.970" end="00:33:23.380" style="s2">you articulate the solutions then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.950" end="00:33:25.240" style="s2">changed your own character in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.380" end="00:33:27.400" style="s2">increases the probability that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.240" end="00:33:29.549" style="s2">going to act out what you do and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.400" end="00:33:32.230" style="s2">requires real patience to to let people</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.549" end="00:33:34.120" style="s2">stumble through to their own problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.230" end="00:33:35.710" style="s2">solutions because someone might lay out</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.120" end="00:33:37.240" style="s2">a set of problems and you think oh my</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.710" end="00:33:40.140" style="s2">god I know what you could do about that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.240" end="00:33:42.580" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t really matter if you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.140" end="00:33:45.640" style="s2">you know and I&#39;m also not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.580" end="00:33:47.350" style="s2">sometimes advice is helpful you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.640" end="00:33:49.179" style="s2">sometimes you can give someone a hint</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.350" end="00:33:50.980" style="s2">but man you have to be careful with that</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.179" end="00:33:53.950" style="s2">because there&#39;s a real element of theft</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.980" end="00:33:55.480" style="s2">that&#39;s associated okay with it now</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.950" end="00:33:57.789" style="s2">Richard also asked how can I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.480" end="00:33:59.710" style="s2">the resentments of my childhood in a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.789" end="00:34:04.450" style="s2">that benefits them instead of giving</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.710" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">them guilt I don&#39;t know if I can answer</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.450" end="00:34:13.060" style="s2">that question Richard because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">not a question that&#39;s see what I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.060" end="00:34:17.530" style="s2">ask if you came to talk to me and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:22.359" style="s2">had that question I would say first of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.530" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">all well what resentments list them out</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.359" end="00:34:28.750" style="s2">man write him down okay so that you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">what they are because all those each of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.750" end="00:34:32.139" style="s2">those resentments is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:34.839" style="s2">different thing and the strategy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.139" end="00:34:37.060" style="s2">associated with each might vary as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.839" end="00:34:39.010" style="s2">consequence of the particularity of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.060" end="00:34:40.899" style="s2">resentment so I would say you should</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.010" end="00:34:43.179" style="s2">start by writing them down like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.899" end="00:34:44.800" style="s2">your problem exactly here&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.179" end="00:34:46.690" style="s2">things that I can think of that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.800" end="00:34:49.389" style="s2">angry about with regard to my childhood</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.690" end="00:34:55.089" style="s2">write that down and then see which ones</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.389" end="00:34:56.560" style="s2">are still living and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.089" end="00:34:59.290" style="s2">figure out well what do you want from</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.560" end="00:35:01.510" style="s2">your parents exactly do you do you want</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.290" end="00:35:03.640" style="s2">them to apologize do you want them to</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.510" end="00:35:06.640" style="s2">understand what they did wrong do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.640" end="00:35:10.119" style="s2">want to punish them do you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:13.780" style="s2">let them get you let them learn to know</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.119" end="00:35:16.599" style="s2">you better do you want to change the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.780" end="00:35:19.089" style="s2">they&#39;re interacting with you now do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.599" end="00:35:20.650" style="s2">want to learn your own lessons from your</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.089" end="00:35:22.420" style="s2">bad experience so that when you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.650" end="00:35:24.849" style="s2">parent you don&#39;t make the same mistake</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.420" end="00:35:26.710" style="s2">you merely want to have a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.849" end="00:35:29.020" style="s2">express yourself like it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.710" end="00:35:30.660" style="s2">difficult to to answer your question</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.020" end="00:35:32.510" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know what your goal is</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.660" end="00:35:34.250" style="s2">right so but and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.510" end="00:35:36.770" style="s2">and I don&#39;t need to know you need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.250" end="00:35:38.090" style="s2">know what are the resentments so we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.770" end="00:35:38.690" style="s2">walk through the process where to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.090" end="00:35:40.790" style="s2">describe</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.690" end="00:35:43.580" style="s2">lay them out and comprehensively you</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.790" end="00:35:45.619" style="s2">might want to make a list of everything</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.580" end="00:35:47.570" style="s2">that you think you might conceivably be</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.619" end="00:35:50.000" style="s2">annoyed about with regards to your</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.570" end="00:35:52.460" style="s2">parents no matter how trivial right</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.000" end="00:35:57.590" style="s2">because that way you you scour your</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.460" end="00:36:00.680" style="s2">memory four four four four four things</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.590" end="00:36:02.840" style="s2">that you&#39;re holding onto in a bitter way</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.680" end="00:36:05.090" style="s2">and maybe you have your justification</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.840" end="00:36:07.220" style="s2">I&#39;m not suggesting that you don&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.090" end="00:36:08.330" style="s2">you need to discover what baggage you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.220" end="00:36:10.550" style="s2">carrying then you have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.330" end="00:36:14.470" style="s2">well what can I let go of and what score</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.550" end="00:36:17.060" style="s2">and I would say what&#39;s really core is if</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.470" end="00:36:19.220" style="s2">there are ways that your parents treated</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.060" end="00:36:20.930" style="s2">you that are still affecting you or that</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.220" end="00:36:23.540" style="s2">are affecting your relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.930" end="00:36:25.430" style="s2">them now those really need to be dealt</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.540" end="00:36:27.380" style="s2">with because they&#39;re not done they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.430" end="00:36:28.880" style="s2">not in the past right they&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.380" end="00:36:33.340" style="s2">resentments of your childhood they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.880" end="00:36:35.300" style="s2">still part of your ongoing life and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.340" end="00:36:37.490" style="s2">okay so now you have all your</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.300" end="00:36:40.100" style="s2">resentments laid out I guess I would say</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.490" end="00:36:41.600" style="s2">you know something like look mom and dad</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.100" end="00:36:43.310" style="s2">there&#39;s something I need to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.600" end="00:36:45.020" style="s2">about that&#39;s been bothering me for a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.310" end="00:36:47.300" style="s2">long time and I&#39;d pick one of the more</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.020" end="00:36:49.640" style="s2">trivial things to begin with like here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.300" end="00:36:51.380" style="s2">a memory I have and don&#39;t get all high</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.640" end="00:36:53.510" style="s2">and mighty about it because you know you</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.380" end="00:36:55.640" style="s2">might have misconstrued the situation as</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.510" end="00:36:57.260" style="s2">a child it&#39;s highly probable and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.640" end="00:36:59.420" style="s2">may have had their reasons and you may</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.260" end="00:37:01.250" style="s2">not even remember the situation let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.420" end="00:37:03.530" style="s2">say correctly or the way they remember</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.250" end="00:37:05.420" style="s2">to say well here&#39;s here&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.530" end="00:37:07.310" style="s2">happened when I was a kid in it it still</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.420" end="00:37:08.930" style="s2">bothers man do you remember what</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.310" end="00:37:10.850" style="s2">happened that&#39;s an open-ended question</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.930" end="00:37:13.250" style="s2">do you remember what happened why did</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.850" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">this why did this go this way and then I</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.250" end="00:37:17.300" style="s2">would do an awful lot of listening you</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.440" end="00:37:19.640" style="s2">know because you are trying to gather</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.300" end="00:37:21.140" style="s2">information and the more your parents</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.640" end="00:37:23.480" style="s2">can tell you about what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.140" end="00:37:27.109" style="s2">those situations I would say the better</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.480" end="00:37:29.840" style="s2">off you&#39;re likely to be so that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.109" end="00:37:31.790" style="s2">all I can say about that that&#39;s fairly</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.840" end="00:37:34.010" style="s2">delineated approach to general</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.790" end="00:37:37.250" style="s2">discussions about difficult things right</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.010" end="00:37:39.770" style="s2">but I would say don&#39;t be afraid of don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.250" end="00:37:41.930" style="s2">be more afraid of engaging in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.770" end="00:37:44.570" style="s2">process than you are afraid of not</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.930" end="00:37:45.110" style="s2">engaging in it like every relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.570" end="00:37:47.450" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.110" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">gonna have problems in it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.450" end="00:37:52.610" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to jump to a intense</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:56.510" style="s2">psychological discussion with every</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.610" end="00:37:59.540" style="s2">little bump but if if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.510" end="00:38:01.370" style="s2">of medium to long term permanence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.540" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">disturbing you or a pattern that repeats</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.370" end="00:38:06.560" style="s2">itself at least three times let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:08.810" style="s2">well then that might be something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.560" end="00:38:10.340" style="s2">worthy of discussion or your discovery</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.810" end="00:38:12.290" style="s2">that you&#39;re you know very dissatisfied</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.340" end="00:38:14.470" style="s2">with the way the relationship is going</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.290" end="00:38:17.150" style="s2">and you have to have the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.470" end="00:38:18.950" style="s2">necessary to sort that out and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.150" end="00:38:20.180" style="s2">going to be conflict with you and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.950" end="00:38:22.250" style="s2">car and the person that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.180" end="00:38:25.100" style="s2">to but the aim should be the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.250" end="00:38:29.150" style="s2">establishment of something like fully</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.100" end="00:38:31.550" style="s2">informed fully negotiated medium to long</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.150" end="00:38:34.420" style="s2">term peace that&#39;s what you&#39;re aiming at</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.550" end="00:38:34.420" style="s2">if you have any sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.640" end="00:38:53.160" style="s2">Oh Cody said it took me seven months but</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.300" end="00:38:55.890" style="s2">I completed all the self authoring suit</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.160" end="00:38:58.740" style="s2">in July I&#39;m still not motivated to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.890" end="00:39:04.470" style="s2">anything and waste all of my time what</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.740" end="00:39:07.020" style="s2">do I do well well the first question is</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.470" end="00:39:09.240" style="s2">is it true that you&#39;re not motivated to</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.020" end="00:39:11.790" style="s2">do anything and is it true that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.240" end="00:39:13.590" style="s2">waste all of your time it seems highly</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.790" end="00:39:16.410" style="s2">unlikely to me that both of those things</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.590" end="00:39:18.840" style="s2">are a hundred percent true so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.410" end="00:39:21.060" style="s2">things you might notice is are there</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.840" end="00:39:23.160" style="s2">anything is there anything that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.060" end="00:39:24.660" style="s2">motivated to do presume you&#39;re motivated</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.160" end="00:39:28.170" style="s2">to eat although perhaps not and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.660" end="00:39:31.470" style="s2">being smart about this um partly what I</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.170" end="00:39:34.680" style="s2">would say is two things you might need</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.470" end="00:39:38.250" style="s2">some smaller goals like you have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.680" end="00:39:41.670" style="s2">shrink your goals to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.250" end="00:39:43.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve established a plan forward that</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.670" end="00:39:45.360" style="s2">consists of steps that not only you</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.800" end="00:39:48.330" style="s2">would be willing to take but that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.360" end="00:39:50.370" style="s2">would take and so some of that humility</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.330" end="00:39:52.290" style="s2">it&#39;s like man I&#39;m stuck I can barely do</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.370" end="00:39:54.000" style="s2">anything it&#39;s okay like well I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.290" end="00:39:56.310" style="s2">laying in bed for seven hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:59.400" style="s2">well could I lay in bed for six hours</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.310" end="00:40:01.320" style="s2">and six and a half hours tomorrow you</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:04.050" style="s2">know or while I&#39;m in bed could I do</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.320" end="00:40:06.030" style="s2">something somewhat useful could I read a</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.050" end="00:40:08.520" style="s2">book and I read one page of a book can I</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.030" end="00:40:11.220" style="s2">read a paragraph of a book you have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.520" end="00:40:14.400" style="s2">find that those steps forward that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.220" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">would take I really think it&#39;s useful to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.400" end="00:40:18.990" style="s2">make friends with something like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:20.730" style="s2">Google Calendar you know or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.990" end="00:40:23.970" style="s2">calendar program you might want to use</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.730" end="00:40:25.560" style="s2">and start designing days that you would</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.970" end="00:40:27.270" style="s2">like to have because that&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.560" end="00:40:29.100" style="s2">way to use a calendar and everyone out</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.270" end="00:40:30.870" style="s2">there that&#39;s listening you should you</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.100" end="00:40:33.540" style="s2">should use a calendar to structure your</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.870" end="00:40:35.310" style="s2">days because if you know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.540" end="00:40:37.530" style="s2">doing tomorrow it decreases your</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.310" end="00:40:39.720" style="s2">anxieties substantially because you need</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.530" end="00:40:42.630" style="s2">that kind of structure you need a</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.720" end="00:40:44.190" style="s2">pathway you need to know you need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.630" end="00:40:45.780" style="s2">have a map and you need to know where</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.190" end="00:40:47.460" style="s2">you&#39;re located on the map and you need</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.780" end="00:40:49.290" style="s2">to know how you&#39;re moving forward and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.460" end="00:40:51.560" style="s2">that gives you hope because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.290" end="00:40:54.450" style="s2">moving towards goals that you regard as</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.560" end="00:40:55.890" style="s2">worthwhile and it stops you from being</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.450" end="00:40:58.740" style="s2">anxious because you&#39;re not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.890" end="00:41:01.170" style="s2">directionless and lost and so learning</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.740" end="00:41:02.819" style="s2">how to manage your time is useful</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.170" end="00:41:04.500" style="s2">you can start with a calendar you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.819" end="00:41:07.200" style="s2">start with simple things like you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.500" end="00:41:09.380" style="s2">put in well when you&#39;re likely to go to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.200" end="00:41:11.609" style="s2">bed and when you&#39;re likely to get up and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.380" end="00:41:14.579" style="s2">regulating that&#39;s useful that should be</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.609" end="00:41:16.770" style="s2">relatively ritualistically consistent</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.579" end="00:41:18.540" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to get your life in</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.770" end="00:41:23.339" style="s2">order if your sleep-wake schedule is</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.540" end="00:41:26.940" style="s2">completely random or if it&#39;s not aligned</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.339" end="00:41:29.250" style="s2">with like day and night and if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.940" end="00:41:31.859" style="s2">aligned with the normative practices of</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.250" end="00:41:33.809" style="s2">other people and so you may have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.859" end="00:41:35.490" style="s2">learn to get your sleep wake cycle</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.809" end="00:41:37.319" style="s2">regulated properly and then the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.490" end="00:41:39.900" style="s2">with your eating schedule those are very</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.319" end="00:41:41.640" style="s2">basic things and you can do that badly</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.900" end="00:41:43.770" style="s2">but that&#39;s what you want to approximate</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.640" end="00:41:46.010" style="s2">three meals a day let&#39;s say because</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.770" end="00:41:52.109" style="s2">that&#39;s what people do normatively and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.010" end="00:41:54.329" style="s2">and then you have to add small goals now</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.109" end="00:41:56.369" style="s2">if that doesn&#39;t work like if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.329" end="00:41:58.470" style="s2">make the goals small enough to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.369" end="00:42:00.540" style="s2">you know it might be that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.470" end="00:42:03.329" style="s2">being humble enough with regards to your</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.540" end="00:42:04.980" style="s2">conceptions of your own ability but you</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.329" end="00:42:07.650" style="s2">can tell if the goal that you put</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.980" end="00:42:09.359" style="s2">forward is a reasonable one if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.650" end="00:42:11.160" style="s2">actually implementing it because if</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.359" end="00:42:13.410" style="s2">you&#39;re not then by definition it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.160" end="00:42:15.210" style="s2">reasonable goal you know like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.410" end="00:42:16.980" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re sleeping all the time in</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.210" end="00:42:19.319" style="s2">your room is just a bloody complete</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.980" end="00:42:20.940" style="s2">disaster you know and you think well I</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.319" end="00:42:23.190" style="s2">should clean up my room it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.940" end="00:42:25.500" style="s2">maybe you can&#39;t but maybe tomorrow you</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.190" end="00:42:27.599" style="s2">could hang up two shirts you know or you</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.500" end="00:42:29.940" style="s2">could we could move two shirts from your</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.599" end="00:42:32.160" style="s2">bedroom to the laundry room or you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.940" end="00:42:34.170" style="s2">bag up a bag of dirty clothes but you</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:36.470" style="s2">could conceivably take to a laundromat</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.170" end="00:42:39.660" style="s2">and you just do that one thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.470" end="00:42:41.670" style="s2">if you do if your room&#39;s a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.660" end="00:42:44.549" style="s2">and you do that one thing and then you</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.670" end="00:42:46.890" style="s2">did one thing like that for 15 days or</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.549" end="00:42:49.710" style="s2">20 days maybe your place would be in</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.890" end="00:42:52.650" style="s2">order and so the trick is to get the</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.710" end="00:42:54.119" style="s2">trajectory right and Kody if you if that</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.650" end="00:42:56.069" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work then you&#39;re gonna need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.119" end="00:42:59.790" style="s2">talk to somebody you know maybe you need</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.069" end="00:43:01.849" style="s2">a partner that that that you can discuss</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.790" end="00:43:04.260" style="s2">these things with where you both have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.849" end="00:43:05.819" style="s2">commitment like a mutual commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.260" end="00:43:07.470" style="s2">attaining a certain set of goals</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.819" end="00:43:09.780" style="s2">you know that could be a friend it could</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.470" end="00:43:11.990" style="s2">be somebody that you find online it</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.780" end="00:43:14.540" style="s2">could be and it could be a professional</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.990" end="00:43:16.700" style="s2">but if you find that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.540" end="00:43:18.200" style="s2">self cannot you just can&#39;t get this</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.700" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">going then you&#39;re gonna have to reach</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.200" end="00:43:22.100" style="s2">out to someone else to give you a hand</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:25.010" style="s2">maybe you need to sit down with a parent</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.100" end="00:43:28.940" style="s2">or a friend or somebody that you love</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.010" end="00:43:30.440" style="s2">and go over the self authoring suite</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.940" end="00:43:32.840" style="s2">with them to go over the future</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.440" end="00:43:35.360" style="s2">authoring plans and to discuss how that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.840" end="00:43:37.730" style="s2">might be implemented you know because if</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.360" end="00:43:39.500" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it on your own then and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.730" end="00:43:42.490" style="s2">maybe you shouldn&#39;t have to then you</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.500" end="00:43:46.760" style="s2">have to reach out to other people and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.490" end="00:43:48.440" style="s2">make your goals smaller see if you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.760" end="00:43:50.060" style="s2">make friends with a schedule or a</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.440" end="00:43:51.620" style="s2">calendar this is really important all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.060" end="00:43:54.680" style="s2">you out there who aren&#39;t doing this like</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.620" end="00:43:57.320" style="s2">I would say all of the people that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.680" end="00:44:02.420" style="s2">know who have become successful in any</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.320" end="00:44:05.150" style="s2">way use a structured means to organize</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.420" end="00:44:07.580" style="s2">their time they have lists of things to</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.150" end="00:44:10.400" style="s2">do like they have everyday there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.580" end="00:44:12.620" style="s2">list of things to do that day every week</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.400" end="00:44:15.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a list of things to do that week</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.620" end="00:44:18.320" style="s2">every month there&#39;s a list of things to</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.320" end="00:44:23.840" style="s2">temporal resolution there&#39;s a sequence</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.840" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">of plans and those plans are implemented</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.840" end="00:44:29.840" style="s2">on a day to day basis you cannot be and</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:31.580" style="s2">successful isn&#39;t the right way of</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.840" end="00:44:33.470" style="s2">thinking about it because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.580" end="00:44:35.330" style="s2">thinking about you know I&#39;m not really</p>

<p begin="00:44:35.330" end="00:44:38.750" style="s2">ladder you know you know what I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.220" end="00:44:40.850" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of what success has come to</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.750" end="00:44:44.180" style="s2">mean in our culture that isn&#39;t what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.850" end="00:44:47.600" style="s2">mean you can&#39;t have a life that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.600" end="00:44:54.200" style="s2">because you need the vision and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:55.910" style="s2">plans to give you purpose and direction</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.200" end="00:44:58.850" style="s2">that&#39;s where all your positive emotion</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.910" end="00:45:01.400" style="s2">comes from all your motivation is laying</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.850" end="00:45:03.830" style="s2">out plans that are worth attaining and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.400" end="00:45:06.560" style="s2">then observing yourself moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.830" end="00:45:08.870" style="s2">them that&#39;s the source of most positive</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.560" end="00:45:11.810" style="s2">meaning and then also without that</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.870" end="00:45:13.370" style="s2">structure you&#39;re so lost that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.810" end="00:45:15.050" style="s2">going to be anxious and overwhelmed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.370" end="00:45:18.740" style="s2">really like being in a foreign country</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.050" end="00:45:20.630" style="s2">like isolated and alone with no map I</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.740" end="00:45:22.610" style="s2">don&#39;t know where the hell I am I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.630" end="00:45:24.350" style="s2">know what the hell I&#39;m doing you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.610" end="00:45:26.180" style="s2">the rains are going to come and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.350" end="00:45:26.990" style="s2">storms are going to come and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.180" end="00:45:28.910" style="s2">winter</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.990" end="00:45:31.460" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know where I am or where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.910" end="00:45:33.980" style="s2">going and then the last thing Cody is</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.460" end="00:45:35.450" style="s2">like rely on some other people man</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.980" end="00:45:38.180" style="s2">you know maybe you&#39;ll be able to return</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.450" end="00:45:39.890" style="s2">the favor in the future I know you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.180" end="00:45:42.020" style="s2">feel bad maybe that you have to go to</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.890" end="00:45:43.670" style="s2">someone else you feel weak and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.020" end="00:45:45.830" style="s2">that you&#39;re taking advantage of them but</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.670" end="00:45:49.369" style="s2">people like to be helpful they really do</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.830" end="00:45:51.770" style="s2">and and so it&#39;s a mark of trust in</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.369" end="00:45:53.960" style="s2">someone and confidence in them that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.770" end="00:45:57.800" style="s2">would ask to have a serious conversation</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.960" end="00:45:59.480" style="s2">with them and so and if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.800" end="00:46:01.100" style="s2">someone like that then you need to find</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.480" end="00:46:03.680" style="s2">somebody like that and maybe that means</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.100" end="00:46:05.570" style="s2">you have to interact more in online</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.680" end="00:46:07.490" style="s2">communities or maybe you have to get the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.570" end="00:46:09.380" style="s2">hell out there in the world there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.490" end="00:46:10.820" style="s2">of meetup groups and that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.380" end="00:46:13.070" style="s2">online that have organized themselves</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.820" end="00:46:14.810" style="s2">and you can go there and hide in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.070" end="00:46:16.670" style="s2">back for a while and not talk to anybody</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.810" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">but you&#39;re gonna get it I get the hell</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.670" end="00:46:21.050" style="s2">out there and and you know make some</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:24.080" style="s2">social connections because you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.050" end="00:46:26.150" style="s2">live alone we&#39;re social creatures and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.080" end="00:46:27.650" style="s2">you need help and maybe you&#39;ll be able</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.150" end="00:46:33.080" style="s2">to offer some help at some point in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.650" end="00:46:36.500" style="s2">future too so well okay Rose says I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.080" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">consumed by envy I can hardly stand to</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.500" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">read or watch or listen to anyone more</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:43.730" style="s2">successful than myself in what</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:45.530" style="s2">directions have my aiming wrong okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.730" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">well look Rose it&#39;s pretty damn useful</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.530" end="00:46:49.010" style="s2">to figure out that you&#39;re consumed by</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:51.980" style="s2">envy that&#39;s a good start you know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.010" end="00:46:54.290" style="s2">that&#39;s a real self-realization and an</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.980" end="00:46:59.810" style="s2">important one okay so the first thing we</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.290" end="00:47:02.450" style="s2">might ask is well it&#39;s it&#39;s likely</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.810" end="00:47:05.900" style="s2">reasonable for you to observe that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.450" end="00:47:08.390" style="s2">that&#39;s not optimal for you right because</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.900" end="00:47:10.940" style="s2">envy that&#39;s that resentment that I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.390" end="00:47:14.300" style="s2">talking about earlier or even worse than</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.940" end="00:47:17.420" style="s2">jealousy it&#39;s like it it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.300" end="00:47:19.970" style="s2">pleasant phenomenological state it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.420" end="00:47:24.410" style="s2">a pleasant state of experience okay so</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.970" end="00:47:26.660" style="s2">look let&#39;s look at it this way well what</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.410" end="00:47:28.490" style="s2">are you envious of you know you say I</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.660" end="00:47:30.410" style="s2">can hardly stand to read or watch or</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.490" end="00:47:34.130" style="s2">listen to anyone more successful than</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.410" end="00:47:35.990" style="s2">myself well that&#39;s pretty vague Rose and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.130" end="00:47:38.480" style="s2">you want to tighten up your envy a bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.990" end="00:47:40.110" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;ll find that there are</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.480" end="00:47:42.090" style="s2">certain people that you&#39;re predicting</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.110" end="00:47:45.510" style="s2">the envious of another issues</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.090" end="00:47:48.840" style="s2">accomplishments really don&#39;t disturb you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.510" end="00:47:51.330" style="s2">let&#39;s say so the first thing you want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.840" end="00:47:53.910" style="s2">do is figure out which people it is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.330" end="00:47:55.710" style="s2">you&#39;re particularly envious of and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.910" end="00:47:58.860" style="s2">you want to figure out well what is it</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.710" end="00:48:00.570" style="s2">that you think they have now you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.860" end="00:48:02.840" style="s2">they probably have a lot more problems</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.570" end="00:48:05.160" style="s2">than you think and so part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.840" end="00:48:06.930" style="s2">pathology of envy is that you look at</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.160" end="00:48:09.180" style="s2">someone who&#39;s successful and you assume</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.930" end="00:48:11.130" style="s2">that that success defines them across</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.180" end="00:48:13.050" style="s2">all the important dimensions of their</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.130" end="00:48:15.690" style="s2">life and that&#39;s rarely the case</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.050" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">and so you know there&#39;s a naive optimism</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.690" end="00:48:20.220" style="s2">and envy and that&#39;s reflected in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:22.680" style="s2">fact that you think that the person</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.220" end="00:48:24.720" style="s2">you&#39;re jealous of has everything that a</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.680" end="00:48:27.000" style="s2">person would need and that&#39;s rarely the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.720" end="00:48:31.200" style="s2">case but that&#39;s somewhat besides the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.000" end="00:48:33.870" style="s2">point look in your Envy lurks the</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.200" end="00:48:36.420" style="s2">beginnings of a structure of ambition</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.870" end="00:48:38.220" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t be envious of something if</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.420" end="00:48:40.560" style="s2">you didn&#39;t believe that that was a value</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.220" end="00:48:42.360" style="s2">that you should possess okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.560" end="00:48:44.340" style="s2">first thing is make a list of all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.360" end="00:48:46.530" style="s2">people you&#39;re envious of and then figure</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.340" end="00:48:48.810" style="s2">out what it is about them that you envy</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.530" end="00:48:51.180" style="s2">okay now those are your goals all of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.810" end="00:48:53.070" style="s2">sudden right now you might be doubtful</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.180" end="00:48:54.900" style="s2">that you can attain those goals and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.070" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the goals would be you</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.900" end="00:48:59.040" style="s2">know like maybe it&#39;s beauty for God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:49:00.840" style="s2">sake maybe you&#39;re envious maybe just for</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.040" end="00:49:03.060" style="s2">the sake of argument you assume that</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.840" end="00:49:04.530" style="s2">you&#39;re not a very good-looking person we</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.060" end="00:49:06.720" style="s2">can assume you&#39;re not blessed by the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.530" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">same set of physical attributes that a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.720" end="00:49:11.210" style="s2">Hollywood starlet might manifest you</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:13.350" style="s2">know and maybe you&#39;re envious of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.210" end="00:49:16.860" style="s2">it&#39;s like why you might start to think</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.350" end="00:49:18.120" style="s2">well in first of all you might think</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.860" end="00:49:20.700" style="s2">about whether or not there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.120" end="00:49:24.480" style="s2">dimensions of evaluation along which</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.700" end="00:49:26.610" style="s2">someone might be judged that are as</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.480" end="00:49:28.710" style="s2">important or more important than</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.610" end="00:49:31.260" style="s2">physical attractiveness right because</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.710" end="00:49:33.210" style="s2">there&#39;s multi there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.260" end="00:49:35.310" style="s2">dimensions along which a person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.210" end="00:49:38.040" style="s2">positive attributes might be rank</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.310" end="00:49:40.440" style="s2">ordered and considered so you might want</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.040" end="00:49:43.140" style="s2">to broaden out your conceptualization of</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.440" end="00:49:46.080" style="s2">what constitutes the good in human</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.140" end="00:49:47.730" style="s2">action but then like if it is a matter</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.080" end="00:49:49.650" style="s2">of attractiveness then you may have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.730" end="00:49:51.000" style="s2">and I&#39;m picking this one because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.650" end="00:49:52.890" style="s2">particularly difficult one</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.000" end="00:49:53.670" style="s2">attractiveness it&#39;s like well what could</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.890" end="00:49:56.130" style="s2">you do</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.670" end="00:49:57.480" style="s2">how often do you get your haircut that</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.130" end="00:49:59.460" style="s2">is it flattering you have someone</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.480" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">professional doing it do you know how to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.460" end="00:50:05.220" style="s2">use makeup properly and carefully you</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:07.349" style="s2">know are you in reasonable physical</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.220" end="00:50:08.940" style="s2">condition or are there other steps that</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.349" end="00:50:11.010" style="s2">you could take to put yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.940" end="00:50:13.319" style="s2">reasonable physical condition do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.010" end="00:50:15.599" style="s2">have some nice clothes like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.319" end="00:50:17.880" style="s2">matter of decomposition so let&#39;s assume</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.599" end="00:50:19.740" style="s2">we&#39;ll be optimistic about this you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.880" end="00:50:21.720" style="s2">envious okay well that means there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.740" end="00:50:23.490" style="s2">some things you value you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.720" end="00:50:26.579" style="s2">them but it&#39;s the beginnings of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.490" end="00:50:28.440" style="s2">philosophical stance so you lay out what</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.579" end="00:50:30.119" style="s2">it is you&#39;re envious about and you think</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.440" end="00:50:32.039" style="s2">well these persons these people have</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.119" end="00:50:34.890" style="s2">this and this and this and this and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.039" end="00:50:37.769" style="s2">don&#39;t and that&#39;s unfair and it might be</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.890" end="00:50:41.519" style="s2">unfair it&#39;s probably not an unfairness</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.769" end="00:50:44.010" style="s2">that specifically aimed at you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.519" end="00:50:46.230" style="s2">probably more a general reflection of</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.010" end="00:50:48.150" style="s2">the unfairness and the inequality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.230" end="00:50:50.940" style="s2">part of life and that&#39;s worth knowing</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.150" end="00:50:53.490" style="s2">but in any case you lay out your envy</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.940" end="00:50:55.529" style="s2">and you and you delve deep into it and</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.490" end="00:50:58.109" style="s2">you find out well here&#39;s what I want</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.529" end="00:50:59.880" style="s2">because you&#39;re in these envious because</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.109" end="00:51:02.009" style="s2">you see other people that have what you</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.880" end="00:51:04.039" style="s2">want okay good now all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.009" end="00:51:06.119" style="s2">know what you want well that&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.039" end="00:51:08.160" style="s2">terrifying because you might see that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.119" end="00:51:11.130" style="s2">it&#39;s so distant from you but you can at</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.160" end="00:51:13.019" style="s2">least lay out and then maybe even admit</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.130" end="00:51:16.019" style="s2">to yourself what you want because the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.019" end="00:51:18.630" style="s2">other thing is is that you&#39;d be unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.019" end="00:51:22.740" style="s2">to be so envious if you weren&#39;t hiding</p>

<p begin="00:51:24.809" end="00:51:28.349" style="s2">admit it because well once you admit it</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.970" end="00:51:31.079" style="s2">then you know what you want and you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.349" end="00:51:32.940" style="s2">when you&#39;re failing you know and and by</p>

<p begin="00:51:32.940" end="00:51:37.109" style="s2">then you can hide to some degree the</p>

<p begin="00:51:37.109" end="00:51:41.490" style="s2">you&#39;re failing and and it&#39;s no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.509" end="00:51:44.130" style="s2">that people do that so make a list of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.490" end="00:51:46.170" style="s2">what you&#39;re envious of extract from that</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.130" end="00:51:48.599" style="s2">the virtues that you would like to</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.940" end="00:52:01.829" style="s2">thing and so make a plan here&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.390" end="00:52:04.610" style="s2">things that other people have that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.829" end="00:52:06.820" style="s2">want how can I start to move</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.610" end="00:52:09.290" style="s2">words having some of that myself and</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.820" end="00:52:11.870" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s the right way to deal</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.290" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">with it so because the other what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.870" end="00:52:16.580" style="s2">alternative you&#39;re gonna tear these</p>

<p begin="00:52:24.920" end="00:52:31.490" style="s2">consumed by envy right and that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.970" end="00:52:33.620" style="s2">that&#39;s a predator metaphor Envy is</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.490" end="00:52:36.170" style="s2">something that&#39;s eating you up god</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.620" end="00:52:38.330" style="s2">that&#39;s not good you know but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.170" end="00:52:39.890" style="s2">good that you&#39;ve at least admitted it</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.330" end="00:52:42.320" style="s2">that start part of that confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.890" end="00:52:44.240" style="s2">with the shadow so you can see your dark</p>

<p begin="00:52:47.510" end="00:52:52.010" style="s2">pretty damn brutal fantasies I wish this</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.970" end="00:52:53.870" style="s2">is what would happen to that person know</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.010" end="00:52:55.910" style="s2">God they think they&#39;re so smart it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.870" end="00:52:57.500" style="s2">like I hope they fall and I get a chance</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.910" end="00:52:59.420" style="s2">to kick them while I&#39;m down well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.500" end="00:53:00.800" style="s2">down maybe you could join a Twitter mob</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.420" end="00:53:03.950" style="s2">and take them out if they make a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.800" end="00:53:05.840" style="s2">you know but that can also get you in</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.950" end="00:53:08.930" style="s2">touch with the dark side of you that</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.840" end="00:53:11.270" style="s2">maybe has the ability to to put forward</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.930" end="00:53:12.920" style="s2">some commitment to moving forward in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.270" end="00:53:15.470" style="s2">future that can make you tough and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.920" end="00:53:18.110" style="s2">strong and so you might also start with</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.470" end="00:53:20.780" style="s2">the consideration that you could move in</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.110" end="00:53:22.340" style="s2">the direction that you desire right if</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.780" end="00:53:24.770" style="s2">you are willing to make the proper</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.340" end="00:53:26.900" style="s2">sacrifices I&#39;m willing to do the work</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.770" end="00:53:29.150" style="s2">and maybe if you can find out what would</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.900" end="00:53:31.880" style="s2">truly motivate you which might be the</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.150" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">desire to cease being consumed by Envy</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.880" end="00:53:37.460" style="s2">that would be a good start and then to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:39.200" style="s2">pursue these goals that are implicit in</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.460" end="00:53:42.920" style="s2">your jealousy well then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.200" end="00:53:45.430" style="s2">direction for your life so in what</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.920" end="00:53:48.530" style="s2">directions are you aiming wrong well</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.430" end="00:53:51.020" style="s2">you&#39;re assuming that you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.530" end="00:53:52.490" style="s2">unfairly treated and that it&#39;s and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.020" end="00:53:54.500" style="s2">there&#39;s something personal about that</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.490" end="00:53:56.390" style="s2">now you probably are being unfairly</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.500" end="00:53:58.340" style="s2">treated in some sense because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.390" end="00:54:00.590" style="s2">just the human condition I would say</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.340" end="00:54:02.450" style="s2">like there&#39;s a real arbitrary element of</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.590" end="00:54:05.210" style="s2">life you&#39;re subject to the depredations</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.450" end="00:54:09.920" style="s2">of nature and the tyranny of culture and</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.210" end="00:54:13.010" style="s2">your own appalling shortcomings you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.920" end="00:54:15.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s life it&#39;s not personal</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.010" end="00:54:17.960" style="s2">exactly and that&#39;s worth knowing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.050" end="00:54:20.450" style="s2">part of the standard human condition</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.960" end="00:54:22.130" style="s2">you should aim at rectifying your envy</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.450" end="00:54:23.660" style="s2">and some of that&#39;s going to be dropping</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.130" end="00:54:25.130" style="s2">that bitter resentment and the other is</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.660" end="00:54:28.579" style="s2">going to be pursuing what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.130" end="00:54:32.420" style="s2">pursue to allow you to view your life as</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.579" end="00:54:34.369" style="s2">at least acceptable right so so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.420" end="00:54:37.930" style="s2">hope in the enve once you admit it</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.369" end="00:54:37.930" style="s2">because it gives you a moral direction</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.200" end="00:54:43.880" style="s2">hello dr. Peterson what would you advise</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.359" end="00:54:45.859" style="s2">to a person who has the courage to defy</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.880" end="00:54:59.349" style="s2">the crowd but doesn&#39;t have the verbal</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.859" end="00:55:02.030" style="s2">skills to debate real-time well look</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.349" end="00:55:04.400" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of ways of defining the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.030" end="00:55:06.559" style="s2">crowd let&#39;s say I mean you could live</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.400" end="00:55:09.650" style="s2">your life the way that you want live it</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.559" end="00:55:11.390" style="s2">that&#39;s a matter of action you know and</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.650" end="00:55:14.089" style="s2">they say actions speak louder than words</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.390" end="00:55:17.380" style="s2">and one of the best things you could</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.089" end="00:55:21.010" style="s2">possibly be is a inspirational example</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.380" end="00:55:24.160" style="s2">so that&#39;s not nothing</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.010" end="00:55:29.240" style="s2">that&#39;s that something live properly in</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.160" end="00:55:32.839" style="s2">your defiance of the crowd right make</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.240" end="00:55:34.849" style="s2">your own course allow yourself to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.839" end="00:55:36.920" style="s2">guided by your own genuine principles</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.849" end="00:55:38.690" style="s2">you don&#39;t necessarily have to advertise</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.920" end="00:55:40.839" style="s2">that which is in some sense what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.690" end="00:55:43.490" style="s2">doing when you when you&#39;re debating</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.839" end="00:55:45.049" style="s2">because you&#39;re taking the manner in</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.490" end="00:55:46.430" style="s2">which you act like if you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.049" end="00:55:49.910" style="s2">integrated person and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.430" end="00:55:51.410" style="s2">articulating that but maybe you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.910" end="00:55:52.910" style="s2">that because you don&#39;t have the verbal</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.410" end="00:55:54.530" style="s2">skills well then the question would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.910" end="00:55:57.319" style="s2">maybe you should develop some more</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.530" end="00:55:59.660" style="s2">verbal skills like I don&#39;t know this for</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.319" end="00:56:02.619" style="s2">sure Dave you know but but generally</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.660" end="00:56:07.369" style="s2">it&#39;s useful how do you do that</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.619" end="00:56:09.349" style="s2">doesn&#39;t hurt to read really doesn&#39;t hurt</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.369" end="00:56:10.730" style="s2">to write you know a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.349" end="00:56:12.790" style="s2">writing every day clarifies your</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.730" end="00:56:15.530" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s a hard thing to do and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.790" end="00:56:18.319" style="s2">it&#39;s an unlikely thing most people won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.530" end="00:56:20.210" style="s2">do it but man you know you wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.319" end="00:56:23.049" style="s2">asking me this question if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.210" end="00:56:25.760" style="s2">think at some level that some</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.049" end="00:56:28.430" style="s2">improvement in your verbal ability would</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.760" end="00:56:31.000" style="s2">be useful to you well so how do you do</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.430" end="00:56:33.580" style="s2">that you read you</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.000" end="00:56:35.470" style="s2">think you&#39;re right the reason you write</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.580" end="00:56:37.720" style="s2">is because writing forces you to</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.470" end="00:56:39.880" style="s2">articulate your thoughts it organizes</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.720" end="00:56:40.810" style="s2">your brain around whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.880" end="00:56:43.630" style="s2">you&#39;re writing about it</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.810" end="00:56:45.850" style="s2">one of the easiest ways to write there</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.630" end="00:56:47.710" style="s2">isn&#39;t any real easy way but the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.850" end="00:56:50.020" style="s2">ways to write is to write down a problem</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.710" end="00:56:52.570" style="s2">it&#39;s like what&#39;s what what problem is</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.020" end="00:56:54.580" style="s2">bothering me we can write about that</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.570" end="00:56:56.650" style="s2">first of all to get the problem clear</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.580" end="00:56:58.750" style="s2">because that&#39;s a hard thing then you</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.650" end="00:57:01.390" style="s2">start to write about what my possible</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.750" end="00:57:03.010" style="s2">solutions be and if you fight with those</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.390" end="00:57:06.040" style="s2">solutions because you know you want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.010" end="00:57:08.410" style="s2">kill off the stupid ones and then you</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.040" end="00:57:13.690" style="s2">know maybe you need to learn to speak</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.410" end="00:57:17.860" style="s2">more fluently maybe you need to what</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.690" end="00:57:22.510" style="s2">what might we say you could try a class</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.860" end="00:57:26.920" style="s2">in improvisation and maybe that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.510" end="00:57:30.850" style="s2">daunting you could join a speaker&#39;s club</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.920" end="00:57:33.430" style="s2">like Toastmasters you could try talking</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.850" end="00:57:34.810" style="s2">more at dinner parties a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.430" end="00:57:37.390" style="s2">once you formulate your thoughts you</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.810" end="00:57:39.060" style="s2">have to be willing to be somewhat of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.390" end="00:57:42.340" style="s2">bumbling fool to begin with right</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.060" end="00:57:43.900" style="s2">because you&#39;re gonna not if and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.340" end="00:57:45.400" style="s2">you&#39;re better your verbal skills are</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.900" end="00:57:47.980" style="s2">better than you think they are you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.400" end="00:57:49.510" style="s2">and you&#39;re just self-conscious but you</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.980" end="00:57:52.510" style="s2">have to practice putting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.510" end="00:57:54.370" style="s2">forward a little bit and tentatively you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.510" end="00:57:56.320" style="s2">can do a lot of that you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.370" end="00:57:59.710" style="s2">that initial learning how to interact</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.320" end="00:58:02.020" style="s2">with people though by asking them</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.710" end="00:58:03.880" style="s2">questions about what they think and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.020" end="00:58:05.470" style="s2">responding instead of being too</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.880" end="00:58:08.020" style="s2">concerned about putting your old point</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.470" end="00:58:08.590" style="s2">forward so all right so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.020" end="00:58:10.720" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.590" end="00:58:12.610" style="s2">what would I advise to the person who</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.720" end="00:58:15.640" style="s2">has the courage to defy the crowd good</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.610" end="00:58:18.430" style="s2">live according to your principles right</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.640" end="00:58:20.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s not a verbal thing and you</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.430" end="00:58:23.220" style="s2">can be a good example and that&#39;s a major</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.440" end="00:58:25.810" style="s2">accomplishment but then if you need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.220" end="00:58:27.310" style="s2">improve your verbal ability which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.810" end="00:58:33.840" style="s2">generally a good thing then those are</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.310" end="00:58:37.840" style="s2">the ways to do it read write speak and</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.840" end="00:58:39.730" style="s2">and and understand that developing those</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.840" end="00:58:41.290" style="s2">abilities might be of tremendous use to</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.730" end="00:58:42.760" style="s2">you you know because it&#39;s one thing to</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.290" end="00:58:43.420" style="s2">live properly and that&#39;s not a trivial</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.760" end="00:58:45.220" style="s2">thing but it</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.420" end="00:58:47.880" style="s2">another thing to be able to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.220" end="00:58:50.380" style="s2">yourself and to be able to negotiate and</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.880" end="00:58:52.599" style="s2">generally speaking there&#39;s nothing about</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.380" end="00:58:55.420" style="s2">that that isn&#39;t advantageous and even</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.599" end="00:58:57.309" style="s2">introverted and anxious people can learn</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.420" end="00:58:59.650" style="s2">to do that you know it&#39;s those are</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.309" end="00:59:04.299" style="s2">learnable skills it&#39;s not easy but but</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.650" end="00:59:06.220" style="s2">but you can manage it you can also you</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.299" end="00:59:07.960" style="s2">can also speak carefully you know and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.220" end="00:59:09.520" style="s2">listen to what you&#39;re saying and only</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.960" end="00:59:12.250" style="s2">try to say things that you think are</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.520" end="00:59:14.410" style="s2">true that&#39;s also unbelievably useful you</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.250" end="00:59:16.630" style="s2">have to feel that out like is this</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.410" end="00:59:18.579" style="s2">really what I believe or am i putting it</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.630" end="00:59:22.750" style="s2">forward well because I want to look good</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.579" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">or I want to dominate or or I want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.750" end="00:59:27.849" style="s2">express obliquely an emotion that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:29.950" style="s2">too cowardly to come out and confront</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.849" end="00:59:32.290" style="s2">directly or am I being manipulative</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.950" end="00:59:34.329" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of reasons that people use</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.290" end="00:59:37.720" style="s2">language but what you really should use</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.329" end="00:59:40.390" style="s2">it for is to state what you believe to</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.720" end="00:59:44.559" style="s2">be true and then to let the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.390" end="00:59:50.680" style="s2">of that unfold and so that can also help</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.559" end="00:59:52.390" style="s2">you simple truths bluntly stated can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.680" end="00:59:54.430" style="s2">very powerful you don&#39;t need a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.390" end="00:59:56.770" style="s2">verbal fluency under those circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.430" end="01:00:02.160" style="s2">if there&#39;s evidence of strength of</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.770" end="01:00:07.030" style="s2">character behind it so the daodejing</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.160" end="01:00:10.119" style="s2">speaks of acting naturally well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.030" end="01:00:12.549" style="s2">know if that&#39;s true if it&#39;s acting</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.119" end="01:00:16.839" style="s2">naturally it depends on what you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.549" end="01:00:19.869" style="s2">naturally the daodejing speaks of acting</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.839" end="01:00:23.079" style="s2">in a manner that balances yin and yang</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.869" end="01:00:26.079" style="s2">that balances chaos in order and that</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.079" end="01:00:28.750" style="s2">means that you&#39;re speaking in the right</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.079" end="01:00:33.220" style="s2">place at the right time about the right</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.750" end="01:00:35.049" style="s2">things and that&#39;s allied with part of</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.220" end="01:00:38.859" style="s2">what I just discussed with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.049" end="01:00:40.960" style="s2">speaking the truth how is one to put</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.859" end="01:00:43.210" style="s2">their foot down and change / better</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.960" end="01:00:44.349" style="s2">their condition without in unnaturally</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.210" end="01:00:51.339" style="s2">manipulating their world</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.349" end="01:00:56.470" style="s2">well the fundamental answer to that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.339" end="01:00:58.660" style="s2">to speak the truth and to let the car</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.470" end="01:01:00.700" style="s2">secuence --is of that unfold but then</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.660" end="01:01:04.150" style="s2">the trick is well how is it that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.700" end="01:01:06.970" style="s2">come to speak the truth well in order to</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.150" end="01:01:08.980" style="s2">do that as far as I can tell you have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.970" end="01:01:11.230" style="s2">be terrified of the consequences of not</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.980" end="01:01:14.230" style="s2">speaking the truth and and part of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.230" end="01:01:16.540" style="s2">is well look do you want the truth on</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.230" end="01:01:20.680" style="s2">your side or not do you want to do you</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.540" end="01:01:23.349" style="s2">want to be facing the truth as an enemy</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.680" end="01:01:27.099" style="s2">or do you want to have the truth behind</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.349" end="01:01:30.190" style="s2">you as an ally and the truth is reality</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.099" end="01:01:32.890" style="s2">and I I don&#39;t see that you want reality</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.190" end="01:01:35.800" style="s2">as an enemy and so if what you do is use</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.890" end="01:01:37.869" style="s2">your language to represent reality as</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.800" end="01:01:40.150" style="s2">accurately as you possibly can</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.869" end="01:01:42.400" style="s2">now given all your inadequacies and</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.150" end="01:01:45.609" style="s2">biases you&#39;re bound to make errors but</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.400" end="01:01:48.580" style="s2">that&#39;s the goal then you have the force</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.609" end="01:01:51.580" style="s2">of reality behind you it&#39;s it&#39;s as if</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.580" end="01:01:54.550" style="s2">you&#39;ve you know where you are you might</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.580" end="01:01:57.280" style="s2">not like it and you maybe you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.550" end="01:01:59.830" style="s2">it&#39;s a terrible craggy chasm full of</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.280" end="01:02:01.390" style="s2">lava and water but at least you can see</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.830" end="01:02:05.890" style="s2">where the obstacles are and you can pick</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.390" end="01:02:15.520" style="s2">your way through it so and then the</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.890" end="01:02:17.859" style="s2">naturalness is well from the Taoist</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.520" end="01:02:19.990" style="s2">perspective in some sense yours you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.859" end="01:02:24.040" style="s2">you&#39;re aiming at being at peace with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.990" end="01:02:28.030" style="s2">world and that means accepting it in</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.040" end="01:02:30.310" style="s2">some sense for what it is and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.030" end="01:02:32.680" style="s2">speak the truth unless you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.310" end="01:02:35.290" style="s2">do that and that means that to a large</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.680" end="01:02:36.970" style="s2">degree it means what means exploring the</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.290" end="01:02:40.119" style="s2">depths of yin and yang of order and</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.970" end="01:02:44.410" style="s2">chaos the order to know that like there</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.119" end="01:02:46.119" style="s2">are tyrannical forces of foot and some</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.410" end="01:02:48.720" style="s2">of them are operating you and some of</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.119" end="01:02:50.950" style="s2">them operate in the social world and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.720" end="01:02:51.849" style="s2">some of them operate for that matter in</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.950" end="01:02:55.960" style="s2">the natural world</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.849" end="01:02:57.790" style="s2">too much crushing order and on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.960" end="01:02:59.680" style="s2">chaotic side there&#39;s the possibility of</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.790" end="01:03:02.430" style="s2">nihilism and hopelessness and depression</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.680" end="01:03:05.800" style="s2">and that a complete Cataclysm and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.430" end="01:03:07.230" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re there&#39;s cliffs on both</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.800" end="01:03:09.210" style="s2">sides of you</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.230" end="01:03:11.010" style="s2">you have to be aware of that because you</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.210" end="01:03:13.050" style="s2">don&#39;t want to fall into those cliffs and</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.010" end="01:03:15.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a thin pathway between them that</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.050" end="01:03:19.170" style="s2">you can that you can walk down if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.750" end="01:03:23.990" style="s2">careful and you feel your way down that</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.170" end="01:03:28.109" style="s2">pathway by noting how what you say</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.990" end="01:03:30.810" style="s2">noting whether what you say puts a</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.109" end="01:03:34.200" style="s2">foundation underneath you that&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.810" end="01:03:36.030" style="s2">a New Testament injunction to that goal</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.200" end="01:03:38.640" style="s2">to build your house on a rock and not on</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.030" end="01:03:41.190" style="s2">sand and and what&#39;s the rock well the</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.640" end="01:03:43.770" style="s2">rock is the truth and integrity of your</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.190" end="01:03:44.070" style="s2">character and of your voice that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.770" end="01:03:49.349" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.070" end="01:03:52.890" style="s2">and you you see you want to aim at</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.349" end="01:03:54.810" style="s2">something Noble that&#39;s the alliance with</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.890" end="01:03:57.030" style="s2">God that&#39;s one way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.810" end="01:03:58.829" style="s2">you want to serve the highest good and</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.030" end="01:04:00.660" style="s2">you have to think very hard about what</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.829" end="01:04:03.240" style="s2">that is I mean we know what it is to</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.660" end="01:04:05.670" style="s2">some degree or we have some we have some</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.240" end="01:04:08.250" style="s2">collective conception of that you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.670" end="01:04:11.609" style="s2">it would be peace that would be</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.250" end="01:04:13.560" style="s2">something it would be the willingness</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.609" end="01:04:16.020" style="s2">and desire to treat other people like</p>

<p begin="01:04:18.569" end="01:04:24.630" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s characterological</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.920" end="01:04:27.180" style="s2">nobility it&#39;s the desire to serve the</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.630" end="01:04:29.880" style="s2">good it&#39;s truth and beauty and all of</p>

<p begin="01:04:29.880" end="01:04:35.310" style="s2">into a single thing you want to serve</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.190" end="01:04:38.670" style="s2">that and then you and then having aimed</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.310" end="01:04:40.589" style="s2">at that you won&#39;t do and that that that</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.670" end="01:04:43.290" style="s2">that governs how you&#39;re going to see the</p>

<p begin="01:04:43.290" end="01:04:52.890" style="s2">the that sets the lens or sets the frame</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.460" end="01:04:55.500" style="s2">through which the world manifests itself</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.890" end="01:04:57.150" style="s2">to you right so it&#39;s as if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:04:57.150" end="01:05:02.430" style="s2">properly and then the world reveals</p>

<p begin="01:06:38.780" end="01:06:45.080" style="s2">hard to it&#39;s hard to emphasize this</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.820" end="01:06:47.350" style="s2">importantly enough you have to make a</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.080" end="01:06:49.780" style="s2">decision in your life at some point look</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.350" end="01:06:52.520" style="s2">about how you&#39;re going to use your words</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.780" end="01:06:54.050" style="s2">like you can use them instrumentally and</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.520" end="01:06:55.490" style="s2">you can use them to manipulate people</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.050" end="01:06:57.980" style="s2">you say well this is what I want from</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.490" end="01:07:00.760" style="s2">this situation and here&#39;s how I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.980" end="01:07:04.460" style="s2">to have to craft my words to get it or</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.760" end="01:07:07.550" style="s2">you can think well I&#39;m oriented properly</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.460" end="01:07:11.690" style="s2">in the world and I&#39;m going to say what I</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.550" end="01:07:13.310" style="s2">think and let things happen and those</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.690" end="01:07:14.780" style="s2">are two different they&#39;re really two</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.310" end="01:07:17.210" style="s2">different modes of being I wrote about</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.780" end="01:07:19.220" style="s2">this in 12 rules for life they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.210" end="01:07:21.130" style="s2">two different modes of being and the lad</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.220" end="01:07:24.020" style="s2">the latter one which is faith in truth</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.130" end="01:07:26.359" style="s2">that&#39;s the same as faith in the logos by</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.020" end="01:07:29.480" style="s2">the way from a symbolic perspective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.359" end="01:07:32.900" style="s2">the faith that truth is that which turns</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.480" end="01:07:34.160" style="s2">uninhabitable chaos into habitable order</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.900" end="01:07:37.279" style="s2">it&#39;s the truth that</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.160" end="01:07:39.349" style="s2">as that and so you you tell the truth</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.279" end="01:07:40.940" style="s2">and you throw caution to the wind and it</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.349" end="01:07:43.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you tell the truth stupidly</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.940" end="01:07:45.319" style="s2">because telling the truth stupidly isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.160" end="01:07:49.119" style="s2">truthful you have to do it very</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.319" end="01:07:49.119" style="s2">carefully and very strategically</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.430" end="01:07:58.490" style="s2">strategically well the strategic part</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.119" end="01:08:01.069" style="s2">the goal is to get better all the time</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.490" end="01:08:05.660" style="s2">at carefully articulating what</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.069" end="01:08:07.339" style="s2">constitutes the truth you know it seems</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.660" end="01:08:08.660" style="s2">obvious to me in some sense it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.339" end="01:08:10.369" style="s2">you got to really think this through</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.660" end="01:08:13.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like what do you want on your side</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.369" end="01:08:15.289" style="s2">you want falsehood on your side it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.460" end="01:08:16.489" style="s2">like who thinks that you really think</p>

<p begin="01:16:40.900" end="01:16:51.730" style="s2">me you have talked about earning your</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.559" end="01:16:54.040" style="s2">knowledge how do you define you guys you</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.730" end="01:16:56.409" style="s2">put up some viciously good questions</p>

<p begin="01:16:56.409" end="01:17:00.340" style="s2">questions they&#39;re very good questions so</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.150" end="01:17:02.590" style="s2">this is Devon M you&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.340" end="01:17:03.610" style="s2">earning your knowledge how do you define</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.590" end="01:17:05.949" style="s2">this and earn it</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.610" end="01:17:13.179" style="s2">when is it ok to debate ideas like yours</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.949" end="01:17:16.360" style="s2">if they are not your own well I would</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.179" end="01:17:20.199" style="s2">say it&#39;s okay to debate them right away</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.360" end="01:17:22.540" style="s2">if what you&#39;re trying to do is to test</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.199" end="01:17:24.219" style="s2">them and learn more about them right but</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.540" end="01:17:27.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not okay if you&#39;re trying to put</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.219" end="01:17:30.040" style="s2">them forward as if they&#39;re your own and</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.250" end="01:17:32.619" style="s2">to obtain something approximating</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.040" end="01:17:36.130" style="s2">unearned moral superiority by doing so</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.619" end="01:17:38.260" style="s2">so that means to have the ideas and to</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.130" end="01:17:40.239" style="s2">discuss them but not to identify with</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.260" end="01:17:42.190" style="s2">them as if they are defining characters</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.239" end="01:17:47.579" style="s2">that defining features of your own</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.190" end="01:17:51.909" style="s2">personality how do you earn knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.579" end="01:17:53.230" style="s2">well and all your elementary school</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.909" end="01:17:55.420" style="s2">teachers when you&#39;re writing an essay</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.230" end="01:17:57.489" style="s2">said you got to put it in your own words</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.420" end="01:17:59.139" style="s2">think well what does that mean you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.489" end="01:18:02.710" style="s2">just copy a sentence it has to be in</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.139" end="01:18:04.630" style="s2">your own words and you know to me that</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.710" end="01:18:08.290" style="s2">was never very well explained to me but</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.630" end="01:18:10.960" style="s2">there was something to it it&#39;s like for</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.290" end="01:18:13.510" style="s2">knowledge to be yours you have to</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.960" end="01:18:17.949" style="s2">integrate it with your own experience</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.510" end="01:18:19.370" style="s2">you have to see how that applies to your</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.949" end="01:18:21.860" style="s2">own case and then have</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.370" end="01:18:24.410" style="s2">story to tell about how that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.860" end="01:18:26.540" style="s2">that&#39;s personal right so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.410" end="01:18:28.400" style="s2">intermingling of the abstract with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.540" end="01:18:30.770" style="s2">personal that makes it real</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.400" end="01:18:32.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the intermingling of the epic with</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.770" end="01:18:34.850" style="s2">the particular or the archetypal with</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.720" end="01:18:37.550" style="s2">the with the concrete that makes</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.850" end="01:18:39.110" style="s2">something real and so of an idea is</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.550" end="01:18:41.960" style="s2">still an abstraction if you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.110" end="01:18:44.030" style="s2">parroting it it also means that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.960" end="01:18:46.040" style="s2">haven&#39;t learned to use it as a tool you</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.030" end="01:18:48.140" style="s2">haven&#39;t started to apply it in your own</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.040" end="01:18:50.120" style="s2">life because you could say well here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.140" end="01:18:52.760" style="s2">an idea that I came across and here&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:18:52.760" end="01:18:56.690" style="s2">learned when I implemented it and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.620" end="01:18:58.640" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely yours right because</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.690" end="01:19:02.060" style="s2">you&#39;re you can kind of tell because</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.640" end="01:19:06.380" style="s2">you&#39;re recounting your knowledge in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.060" end="01:19:07.640" style="s2">manner that no one else could do and and</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.380" end="01:19:10.130" style="s2">that&#39;s what gives it that ring of</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.640" end="01:19:11.870" style="s2">genuineness right that&#39;s what it means</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.130" end="01:19:14.540" style="s2">in some sense to speak from the heart</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.870" end="01:19:18.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like well here&#39;s my experience with</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.540" end="01:19:21.130" style="s2">this idea and you can say - well here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.440" end="01:19:23.600" style="s2">how I understand this idea and you</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.130" end="01:19:25.400" style="s2">reformulate that in your own terms and</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.600" end="01:19:29.030" style="s2">that means that you associate it with</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.400" end="01:19:30.680" style="s2">your own but the only with the unique</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.030" end="01:19:32.870" style="s2">particularity --zz of your own</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.680" end="01:19:35.090" style="s2">experience and then I would also say it</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.870" end="01:19:38.150" style="s2">means that you&#39;ve acted out the ideas</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.090" end="01:19:40.490" style="s2">and tested them like in in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.150" end="01:19:44.000" style="s2">that you have your own stories to tell</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.490" end="01:19:47.720" style="s2">about that and that&#39;s how you make it</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.000" end="01:19:50.090" style="s2">your own it&#39;s like you go to the tool</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.720" end="01:19:52.790" style="s2">store the hardware store and you buy a</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.090" end="01:19:55.430" style="s2">hammer you know and then you start to</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.790" end="01:19:56.630" style="s2">use the hammer to hammer in nails and</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.430" end="01:19:58.790" style="s2">you learn how to use the hammer you</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.630" end="01:20:00.440" style="s2">learn how to use the saw and then you</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.790" end="01:20:03.080" style="s2">know at some point that saw sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.440" end="01:20:05.150" style="s2">becomes yours you know how to use it and</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.080" end="01:20:07.730" style="s2">it&#39;s the same with these ideas is like</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.150" end="01:20:10.300" style="s2">you don&#39;t just you you don&#39;t just say</p>

<p begin="01:21:14.599" end="01:21:20.960" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s and then concretely</p>

<p begin="01:21:25.550" end="01:21:30.440" style="s2">that&#39;s thinking it through right and</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.639" end="01:21:32.570" style="s2">discussing it until you have it at hand</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.440" end="01:21:34.130" style="s2">you can talk about it and you can</p>

<p begin="01:21:34.130" end="01:21:37.909" style="s2">understand it but a huge part of that is</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.170" end="01:21:40.280" style="s2">also putting it into practice than</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.909" end="01:21:42.170" style="s2">deriving your own conclusions as a</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.280" end="01:21:44.480" style="s2">consequence and some of that can be done</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.170" end="01:21:47.090" style="s2">with debate it&#39;s like here&#39;s an idea I</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.480" end="01:21:50.050" style="s2">came across and here&#39;s the idea and</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.090" end="01:21:52.909" style="s2">here&#39;s what I think it means and this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.050" end="01:21:54.469" style="s2">how I think it would change things if I</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.909" end="01:21:57.440" style="s2">put it into practice this is how I</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.469" end="01:22:00.829" style="s2">understand this idea and what do you</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.440" end="01:22:03.590" style="s2">think of that like that&#39;s a good debate</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.829" end="01:22:05.690" style="s2">or discussion you know because then the</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.590" end="01:22:07.039" style="s2">other person can say well I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.690" end="01:22:08.090" style="s2">agree with the way you&#39;ve formulated</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.039" end="01:22:09.860" style="s2">that or I don&#39;t agree with your</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.090" end="01:22:12.199" style="s2">conclusions and hopefully it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.860" end="01:22:13.610" style="s2">discussion and not just one upmanship</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.199" end="01:22:17.539" style="s2">you know because that&#39;s a pretty dull</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.610" end="01:22:19.309" style="s2">game and then well then you get clearer</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.539" end="01:22:20.719" style="s2">about what it is that the idea is and</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.309" end="01:22:22.520" style="s2">how it is that you would use it as a</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.719" end="01:22:24.170" style="s2">tool in your own life and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.520" end="01:22:26.480" style="s2">right way to think about ideas to you</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.170" end="01:22:29.139" style="s2">know is well partly they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.480" end="01:22:31.099" style="s2">tools for looking at the world with</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.139" end="01:22:32.599" style="s2">because you have to look at the world</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.099" end="01:22:34.340" style="s2">with tools because you can&#39;t look at the</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.599" end="01:22:35.929" style="s2">whole world so you&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.340" end="01:22:38.030" style="s2">world through a tool like structure and</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.929" end="01:22:41.090" style="s2">then the ideas themselves are too alike</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.030" end="01:22:43.400" style="s2">and they need to be used and and worn a</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.090" end="01:22:44.119" style="s2">bit in your hands before they&#39;re before</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.400" end="01:22:46.110" style="s2">they&#39;re yours</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.119" end="01:22:47.610" style="s2">so how</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.110" end="01:22:51.180" style="s2">you ever thought about engaging in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.610" end="01:22:53.010" style="s2">public debate with slavish jiseok he has</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.180" end="01:22:54.570" style="s2">many interesting observations on the</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.010" end="01:22:57.990" style="s2">topic of ideology and that would be a</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.570" end="01:23:01.410" style="s2">good conversation conversation yes we</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.990" end="01:23:04.290" style="s2">have a tentative we have been speaking</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.410" end="01:23:07.230" style="s2">tentatively about the possibility of</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.290" end="01:23:14.820" style="s2">having a public discussion in Toronto in</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.230" end="01:23:16.640" style="s2">April and so we&#39;re negotiating and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.820" end="01:23:19.320" style="s2">see how that goes</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.640" end="01:23:21.480" style="s2">we&#39;ll see if he&#39;s available and if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.320" end="01:23:26.010" style="s2">available if we can agree on a set of</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.480" end="01:23:29.270" style="s2">topics if we can if we can undertake all</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.010" end="01:23:31.310" style="s2">the complex detailed negotiations</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.270" end="01:23:34.920" style="s2">necessary to make something like that</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.310" end="01:23:37.200" style="s2">successful in the public sphere I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.920" end="01:23:39.960" style="s2">confident enough that this will occur</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.200" end="01:23:42.360" style="s2">that I&#39;ve already downloaded about six</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.960" end="01:23:45.900" style="s2">of his books because I really want to</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.360" end="01:23:51.710" style="s2">start understanding what he has to say</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.900" end="01:23:54.600" style="s2">and think before undertaking that so so</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.710" end="01:23:56.850" style="s2">yes I have thought about it more than</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.600" end="01:24:01.110" style="s2">thought about it the offer is out the</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.850" end="01:24:03.450" style="s2">negotiations are underway how do you</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.110" end="01:24:05.250" style="s2">maintain a stable identity when you are</p>

<p begin="01:24:05.250" end="01:24:10.320" style="s2">anxiety well the first thing we might</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.620" end="01:24:12.180" style="s2">say is that you can&#39;t you know what I</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.320" end="01:24:13.800" style="s2">mean if you&#39;re plagued by boats of</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.180" end="01:24:18.690" style="s2">depression and anxiety that does</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.800" end="01:24:22.080" style="s2">destabilize your identity so it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.690" end="01:24:27.540" style="s2">by definition but having said that look</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.080" end="01:24:29.430" style="s2">this is when habit and plan and strategy</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.540" end="01:24:32.250" style="s2">are so useful so in the periods of</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.430" end="01:24:34.470" style="s2">depression that I&#39;ve had what sustained</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.250" end="01:24:36.150" style="s2">some of them were long and and and</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.470" end="01:24:38.450" style="s2">certainly the most unpleasant</p>

<p begin="01:24:43.080" end="01:24:47.070" style="s2">let&#39;s say that&#39;s aligned with your</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.030" end="01:24:49.140" style="s2">vision and your strategy to sustain you</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.070" end="01:24:53.040" style="s2">because what would what would happen to</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.140" end="01:24:55.140" style="s2">me is that I know I have these a vision</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.040" end="01:24:59.580" style="s2">and I suppose the vision is of a world</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.140" end="01:25:01.880" style="s2">that&#39;s better in in that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.580" end="01:25:04.320" style="s2">less likely to descend into ideological</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.880" end="01:25:06.920" style="s2">catastrophe and where people are more</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.320" end="01:25:11.250" style="s2">responsible and more awake and more</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.920" end="01:25:13.380" style="s2">educated and and healthier all of that a</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.250" end="01:25:16.050" style="s2">vision of a better world you know a</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.380" end="01:25:18.750" style="s2">world is less hellish at least but also</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.050" end="01:25:21.780" style="s2">a better world and some sense of what</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.750" end="01:25:23.310" style="s2">role I might play in that and then so</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.780" end="01:25:26.400" style="s2">that&#39;s very motivating like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.310" end="01:25:28.590" style="s2">profound gold to try to make things</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.400" end="01:25:30.150" style="s2">better and you can do that locally you</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.590" end="01:25:32.010" style="s2">can do that for yourself you can do that</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.150" end="01:25:33.570" style="s2">for your family you can do that for the</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.010" end="01:25:35.370" style="s2">broader community and all of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.570" end="01:25:37.500" style="s2">worth it man it&#39;s worth making some</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.370" end="01:25:40.560" style="s2">sacrifices for it&#39;s worth suffering for</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.500" end="01:25:42.750" style="s2">to some degree and then you decompose</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.560" end="01:25:45.570" style="s2">that into the day-to-day and</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.750" end="01:25:48.180" style="s2">week-to-week strategies and actions that</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.570" end="01:25:50.400" style="s2">you&#39;re undertaking the plans and the</p>

<p begin="01:25:59.250" end="01:26:03.090" style="s2">with depression it&#39;s like it&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="01:26:47.910" end="01:26:52.710" style="s2">and that&#39;s what you&#39;ve got and so</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.010" end="01:26:54.810" style="s2">endurance is a huge part of it and then</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.710" end="01:26:57.210" style="s2">I would say with its anxiety it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.810" end="01:26:59.580" style="s2">same thing it&#39;s like or very much the</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.210" end="01:27:03.000" style="s2">same as you&#39;re terrified and and</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.580" end="01:27:06.090" style="s2">uncertain but you move ahead to the best</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.000" end="01:27:07.770" style="s2">of your ability and again you operate at</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.090" end="01:27:09.480" style="s2">least to some degree on hope and if you</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.770" end="01:27:11.880" style="s2">haven&#39;t got hope then you&#39;ve got blind</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.480" end="01:27:13.140" style="s2">bloody endurance and that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.880" end="01:27:14.880" style="s2">motivated by</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.140" end="01:27:17.130" style="s2">some sense that you&#39;re working towards</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.880" end="01:27:20.160" style="s2">something that&#39;s worthwhile working to</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.130" end="01:27:23.070" style="s2">work you know and that is well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.160" end="01:27:24.090" style="s2">your own long-term well-being to treat</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.070" end="01:27:26.580" style="s2">yourself properly</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.090" end="01:27:29.160" style="s2">it&#39;s the stability and productivity and</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.580" end="01:27:31.350" style="s2">harmony and health of your family that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.160" end="01:27:33.770" style="s2">a huge deal and then it&#39;s whatever</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.350" end="01:27:36.780" style="s2">benefit you can be to the community and</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.770" end="01:27:39.240" style="s2">if you have to limp along and drag</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.780" end="01:27:41.580" style="s2">yourself forward in order to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.240" end="01:27:46.580" style="s2">that pathway then so be it</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.580" end="01:27:46.580" style="s2">because it&#39;s better than the alternative</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.930" end="01:27:52.560" style="s2">so and I&#39;m not and I know that you can</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.640" end="01:27:56.010" style="s2">become depressed enough so that you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.560" end="01:27:57.660" style="s2">you&#39;re virtually immobilized but you do</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.010" end="01:27:59.670" style="s2">what you can to fight it and you and</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.660" end="01:28:02.390" style="s2">then you do what you can to treat it you</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.670" end="01:28:04.590" style="s2">know it&#39;s like have you tried the</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.390" end="01:28:08.700" style="s2">antidepressants have you gone to speak</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.590" end="01:28:11.340" style="s2">to a professional have you done what you</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.700" end="01:28:13.230" style="s2">need to do to investigate the causes of</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.340" end="01:28:15.450" style="s2">your depression and anxiety because</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.230" end="01:28:17.280" style="s2">often there&#39;s physical reasons that that</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.450" end="01:28:19.950" style="s2">might be the case you know like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.280" end="01:28:21.690" style="s2">learned notoriously that a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.950" end="01:28:23.280" style="s2">the negative emotion that I experienced</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.690" end="01:28:25.560" style="s2">a seem to be associated with an</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.280" end="01:28:27.660" style="s2">autoimmune problem that was associated</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.560" end="01:28:30.720" style="s2">with food sensitivity Jesus like I</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.660" end="01:28:32.520" style="s2">hadn&#39;t I I would have never believed</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.720" end="01:28:34.410" style="s2">that was possible ten years ago even</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.520" end="01:28:38.340" style="s2">though I didn&#39;t I had learned by that</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.410" end="01:28:39.900" style="s2">point that my susceptibility the</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.340" end="01:28:42.510" style="s2">negative emotion was definitely</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.900" end="01:28:44.880" style="s2">exacerbated for example if I was hungry</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.510" end="01:28:46.650" style="s2">so I knew there was some relationship</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.880" end="01:28:48.420" style="s2">with food but I had no idea that it was</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.650" end="01:28:53.460" style="s2">this profound as it turned out to be and</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.420" end="01:28:57.360" style="s2">so but don&#39;t and then well the other</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.460" end="01:28:59.340" style="s2">thing you can do too is that as the</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.360" end="01:29:02.540" style="s2">negative emotion ramps up in intensity</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.340" end="01:29:05.340" style="s2">the amount of time that you construe as</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.540" end="01:29:08.010" style="s2">managable shrinks you know and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.340" end="01:29:09.750" style="s2">extremely depressed and anxious then you</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.010" end="01:29:13.680" style="s2">know you may be struggling to get</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.750" end="01:29:17.670" style="s2">through the day and then you need a map</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.680" end="01:29:19.980" style="s2">of what is going to constitute a</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.670" end="01:29:22.650" style="s2">minimally acceptable day and that might</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.980" end="01:29:23.790" style="s2">be one where you&#39;ve done what you need</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.650" end="01:29:26.340" style="s2">so that when you wake up</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.790" end="01:29:28.080" style="s2">tomorrow things aren&#39;t worse right you</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.340" end="01:29:30.480" style="s2">have to keep up with your obligations</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.080" end="01:29:36.080" style="s2">and your duties at least enough so that</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.480" end="01:29:36.080" style="s2">you&#39;re not degenerating downhill and you</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.800" end="01:29:46.230" style="s2">the other thing too is that you you also</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.780" end="01:29:47.970" style="s2">learned that you act out the things that</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.230" end="01:29:49.800" style="s2">you would do when you&#39;re normal even</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.970" end="01:29:51.600" style="s2">when you&#39;re depressed you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.800" end="01:29:53.910" style="s2">want to see people well it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.600" end="01:29:55.800" style="s2">matter you go see them cuz it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.910" end="01:29:57.210" style="s2">than not seeing them you know and you</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.800" end="01:29:58.680" style="s2">find when you do see them that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.210" end="01:30:00.360" style="s2">better it&#39;ll go better than you think</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.680" end="01:30:02.640" style="s2">but you can&#39;t isolate yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.360" end="01:30:04.410" style="s2">you&#39;re anxious and so you want to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.640" end="01:30:06.060" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to go out you&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.410" end="01:30:08.400" style="s2">stay home and sit in the chair and just</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.060" end="01:30:10.260" style="s2">sit there and like in a frozen positions</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.400" end="01:30:12.630" style="s2">like you can&#39;t do that you have to go</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.260" end="01:30:14.250" style="s2">out and go grocery shopping and go out</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.630" end="01:30:15.930" style="s2">and have coffee and all of those things</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.250" end="01:30:17.970" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter whether you enjoy them</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.930" end="01:30:20.340" style="s2">it matters that you do them because</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.970" end="01:30:23.010" style="s2">that&#39;s what you do that&#39;s what you do in</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.340" end="01:30:25.500" style="s2">order to maintain your health and and so</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.010" end="01:30:28.320" style="s2">a huge part of it is like head down</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.500" end="01:30:30.960" style="s2">endurance and that&#39;ll get you through</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.320" end="01:30:34.830" style="s2">bad times that endurance it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.960" end="01:30:38.520" style="s2">such an under represented virtue that</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.830" end="01:30:41.790" style="s2">ability to trudge forward under a trudge</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.520" end="01:30:44.100" style="s2">forward unhappily under unfairly</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.790" end="01:30:46.590" style="s2">burdensome load is a testament to</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.100" end="01:30:51.500" style="s2">character if you can and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.590" end="01:30:56.820" style="s2">something that should be encouraged and</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.500" end="01:30:59.250" style="s2">valued so you know and I&#39;m not making</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.820" end="01:31:01.620" style="s2">the claim that people who are depressed</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.250" end="01:31:03.720" style="s2">you can&#39;t get out of bed lack endurance</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.620" end="01:31:08.430" style="s2">some do and some don&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.720" end="01:31:10.470" style="s2">depression comes in very varied degrees</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.430" end="01:31:13.800" style="s2">of intensity and and you can be laid out</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.470" end="01:31:16.410" style="s2">completely by depression so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.800" end="01:31:18.390" style="s2">trying to make some arbitrary judgment</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.410" end="01:31:20.820" style="s2">about who&#39;s got endurance and who hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.390" end="01:31:23.520" style="s2">you can&#39;t do that from the outside but I</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.820" end="01:31:26.780" style="s2">can say that endurance is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.520" end="01:31:29.940" style="s2">tools you have to deal with chronic</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.780" end="01:31:32.040" style="s2">discomfort and pain you know and even if</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.940" end="01:31:33.510" style="s2">you have chronic pain it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.040" end="01:31:35.700" style="s2">because it&#39;s very much allied with</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.510" end="01:31:37.090" style="s2">depression by the way all of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.700" end="01:31:39.190" style="s2">research on chronic</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.090" end="01:31:41.920" style="s2">back pain for example indicates and</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.190" end="01:31:45.159" style="s2">chronic pain of all sorts is that the</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.920" end="01:31:48.960" style="s2">more you allow your pain to render you</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.159" end="01:31:51.760" style="s2">inactive the worse the outcome including</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.960" end="01:31:54.070" style="s2">exacerbation of the pain a depression is</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.760" end="01:31:56.260" style="s2">a pain disorder and so that&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.070" end="01:32:01.030" style="s2">worth thinking about - it&#39;s like move</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.260" end="01:32:02.469" style="s2">forward move forward move forward you</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.030" end="01:32:04.540" style="s2">know and if you need to talk to somebody</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.469" end="01:32:06.820" style="s2">about what your plan is for the day or</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.540" end="01:32:10.119" style="s2">the hour or the week then do that as</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.820" end="01:32:11.949" style="s2">well and perhaps you also have to help</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.119" end="01:32:13.420" style="s2">get the people around you to help a bit</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.949" end="01:32:15.520" style="s2">I need a little bit of help getting up</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.420" end="01:32:17.619" style="s2">in the morning I need to have breakfast</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.520" end="01:32:19.869" style="s2">made for me so that all I knew when I</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.619" end="01:32:22.030" style="s2">get up in my sin my terrible state of</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.869" end="01:32:24.099" style="s2">fog and confusion and terrible anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.030" end="01:32:25.659" style="s2">and depression is I have a shower</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.099" end="01:32:28.060" style="s2">because that&#39;s what happens first and</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.659" end="01:32:29.530" style="s2">then the next thing is I eat and then</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.060" end="01:32:31.630" style="s2">that&#39;s better you&#39;re at least you&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.530" end="01:32:32.199" style="s2">of bed and moving and that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.630" end="01:32:36.730" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.199" end="01:32:39.820" style="s2">you know so and then you endear and hope</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.730" end="01:32:41.260" style="s2">and that&#39;s how it is and you do the same</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.820" end="01:32:43.270" style="s2">thing when someone in your family is</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.260" end="01:32:46.000" style="s2">sick or when you&#39;re facing a death all</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.270" end="01:32:52.179" style="s2">of that it&#39;s like one bloody foot in</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.000" end="01:32:54.639" style="s2">front of the other up the hill how are</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.179" end="01:32:58.330" style="s2">you always so consistently composed and</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.639" end="01:33:07.780" style="s2">confident oh yeah well I wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.330" end="01:33:10.690" style="s2">that I am I know what you mean well look</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.780" end="01:33:12.760" style="s2">you know I&#39;m I&#39;m not that young I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.690" end="01:33:14.500" style="s2">about 60 years old and so I have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.760" end="01:33:17.650" style="s2">of experience behind me and I&#39;ve seen a</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.500" end="01:33:19.929" style="s2">lot of things and I&#39;ve learned to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.650" end="01:33:21.489" style="s2">detached to some degree you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.929" end="01:33:22.949" style="s2">one thing you learn as a clinician as</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.489" end="01:33:26.139" style="s2">people are always talking to you about</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.949" end="01:33:27.849" style="s2">terrible things and that difficulties in</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.139" end="01:33:30.909" style="s2">their life and you can take that home</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.849" end="01:33:34.810" style="s2">and and have it destroy you because</p>

<p begin="01:34:38.550" end="01:34:44.320" style="s2">upset that I can manage and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.680" end="01:34:47.020" style="s2">part of the doctrine of minimal minimal</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.320" end="01:34:49.930" style="s2">necessary force like one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.020" end="01:34:53.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned if you&#39;re if you have a</p>

<p begin="01:34:53.830" end="01:34:59.170" style="s2">settled and maybe they need to change</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.739" end="01:35:00.790" style="s2">more than you and that&#39;s not always the</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.170" end="01:35:02.440" style="s2">case because sometimes the settling</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.790" end="01:35:04.930" style="s2">requires change on your part but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.440" end="01:35:07.840" style="s2">say that they have to be defeated in</p>

<p begin="01:35:11.500" end="01:35:15.040" style="s2">knock your opponent to the ground and</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.570" end="01:35:18.100" style="s2">then jump up and down on them three or</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.040" end="01:35:22.600" style="s2">four times in triumph you know you you</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.100" end="01:35:28.449" style="s2">you you pin them in linen and then let</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.600" end="01:35:30.400" style="s2">them up minimal necessary force because</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.449" end="01:35:37.420" style="s2">any more than that just produces a</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.400" end="01:35:40.330" style="s2">counter reaction and so and I guess the</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.420" end="01:35:42.010" style="s2">other thing is too is my motivation when</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.330" end="01:35:44.380" style="s2">I&#39;m engaged let&#39;s say in these</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.010" end="01:35:49.260" style="s2">discussions is that I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.380" end="01:35:51.940" style="s2">win the argument I&#39;m not trying to win</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.260" end="01:35:55.360" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to say what I think as</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.940" end="01:35:57.730" style="s2">clearly as I can and there is there</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.360" end="01:35:59.910" style="s2">might be an element there might be one</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.730" end="01:36:04.230" style="s2">of the consequences of that might be</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.910" end="01:36:06.870" style="s2">what appears to be a victory but the</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.230" end="01:36:10.280" style="s2">victory is the victory for your ability</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.870" end="01:36:12.780" style="s2">to articulate what you believe and</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.280" end="01:36:15.660" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do and so</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.780" end="01:36:18.750" style="s2">that&#39;s another reason to stay composed</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.660" end="01:36:21.090" style="s2">is like well okay this person has just</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.750" end="01:36:26.190" style="s2">thrown a curveball at me it&#39;s like all</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.090" end="01:36:27.870" style="s2">right so well I could be thinking well I</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.190" end="01:36:29.100" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be undermined by that and</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.870" end="01:36:30.720" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to make a fool of myself</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.100" end="01:36:32.160" style="s2">and I don&#39;t want to be put on the spot</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.720" end="01:36:34.380" style="s2">and of course all of those things are</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.160" end="01:36:36.450" style="s2">true but mostly what I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.380" end="01:36:41.010" style="s2">is okay well now I&#39;ve got that question</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.450" end="01:36:42.120" style="s2">I want to answer as truthfully as I</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.010" end="01:36:44.630" style="s2">possibly can</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.120" end="01:36:49.650" style="s2">what do I think about what was just said</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.630" end="01:36:51.810" style="s2">and I&#39;m not calculating the outcome I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.650" end="01:36:54.840" style="s2">assuming this is a mark of faith right</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.810" end="01:37:01.650" style="s2">this is the faith that the people have</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.840" end="01:37:03.660" style="s2">talked about being something that has to</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.650" end="01:37:04.920" style="s2">be manifested necessarily we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.660" end="01:37:05.370" style="s2">talking about this since the dawn of</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.920" end="01:37:08.250" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.370" end="01:37:11.820" style="s2">what&#39;s the faith the faith is that if</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.250" end="01:37:14.220" style="s2">you say what you believe to be true then</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.820" end="01:37:17.370" style="s2">whatever happens is the best thing that</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.220" end="01:37:20.540" style="s2">could have happened and I believe that</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.370" end="01:37:22.620" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I really believe it</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.540" end="01:37:25.170" style="s2">partly because I believe that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.620" end="01:37:27.180" style="s2">deceitful which is the opposite of that</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.170" end="01:37:27.950" style="s2">or manipulative or malicious or</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.180" end="01:37:31.590" style="s2">malevolent</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.950" end="01:37:33.360" style="s2">but maybe primarily manipulative then</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.590" end="01:37:37.380" style="s2">what you&#39;re acting out is your belief</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.360" end="01:37:40.380" style="s2">that deceit will bring victory and I</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.380" end="01:37:43.560" style="s2">just don&#39;t believe that at all I just I</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.380" end="01:37:46.800" style="s2">think it&#39;s a preposterous claim and so</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.560" end="01:37:49.290" style="s2">if Steve won&#39;t bring victory then truth</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.800" end="01:37:51.480" style="s2">is what brings victory if there is such</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.290" end="01:37:52.890" style="s2">a thing as truth and there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.480" end="01:37:54.960" style="s2">such a thing as deceit</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.890" end="01:37:59.610" style="s2">so there must be such a thing as truth</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.960" end="01:38:01.770" style="s2">and so and some of its just curiosity</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.610" end="01:38:03.239" style="s2">too it&#39;s like well I&#39;m going to say what</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.770" end="01:38:05.760" style="s2">I think and see what happens</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.239" end="01:38:08.130" style="s2">that&#39;s an adventure you know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.760" end="01:38:10.290" style="s2">adventure of your life really and you</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.130" end="01:38:11.880" style="s2">don&#39;t want to miss that because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.290" end="01:38:15.050" style="s2">what you&#39;ve got in your life is for it</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.880" end="01:38:18.000" style="s2">to be an adventure it&#39;s not an easy road</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.050" end="01:38:21.230" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a stormy sea</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.000" end="01:38:24.660" style="s2">and what you have is the adventure of</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.230" end="01:38:30.090" style="s2">contending with God and the waves that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.660" end="01:38:35.010" style="s2">what you have and the way you do that is</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.090" end="01:38:39.000" style="s2">with truth and then that sort of takes</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.010" end="01:38:42.330" style="s2">you out of that immediacy of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.000" end="01:38:43.800" style="s2">conflict whoever it is that the conflict</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.330" end="01:38:47.490" style="s2">with whoever it is that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.800" end="01:38:50.850" style="s2">to you&#39;re trying to align yourself with</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.490" end="01:38:58.740" style="s2">something that&#39;s deeper and more</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.850" end="01:39:01.100" style="s2">profound and more lasting but I&#39;d like I</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.740" end="01:39:04.770" style="s2">don&#39;t think that I am particularly</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.100" end="01:39:08.960" style="s2">consistently composed and confident you</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.770" end="01:39:08.960" style="s2">know I think I have faith in the truth</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.100" end="01:39:23.370" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same thing and you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.200" end="01:39:25.440" style="s2">an emotional person obviously how do you</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.370" end="01:39:28.560" style="s2">manage to read so much well a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.440" end="01:39:33.930" style="s2">that&#39;s good fortune you know like I seem</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.560" end="01:39:36.360" style="s2">to have a knack for reading it&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.930" end="01:39:39.930" style="s2">was a gift you know like when I was a</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.360" end="01:39:42.450" style="s2">kid if I look at a word once I can</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.930" end="01:39:44.850" style="s2">always spell it like I have it instantly</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.450" end="01:39:46.350" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been like that ever since I was</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.850" end="01:39:49.080" style="s2">little and so I seem to have a facility</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.350" end="01:39:51.210" style="s2">for very rapid verbal comprehension and</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.080" end="01:39:52.860" style="s2">then my father taught me to read when I</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.210" end="01:39:54.470" style="s2">was very young and I think it was the</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.860" end="01:39:57.240" style="s2">combination of those two things that</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.470" end="01:39:59.970" style="s2">enabled that for me you know I had the</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.240" end="01:40:02.700" style="s2">natural proclivity a verbal ability you</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.970" end="01:40:04.650" style="s2">know I my grudges supervisor very smart</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.700" end="01:40:08.220" style="s2">guy Robert Peel guy I really like</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.650" end="01:40:11.760" style="s2">he had trouble with spelling you know it</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.220" end="01:40:14.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t know why sake that is people</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.760" end="01:40:17.550" style="s2">have different talents and I had to tell</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.250" end="01:40:20.610" style="s2">it for immediate recognition and memory</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.550" end="01:40:24.920" style="s2">of words and and and I&#39;m also very</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.610" end="01:40:24.920" style="s2">verbally fluid here</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.410" end="01:40:38.720" style="s2">so I think mostly it&#39;s an innate talent</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.630" end="01:40:39.620" style="s2">you know now I also do know that the</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.720" end="01:40:42.980" style="s2">more you read</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.620" end="01:40:45.230" style="s2">generally speaking the faster you get my</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.980" end="01:40:47.240" style="s2">wife is really like she always read but</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.230" end="01:40:49.130" style="s2">she&#39;s really started to read more since</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.240" end="01:40:51.290" style="s2">you go to Kendall she turns out to he</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.130" end="01:40:53.150" style="s2">likes her Kindle she reads a lot more in</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.290" end="01:40:58.460" style="s2">her reading speed has increased a lot a</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.150" end="01:41:00.260" style="s2">lot of its practice you can try to speed</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.460" end="01:41:04.250" style="s2">up your reading by reading a little</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.260" end="01:41:06.430" style="s2">faster than you&#39;re comfortable with it I</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.250" end="01:41:10.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know the research literature</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.430" end="01:41:13.130" style="s2">indicating the utility of that but</p>

<p begin="01:43:04.780" end="01:43:09.650" style="s2">investigate carefully what resistances</p>

<p begin="01:43:37.190" end="01:43:43.370" style="s2">so you value it you make it a regular</p>

<p begin="01:43:48.410" end="01:43:53.000" style="s2">and so that you&#39;re more informed and you</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.750" end="01:43:54.890" style="s2">can think better why should you be more</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.000" end="01:43:58.940" style="s2">informed and think better because you</p>

<p begin="01:44:06.290" end="01:44:10.000" style="s2">you&#39;ll have a better sense of how the</p>

<p begin="01:44:14.900" end="01:44:22.390" style="s2">good reasons to be highly literate is is</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.200" end="01:44:25.280" style="s2">an incredibly massive massive advantage</p>

<p begin="01:44:25.280" end="01:44:36.790" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be underestimated so there are</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.170" end="01:44:38.650" style="s2">drug-addicted mentally ill homeless</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.790" end="01:44:40.570" style="s2">people in my city and it seems to keep</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.650" end="01:44:43.380" style="s2">getting worse how do we help people who</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.570" end="01:44:46.660" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be helped</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.380" end="01:44:49.690" style="s2">well I think you do that by example</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.660" end="01:44:51.790" style="s2">fundamentally there isn&#39;t any other way</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.690" end="01:44:54.360" style="s2">I know of to help people who don&#39;t want</p>

<p begin="01:44:59.160" end="01:45:07.420" style="s2">and then I guess I think what you do is</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.340" end="01:45:11.440" style="s2">you open up you it&#39;s the same thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.420" end="01:45:13.090" style="s2">said many times is that you do what you</p>

<p begin="01:45:26.080" end="01:45:31.960" style="s2">volunteer you could talk to those people</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.410" end="01:45:33.489" style="s2">and listen because then you&#39;d find out</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.960" end="01:45:35.290" style="s2">what the hell their problems are and</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.489" end="01:45:37.210" style="s2">then you&#39;d have some sense about how</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.290" end="01:45:40.360" style="s2">they might be helped you know but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.210" end="01:45:43.989" style="s2">a hard thing there&#39;s no helping from</p>

<p begin="01:45:49.900" end="01:45:54.100" style="s2">isn&#39;t even necessarily obvious that the</p>

<p begin="01:48:02.349" end="01:48:08.889" style="s2">Laci ruminations come up accidentally</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.650" end="01:48:10.780" style="s2">involuntarily unconsciously whereas if</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.889" end="01:48:12.340" style="s2">you write down everything that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.780" end="01:48:14.949" style="s2">ruminating about you&#39;re facing them</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.340" end="01:48:17.619" style="s2">voluntarily so I would say well open up</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.949" end="01:48:20.229" style="s2">a journal or word document whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.619" end="01:48:22.570" style="s2">write down every time you ruminate about</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.229" end="01:48:24.429" style="s2">something write it down and write down</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.570" end="01:48:27.939" style="s2">every rumination you can remember</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.429" end="01:48:29.800" style="s2">exhaustively write them all down that</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.939" end="01:48:31.630" style="s2">would be the first thing and the second</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.800" end="01:48:33.189" style="s2">thing is standard behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.630" end="01:48:37.599" style="s2">practice the second thing the next thing</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.189" end="01:48:41.199" style="s2">would be write down why you think they</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.599" end="01:48:43.539" style="s2">happened so that you get a good causal</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.199" end="01:48:45.880" style="s2">account and then write down well what</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.539" end="01:48:47.590" style="s2">you might have done about them then but</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.880" end="01:48:50.349" style="s2">more importantly what you could do about</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.590" end="01:48:51.519" style="s2">them in the future to avoid them because</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.349" end="01:48:52.969" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter that something</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.519" end="01:48:56.389" style="s2">embarrassing happened to you</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.969" end="01:48:58.369" style="s2">what matters is whether or not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.389" end="01:49:02.360" style="s2">likely to repeat it in the future but my</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.369" end="01:49:05.809" style="s2">suspicions are that even if you just you</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.360" end="01:49:08.179" style="s2">could just start simply write down every</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.809" end="01:49:11.840" style="s2">ruminating ruminating thought that you</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.179" end="01:49:14.420" style="s2">have voluntarily and think about them in</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.840" end="01:49:18.440" style="s2">detail and write them down in detail get</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.420" end="01:49:20.570" style="s2">every little word down and then you have</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.440" end="01:49:25.179" style="s2">that document and then when you have a</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.570" end="01:49:28.249" style="s2">thought and start to ruminate on it then</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.179" end="01:49:31.010" style="s2">sit down later after the ruminating</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.249" end="01:49:34.010" style="s2">thought goes away and bring it to mind</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.010" end="01:49:37.130" style="s2">voluntarily so every time you ever</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.010" end="01:49:39.619" style="s2">thought you don&#39;t want to have later</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.130" end="01:49:43.070" style="s2">practice having that thought on purpose</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.619" end="01:49:45.170" style="s2">and try that for about a month and see</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.070" end="01:49:48.949" style="s2">what happens because it&#39;s often the case</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.170" end="01:49:50.469" style="s2">that if you start thinking about the</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.949" end="01:49:52.960" style="s2">thoughts you&#39;re ruminating on</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.469" end="01:49:55.550" style="s2">consciously and confront them</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.960" end="01:49:58.280" style="s2">voluntarily that they will start to go</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.550" end="01:50:01.539" style="s2">away so you could try that you could try</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.280" end="01:50:01.539" style="s2">that that that should help</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.800" end="01:50:21.570" style="s2">what&#39;s the best method to retain what</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.110" end="01:50:25.850" style="s2">you read and to be able to use it in</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.570" end="01:50:25.850" style="s2">conversation oh well</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.840" end="01:50:42.190" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult ready to retain</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.750" end="01:50:45.730" style="s2">anything without recalling it so look if</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.190" end="01:50:47.230" style="s2">you encounter something and then you</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.730" end="01:50:49.570" style="s2">encounter it again you can usually</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.230" end="01:50:50.140" style="s2">recognize that you&#39;ve encountered it</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.570" end="01:50:52.540" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.140" end="01:50:54.910" style="s2">that&#39;s recognition memory so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.540" end="01:50:57.310" style="s2">an important form of memory it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.910" end="01:50:59.080" style="s2">it&#39;s the memory that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.310" end="01:51:01.420" style="s2">familiarity but it&#39;s not the same as</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.080" end="01:51:03.430" style="s2">being able to use something exactly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.420" end="01:51:06.070" style="s2">a rather shallow form of memory even</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.430" end="01:51:09.820" style="s2">though it&#39;s necessary in order to be</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.070" end="01:51:12.430" style="s2">able to use something you have to recall</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.820" end="01:51:14.380" style="s2">it this is also very useful hint for</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.430" end="01:51:16.210" style="s2">studying like if you&#39;re studying and you</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.380" end="01:51:18.760" style="s2">have to remember what you want to do is</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.210" end="01:51:21.340" style="s2">study and then you want to write down</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.760" end="01:51:23.740" style="s2">what you just learned so you read a</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.340" end="01:51:25.900" style="s2">paragraph you close the book and you</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.740" end="01:51:28.360" style="s2">write down what you remember or you read</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.900" end="01:51:30.100" style="s2">a chapter and you close the book and you</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.360" end="01:51:32.830" style="s2">write down what you remember or at least</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.100" end="01:51:35.410" style="s2">you sit there and you try to remember</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.830" end="01:51:39.790" style="s2">because the way you remember is by</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.410" end="01:51:41.200" style="s2">practicing remembering okay so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.790" end="01:51:43.750" style="s2">reading and you want to use it in</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.200" end="01:51:46.540" style="s2">conversation then you have to think</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.750" end="01:51:48.790" style="s2">about what you read you have to put it</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.540" end="01:51:50.830" style="s2">in your own words it&#39;s also often</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.790" end="01:51:53.560" style="s2">helpful to close the book and write it</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.830" end="01:51:56.620" style="s2">down or to associate it with some</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.560" end="01:51:58.420" style="s2">problem that you&#39;re currently trying to</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.620" end="01:52:01.420" style="s2">solve you have to take the knowledge and</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.420" end="01:52:03.760" style="s2">make it your own and then and then that</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.420" end="01:52:05.680" style="s2">alters the structure through which you</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.760" end="01:52:07.900" style="s2">look at the world and that changes the</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.680" end="01:52:09.490" style="s2">way that you think so that when you have</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.900" end="01:52:10.750" style="s2">a conversation the next time that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.490" end="01:52:13.300" style="s2">going to have the conversation in a</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.750" end="01:52:16.030" style="s2">different way so merely reading isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.300" end="01:52:19.720" style="s2">enough you have you have to read and</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.030" end="01:52:21.940" style="s2">think and recall and it&#39;s the act of</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.720" end="01:52:23.680" style="s2">recalling that produces the remembering</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.940" end="01:52:29.550" style="s2">and it&#39;s that act of remembering that</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.680" end="01:52:29.550" style="s2">puts that material at hand for you so</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.340" end="01:52:37.450" style="s2">okay well look I&#39;m just about done here</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.320" end="01:52:38.950" style="s2">it&#39;s 11:35 so I&#39;ve gone for 19 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.450" end="01:52:40.780" style="s2">and I hear people rattling around</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.950" end="01:52:43.360" style="s2">upstairs and I have to fly to Zurich</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.780" end="01:52:46.680" style="s2">today and so I&#39;m going to stop out I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.360" end="01:52:48.330" style="s2">going to stop here so I&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.680" end="01:52:55.820" style="s2">one more question and answer it and then</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.330" end="01:52:58.890" style="s2">I just found out I&#39;m having a girl</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.820" end="01:53:01.680" style="s2">congratulations what can I do to raise</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.890" end="01:53:03.420" style="s2">her to think for herself and not fall</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.680" end="01:53:08.160" style="s2">into the modes of thinking proposed by</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.420" end="01:53:10.260" style="s2">popular culture well you can let her</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.160" end="01:53:12.270" style="s2">think for herself when she&#39;s a kid</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.260" end="01:53:16.620" style="s2">you know what you do is so that she</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.270" end="01:53:20.940" style="s2">practices doing that you know and so</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.620" end="01:53:25.050" style="s2">that means to consciously encourage as</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.940" end="01:53:26.970" style="s2">much autonomy as possible so how do you</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.050" end="01:53:29.070" style="s2">do that well let&#39;s say she&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.970" end="01:53:30.630" style="s2">kid she&#39;s three and she started to get</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.070" end="01:53:32.190" style="s2">interested in clothing so you late</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.630" end="01:53:33.720" style="s2">clothing out of the bed and you say what</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.190" end="01:53:35.270" style="s2">you can wear this or you can wear this</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.720" end="01:53:39.090" style="s2">you let her make autonomous decisions</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.270" end="01:53:41.850" style="s2">you know with kids you don&#39;t want to let</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.090" end="01:53:43.530" style="s2">them choose from an infinite menu you</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.850" end="01:53:45.480" style="s2">want to give them a constraint menu but</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.530" end="01:53:49.350" style="s2">what you want to do with your daughter</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.480" end="01:53:51.900" style="s2">is allow her to make as many decisions</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.350" end="01:53:55.020" style="s2">as she can possibly make as early as</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.900" end="01:53:56.850" style="s2">possible you know and that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.020" end="01:53:59.430" style="s2">the children always know what&#39;s best for</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.850" end="01:54:02.450" style="s2">themselves or any nonsense like that it</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.430" end="01:54:07.970" style="s2">just means that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.450" end="01:54:10.440" style="s2">encourage her autonomy to every in every</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.970" end="01:54:11.820" style="s2">measure that you can manage and that</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.440" end="01:54:13.380" style="s2">means you&#39;re gonna have to be brave and</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.820" end="01:54:17.760" style="s2">allow her to subject herself to a</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.380" end="01:54:20.090" style="s2">certain number of risks so you you you</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.760" end="01:54:24.330" style="s2">raise her to think for herself by</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.090" end="01:54:25.950" style="s2">letting her think for herself and and</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.330" end="01:54:28.980" style="s2">that can start that can start quite</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.950" end="01:54:31.020" style="s2">early um I would say when she&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.980" end="01:54:33.000" style="s2">teenager she&#39;s going to fall into the</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.020" end="01:54:34.380" style="s2">modes of thinking proposed by popular</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.000" end="01:54:36.570" style="s2">culture because that&#39;s part of being</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.380" end="01:54:38.850" style="s2">enculturated and socialized it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.570" end="01:54:40.890" style="s2">virtually inevitable and it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.850" end="01:54:44.970" style="s2">somewhat desirable but what you hope is</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.890" end="01:54:48.090" style="s2">that you&#39;ve you&#39;ve encouraged the</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.970" end="01:54:50.480" style="s2">capacity for autonomous thinking to a</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.090" end="01:54:53.600" style="s2">sufficient degree that it&#39;s likely to</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.480" end="01:54:56.400" style="s2">integrate with that more intense teenage</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.600" end="01:54:57.590" style="s2">socialization and then reemerge so you</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.400" end="01:54:59.230" style="s2">get someone who</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.590" end="01:55:01.940" style="s2">the other side as an autonomous</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.230" end="01:55:05.449" style="s2">individual and that works with boys and</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.940" end="01:55:07.639" style="s2">girls so so you know let&#39;s I guess you</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.449" end="01:55:09.440" style="s2">do what Geppetto did and Pinocchio is</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.639" end="01:55:12.409" style="s2">the first thing you decide is well you</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.440" end="01:55:14.300" style="s2">don&#39;t want to raise a puppet you know</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.409" end="01:55:16.580" style="s2">you want to raise an autonomous person</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.300" end="01:55:18.320" style="s2">and and then you think through what what</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.580" end="01:55:19.760" style="s2">does it mean to be an autonomous person</p>
