<p begin="00:00:10.950" end="00:00:16.710" style="s2">half of the Dark Horse podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.530" end="00:00:19.020" style="s2">livestream number seven we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.710" end="00:00:21.359" style="s2">answer your super chat questions I am</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.020" end="00:00:23.010" style="s2">sitting with dr. Heather huiying I am</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.359" end="00:00:24.689" style="s2">going to do a better job</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.010" end="00:00:26.519" style="s2">I promise of speaking into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.689" end="00:00:29.160" style="s2">microphone it&#39;s harder than it looks</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.519" end="00:00:31.439" style="s2">mm-hmm all right all right that further</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.160" end="00:00:33.300" style="s2">ado we are going to embark on these</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:35.250" style="s2">questions question number one</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.300" end="00:00:36.690" style="s2">looking at the toilet paper hoarding</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.250" end="00:00:37.950" style="s2">from an evolutionary standpoint do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.690" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">believe gender differences could be</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.950" end="00:00:42.300" style="s2">playing a role and would men or women be</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:47.879" style="s2">the more likely culprit playing a role</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.300" end="00:00:49.739" style="s2">good one roll of toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.879" end="00:00:52.860" style="s2">oh it&#39;s spelled differently you spellers</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.739" end="00:00:55.739" style="s2">are all alike yeah what do you think you</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.860" end="00:01:00.210" style="s2">want to address that yeah I think women</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.739" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">are more likely to be hoarding toilet</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.210" end="00:01:04.019" style="s2">paper right I&#39;m not sure I love the term</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:07.140" style="s2">hoarding I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.019" end="00:01:09.689" style="s2">about this on the live stream but the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.140" end="00:01:11.580" style="s2">idea of planning ahead and having a back</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.689" end="00:01:13.290" style="s2">supply of things that you need is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.580" end="00:01:15.780" style="s2">inherently hoarding if you never did it</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.290" end="00:01:17.280" style="s2">before and you&#39;re panicking maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.780" end="00:01:18.659" style="s2">looks like hoarding but if you always</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.280" end="00:01:19.740" style="s2">tend to have a lot of something around</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.659" end="00:01:22.460" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure that that should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.740" end="00:01:25.710" style="s2">qualified as hoarding but put that aside</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.460" end="00:01:27.570" style="s2">women in general are more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.710" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">putting stuff away and saving and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.570" end="00:01:33.570" style="s2">planning for for later situations I</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:35.640" style="s2">think and also women use toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.570" end="00:01:37.140" style="s2">more for you know women you store the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.640" end="00:01:37.790" style="s2">paper every time they use the bathroom I</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.140" end="00:01:40.170" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.790" end="00:01:41.820" style="s2">whereas men only used two other paper</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.170" end="00:01:44.310" style="s2">when they&#39;re actually sitting there on</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.820" end="00:01:47.220" style="s2">the toilet so I think it&#39;s safe to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.310" end="00:01:49.740" style="s2">women are probably more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.220" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">stockpiling toilet paper and men are</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.740" end="00:01:53.579" style="s2">more likely to be left scratching their</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:01:58.950" style="s2">heads wondering why it doesn&#39;t drop from</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.579" end="00:02:01.700" style="s2">the sky like normal perhaps yes I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.950" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">say I find the whole toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.700" end="00:02:08.009" style="s2">phenomenon curious because as much as I</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:11.480" style="s2">get that people are stocking up even on</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.009" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s not absolutely essential I</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.480" end="00:02:15.480" style="s2">think this is more a reflection</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:18.810" style="s2">action of human and securities than it</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.480" end="00:02:21.810" style="s2">is a response to the particular crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.810" end="00:02:25.189" style="s2">in question you know this could get kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.810" end="00:02:28.019" style="s2">of biological in nature but I gotta say</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.189" end="00:02:30.359" style="s2">if the toilet paper I mean some people</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.019" end="00:02:32.280" style="s2">wise people aren&#39;t using toilet paper to</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.359" end="00:02:35.189" style="s2">begin with they&#39;ve moved on to some</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.280" end="00:02:39.629" style="s2">version of a bidet that&#39;s healthier for</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.189" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">the body and you know if the if the hot</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.629" end="00:02:46.049" style="s2">water continues to run toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:47.129" style="s2">isn&#39;t your only go to move so a whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.049" end="00:02:49.919" style="s2">lot of the world doesn&#39;t use toilet</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.129" end="00:02:51.419" style="s2">paper and this I mean we we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.919" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">continue to spend so much time on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.419" end="00:02:56.280" style="s2">first question in front of time at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:02:58.709" style="s2">end but back when I Madagascar</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.280" end="00:03:01.739" style="s2">you know I embarked on these five months</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.709" end="00:03:03.359" style="s2">field seasons and would have to plan out</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.739" end="00:03:05.189" style="s2">what am I gonna need for five months and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.359" end="00:03:07.889" style="s2">one of the things was how much does a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.189" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">person and her field assistant and which</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.889" end="00:03:11.250" style="s2">toilet paper does one person and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:13.859" style="s2">feel assistant or for the field season</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.250" end="00:03:16.079" style="s2">you were with me on two people and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.859" end="00:03:17.579" style="s2">field assistant used in five months</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.079" end="00:03:19.379" style="s2">because at that point anyway there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.579" end="00:03:21.510" style="s2">literally no possibility of buying</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.379" end="00:03:22.859" style="s2">toilet paper anywhere in Madagascar it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.510" end="00:03:24.449" style="s2">just not what they used and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.859" end="00:03:25.620" style="s2">it&#39;s such a desperately poor country</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.449" end="00:03:26.970" style="s2">that it was not going to be a luxury</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.620" end="00:03:29.069" style="s2">item that started to be used it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.970" end="00:03:30.479" style="s2">that people don&#39;t clean their butts they</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.069" end="00:03:32.459" style="s2">do so they just don&#39;t do it with paper</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.479" end="00:03:34.500" style="s2">do it some other way yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.459" end="00:03:38.040" style="s2">in Madagascar even the concept of toilet</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.500" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">was a bit foreign in most locations all</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.040" end="00:03:43.709" style="s2">right let&#39;s move on alright so this we</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:44.939" style="s2">have several questions from echo which</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.709" end="00:03:49.709" style="s2">thank you I know know how to pronounce</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.939" end="00:03:52.199" style="s2">your name assume that virus X has become</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.709" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">innocuous and a rat species can it cause</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.199" end="00:03:57.030" style="s2">radical diet change for instance if all</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">pandas who fed on virus Laden rats died</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:04:04.079" style="s2">and only those able to eat bamboo to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:06.150" style="s2">survive yeah so first of all when you</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.079" end="00:04:11.250" style="s2">say innocuous we presume that you mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.150" end="00:04:14.159" style="s2">that it has become a some harmless to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.250" end="00:04:16.079" style="s2">the creature that is not consistent with</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.159" end="00:04:18.150" style="s2">it radically changing diet because</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.079" end="00:04:23.310" style="s2">presumably the animal that would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.150" end="00:04:26.190" style="s2">infected has a diet choice that is honed</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.310" end="00:04:26.940" style="s2">based on whatever the opportunity cost</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:28.650" style="s2">of the various</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.940" end="00:04:30.330" style="s2">foodstuffs that are available are so if</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.650" end="00:04:31.650" style="s2">the virus alters what the animal is</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.330" end="00:04:34.170" style="s2">feeding on it&#39;s moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.650" end="00:04:36.360" style="s2">whatever selection had chosen as the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.170" end="00:04:38.090" style="s2">right diet for that habitat so those two</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.360" end="00:04:43.550" style="s2">things are a little bit inconsistent but</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.090" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">your point about could a virus alter the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.550" end="00:04:50.130" style="s2">the food preferences of an animal yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:52.550" style="s2">this is readily possible and I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.130" end="00:04:58.460" style="s2">just say that if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.550" end="00:05:01.970" style="s2">toxoplasmosis in rodents which is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.460" end="00:05:03.810" style="s2">parasite that alters the behavior of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.970" end="00:05:07.050" style="s2">rodents such that they are more likely</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.810" end="00:05:11.630" style="s2">to be ingested by cats cats being the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.050" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">place where the the pathogen reproduces</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.630" end="00:05:16.290" style="s2">we see exactly this kind of alteration</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:18.090" style="s2">and it&#39;s not the only case there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.290" end="00:05:19.800" style="s2">many places where pathogens alter</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.090" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">behavior to increase the likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.800" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">their being passed on not all of them</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.690" end="00:05:26.520" style="s2">match that model you proposed but enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:29.070" style="s2">things are close that yeah it&#39;s readily</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.520" end="00:05:30.300" style="s2">possible and follow-up here could</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.070" end="00:05:32.520" style="s2">awareness for the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.300" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">catching a potential virus be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.520" end="00:05:36.390" style="s2">reasons why some animals don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:38.340" style="s2">company of other species could that be</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.390" end="00:05:41.490" style="s2">one more reason than food to defend</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.340" end="00:05:43.440" style="s2">territory the question about defending</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.490" end="00:05:47.010" style="s2">territory is particularly interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.440" end="00:05:52.140" style="s2">think I think yes potentially yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.010" end="00:05:54.870" style="s2">would say it&#39;s certainly true that to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.140" end="00:05:58.440" style="s2">the extent that viruses or any other</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.870" end="00:06:01.470" style="s2">pathogen leaping between species carries</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.440" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">a cost that it will be it will schedule</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.470" end="00:06:05.669" style="s2">how reluctant creatures are to interact</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:10.040" style="s2">and I will also say that I&#39;ve seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.669" end="00:06:14.490" style="s2">mammalogist I&#39;ve seen ectoparasites</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.040" end="00:06:17.190" style="s2">attempt to abandon a sinking mammal you</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.490" end="00:06:19.290" style="s2">know where an animal dies and it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.190" end="00:06:21.330" style="s2">fleas and those fleas are now in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.290" end="00:06:23.310" style="s2">desperate race to find some other</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.330" end="00:06:24.660" style="s2">animals so from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.310" end="00:06:28.890" style="s2">anything that would mess with that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.660" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">carcass like a scavenger there is going</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.890" end="00:06:35.220" style="s2">to be a cost-benefit analysis is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.990" style="s2">meat worth the ectoparasites or you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.220" end="00:06:38.970" style="s2">if it&#39;s a raptor maybe the ectoparasites</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.990" end="00:06:40.289" style="s2">aren&#39;t very well adapted to jump to the</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.800" end="00:08:06.629" style="s2">aggregations and then once there once</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.439" end="00:08:07.949" style="s2">their broods are reared and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.629" end="00:08:13.469" style="s2">migrating again they tend to</p>

<p begin="00:08:13.469" end="00:08:17.729" style="s2">question from so there&#39;s four questions</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.599" end="00:08:20.399" style="s2">here from echo our animals aware of more</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.729" end="00:08:23.009" style="s2">things than we assumed yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.399" end="00:08:24.689" style="s2">depends who you are and what you say yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.009" end="00:08:26.849" style="s2">but they but they know but they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.689" end="00:08:29.610" style="s2">aware of things that probably some</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.849" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">animals are capable of inferring</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.610" end="00:08:35.909" style="s2">information about the world that we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:38.189" style="s2">very little concept of so I will say</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.909" end="00:08:40.860" style="s2">I&#39;ll pull in both directions on this one</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.189" end="00:08:43.620" style="s2">animals are frequently aware of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.860" end="00:08:45.779" style="s2">that you don&#39;t expect them to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.620" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">of on the other hand awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.779" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">conscious are two different things and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:51.990" style="s2">some at some point we will talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:53.279" style="s2">consciousness but I would just say that</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.990" end="00:08:56.370" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.279" end="00:08:59.139" style="s2">next to no reason to hypothesize</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.370" end="00:09:02.949" style="s2">consciousness in a great many organisms</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.139" end="00:09:05.079" style="s2">that behave in a beautifully interactive</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.949" end="00:09:09.579" style="s2">way in other words consciousness that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.079" end="00:09:11.860" style="s2">subjective experience is costly and not</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.579" end="00:09:13.749" style="s2">necessarily beneficial with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.860" end="00:09:16.029" style="s2">accomplishing many of the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.749" end="00:09:17.889" style="s2">things that animals do so don&#39;t leap to</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.029" end="00:09:19.300" style="s2">the assumption that just because an</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.889" end="00:09:21.009" style="s2">animal behaves in a way that a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.300" end="00:09:23.499" style="s2">animal might that it is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.009" end="00:09:24.939" style="s2">conscious in many cases it will almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.499" end="00:09:27.220" style="s2">certainly turn out not to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.939" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">what&#39;s so interesting I read aware I</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.220" end="00:09:31.899" style="s2">immediately sonata my&#39;s that with</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:34.379" style="s2">sensory inputs you know what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.899" end="00:09:38.350" style="s2">sensory inputs to do other animals have</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.379" end="00:09:40.899" style="s2">that we either don&#39;t have in as is</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.350" end="00:09:42.309" style="s2">higher form you know our sense of smell</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.899" end="00:09:45.670" style="s2">is much reduced compared to the other</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.309" end="00:09:47.350" style="s2">mammals or that we don&#39;t appear to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.670" end="00:09:50.499" style="s2">at all things like electro sensory</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.350" end="00:09:53.019" style="s2">perception yep and I would just say the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.499" end="00:09:55.899" style="s2">way to think about this is if you look</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.019" end="00:09:58.420" style="s2">up at the canopy of a forest you will</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.899" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">see that the trees actually have</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.420" end="00:10:02.500" style="s2">interlaced with each other that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:03.759" style="s2">don&#39;t spend a lot of time overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.500" end="00:10:05.589" style="s2">and they really don&#39;t spend a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.759" end="00:10:07.750" style="s2">time crashing into each other right</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.589" end="00:10:09.730" style="s2">they&#39;ve sort of navigated the space in</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.750" end="00:10:11.379" style="s2">some way that suggests the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.730" end="00:10:13.629" style="s2">awareness and we know it has nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.379" end="00:10:17.559" style="s2">do with a conscious awareness subjective</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.629" end="00:10:21.459" style="s2">experience etc it&#39;s a kind of passive</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.559" end="00:10:23.319" style="s2">awareness but elegant good and final</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.459" end="00:10:24.670" style="s2">question from echo Brett would people</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.319" end="00:10:26.620" style="s2">who look younger than their age have</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.670" end="00:10:29.040" style="s2">longer telomeres any studies on</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.620" end="00:10:32.680" style="s2">different ethnicities telomere lengths</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.040" end="00:10:36.899" style="s2">yeah I would be a little bit cautious</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.680" end="00:10:41.230" style="s2">about people who look younger that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.899" end="00:10:45.600" style="s2">that is too broad but yes you will find</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.230" end="00:10:49.240" style="s2">any tissue that has a below average</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.600" end="00:10:51.339" style="s2">level of damage at a given age will</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.240" end="00:10:53.620" style="s2">leave that individual younger in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.339" end="00:10:55.660" style="s2">tissue that can be your liver it can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.620" end="00:11:00.329" style="s2">your skin we know a lot about how this</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.660" end="00:11:04.059" style="s2">works in skin with collagen matrix but</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.329" end="00:11:05.960" style="s2">basically rule of thumb would be that if</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.059" end="00:11:07.640" style="s2">a tissue looks younger and I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.960" end="00:11:09.650" style="s2">the gold standard would be under a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.640" end="00:11:11.450" style="s2">microscope if the tissue looks really</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.650" end="00:11:13.850" style="s2">well-organized like it came from a young</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.450" end="00:11:16.130" style="s2">animal it probably is chronologically</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.850" end="00:11:19.100" style="s2">younger by virtue of having gone through</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.130" end="00:11:22.490" style="s2">fewer cell divisions to get where it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.100" end="00:11:24.320" style="s2">and you know we also empirically I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.490" end="00:11:28.190" style="s2">just say there&#39;s a lot of truth to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.320" end="00:11:30.530" style="s2">fact that you know 60 is the new 40</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.190" end="00:11:32.870" style="s2">right there&#39;s a way in which our lives</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.530" end="00:11:36.380" style="s2">just do so much less damage than our</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.870" end="00:11:37.790" style="s2">immediate ancestors you know because you</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.380" end="00:11:39.800" style="s2">know we do certain kinds of damage</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.790" end="00:11:41.570" style="s2">sitting at a desk or whatever but by and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.800" end="00:11:45.050" style="s2">large our lives are physically a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.570" end="00:11:48.560" style="s2">easier than they were even a century ago</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.050" end="00:11:51.110" style="s2">and so hard lives we&#39;re down you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.560" end="00:11:52.850" style="s2">replicative capacity rapidly and to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.110" end="00:11:55.070" style="s2">extent that you&#39;re spared that you do</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.850" end="00:11:57.560" style="s2">retain youth longer which is desirable</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.070" end="00:11:59.870" style="s2">this part of why I&#39;m so troubled by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.560" end="00:12:02.360" style="s2">campaign to end human aging is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.870" end="00:12:04.400" style="s2">actually if we got over that we know a</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.360" end="00:12:07.430" style="s2">ton about how to how to keep you healthy</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.400" end="00:12:09.650" style="s2">longer and the returns on research</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.430" end="00:12:12.530" style="s2">investments that go towards how do we</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.650" end="00:12:15.560" style="s2">slow the aging process not by magic but</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.530" end="00:12:18.290" style="s2">by you know making life better and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.560" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">healthier those returns are great and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.290" end="00:12:22.970" style="s2">are ignoring them gambling on something</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:25.790" style="s2">that I think will never come to pass</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.970" end="00:12:27.980" style="s2">which is actually correcting the aging</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.819" end="00:13:41.879" style="s2">19 like SARS cough - yeah yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.759" end="00:13:44.160" style="s2">say absolutely you would expect viruses</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.879" end="00:13:46.319" style="s2">to naturally evolve to regulate their</p>

<p begin="00:13:53.220" end="00:13:59.249" style="s2">the rule but how much how much</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.749" end="00:14:09.480" style="s2">and the more transmission between cells</p>

<p begin="00:14:09.480" end="00:14:13.670" style="s2">to be so as we&#39;ve talked about before in</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.379" end="00:14:44.579" style="s2">more the more specialized your virus is</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.019" end="00:14:46.170" style="s2">the less likely we&#39;re going to see it if</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.579" end="00:14:48.179" style="s2">it started out in the bat or a Pangolin</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.170" end="00:14:50.610" style="s2">or a Sibbett or camel or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.179" end="00:14:53.819" style="s2">whereas these more generalized</p>

<p begin="00:14:56.699" end="00:14:59.730" style="s2">why we see something that looks kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.139" end="00:15:01.709" style="s2">just regulated on the part of the virus</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.730" end="00:15:05.069" style="s2">right now you know i think i think i</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.709" end="00:15:06.870" style="s2">think most people have dropped the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.069" end="00:15:08.999" style="s2">expectation now that this will clearly</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.870" end="00:15:10.050" style="s2">follow the seasonal pattern and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.999" end="00:15:13.709" style="s2">see less of it in the north american</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.050" end="00:15:15.660" style="s2">summer because there doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.709" end="00:15:17.509" style="s2">any evidence of that from the south</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.660" end="00:15:21.749" style="s2">america from the southern hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.509" end="00:15:23.129" style="s2">summer and from more tropical climes but</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.749" end="00:15:28.270" style="s2">really this is about as we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.129" end="00:15:31.690" style="s2">about earlier this is about</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.270" end="00:15:34.870" style="s2">this particular virus being a completely</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.690" end="00:15:38.110" style="s2">new to the human host it&#39;s not that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.870" end="00:15:39.670" style="s2">virus is new to life on this planet but</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.110" end="00:15:43.089" style="s2">it&#39;s very new to its relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.670" end="00:15:45.070" style="s2">us yeah it it has no experience with us</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.089" end="00:15:47.980" style="s2">and so even if it&#39;s well regulated for</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.070" end="00:15:49.870" style="s2">its original bat host it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.980" end="00:15:52.240" style="s2">that it even has the signals to follow</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.870" end="00:15:55.300" style="s2">the same pattern right you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.240" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2">human so I would say in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.300" end="00:15:58.779" style="s2">covert 19</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.320" end="00:16:03.490" style="s2">we&#39;re in some sense waiting for it to</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.779" end="00:16:06.070" style="s2">figure out what its interests are we I</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.490" end="00:16:08.500" style="s2">do expect some decrease in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.070" end="00:16:11.050" style="s2">transmissibility from a number of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.500" end="00:16:13.690" style="s2">different sources one is what we talked</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.050" end="00:16:16.390" style="s2">about last time UV light being an</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.690" end="00:16:17.500" style="s2">effective killer of the thing so to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.390" end="00:16:19.270" style="s2">extent that it&#39;s brighter and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.500" end="00:16:20.950" style="s2">more hours of daylight that suggests a</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.270" end="00:16:22.690" style="s2">positivity that has nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.950" end="00:16:27.850" style="s2">the cyclic pattern of the pathogen</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.690" end="00:16:29.740" style="s2">itself and also if it is true that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.850" end="00:16:31.779" style="s2">are seeing and again there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.740" end="00:16:34.150" style="s2">studies that say that we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.779" end="00:16:36.850" style="s2">something like half a percent to one</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.150" end="00:16:40.420" style="s2">percent of the total infected population</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.850" end="00:16:43.690" style="s2">are showing up on reports of Ovid 19</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.420" end="00:16:46.570" style="s2">cases if that holds from the Scottish</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.690" end="00:16:50.529" style="s2">data and elsewhere then what it suggests</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.570" end="00:16:52.510" style="s2">is potentially a sizable fraction of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.529" end="00:16:55.480" style="s2">population growing immune over time</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.510" end="00:16:56.589" style="s2">without being symptomatic and that also</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.480" end="00:16:58.870" style="s2">predicts something has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.589" end="00:17:00.670" style="s2">with seasonality but as we head towards</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.870" end="00:17:02.970" style="s2">the northern summer we&#39;re also heading</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.670" end="00:17:05.500" style="s2">towards greater herd immunity right</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.970" end="00:17:09.220" style="s2">which is what we want yep that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.500" end="00:17:11.110" style="s2">the best outcome can you recommend some</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.220" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">books for any of that from any of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.110" end="00:17:14.410" style="s2">vast branches of biology I left the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:16.600" style="s2">question somewhat vague to give more</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.410" end="00:17:19.449" style="s2">room for interpretation we will have</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.600" end="00:17:21.579" style="s2">recommended reading associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.449" end="00:17:23.500" style="s2">book that we are writing but I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.579" end="00:17:24.730" style="s2">can do three right off the top of my</p>

<p begin="00:17:32.410" end="00:17:38.620" style="s2">use an update but it&#39;s excellent mother</p>

<p begin="00:18:28.100" end="00:18:32.059" style="s2">there&#39;s a great book that you and I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.419" end="00:18:33.799" style="s2">taught from called tropical nature oh</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.059" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">yeah which if you want to get a handle</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.799" end="00:18:37.639" style="s2">on how things are different in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">tropics it&#39;s a great place to start so a</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.639" end="00:18:42.620" style="s2">really good book and if when this</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:45.230" style="s2">lockdown is lifted and people are able</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.620" end="00:18:47.179" style="s2">to travel again it is the book that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.230" end="00:18:49.490" style="s2">recommend for people going to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.179" end="00:18:51.919" style="s2">tropics and actually you know explain to</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.490" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">explore tropical nature you want this</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.919" end="00:18:55.220" style="s2">book in your hands especially if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:58.190" style="s2">the Neotropics yeah that&#39;s fact I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.220" end="00:19:00.500" style="s2">go so far as to say it is essential</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.190" end="00:19:02.510" style="s2">reading so Amazon should send it to you</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.500" end="00:19:03.950" style="s2">even if you&#39;re in Michigan yes because</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.510" end="00:19:05.539" style="s2">you heard it here first from tropical</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.950" end="00:19:08.210" style="s2">biologist there you go there it is and</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.539" end="00:19:10.190" style="s2">we would know we would know did the use</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.210" end="00:19:12.200" style="s2">of ancient psychotropic plants by early</p>

<p begin="00:19:19.429" end="00:19:25.490" style="s2">reason to imagine a genetic disposition</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.260" end="00:19:28.549" style="s2">but but I&#39;m not gonna blame psychotropic</p>

<p begin="00:19:28.549" end="00:19:33.470" style="s2">don&#39;t think either one of them would</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.450" end="00:19:35.690" style="s2">listen to us but I will say we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.470" end="00:19:39.320" style="s2">coming to understand over time that the</p>

<p begin="00:20:04.479" end="00:20:10.450" style="s2">some there&#39;s a rat study I think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.840" end="00:20:13.720" style="s2">bears this out right but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.450" end="00:20:15.429" style="s2">rats that you you offer them and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.720" end="00:20:17.320" style="s2">remember it&#39;s it&#39;s coke or meth or one</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.429" end="00:20:19.029" style="s2">of these one of these powdered drugs you</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.320" end="00:20:20.499" style="s2">offer it to them in a cage bereft of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.029" end="00:20:23.350" style="s2">anything to do and of course they become</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.499" end="00:20:25.239" style="s2">addicted and you enrich their lives with</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.350" end="00:20:27.549" style="s2">things that enrich the lives of rats I</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.239" end="00:20:29.379" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that&#39;s wheels to run in or</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.549" end="00:20:31.479" style="s2">television to watch I have no idea I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.379" end="00:20:34.749" style="s2">don&#39;t remember but they&#39;ll try it</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.479" end="00:20:37.059" style="s2">they&#39;ll try the the lever and and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.749" end="00:20:40.029" style="s2">take some but but they don&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.059" end="00:20:43.299" style="s2">addicted at nearly as high rates yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.029" end="00:20:45.309" style="s2">a rat study bears it out probably a bear</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.299" end="00:20:46.450" style="s2">study would rat it out absolutely you</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.309" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to have this stuff to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.450" end="00:20:52.659" style="s2">yeah a lot of really not math no any</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:54.759" style="s2">thoughts on the three-toed skink</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.659" end="00:20:57.220" style="s2">regarding its Amba parity here&#39;s the CNN</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.759" end="00:20:58.539" style="s2">article so we were able to look at one</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.220" end="00:21:00.309" style="s2">and only one of these questions in</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.539" end="00:21:03.009" style="s2">advance and we both saw that because</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.309" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">skinks right why would you tell them we</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.009" end="00:21:06.849" style="s2">looked it up it&#39;s so much cooler to just</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:09.159" style="s2">pretend that we happen to know this</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.849" end="00:21:12.429" style="s2">particular study I did so neither of us</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.159" end="00:21:13.869" style="s2">did and I still I only looked at the CNN</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.429" end="00:21:17.590" style="s2">article so I have not we did not have</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.869" end="00:21:19.629" style="s2">time to look at the paper that it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.590" end="00:21:22.899" style="s2">based on but it seems that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.629" end="00:21:25.389" style="s2">skink that was both a vaporous and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.899" end="00:21:28.509" style="s2">vaporous meaning that a individual both</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.389" end="00:21:31.359" style="s2">laid eggs and gave live birth and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.509" end="00:21:35.049" style="s2">is not supposed to happen right that in</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.359" end="00:21:37.210" style="s2">general species well it gave it I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.049" end="00:21:38.679" style="s2">I think what the study said was that it</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.210" end="00:21:40.419" style="s2">laid eggs and it gave life birth sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.679" end="00:21:41.919" style="s2">within the confines of what would</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.419" end="00:21:44.080" style="s2">normally be expected in a single</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.919" end="00:21:47.820" style="s2">pregnancy but there are snake species</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.080" end="00:21:49.809" style="s2">that do this there&#39;s snake species that</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.820" end="00:21:52.479" style="s2">depending on where they are in their</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.809" end="00:21:54.369" style="s2">range they will sometimes be of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.479" end="00:21:56.619" style="s2">vaporous that is giving live birth and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.369" end="00:21:58.389" style="s2">sometimes be a vaporous I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.619" end="00:22:00.159" style="s2">it&#39;s within a single individual although</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.389" end="00:22:03.920" style="s2">it&#39;s harder these are these are these</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.159" end="00:22:05.030" style="s2">very nasty and aggressive African snakes</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.920" end="00:22:07.550" style="s2">that I&#39;m thinking of I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.030" end="00:22:09.740" style="s2">the species there a couple of them um</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.550" end="00:22:11.980" style="s2">but it you know begs the question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.740" end="00:22:15.530" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing if individuals can do both</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.980" end="00:22:17.750" style="s2">but why in general the question is you</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.530" end="00:22:21.380" style="s2">know why why lay eggs versus why give</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.750" end="00:22:23.960" style="s2">birth egg-laying is the basal state to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.380" end="00:22:26.060" style="s2">return to that terminology that vivid</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.960" end="00:22:27.680" style="s2">parody evolves later than egg-laying and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.060" end="00:22:29.300" style="s2">there are reversals you can go back to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.680" end="00:22:30.830" style="s2">over parody from vivid parody and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.300" end="00:22:32.510" style="s2">there&#39;s also this intermediate state</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.830" end="00:22:34.310" style="s2">called ova viv a parody where you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.510" end="00:22:36.230" style="s2">eggs inside of you that hatch and then I</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.310" end="00:22:39.260" style="s2">was gonna ask if that was the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.230" end="00:22:41.450" style="s2">here yeah so it may well be and at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.260" end="00:22:43.790" style="s2">the CNN article didn&#39;t didn&#39;t say but</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.450" end="00:22:47.300" style="s2">but just think about you know under what</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.790" end="00:22:49.400" style="s2">circumstances you would you would want</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.300" end="00:22:51.830" style="s2">if you know if you&#39;re having kids if</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.400" end="00:22:54.650" style="s2">you&#39;re you know pursuing the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.830" end="00:22:56.870" style="s2">evolution has told you to pursue under</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.650" end="00:22:58.670" style="s2">what circumstances is it better to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.870" end="00:23:00.020" style="s2">a clutch of eggs that&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.670" end="00:23:02.690" style="s2">defenseless but which you can leave</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.020" end="00:23:04.580" style="s2">behind and travel to get food without</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.690" end="00:23:09.650" style="s2">the burden of being weighed down by the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.580" end="00:23:11.660" style="s2">eggs or you want all of your brood on</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.650" end="00:23:14.060" style="s2">you at all times but whenever you go out</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.660" end="00:23:15.380" style="s2">you&#39;re fully your kids and you are</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.060" end="00:23:17.860" style="s2">suffering the greater weight you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.380" end="00:23:20.770" style="s2">probably more susceptible to predation</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.860" end="00:23:24.230" style="s2">all of that so and then there are also</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.770" end="00:23:26.650" style="s2">differences around whether or not the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.230" end="00:23:29.420" style="s2">sex of your offspring is determined by</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.650" end="00:23:32.060" style="s2">by chromosomes or by environmental</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.420" end="00:23:33.350" style="s2">measures and you basically if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.060" end="00:23:34.340" style="s2">going to be of a vaporous you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.350" end="00:23:35.450" style="s2">to need to have chromosomal sex</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.340" end="00:23:38.930" style="s2">determinations there&#39;s all of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.450" end="00:23:40.520" style="s2">interesting factors here I&#39;m gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.930" end="00:23:43.010" style="s2">the other way and say that this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.520" end="00:23:45.710" style="s2">actually a totally expected thing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.010" end="00:23:48.170" style="s2">not expected is that you will see it mmm</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.710" end="00:23:50.300" style="s2">that basically the fact of species that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.170" end="00:23:52.220" style="s2">do both things depending upon where in</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.300" end="00:23:54.950" style="s2">their range there are they are and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.220" end="00:23:58.130" style="s2">fact that over time this characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.950" end="00:23:59.540" style="s2">changes predicts that individuals will</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.130" end="00:24:01.130" style="s2">find themselves somewhere in between</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.540" end="00:24:02.600" style="s2">some fraction of the time and then we</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.130" end="00:24:04.100" style="s2">just almost never see it but wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.600" end="00:24:06.950" style="s2">your prediction be that it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.100" end="00:24:09.290" style="s2">certainly ovav of a parity then since</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.950" end="00:24:11.180" style="s2">vivir parity requires so many distinct</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.290" end="00:24:12.710" style="s2">anatomical and physiological adaptations</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.180" end="00:24:15.890" style="s2">well right that I mean there are like</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.710" end="00:24:16.550" style="s2">four different phenotypes of placentas</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.890" end="00:24:19.490" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.550" end="00:24:21.590" style="s2">mammals but all of them have not just a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.490" end="00:24:23.870" style="s2">remarkable number of circulatory</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.590" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">respiratory neurological distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.870" end="00:24:28.520" style="s2">that then also have genetic distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:30.770" style="s2">whereas over fever parity okay I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.520" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">eggs do I lay the eggs or do I let the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.770" end="00:24:33.740" style="s2">thing hatch out inside of me and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:35.390" style="s2">give birth like that that seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.740" end="00:24:37.850" style="s2">pretty that&#39;s an easy that&#39;s an easy one</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.390" end="00:24:40.220" style="s2">to get past but the real question I</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.850" end="00:24:45.190" style="s2">would say is if you looked across the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.220" end="00:24:47.540" style="s2">phylogeny of snakes if this pattern is</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.190" end="00:24:49.580" style="s2">distributed such that we know it has</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.540" end="00:24:51.470" style="s2">evolved many times it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.580" end="00:24:53.900" style="s2">facultative thing where the structures</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.470" end="00:24:56.090" style="s2">are already latent in the genome yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.900" end="00:24:59.750" style="s2">actually breaths I have just the paper</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.090" end="00:25:03.430" style="s2">for you it&#39;s cool for people like us you</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.750" end="00:25:07.510" style="s2">can map the OVA Paraty onto onto the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.430" end="00:25:11.240" style="s2">snake for luncheon nice we just lost</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.510" end="00:25:13.070" style="s2">okay if an effective treatment or</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.240" end="00:25:15.410" style="s2">vaccine is not discovered before leaving</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.070" end="00:25:19.810" style="s2">quarantine have our actions delayed</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.410" end="00:25:19.810" style="s2">rather than prevented covered 19 deaths</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.800" end="00:25:28.370" style="s2">no I mean both oh yeah both but rather</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.010" end="00:25:31.610" style="s2">than no our actions will have delayed</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.370" end="00:25:34.010" style="s2">some deaths but they also prevented some</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.610" end="00:25:37.910" style="s2">because there will be greater herd</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.010" end="00:25:39.380" style="s2">immunity there will the virus presumably</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.910" end="00:25:41.570" style="s2">this is a guess but based on other</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.380" end="00:25:46.070" style="s2">viruses we will be evolving towards</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.570" end="00:25:47.540" style="s2">lesser variance over time and the health</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.070" end="00:25:50.330" style="s2">care professionals are learning better</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.540" end="00:25:52.940" style="s2">ways to treat so you know you say</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.330" end="00:25:55.760" style="s2">effective treatment or vaccine I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.940" end="00:25:58.220" style="s2">you know we have been skeptical of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.760" end="00:26:00.380" style="s2">the plan that like it&#39;s only about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.220" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">a vaccine or nothing but there are so</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.380" end="00:26:07.870" style="s2">many different avenues by which we</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:12.970" style="s2">trying to approach this that I would say</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.870" end="00:26:15.290" style="s2">even so even if we have no vaccine and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.970" end="00:26:17.990" style="s2">just treatments that seem to work in</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.290" end="00:26:20.900" style="s2">places and not in others that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.990" end="00:26:22.460" style="s2">quarantine will have yes delayed some</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.900" end="00:26:27.170" style="s2">deaths but also have prevented others I</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.460" end="00:26:28.790" style="s2">would add to this there is this lurking</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.170" end="00:26:29.900" style="s2">parameter that I think we don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.790" end="00:26:34.760" style="s2">to think about yet</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.900" end="00:26:37.909" style="s2">which is low levels of exposure causing</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.760" end="00:26:39.980" style="s2">non symptomatic cases that then generate</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.909" end="00:26:42.110" style="s2">immunity and we don&#39;t know how many of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.980" end="00:26:44.059" style="s2">these we are generating it is possible</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.110" end="00:26:47.890" style="s2">that I have been through this that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.059" end="00:26:50.539" style="s2">got sick with Kovan 19 back in February</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.890" end="00:26:53.539" style="s2">and that I had an asymptomatic case we</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.539" end="00:26:55.279" style="s2">actually a friend is sending us some</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.539" end="00:26:56.659" style="s2">tests and we may know more about whether</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.279" end="00:27:01.370" style="s2">or not this is what happened to us</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.659" end="00:27:03.950" style="s2">serology tests but in any case many</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.370" end="00:27:06.230" style="s2">things are possible including that what</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.950" end="00:27:10.940" style="s2">we are doing given the density-dependent</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.230" end="00:27:15.190" style="s2">evidence that lower lower exposure</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.940" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">levels result in less serious cases and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.190" end="00:27:21.470" style="s2">that there are many non symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:23.960" style="s2">cases slowing this down may actually be</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.470" end="00:27:26.210" style="s2">producing the effect of a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.960" end="00:27:29.080" style="s2">without us having invented a vaccine so</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.210" end="00:27:31.700" style="s2">I think there are lots of ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.080" end="00:27:34.070" style="s2">this is actually moving in the right</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.700" end="00:27:35.510" style="s2">direction and as much as I think much of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.070" end="00:27:38.270" style="s2">this had been botched at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.510" end="00:27:40.159" style="s2">governmental level the population has</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.270" end="00:27:44.480" style="s2">actually risen to the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.159" end="00:27:47.750" style="s2">surprisingly well and you know even</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.480" end="00:27:51.020" style="s2">absent the silver bullet this could work</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.750" end="00:27:53.570" style="s2">out yeah pretty well and with an</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.020" end="00:27:55.490" style="s2">endogenous biological vaccine created</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.570" end="00:27:59.090" style="s2">through behavioral modification rather</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.490" end="00:28:01.159" style="s2">than in a lab yeah on the fifth podcast</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.090" end="00:28:02.659" style="s2">you discussed the low success rate of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.159" end="00:28:04.210" style="s2">respirators I think we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.659" end="00:28:06.620" style="s2">about with ventilated entities you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.210" end="00:28:07.190" style="s2">hypothesizing koban 19 is hungry for</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.620" end="00:28:09.529" style="s2">oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.190" end="00:28:11.029" style="s2">somehow attacking hemoglobin if that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.529" end="00:28:14.419" style="s2">the case would blood doping be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.029" end="00:28:16.370" style="s2">treatment this is actively being thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.419" end="00:28:17.750" style="s2">about and discussed in medical circles</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.370" end="00:28:22.220" style="s2">and I think we need to leave it to them</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.750" end="00:28:26.210" style="s2">to to navigate that but I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.220" end="00:28:30.169" style="s2">evidence for hypoxia as a primary driver</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.210" end="00:28:31.850" style="s2">here is less secure than it was there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.169" end="00:28:32.960" style="s2">been more people have looked into it and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.850" end="00:28:36.620" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look that way on the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.960" end="00:28:39.850" style="s2">hand the evidence that ventilators that</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.620" end="00:28:43.120" style="s2">physical mechanical ventilation</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.850" end="00:28:46.410" style="s2">is not highly effective that basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.120" end="00:28:49.810" style="s2">it becomes necessary as people face</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.410" end="00:28:51.610" style="s2">these cytokine storms at the end of very</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.810" end="00:28:53.140" style="s2">serious cases oh I should come back to</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.610" end="00:28:55.720" style="s2">cytokine storm maybe a little bit later</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.140" end="00:28:57.580" style="s2">but as people face these dire</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.720" end="00:29:01.660" style="s2">consequences at the end of one of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.580" end="00:29:03.880" style="s2">very bad cases of kovat 19 the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.660" end="00:29:05.860" style="s2">ventilators become necessary but lots of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.880" end="00:29:09.130" style="s2">people don&#39;t live to get off the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.860" end="00:29:11.010" style="s2">ventilator yeah so I think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.130" end="00:29:13.270" style="s2">we are blood doping is a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.010" end="00:29:16.060" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about whether or not it</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.270" end="00:29:18.730" style="s2">carries immunity factors if it&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.060" end="00:29:20.410" style="s2">from people who have had an exposure and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.730" end="00:29:22.330" style="s2">recovered from it or whether or not it</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.410" end="00:29:24.910" style="s2">just simply carries increased capacity</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.330" end="00:29:27.430" style="s2">to have oxygen in the blood either way</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.910" end="00:29:31.690" style="s2">it could be viable but yes there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.430" end="00:29:33.520" style="s2">to be understood there well kovat 19</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.690" end="00:29:35.890" style="s2">proved to be as cataclysmic for academia</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:37.660" style="s2">as it is for other domains exposing</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.890" end="00:29:41.070" style="s2">academia&#39;s major structural weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.660" end="00:29:43.390" style="s2">and inability to adapt we can hope yes I</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.070" end="00:29:47.800" style="s2">my answer was not in response to you</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.390" end="00:29:51.520" style="s2">know the question yes I think especially</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.800" end="00:29:55.660" style="s2">the liberal arts colleges are suffering</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:57.880" style="s2">greatly and maybe some of the chickens</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.660" end="00:29:59.260" style="s2">have come home to roost yeah there are a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.880" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">lot of chickens in academia I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.260" end="00:30:08.260" style="s2">encountered quite a number myself I</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:10.120" style="s2">would I would say that oh we could we</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.260" end="00:30:15.280" style="s2">could do a whole live stream about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.120" end="00:30:20.280" style="s2">chickens in academia but the weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.280" end="00:30:23.170" style="s2">in academia are being revealed that is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.280" end="00:30:25.750" style="s2">hopeful thing if it allows what has been</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.170" end="00:30:30.220" style="s2">trapped inside of academia to either</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.750" end="00:30:32.530" style="s2">upgrade the institution so that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.220" end="00:30:34.690" style="s2">vital things that academia has</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.530" end="00:30:37.630" style="s2">traditionally been in charge of get done</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.690" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">better or that those things find a new</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.630" end="00:30:45.550" style="s2">home either way we cannot have science</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:47.980" style="s2">trapped inside of an institution that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.550" end="00:30:49.000" style="s2">can&#39;t figure out for example that men</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.980" end="00:30:50.830" style="s2">and women are actually two different</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.000" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">things right you just can&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.830" end="00:30:54.920" style="s2">institution in charge of the one</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">if it&#39;s confused about the other for</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.920" end="00:31:00.680" style="s2">example this is Pamela Olsen again who</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:02.900" style="s2">ends her question by asking us to hold</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.680" end="00:31:05.350" style="s2">hands and smile again so we&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.900" end="00:31:05.350" style="s2">that all right</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.750" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">she gives a link which we can&#39;t access</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.570" end="00:31:17.180" style="s2">right here but says that it says 91% of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:20.660" style="s2">deaths are over 55 years old 28.5% are</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.180" end="00:31:23.870" style="s2">over 85 the whose site says only 1% of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.660" end="00:31:29.420" style="s2">deaths do not have a comorbid disease</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.870" end="00:31:31.250" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t quarantine be targeted I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.420" end="00:31:35.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a really good argument for this</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.250" end="00:31:38.300" style="s2">and I think with with widespread</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.120" end="00:31:42.170" style="s2">serology testing it becomes an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.300" end="00:31:44.770" style="s2">argument that once we know especially</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.170" end="00:31:48.560" style="s2">including who has already been exposed</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.770" end="00:31:50.390" style="s2">the big if they&#39;re being that we are</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.560" end="00:31:51.650" style="s2">assuming that if you&#39;ve been exposed and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.390" end="00:31:54.470" style="s2">have recovered that you cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.650" end="00:31:57.770" style="s2">infected again at least right away that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.470" end="00:32:00.260" style="s2">then doing targeted quarantine would</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.770" end="00:32:03.170" style="s2">seem to be a very good intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.260" end="00:32:08.410" style="s2">stage that would not be putting so many</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.170" end="00:32:12.470" style="s2">people at risk of economic disaster I</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.410" end="00:32:15.920" style="s2">would add to this so the the reason it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.470" end="00:32:20.140" style="s2">not a simple question is because even if</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.920" end="00:32:22.490" style="s2">the people who are dying are older and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.140" end="00:32:24.290" style="s2">therefore you could potentially free</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.490" end="00:32:28.130" style="s2">younger people to go about their</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.290" end="00:32:30.350" style="s2">business those younger people may be</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.130" end="00:32:32.330" style="s2">circulating things that then reach those</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.350" end="00:32:35.090" style="s2">older people and so this is why I raised</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.330" end="00:32:38.480" style="s2">the question before about about</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.090" end="00:32:41.030" style="s2">effectively I think the the academic</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.480" end="00:32:43.240" style="s2">term is Sanel aside if you know we are</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.030" end="00:32:46.810" style="s2">effectively taking old people and</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.240" end="00:32:49.160" style="s2">leaving them to the wolves that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.810" end="00:32:52.340" style="s2">presumably not something we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.160" end="00:32:55.040" style="s2">and so keeping those people safe may</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.340" end="00:32:57.650" style="s2">involve a general quarantine but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.040" end="00:33:01.700" style="s2">other thing I unfortunately did not have</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.650" end="00:33:04.520" style="s2">time to fully digest it but I read the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.700" end="00:33:05.660" style="s2">beginnings of a very interesting article</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.520" end="00:33:07.910" style="s2">written by</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.660" end="00:33:09.890" style="s2">one of the founders of Instagram Kevin</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.910" end="00:33:12.560" style="s2">whose last name escapes me other people</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.890" end="00:33:17.590" style="s2">will know it but anyway he was arguing</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.560" end="00:33:20.530" style="s2">for a metric which was I believe R sub T</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.590" end="00:33:24.110" style="s2">which would allow you to compare</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.530" end="00:33:27.020" style="s2">different methods of quarantine for</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.110" end="00:33:30.740" style="s2">their effectiveness at reducing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.020" end="00:33:33.230" style="s2">spread of the disease and thereby in</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.740" end="00:33:35.000" style="s2">essence we could figure out how is it</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.230" end="00:33:37.220" style="s2">that we could liberate people who are</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.000" end="00:33:38.990" style="s2">less endangered by this and not put</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.220" end="00:33:42.560" style="s2">those who are in danger at greater risk</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.990" end="00:33:46.370" style="s2">etc so better metrics and as you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.560" end="00:33:47.780" style="s2">saying since moment one much higher</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.370" end="00:33:51.140" style="s2">rates of testing those are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.780" end="00:33:53.450" style="s2">necessary yeah and some of the changes</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.140" end="00:33:55.700" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen with regard to the quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.450" end="00:33:57.260" style="s2">could persist you know I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.700" end="00:34:00.380" style="s2">pretty widespread at this point at least</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.260" end="00:34:02.300" style="s2">in the US and I suspect at least some</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.380" end="00:34:03.920" style="s2">places elsewhere as well that grocery</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.300" end="00:34:07.160" style="s2">stores for instance are now starting out</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.920" end="00:34:08.419" style="s2">their day by having an hour for only</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.160" end="00:34:12.050" style="s2">elderly and other maybe</p>

<p begin="00:35:31.610" end="00:35:35.350" style="s2">because it&#39;s so much easier to cut</p>

<p begin="00:35:44.330" end="00:35:48.500" style="s2">of course who were exactly doing almost</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.100" end="00:35:51.560" style="s2">all the teaching so one effect that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.500" end="00:35:53.210" style="s2">may see here is that you have higher ed</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.560" end="00:35:56.540" style="s2">becoming more and more a bastion for</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.210" end="00:35:58.610" style="s2">research and and you know what has been</p>

<p begin="00:35:58.610" end="00:36:03.620" style="s2">universities for a very long time is</p>

<p begin="00:36:07.580" end="00:36:10.160" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t have time to actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.840" end="00:36:13.250" style="s2">think about teaching or to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.160" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">undergraduates so this this separation</p>

<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:21.950" style="s2">scholarship from education is is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.520" end="00:36:24.890" style="s2">problem and I think this will put that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.950" end="00:36:26.270" style="s2">an even starker relief but to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.890" end="00:36:27.890" style="s2">that the people who are being let go</p>

<p begin="00:36:27.890" end="00:36:32.390" style="s2">higher ed jobs were primarily in</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.050" end="00:37:06.740" style="s2">respect to teaching to compile them get</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.860" end="00:37:08.420" style="s2">them paid give them a a path forward in</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.740" end="00:37:12.380" style="s2">the in a career that that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.420" end="00:37:14.630" style="s2">and can feed a family and that can</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.380" end="00:37:17.720" style="s2">actually deliver something to students</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.630" end="00:37:20.810" style="s2">that is not only enriching to them but</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.720" end="00:37:23.090" style="s2">also is recognized by the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.810" end="00:37:24.710" style="s2">as valid you know part of this comes</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.090" end="00:37:27.050" style="s2">down to the fact that you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.710" end="00:37:29.090" style="s2">stranglehold on education that comes</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.050" end="00:37:31.130" style="s2">from the fact that only these</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.090" end="00:37:32.780" style="s2">institutions are licensed to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.130" end="00:37:34.460" style="s2">credential that&#39;s worth anything</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.780" end="00:37:36.350" style="s2">and so lots of people are going to these</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.460" end="00:37:38.090" style="s2">institutions not because they believe in</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.350" end="00:37:40.460" style="s2">them but because that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.090" end="00:37:44.000" style="s2">credential comes from that then is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.460" end="00:37:45.650" style="s2">gateway to a job and so somebody has to</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.000" end="00:37:47.990" style="s2">figure out how to break the stranglehold</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.650" end="00:37:50.780" style="s2">and you know this is one of the place</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.990" end="00:37:53.750" style="s2">places where those who are in love with</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.780" end="00:37:56.180" style="s2">the idea of economic competition are</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.750" end="00:37:57.980" style="s2">just absolutely right which is if if the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.180" end="00:38:00.470" style="s2">universities had to compete head-to-head</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.980" end="00:38:02.330" style="s2">with something on the outside that</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.470" end="00:38:04.940" style="s2">delivered higher quality educational</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.330" end="00:38:09.080" style="s2">goods that were equally valid in the</p>

<p begin="00:38:09.080" end="00:38:13.100" style="s2">would get better it is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.790" end="00:38:14.870" style="s2">they have an effective monopoly through</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.870" end="00:38:21.020" style="s2">has made them so feeble a bit off topic</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.500" end="00:39:53.040" style="s2">could the left/right political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.450" end="00:39:55.260" style="s2">have evolutionary origins dating as far</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.040" end="00:39:57.329" style="s2">back as the early mammals 65 million</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.260" end="00:39:58.829" style="s2">years ago I&#39;m wondering if the curiosity</p>

<p begin="00:40:16.250" end="00:40:19.829" style="s2">phylogenetic models that suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.359" end="00:40:22.380" style="s2">there have been mammals around for 200</p>

<p begin="00:40:22.380" end="00:40:26.130" style="s2">clear if all of the current clades</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.119" end="00:40:28.859" style="s2">including you know primates and cats and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.130" end="00:40:30.569" style="s2">rodents and bats were around 65 million</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.859" end="00:40:33.839" style="s2">years ago or if they were still just a</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.569" end="00:40:37.079" style="s2">bunch of basal scurrying mammals running</p>

<p begin="00:40:41.310" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">longer ago than that but do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.560" end="00:40:50.400" style="s2">take the political question yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:52.980" style="s2">I mean the political spectrum is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.400" end="00:40:54.690" style="s2">feature of a moment in time but there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.980" end="00:40:56.970" style="s2">something and we actually address this a</p>

<p begin="00:40:56.970" end="00:41:06.900" style="s2">writing and revising there is a basic</p>

<p begin="00:41:15.240" end="00:41:22.250" style="s2">frontiers so yes this will be a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.599" end="00:41:25.410" style="s2">ancient process but I don&#39;t even think</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.250" end="00:41:26.940" style="s2">it&#39;s early mammals we&#39;ve made the</p>

<p begin="00:41:35.130" end="00:41:41.369" style="s2">there is a a tension between modes and</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.910" end="00:41:43.349" style="s2">so anyway we&#39;ll talk more about that at</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.369" end="00:41:46.410" style="s2">some other point but yes there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.349" end="00:41:48.000" style="s2">something to the idea that those kinds</p>

<p begin="00:41:50.520" end="00:41:56.410" style="s2">roots that go far back into our distant</p>

<p begin="00:41:56.410" end="00:42:01.910" style="s2">which excuse me what should the</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.780" end="00:42:04.310" style="s2">productive conversations of geometric</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.910" end="00:42:06.590" style="s2">unity theory look like and what platform</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.310" end="00:42:09.130" style="s2">so they live on talking to the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.590" end="00:42:11.840" style="s2">brother yeah you got the wrong Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.130" end="00:42:14.420" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know how to answer</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.840" end="00:42:17.900" style="s2">that question I think the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.420" end="00:42:20.150" style="s2">are talking about geometric unity in</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.900" end="00:42:23.510" style="s2">public is very healthy and I look</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.150" end="00:42:25.700" style="s2">forward to seeing where it goes but Erik</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.510" end="00:42:27.560" style="s2">that&#39;s a question for you clearly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.700" end="00:42:29.480" style="s2">right your thoughts on a virtual</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.560" end="00:42:32.270" style="s2">Convention on freedom and rights in</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.480" end="00:42:34.100" style="s2">light of the crisis now your thoughts on</p>

<p begin="00:42:34.100" end="00:42:37.010" style="s2">in light of the crisis and would you be</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.660" end="00:42:40.430" style="s2">interested in participating in such a</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.010" end="00:42:42.380" style="s2">conversation yeah I don&#39;t know that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.430" end="00:42:44.330" style="s2">even need the current crisis and I will</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.380" end="00:42:50.120" style="s2">say that I think most of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.330" end="00:42:52.130" style="s2">were involved in conversations about how</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.120" end="00:42:55.220" style="s2">we might remake civilization</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.130" end="00:42:58.010" style="s2">productively were motivated by a fear of</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.220" end="00:43:01.910" style="s2">just how fragile our current</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.010" end="00:43:07.310" style="s2">civilization has become and so 5-10</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.910" end="00:43:09.650" style="s2">years ago right now yeah so for some of</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.310" end="00:43:12.440" style="s2">us you know I don&#39;t know anybody who saw</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.650" end="00:43:15.230" style="s2">the particulars of this crisis emerging</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.440" end="00:43:18.140" style="s2">as they did but wow there were a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.230" end="00:43:19.820" style="s2">us who were awfully nervous that people</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.140" end="00:43:22.210" style="s2">seem to have gotten complacent about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.820" end="00:43:26.540" style="s2">hazards we face and the hazards were</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.210" end="00:43:27.680" style="s2">looming ever-larger Salutations super</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.540" end="00:43:28.820" style="s2">people thank you</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.680" end="00:43:30.800" style="s2">there&#39;s been chatter on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.820" end="00:43:32.750" style="s2">philanthropic front philanthropic front</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.800" end="00:43:34.310" style="s2">lately about the possibility of kovat</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.310" end="00:43:39.320" style="s2">campaigns gate seems enthusiastic but</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.740" end="00:43:41.420" style="s2">I&#39;m a little worried thoughts what could</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.320" end="00:43:43.760" style="s2">possibly go wrong what could possibly go</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.420" end="00:43:45.800" style="s2">everyone could possibly go wrong yes</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:51.020" style="s2">said you know South Korea&#39;s track and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.800" end="00:43:53.180" style="s2">trace requires which has been by nearly</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.020" end="00:43:57.860" style="s2">everyone&#39;s measures one of the most</p>

<p begin="00:44:01.150" end="00:44:09.140" style="s2">targeted surveillance so I guess I at</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.540" end="00:44:09.920" style="s2">the risk of destroying what we&#39;ve built</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.140" end="00:44:14.720" style="s2">up here</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.920" end="00:44:16.040" style="s2">yeah I would say look this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.720" end="00:44:17.510" style="s2">the wrong time to be having this</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.040" end="00:44:19.190" style="s2">discussion and I understand that we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.510" end="00:44:22.280" style="s2">to have it because we&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.190" end="00:44:25.060" style="s2">situation but a lot of us have been</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.280" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">shouting about the hazard of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.060" end="00:44:30.980" style="s2">government that appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:33.590" style="s2">functioning towards objectives that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.980" end="00:44:36.620" style="s2">not public spirited and the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.590" end="00:44:38.750" style="s2">remaking it such that it is accountable</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.620" end="00:44:41.240" style="s2">right that is not a new topic for many</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.750" end="00:44:43.340" style="s2">of us and so yes we are now in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.240" end="00:44:45.680" style="s2">situation where we both have to do some</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.340" end="00:44:47.060" style="s2">sort of track and trace thing and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.680" end="00:44:49.250" style="s2">one entity that&#39;s really in a position</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.060" end="00:44:51.770" style="s2">to do it couldn&#39;t possibly be trusted</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.250" end="00:44:53.360" style="s2">and even if you say well it could be</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.770" end="00:44:55.460" style="s2">done privately you&#39;re gonna do it</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.360" end="00:44:56.750" style="s2">through your phone is it going to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.460" end="00:44:58.610" style="s2">Google I don&#39;t trust any of these</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.750" end="00:45:00.170" style="s2">entities to engage in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.610" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">behavior so we&#39;re now damned if we do</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.170" end="00:45:03.770" style="s2">and damned if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.040" end="00:45:05.630" style="s2">what we should do is recognize never</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.770" end="00:45:08.390" style="s2">again we don&#39;t want to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.630" end="00:45:11.300" style="s2">situation we need the ability to deploy</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.390" end="00:45:13.640" style="s2">some sort of track and trace in order to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.300" end="00:45:15.710" style="s2">deal with the next epidemic without it</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.640" end="00:45:18.320" style="s2">inviting this kind of authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.710" end="00:45:22.460" style="s2">overreach nonsense we&#39;ve seen so much of</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.320" end="00:45:24.470" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s fix this and if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.460" end="00:45:25.100" style="s2">fix it for this round let&#39;s fix it for</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.470" end="00:45:29.420" style="s2">the next one</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.100" end="00:45:31.490" style="s2">good a study shows SARS two attacks a</p>

<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:40.310" style="s2">Zak you want to highlight that one</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.980" end="00:45:44.120" style="s2">because it&#39;s got a link in it I would</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.310" end="00:45:46.430" style="s2">say a I haven&#39;t seen I feel like someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.120" end="00:45:48.320" style="s2">pointed this out to us before and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.430" end="00:45:51.500" style="s2">pursue it yeah so just haven&#39;t seen the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.320" end="00:45:53.360" style="s2">research a we need to know it&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.500" end="00:45:56.420" style="s2">reduction if that&#39;s true what it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.360" end="00:45:57.110" style="s2">huge reduction we need to know what it</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.420" end="00:45:58.940" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.110" end="00:46:01.100" style="s2">is does this mean everybody who&#39;s had an</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.940" end="00:46:02.420" style="s2">asymptomatic case I strongly doubt it</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.100" end="00:46:04.760" style="s2">what it&#39;s going to mean is people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.420" end="00:46:07.670" style="s2">had a severe case and is the result</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.760" end="00:46:10.730" style="s2">robust I have my doubts about that too</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.670" end="00:46:13.490" style="s2">but we could find out that it is is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.730" end="00:46:15.950" style="s2">result robust but you know nobody&#39;s had</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.490" end="00:46:17.930" style="s2">this disease for very long so does it</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.950" end="00:46:19.460" style="s2">clear up some sort of a year in which</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.930" end="00:46:21.290" style="s2">case that&#39;s not worry about it if it</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.460" end="00:46:22.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t clear up you know over the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.290" end="00:46:24.610" style="s2">course of time</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.370" end="00:46:26.330" style="s2">and it raises questions obviously</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.610" end="00:46:29.180" style="s2">testosterone is something you could</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.330" end="00:46:32.300" style="s2">supplement if you needed to so anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.180" end="00:46:33.860" style="s2">don&#39;t see it as the primary concern and</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.300" end="00:46:37.210" style="s2">I&#39;d like to know a lot more about it</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.860" end="00:46:40.520" style="s2">before saying anything definitive but</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.210" end="00:46:42.320" style="s2">you know that number 50 reduces</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.520" end="00:46:44.810" style="s2">testosterone by 50% and recovered</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.320" end="00:46:48.020" style="s2">patients strikes me as a red flag it</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.810" end="00:46:50.420" style="s2">just seems so high yeah but but we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.020" end="00:46:52.370" style="s2">take a look ya&#39;ll have an email to send</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.420" end="00:46:54.530" style="s2">papers of interest to we both have</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.370" end="00:46:56.210" style="s2">websites that have emails on them I</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.530" end="00:46:59.600" style="s2">think it&#39;s support at Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.210" end="00:47:03.710" style="s2">net yep and hello farmer Burt what mine</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.600" end="00:47:06.070" style="s2">is okay that heather hang calm maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.710" end="00:47:08.660" style="s2">not sure I&#39;m sure about yours yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.070" end="00:47:10.670" style="s2">thoughts on link between positive blood</p>

<p begin="00:47:15.470" end="00:47:19.370" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about rhesus factor then</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.370" end="00:47:26.540" style="s2">from covered 19 interesting we had seen</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.660" end="00:47:28.940" style="s2">the a B O blood type paper and talked</p>

<p begin="00:47:33.890" end="00:47:39.710" style="s2">particular yeah thoughts here so I would</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.820" end="00:47:42.440" style="s2">say this raises some questions for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.710" end="00:47:45.590" style="s2">which may well be known to other people</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.440" end="00:47:48.290" style="s2">but there&#39;s some question about why so</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.590" end="00:47:50.000" style="s2">in mammals red blood cells do not have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.290" end="00:47:52.550" style="s2">nucleus the story that we tell about</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.000" end="00:47:54.410" style="s2">that is that the nucleus is removed so</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.550" end="00:47:56.840" style="s2">that there&#39;s more room for hemoglobin to</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.410" end="00:47:58.700" style="s2">carry oxygen this raises all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.840" end="00:48:00.440" style="s2">questions about why the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.700" end="00:48:02.600" style="s2">invading red blood cells to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.440" end="00:48:05.720" style="s2">because absent nucleus is it able to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.600" end="00:48:07.400" style="s2">anything my guess would be no but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.720" end="00:48:09.260" style="s2">can&#39;t rule it out I should have looked</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.400" end="00:48:11.300" style="s2">it up but I can&#39;t rule it out without</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.260" end="00:48:13.340" style="s2">looking it up because it&#39;s possible that</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.300" end="00:48:14.720" style="s2">when the nucleus is removed ribosomes</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.340" end="00:48:16.370" style="s2">are left behind in which case this</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.720" end="00:48:17.810" style="s2">particular virus could continue to</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.370" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">operate in a red blood cell in which</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.810" end="00:48:22.070" style="s2">case this would be straightforward if</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:23.570" style="s2">that was not the case which I assume it</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.070" end="00:48:25.040" style="s2">is not the case I don&#39;t think there</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.570" end="00:48:27.620" style="s2">arrived as ohm&#39;s left behind in the red</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.040" end="00:48:29.630" style="s2">blood cell but I don&#39;t know if there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.620" end="00:48:31.340" style="s2">no red if there are no ribosomes left</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.630" end="00:48:34.150" style="s2">behind in the red blood cells then</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.340" end="00:48:36.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about why these</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.150" end="00:48:37.580" style="s2">antigens on the surface of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.110" end="00:48:39.530" style="s2">the red blood cells are playing a</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.580" end="00:48:41.060" style="s2">primary role are those antigens also</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.530" end="00:48:43.580" style="s2">being some seen somewhere else in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.060" end="00:48:46.520" style="s2">physiology and so the red blood cells</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.580" end="00:48:49.070" style="s2">are a red herring in this case or is</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.520" end="00:48:50.420" style="s2">there some meaning you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.070" end="00:48:51.620" style="s2">reason that the corona virus looks the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.420" end="00:48:54.200" style="s2">way it does is that it has these</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.620" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">receptors on its surface which interact</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.200" end="00:49:01.580" style="s2">with the proteins on the surface of</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:03.620" style="s2">cells and so you know getting into a</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.580" end="00:49:06.050" style="s2">cell is very frequently and in this case</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.620" end="00:49:08.030" style="s2">it is a matter of joining proteins on</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.050" end="00:49:12.200" style="s2">the surface of the cell and using them</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.030" end="00:49:14.150" style="s2">to I think bind the membrane so it has a</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.200" end="00:49:15.740" style="s2">cell like membrane and the lipid</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.150" end="00:49:19.550" style="s2">membrane you&#39;ve heard of in Philips</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.740" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">contents into the the cytoplasm of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.550" end="00:49:23.210" style="s2">cell so there&#39;s a question about whether</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:25.400" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in red blood cells if</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.210" end="00:49:26.840" style="s2">so why does the virus want in if it</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.400" end="00:49:29.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have ribosomes with which to</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.840" end="00:49:30.860" style="s2">make more virus and I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.540" end="00:49:36.710" style="s2">answers to those questions but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.860" end="00:49:39.890" style="s2">the road I would go down okay yeah so we</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.710" end="00:49:41.720" style="s2">are going to stop taking super chair</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.890" end="00:49:43.970" style="s2">questions I Q just want to draw a line</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.720" end="00:49:45.380" style="s2">on the spreadsheet if you can so that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.970" end="00:49:50.120" style="s2">know where to stop because we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.380" end="00:49:51.740" style="s2">lot more to get through here and so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.120" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">know can&#39;t see what the next question is</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.740" end="00:49:59.290" style="s2">though let&#39;s say if I can find it on</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:01.610" style="s2">mine</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.290" end="00:50:03.850" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you be interested in forming an</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.610" end="00:50:06.080" style="s2">alliance of professors in exile ape</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.850" end="00:50:07.820" style="s2">academic stakeholders like us will have</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.080" end="00:50:11.750" style="s2">more power to influence the Academy as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.820" end="00:50:13.790" style="s2">group maybe yeah we&#39;re always open to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.750" end="00:50:17.380" style="s2">these ideas but we want to see something</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.790" end="00:50:21.140" style="s2">that has the potential to do the job</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.380" end="00:50:22.700" style="s2">that&#39;s really crucial yep hi professors</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.140" end="00:50:24.290" style="s2">thank you for these streams Brett last</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.700" end="00:50:27.410" style="s2">week you said you were doubting the wet</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.290" end="00:50:29.720" style="s2">hmm doubting the wet market origin story</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.410" end="00:50:32.800" style="s2">in favor the virology lab can you</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.720" end="00:50:35.540" style="s2">discuss your reasons in more depth</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.800" end="00:50:39.080" style="s2">before you answer though you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.540" end="00:50:42.050" style="s2">for a biology lab accidental release</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.080" end="00:50:45.830" style="s2">rather than I was just gonna say that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.050" end="00:50:48.140" style="s2">saw an appalling question I think out of</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.830" end="00:50:49.210" style="s2">the Pew Research Center then merited by</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.140" end="00:50:52.290" style="s2">CNN worse</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.210" end="00:50:55.599" style="s2">30% of Americans believe the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.290" end="00:50:57.400" style="s2">architected in a lab and I looked at</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.599" end="00:50:59.920" style="s2">this and I just thought you know if I</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.400" end="00:51:01.900" style="s2">had been asked this question the answer</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.920" end="00:51:04.540" style="s2">that I would give was not available</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.900" end="00:51:07.000" style="s2">because I don&#39;t believe that this virus</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.540" end="00:51:08.520" style="s2">was engineered we don&#39;t have evidence</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.000" end="00:51:11.770" style="s2">that I believe points in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.520" end="00:51:13.960" style="s2">but there is reason to think that it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.770" end="00:51:16.089" style="s2">being investigated in a lab and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.960" end="00:51:17.530" style="s2">that may have been how it was released</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.089" end="00:51:20.920" style="s2">so I think you spelled it out there the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.530" end="00:51:24.430" style="s2">question the the question that you saw</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.920" end="00:51:25.990" style="s2">was a or B do you think this virus came</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.430" end="00:51:28.420" style="s2">out of a lab or not do you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.990" end="00:51:30.339" style="s2">natural or it was engineered in a lab</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.420" end="00:51:32.890" style="s2">just not a complete solution set right</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.339" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">so what I you know and I am open to all</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.890" end="00:51:36.309" style="s2">kinds of evidence for any other</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:39.280" style="s2">hypothesis but from what I&#39;ve seen so</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.309" end="00:51:41.490" style="s2">far I would say I think it&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.280" end="00:51:44.619" style="s2">virus I think it was in the lab</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.490" end="00:51:46.210" style="s2">potentially for legitimate reasons could</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.619" end="00:51:48.490" style="s2">have been illegitimate reasons but that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.210" end="00:51:51.220" style="s2">what happened is a mistake in the lab</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.490" end="00:51:53.470" style="s2">caused someone to be infected and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.220" end="00:51:55.839" style="s2">know that&#39;s a natural virus that has</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.470" end="00:51:57.490" style="s2">escaped through a lab it&#39;s not a or B</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.839" end="00:51:59.500" style="s2">and why specifically are you doubting</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.490" end="00:52:01.540" style="s2">the wet market Georgian I&#39;m doubting the</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.500" end="00:52:04.390" style="s2">wet market origin because I have yet to</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.540" end="00:52:07.510" style="s2">see the evidence for a clear pattern</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.390" end="00:52:09.250" style="s2">that the wet market was involved and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.510" end="00:52:10.990" style="s2">know they weren&#39;t selling bats the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.250" end="00:52:12.849" style="s2">closest colony of horseshoe bats is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.990" end="00:52:14.349" style="s2">long ways away you know there was</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.849" end="00:52:16.690" style="s2">something else you were we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.349" end="00:52:18.460" style="s2">about Lots so again I don&#39;t want it I</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.690" end="00:52:20.619" style="s2">don&#39;t want responsibility for this story</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.460" end="00:52:22.329" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve never been to Wuhan I</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.619" end="00:52:23.799" style="s2">don&#39;t know anything about their wet</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.329" end="00:52:25.450" style="s2">market how it functions under normal</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.799" end="00:52:28.030" style="s2">circumstances I don&#39;t know whether you</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.450" end="00:52:30.460" style="s2">can order bat soup in a restaurant in</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.030" end="00:52:32.980" style="s2">Wuhan but what I have seen suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.460" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">this is not common practice in that part</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.980" end="00:52:37.270" style="s2">of the world the bats in question what</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:39.359" style="s2">is an eating bat soup isn&#39;t common</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.270" end="00:52:43.119" style="s2">practice isn&#39;t common practice there</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.359" end="00:52:45.369" style="s2">there isn&#39;t from what I understand bats</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.119" end="00:52:46.660" style="s2">were not found for sale in the Wuhan</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.369" end="00:52:51.059" style="s2">market at the point that this was</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.660" end="00:52:53.410" style="s2">suspected the clade of bats which are</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.059" end="00:52:56.650" style="s2">understood to be the source of the virus</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.410" end="00:52:58.869" style="s2">the quote the closest colony is at least</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.650" end="00:52:59.620" style="s2">100 miles away farther it&#39;s farther away</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.869" end="00:53:01.300" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.620" end="00:53:02.680" style="s2">that could be wrong maybe there&#39;s a cave</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.300" end="00:53:04.720" style="s2">I don&#39;t know about but the evidence I</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.680" end="00:53:07.720" style="s2">saw suggested that and on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.720" end="00:53:09.670" style="s2">I have seen what credibly appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.720" end="00:53:11.800" style="s2">a job advertisement to study back</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.670" end="00:53:15.040" style="s2">coronaviruses at a lab that just happens</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.800" end="00:53:18.370" style="s2">to be in Wuhan and so you know where am</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.040" end="00:53:20.260" style="s2">i I&#39;m not committed to any hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.370" end="00:53:22.300" style="s2">yet but I would say the one hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.260" end="00:53:23.950" style="s2">continues to look weaker the more I see</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.300" end="00:53:26.920" style="s2">and the other hypothesis looks stronger</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.950" end="00:53:29.140" style="s2">what doesn&#39;t look strong to me at all is</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.920" end="00:53:32.380" style="s2">the idea that this is an engineered</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.140" end="00:53:35.770" style="s2">virus totally engineered it all</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.380" end="00:53:37.330" style="s2">engineered yeah or nor do we see do I</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.770" end="00:53:38.860" style="s2">think of either of us seen any</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.330" end="00:53:40.960" style="s2">compelling evidence that this was</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.860" end="00:53:42.970" style="s2">intentional release as a weapon it</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.960" end="00:53:44.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense to me that you would</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.970" end="00:53:46.660" style="s2">release it close to the virality lab</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.740" end="00:53:49.780" style="s2">because it raises too many questions so</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.660" end="00:53:53.110" style="s2">yeah you know everything I know so far</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.780" end="00:53:55.420" style="s2">suggests accidental release that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.110" end="00:53:58.090" style="s2">to say that there weren&#39;t lab safety</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.420" end="00:53:59.260" style="s2">issues right perhaps you know more so in</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.090" end="00:54:01.240" style="s2">that lab than there should have been</p>

<p begin="00:54:01.240" end="00:54:06.040" style="s2">and all but this this is always a risk</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:09.210" style="s2">when you are doing this kind of research</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.040" end="00:54:11.320" style="s2">in any lab which are which exists</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.210" end="00:54:13.840" style="s2">probably in every major city on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.320" end="00:54:16.480" style="s2">planet that way so I&#39;m still very anti</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.840" end="00:54:19.510" style="s2">wet market I mean we effectively know</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.480" end="00:54:21.430" style="s2">that HIV came from human contact with a</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.510" end="00:54:23.410" style="s2">hunted chimpanzees is that not enough of</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.430" end="00:54:25.960" style="s2">a cost for us to end the hunting of wild</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.410" end="00:54:27.520" style="s2">animals for the sale and what markets I</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.960" end="00:54:31.570" style="s2">think it&#39;s sufficient in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.520" end="00:54:33.580" style="s2">right how much of a role do you think</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.570" end="00:54:35.230" style="s2">climate change has to play in increasing</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.580" end="00:54:39.430" style="s2">the likelihood of more zoonotic diseases</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.230" end="00:54:42.100" style="s2">jumping from wild animals to humans I</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.430" end="00:54:44.110" style="s2">hate to say it but I think probably in</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.100" end="00:54:49.420" style="s2">the end it reduces the likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.110" end="00:54:50.590" style="s2">because it reduces diversity I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.420" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just going to reduce the number of</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.590" end="00:54:54.040" style="s2">creatures we&#39;re interacting with so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:57.520" style="s2">think in the end it obviously climate</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.040" end="00:54:59.890" style="s2">change will reduce diversity but it may</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.520" end="00:55:02.620" style="s2">put species in contact with one another</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.890" end="00:55:04.660" style="s2">sooner than they would have or you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.620" end="00:55:07.000" style="s2">at all than they would have in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.660" end="00:55:09.370" style="s2">shorter term such that you end up with a</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.000" end="00:55:11.820" style="s2">shorter term spike in</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.370" end="00:55:14.620" style="s2">zoo notic jumping between host species</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.820" end="00:55:16.150" style="s2">with a longer term declined because</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.620" end="00:55:18.880" style="s2">there&#39;s just not as many species to jump</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.150" end="00:55:20.980" style="s2">from yeah and it will also create</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.880" end="00:55:23.020" style="s2">desperate people who will eat bush meat</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.980" end="00:55:25.900" style="s2">who wouldn&#39;t otherwise be driven to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.020" end="00:55:29.230" style="s2">but I would say you know as somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.900" end="00:55:31.090" style="s2">has handled wild mammals regularly in</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.230" end="00:55:34.600" style="s2">graduate school you know I studied bats</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.090" end="00:55:37.440" style="s2">i netted them I took data and glued</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.600" end="00:55:40.180" style="s2">transmitters to him and let him go I</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.440" end="00:55:43.210" style="s2">don&#39;t know good scientific reason you</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.180" end="00:55:44.710" style="s2">handled mouse lemurs yeah I had a good</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.210" end="00:55:50.560" style="s2">scientific reason it&#39;s just a little</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.710" end="00:55:53.530" style="s2">hard to defend but in any case basic</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.560" end="00:55:56.920" style="s2">precautions in general have prevented</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.530" end="00:55:59.230" style="s2">this kind of transmission as far as we</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.920" end="00:56:01.750" style="s2">know there&#39;s always the risk that</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.230" end="00:56:03.370" style="s2">something is going to jump I think we</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.750" end="00:56:05.560" style="s2">need to think about how to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.370" end="00:56:07.180" style="s2">people who do what I did in graduate</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.560" end="00:56:09.820" style="s2">school studying these animals you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.180" end="00:56:11.800" style="s2">how do we make sure that you know not</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.820" end="00:56:16.060" style="s2">releasing something into into the human</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.800" end="00:56:20.590" style="s2">population is a high on their list of</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.060" end="00:56:22.630" style="s2">concerns but by and large if something</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.590" end="00:56:25.510" style="s2">had a really easy time jumping to humans</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.630" end="00:56:27.670" style="s2">it&#39;s already happened and to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.510" end="00:56:29.560" style="s2">that things don&#39;t jump so easily to</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.670" end="00:56:31.960" style="s2">humans then the point is we need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.560" end="00:56:33.850" style="s2">prevent intimate contact of the sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.960" end="00:56:37.530" style="s2">that butchering and cutting your finger</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.850" end="00:56:37.530" style="s2">or whatever it is that would cause that</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.830" end="00:56:45.580" style="s2">sets in motion so anyway I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.980" end="00:56:47.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a straightforward anthropogenic</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.580" end="00:56:48.990" style="s2">climate change increases or decreases</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.620" end="00:56:52.030" style="s2">I think it&#39;s going to be a bit of both</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.990" end="00:56:55.180" style="s2">hello again do you think erythropoietin</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.030" end="00:56:57.160" style="s2">EPO would help with hypoxia and treating</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.180" end="00:56:59.860" style="s2">Koba 19 with the malaria drugs such as</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.160" end="00:57:01.810" style="s2">Hydra hydroxychloroquine thanks for all</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.860" end="00:57:05.170" style="s2">the insightful ideas to digest while in</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.810" end="00:57:09.010" style="s2">isolation I don&#39;t know enough enough</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.170" end="00:57:10.720" style="s2">about EPO to address this I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.010" end="00:57:12.370" style="s2">all I can say is what I said on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.720" end="00:57:14.800" style="s2">beginning of the livestream which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.370" end="00:57:17.130" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen two papers this week that</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.800" end="00:57:19.000" style="s2">cast doubt on the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.130" end="00:57:20.470" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine being a useful</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.000" end="00:57:22.010" style="s2">treatment at least for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.470" end="00:57:24.710" style="s2">already very sick</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.010" end="00:57:25.900" style="s2">that I believe was true in both both</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.710" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">papers mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.900" end="00:57:33.770" style="s2">amazing work folks keep it up thank you</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:35.630" style="s2">do you think the fact where are we there</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.770" end="00:57:37.520" style="s2">we go not moving it for a second the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.630" end="00:57:39.140" style="s2">problem do you think the fact that China</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.520" end="00:57:41.150" style="s2">has controlled this virus of relative</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.140" end="00:57:43.040" style="s2">ease points the possibility that this</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.150" end="00:57:45.050" style="s2">was a bioweapon intentionally released</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.040" end="00:57:47.470" style="s2">the Chinese government has certainly</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.050" end="00:57:50.660" style="s2">sacrificed more citizens before thanks I</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.470" end="00:57:52.130" style="s2">don&#39;t think that we can believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.660" end="00:57:53.720" style="s2">China has controlled this virus with</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.130" end="00:57:55.820" style="s2">relative ease I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.720" end="00:57:59.210" style="s2">reason to assume that the data coming</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.820" end="00:58:00.560" style="s2">out of China are real or accurate that</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.210" end="00:58:04.070" style="s2">said it&#39;s true that the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.560" end="00:58:06.980" style="s2">government has demonstrated willingness</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.070" end="00:58:09.680" style="s2">to sacrifice citizens in ways that would</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.980" end="00:58:12.650" style="s2">be anathema to people of other nation</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.680" end="00:58:14.570" style="s2">states but I just I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.650" end="00:58:18.010" style="s2">there&#39;s any reason to trust the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.570" end="00:58:19.640" style="s2">coming out of China at this point agreed</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.010" end="00:58:21.170" style="s2">thank you for the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.640" end="00:58:22.190" style="s2">informative and engaging broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.170" end="00:58:24.500" style="s2">you&#39;re welcome</p>

<p begin="00:58:24.500" end="00:58:32.780" style="s2">your wallet keys etc well even though</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.710" end="00:58:35.060" style="s2">we&#39;re in lockdown I still put on pants</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.780" end="00:58:41.900" style="s2">every day reasons I can&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.060" end="00:58:44.210" style="s2">articulate thing yeah I every day carry</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.900" end="00:58:46.520" style="s2">I mean well mine&#39;s actually less like</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.210" end="00:58:48.530" style="s2">when I I mean if you&#39;re staying at home</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.520" end="00:58:51.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t put on wallet and keys and</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.530" end="00:58:54.860" style="s2">such but when I do have to go out I now</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.760" end="00:58:59.150" style="s2">we&#39;re stripped down to a driver&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.860" end="00:59:01.970" style="s2">license and a card and a insurance card</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.150" end="00:59:03.440" style="s2">and a single key and my phone so that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.970" end="00:59:05.720" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be playing with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.440" end="00:59:07.400" style="s2">objects I know know what I was supposed</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.720" end="00:59:07.880" style="s2">to answer to this question okay can we</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.400" end="00:59:09.980" style="s2">start again</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.880" end="00:59:13.400" style="s2">what&#39;s your ET cie every day carry your</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.980" end="00:59:16.340" style="s2">wallet keys etc when I go out among the</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.400" end="00:59:19.580" style="s2">things that I do is I take my phone out</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.340" end="00:59:21.290" style="s2">of the case that I have it in at home if</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.580" end="00:59:23.090" style="s2">I drop my phone the case protects it</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.290" end="00:59:25.880" style="s2">from breaking if I go out I take it out</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.090" end="00:59:29.210" style="s2">of the case so that I can wash it when I</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.880" end="00:59:30.590" style="s2">get home or sanitize it while I&#39;m out if</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.210" end="00:59:32.750" style="s2">I think it&#39;s been compromised because I</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.590" end="00:59:35.610" style="s2">do find myself interacting with it but</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.750" end="00:59:37.380" style="s2">it&#39;s an obvious source of contagion if</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.610" end="00:59:39.810" style="s2">you know I touched an object at a store</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.380" end="00:59:42.330" style="s2">I touched my phone I want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.810" end="00:59:43.980" style="s2">clean it and so this puts the phone at</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.330" end="00:59:46.050" style="s2">risk but I think it&#39;s worth it yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.980" end="00:59:47.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve got sanitizer in the car and in</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.050" end="00:59:49.320" style="s2">the truck so that we have we have a way</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.880" end="00:59:51.060" style="s2">to clean stuff when we get back into the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.320" end="00:59:53.310" style="s2">vehicle yes and modern phones can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.060" end="00:59:54.690" style="s2">washed under a faucet yeah but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.310" end="00:59:57.510" style="s2">with regard to the credit cards keys</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.690" end="00:59:59.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah totally we now know an</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.510" end="01:00:00.600" style="s2">economic shutdown and curfews are not</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.130" end="01:00:02.880" style="s2">proportional to the actual danger of</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.600" end="01:00:06.420" style="s2">this virus whose head should roll first</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:08.190" style="s2">wow I don&#39;t think we know any such thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.420" end="01:00:10.860" style="s2">and the problem is to the extent that</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.190" end="01:00:13.710" style="s2">we&#39;ve been effective at addressing this</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.860" end="01:00:15.030" style="s2">with lockdowns we don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.710" end="01:00:17.820" style="s2">world would have looked like otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.030" end="01:00:21.450" style="s2">but if you missed our discussion of what</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.820" end="01:00:24.960" style="s2">happened in Guayaquil Ecuador I suggest</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.450" end="01:00:27.000" style="s2">you look into it because this can get</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.960" end="01:00:30.990" style="s2">pretty frightening pretty quick and you</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.000" end="01:00:34.350" style="s2">know even with lockdown we&#39;ve got mass</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.990" end="01:00:36.870" style="s2">graves being dug in potter&#39;s field in</p>

<p begin="01:02:16.329" end="01:02:20.319" style="s2">researchers in that case at least have</p>

<p begin="01:03:07.599" end="01:03:10.869" style="s2">with libertarians because I think they</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.130" end="01:03:12.400" style="s2">have something dead wrong but I have</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.869" end="01:03:15.249" style="s2">also come to understand they have</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.400" end="01:03:19.269" style="s2">something dead right and it would be</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.249" end="01:03:21.069" style="s2">very valuable if we could tease those</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.269" end="01:03:23.140" style="s2">two apart so we could recover the part</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.069" end="01:03:25.420" style="s2">of libertarianism that makes sense which</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.140" end="01:03:29.950" style="s2">is to say Liberty is a special virtue</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.420" end="01:03:32.380" style="s2">and one can reasonably seek to maximize</p>

<p begin="01:03:43.029" end="01:03:49.210" style="s2">needless failures and so let&#39;s please</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.779" end="01:03:51.099" style="s2">level up and tease these two things</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.210" end="01:03:53.890" style="s2">apart so that we can stop making the</p>

<p begin="01:04:28.750" end="01:04:35.019" style="s2">legislative level and we have to be very</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.160" end="01:04:38.140" style="s2">concerned and I have to say this is one</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.019" end="01:04:40.960" style="s2">of many reasons that I&#39;m very unhappy</p>

<p begin="01:04:43.869" end="01:04:50.500" style="s2">understand it Joe Biden was actually the</p>

<p begin="01:04:52.599" end="01:04:57.759" style="s2">of 9/11 so anyway yes we have a problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.869" end="01:04:59.890" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that the crisis</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.759" end="01:05:01.809" style="s2">was orchestrated in order to advance</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.890" end="01:05:04.900" style="s2">these things much more likely that this</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.809" end="01:05:05.200" style="s2">is just opportunistic overreach there it</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.900" end="01:05:08.470" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.200" end="01:05:10.089" style="s2">opportunistic overreach Masai tribal</p>

<p begin="01:05:22.539" end="01:05:29.230" style="s2">so are they&#39;re solitary ants and if not</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.369" end="01:05:31.450" style="s2">why not there are well yeah yes and no</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.230" end="01:05:34.180" style="s2">there there there are ants like the ball</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.450" end="01:05:36.609" style="s2">ant that forged solitarily but they go</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.180" end="01:05:38.789" style="s2">back to homes with lots of big scary</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.609" end="01:05:41.170" style="s2">homes lots of scary pollen in fact</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.789" end="01:05:49.450" style="s2">permit me oh you don&#39;t have bullet ants</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.170" end="01:05:51.279" style="s2">in the studio okay lucite ice cube in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.450" end="01:05:52.930" style="s2">lucite ice cube that I made back when I</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.279" end="01:05:54.519" style="s2">was a graduate student experimenting</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.930" end="01:05:57.829" style="s2">with lucite</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.519" end="01:05:59.779" style="s2">so anyway this is an ant you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.829" end="01:06:02.239" style="s2">really see it it has wings</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.779" end="01:06:04.940" style="s2">it&#39;s a reproductive ant and it is of a</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.239" end="01:06:07.759" style="s2">species that we have encountered yep</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.940" end="01:06:12.710" style="s2">this is para poner so this is a giant</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.759" end="01:06:15.589" style="s2">verifying forages solitarily but they do</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.710" end="01:06:17.150" style="s2">live in colonies so it&#39;s not truly</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.589" end="01:06:21.829" style="s2">solitary I think the answer to your</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.150" end="01:06:23.809" style="s2">question is I don&#39;t I think maybe there</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.829" end="01:06:27.079" style="s2">aren&#39;t any then that are entirely</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.809" end="01:06:29.059" style="s2">solitary yeah is that right I think that</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.079" end="01:06:30.470" style="s2">is I think that&#39;s right but we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.059" end="01:06:34.970" style="s2">find out because yeah somebody will</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.470" end="01:06:38.329" style="s2">correct us yeah and if not why not like</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.970" end="01:06:39.980" style="s2">what what makes it&#39;s different I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.329" end="01:06:43.339" style="s2">trying to remember with regard to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.980" end="01:06:44.299" style="s2">phylogeny of the Hymenoptera are ants</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.339" end="01:06:45.589" style="s2">basil</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.299" end="01:06:47.569" style="s2">I mean bees and wasps certainly our</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.589" end="01:06:48.920" style="s2">sister but I I just I don&#39;t remember I</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.569" end="01:06:50.150" style="s2">don&#39;t remember how it falls out and</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.920" end="01:06:51.589" style="s2">where the saw flies are because I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.150" end="01:06:54.950" style="s2">they&#39;re hymenopteran but they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.589" end="01:06:56.420" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re the most basal I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.950" end="01:06:57.079" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know how it falls out yeah</p>

<p begin="01:06:57.079" end="01:07:01.730" style="s2">I seem to recall wasps were basil but</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.329" end="01:07:03.890" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s wrong that feels I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:08:35.650" end="01:08:40.660" style="s2">is the phone and the social media</p>

<p begin="01:08:53.170" end="01:08:57.300" style="s2">the skull on the desk is a yeah now</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.680" end="01:09:02.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve done it</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.300" end="01:09:07.750" style="s2">okay that is a seal skull that I</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.170" end="01:09:09.550" style="s2">acquired from a seal who was no longer</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.750" end="01:09:11.710" style="s2">using it he was no longer using it</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.550" end="01:09:13.390" style="s2">especially as I disassociated it from</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.710" end="01:09:14.890" style="s2">him and that made it impossible to use</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.390" end="01:09:17.440" style="s2">it but he had actually died of</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.890" end="01:09:20.950" style="s2">presumably natural causes and washed up</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.440" end="01:09:23.830" style="s2">on a beach in Oregon where I violated</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.950" end="01:09:27.130" style="s2">the law by removing his head with a</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.830" end="01:09:30.520" style="s2">knife that was way too short for the job</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.130" end="01:09:33.100" style="s2">I did this in the head light of a pickup</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.520" end="01:09:35.980" style="s2">truck driven by a student friend of mine</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.100" end="01:09:37.960" style="s2">who had found the animal and it caused</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.980" end="01:09:40.480" style="s2">quite a kerfuffle on the field trip that</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.960" end="01:09:42.790" style="s2">I was on where many people had a moral</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.480" end="01:09:44.320" style="s2">objection to my having recovered the</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.790" end="01:09:46.120" style="s2">head of this animal for the purpose of</p>

<p begin="01:09:46.120" end="01:09:49.690" style="s2">least some people had a legal objection</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.430" end="01:09:53.400" style="s2">understanding that you would in fact</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.690" end="01:09:55.750" style="s2">broken the law yeah I mean I guess but I</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.400" end="01:09:57.700" style="s2">the discussion was an interesting one</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.750" end="01:09:59.440" style="s2">because lots of people found what I did</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.700" end="01:10:00.520" style="s2">distasteful even though they had a hard</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.440" end="01:10:02.920" style="s2">time putting their finger on exactly</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.520" end="01:10:04.330" style="s2">what the problem was now it turns out</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.920" end="01:10:06.550" style="s2">that what I had engaged in was actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.330" end="01:10:08.950" style="s2">kind of dangerous behavior because there</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.550" end="01:10:12.040" style="s2">are a lot of things you can get from a</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.950" end="01:10:16.780" style="s2">sea mammal like this one and diseases</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.040" end="01:10:19.239" style="s2">yeah oh yeah bad ones so anyway I got</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.780" end="01:10:22.989" style="s2">lucky I got this fancy</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.239" end="01:10:25.690" style="s2">skull here it has served me well I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.989" end="01:10:29.170" style="s2">demonstrated to many classes how these</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.690" end="01:10:31.119" style="s2">the skull of a seal looks just like the</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.170" end="01:10:32.590" style="s2">skull of a bear except for the teeth and</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.119" end="01:10:34.929" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason for that which is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.590" end="01:10:36.909" style="s2">as far as we understand it seals are</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.929" end="01:10:39.460" style="s2">actually bears and if that sounds like a</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.909" end="01:10:40.809" style="s2">preposterous statement then allow me to</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.460" end="01:10:42.369" style="s2">defend it to you at some point because</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.809" end="01:10:45.329" style="s2">it&#39;s literally true somewhere around</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.369" end="01:10:48.429" style="s2">here we have a bear skull from Alaska</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.329" end="01:10:50.590" style="s2">next time yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.429" end="01:10:53.050" style="s2">please explain your objection to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.590" end="01:10:58.329" style="s2">lesser of two evils calculation how is</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.050" end="01:11:00.340" style="s2">Biden not preferable to Trump Wow yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.329" end="01:11:02.170" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to go deeper into this</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.340" end="01:11:06.030" style="s2">later but let me just say this my</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.170" end="01:11:09.760" style="s2">objection to the lesser evil paradigm is</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.030" end="01:11:11.889" style="s2">twofold one it doesn&#39;t hold up if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.760" end="01:11:14.739" style="s2">think about elections as an iterated</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.889" end="01:11:16.989" style="s2">phenomenon in other words it requires us</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.739" end="01:11:18.820" style="s2">to think about elections individually</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.989" end="01:11:21.249" style="s2">and then say well okay they may both</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.820" end="01:11:23.769" style="s2">suck but this one sucks less obviously</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.249" end="01:11:26.139" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna vote for them right on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.769" end="01:11:28.960" style="s2">other hand if the point is actually no</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.139" end="01:11:30.969" style="s2">my objective is that humans are still on</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.960" end="01:11:34.539" style="s2">this planet five hundred years from now</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.969" end="01:11:37.389" style="s2">and I think both of these guys leave the</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.539" end="01:11:39.369" style="s2">basic problem intact and therefore I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.389" end="01:11:41.320" style="s2">looking for whatever solution gets us</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.369" end="01:11:42.309" style="s2">through that bottleneck it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.320" end="01:11:46.360" style="s2">different question</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.309" end="01:11:47.289" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the primary</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.360" end="01:11:49.869" style="s2">objection</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.289" end="01:11:53.619" style="s2">the secondary objection is that things</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.869" end="01:11:57.519" style="s2">like the Democratic National Committee</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.619" end="01:11:59.829" style="s2">have used the lesser evil paradigm in</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.519" end="01:12:02.050" style="s2">order to keep us trapped and not cater</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.829" end="01:12:03.550" style="s2">to the interests of the public so having</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.050" end="01:12:06.639" style="s2">abandoned the interests of working</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.550" end="01:12:09.130" style="s2">people decades ago the way they keep us</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.639" end="01:12:11.769" style="s2">from fleeing the party in favor of some</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.130" end="01:12:13.719" style="s2">alternative has to do with the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.769" end="01:12:15.400" style="s2">all they have to do is deliver something</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.719" end="01:12:17.619" style="s2">that at the particular cocktail parties</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.400" end="01:12:19.630" style="s2">we go to is treated as a lesser evil and</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.619" end="01:12:21.340" style="s2">we will be hamstrung and we will just</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.630" end="01:12:24.309" style="s2">simply roll our eyes and vote for their</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.340" end="01:12:26.679" style="s2">person one more time and at some point</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.309" end="01:12:29.199" style="s2">when somebody uses that mechanism to</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.679" end="01:12:32.380" style="s2">control you you have to not do what</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.199" end="01:12:32.940" style="s2">they&#39;re expecting so lots more to say</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.380" end="01:12:35.640" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.940" end="01:12:38.040" style="s2">another time which organisms follow us</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.640" end="01:12:40.290" style="s2">and a conscious a scale I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.040" end="01:12:43.260" style="s2">what follow us oh you mean hell they</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.290" end="01:12:47.820" style="s2">want who is next most conscious this is</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.260" end="01:12:52.890" style="s2">a easy way I think it&#39;s dogs that is</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.820" end="01:12:55.590" style="s2">domestic dogs and not incidentally it is</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.890" end="01:12:57.870" style="s2">a result of their coevolution with us so</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.590" end="01:13:00.360" style="s2">that&#39;s I realize a paradoxical maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.870" end="01:13:02.310" style="s2">should leave it leave that answer there</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.360" end="01:13:07.050" style="s2">for further expression number another</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.310" end="01:13:11.130" style="s2">time but also say those organisms that</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.050" end="01:13:13.440" style="s2">are long-lived social with generational</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.130" end="01:13:16.680" style="s2">overlap and have long childhoods tend to</p>

<p begin="01:14:52.350" end="01:14:57.130" style="s2">is it crazy to be fearful of the idea of</p>

<p begin="01:14:57.130" end="01:15:00.970" style="s2">suggests it&#39;s crazy but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.600" end="01:15:04.300" style="s2">reasonable to be fearful of the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.970" end="01:15:06.910" style="s2">forced vaccination this is this is hard</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.300" end="01:15:09.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not crazy to be fearful yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.910" end="01:15:12.310" style="s2">is there a circumstance in which it</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.760" end="01:15:14.890" style="s2">would be necessary to force vaccination</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.310" end="01:15:17.380" style="s2">and you would have to overcome your</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.890" end="01:15:19.480" style="s2">fears I think there are rational places</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.380" end="01:15:21.580" style="s2">where that could well emerge but figure</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.480" end="01:15:24.160" style="s2">out where that line is is really really</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.580" end="01:15:26.740" style="s2">hard yes and I think we&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.160" end="01:15:31.480" style="s2">terrible job our safety system is so</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.740" end="01:15:33.940" style="s2">broken that we you know to force people</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.480" end="01:15:37.990" style="s2">to vaccinate would be reasonable if the</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.940" end="01:15:42.820" style="s2">vaccines were so safe that for the</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.990" end="01:15:45.850" style="s2">benefit to the herd of producing the</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.820" end="01:15:49.540" style="s2">immunity it was necessary to require it</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.850" end="01:15:51.460" style="s2">but that puts the burden on the system</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.540" end="01:15:55.710" style="s2">to make the things very very very safe</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.460" end="01:15:59.860" style="s2">and the problem is the economic model</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.710" end="01:16:01.870" style="s2">doesn&#39;t support it so anyway as I have</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.860" end="01:16:04.950" style="s2">said elsewhere we have vaccinated our</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.870" end="01:16:08.470" style="s2">children we are strong believers in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.950" end="01:16:11.350" style="s2">importance of vaccines but we are well</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.470" end="01:16:13.930" style="s2">I&#39;ll speak for me I am livid that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.350" end="01:16:17.110" style="s2">have been as cavalier about drug safety</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.930" end="01:16:20.160" style="s2">and medical procedure safety as we have</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.110" end="01:16:23.470" style="s2">been and if you want me to become an</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.160" end="01:16:26.140" style="s2">enthusiastic advocate for things like</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.470" end="01:16:30.850" style="s2">mandatory vaccination then you gotta</p>

<p begin="01:16:30.850" end="01:16:35.770" style="s2">about viral examp demand COBIT 19 I had</p>

<p begin="01:16:47.890" end="01:16:56.200" style="s2">know chickenpox is fascinating internet&#39;</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.700" end="01:16:59.239" style="s2">is a virus that goes latent inside of</p>

<p begin="01:16:59.239" end="01:17:02.630" style="s2">there are many possibilities possible</p>

<p begin="01:17:02.630" end="01:17:07.460" style="s2">enough from the one that you had had</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.980" end="01:17:10.550" style="s2">before and so were capable of being</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.460" end="01:17:13.039" style="s2">infected also you know possible it was</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.550" end="01:17:13.699" style="s2">going who knows yep okay three more</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.039" end="01:17:16.510" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.699" end="01:17:19.159" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna go bottom to top here okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.510" end="01:17:21.559" style="s2">would you like to discuss decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.159" end="01:17:25.940" style="s2">legislators on your show the null</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.559" end="01:17:27.739" style="s2">hypothesis of politics.com decentralize</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.940" end="01:17:31.340" style="s2">legislators you know I&#39;ve encountered</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.739" end="01:17:34.360" style="s2">other potential solutions to what that</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.340" end="01:17:37.599" style="s2">must be a response to but I</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.360" end="01:17:40.519" style="s2">decentralized legislature is not</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.599" end="01:17:41.869" style="s2">I can&#39;t even quite tell what it would be</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.519" end="01:17:43.940" style="s2">I mean in some sense we have a</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.869" end="01:17:47.150" style="s2">decentralized legislature by virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.940" end="01:17:49.639" style="s2">the fact that it is sourcing people from</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.150" end="01:17:53.869" style="s2">all over the country and compiling them</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.639" end="01:17:56.719" style="s2">and so it&#39;s given us a a link to learn</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.869" end="01:17:58.519" style="s2">more maybe from my research most</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.719" end="01:18:00.199" style="s2">vaccines are manufactured using animal</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.519" end="01:18:02.749" style="s2">tissues and may therefore introduce</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.199" end="01:18:05.420" style="s2">animal based virus to humans if vaccine</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.749" end="01:18:06.110" style="s2">science controls and quality are as safe</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.420" end="01:18:08.360" style="s2">as possible</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.110" end="01:18:15.409" style="s2">why should manufacturers receive</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.360" end="01:18:21.579" style="s2">immunity well this is a can of worms to</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.409" end="01:18:21.579" style="s2">be sure immunity from being sued yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.599" end="01:18:27.889" style="s2">here&#39;s the reason I think we have to</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.909" end="01:18:31.010" style="s2">steal man it before we attack it the</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.889" end="01:18:35.059" style="s2">reason is because if we need vaccines</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.010" end="01:18:36.409" style="s2">produced then we cannot leave those that</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.059" end="01:18:38.800" style="s2">we are asking to produce them in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.409" end="01:18:41.539" style="s2">frightening position of being sued over</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.800" end="01:18:44.510" style="s2">things they could not reasonably have</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.539" end="01:18:46.760" style="s2">foreseen and the very fact that we say</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.510" end="01:18:49.010" style="s2">well you&#39;re making it with animal tissue</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.760" end="01:18:49.550" style="s2">therefore something could jump that&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.010" end="01:18:51.699" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.550" end="01:18:54.440" style="s2">you might drive everybody out of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.699" end="01:18:56.480" style="s2">race to produce these things so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.440" end="01:19:00.019" style="s2">an argument for it but what I would say</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.480" end="01:19:02.119" style="s2">is it isn&#39;t clear to me at all and I</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.019" end="01:19:05.150" style="s2">rather suspect otherwise that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.119" end="01:19:06.829" style="s2">production of these things for profit is</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.150" end="01:19:08.719" style="s2">a bad idea</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.829" end="01:19:12.640" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a question about whether</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.719" end="01:19:15.280" style="s2">or not you want to generate a public</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.640" end="01:19:18.100" style="s2">effort to create the vaccines that would</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.280" end="01:19:20.080" style="s2">not have the same fears or incentives</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.100" end="01:19:22.030" style="s2">and then could render them as safe as</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.080" end="01:19:24.730" style="s2">possible which is really I think the</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.030" end="01:19:27.250" style="s2">ideal solution which is where all the</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.730" end="01:19:29.430" style="s2">libertarians who follow us will now be</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.250" end="01:19:32.410" style="s2">apoplectic because I&#39;ve advocated</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.430" end="01:19:34.020" style="s2">government doing something that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.410" end="01:19:36.460" style="s2">want government and aptitude</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.020" end="01:19:38.500" style="s2">compromising but the point is what we</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.460" end="01:19:40.020" style="s2">need is higher quality government and I</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.500" end="01:19:42.280" style="s2">do believe that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.020" end="01:19:47.520" style="s2">final question can you talk more about</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.280" end="01:19:51.580" style="s2">rent-seeking sure rent-seeking</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.520" end="01:19:54.250" style="s2">effectively is the utilization of a</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.580" end="01:19:57.490" style="s2">bottleneck to recover profits that are</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.250" end="01:20:03.090" style="s2">the result of non-productive behavior in</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.490" end="01:20:06.160" style="s2">the market and my contention is that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.090" end="01:20:08.350" style="s2">tend to imagine based on what we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.160" end="01:20:11.320" style="s2">been taught from classical economics</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.350" end="01:20:13.780" style="s2">that rent-seeking exists but that it is</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.320" end="01:20:15.940" style="s2">a small perturbation on a system that by</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.780" end="01:20:19.090" style="s2">and large functions as the textbook says</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.940" end="01:20:21.640" style="s2">and the more I think about it and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.090" end="01:20:23.680" style="s2">more I read the more I discover that</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.640" end="01:20:27.370" style="s2">rent-seeking may in fact be an ever</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.680" end="01:20:31.450" style="s2">larger fraction of the economy and that</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.370" end="01:20:33.670" style="s2">it would become so as a result of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.450" end="01:20:36.070" style="s2">what we would call the adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.670" end="01:20:37.840" style="s2">landscape of opportunities that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.070" end="01:20:40.660" style="s2">market provides in other words this is</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.840" end="01:20:42.340" style="s2">not the result of evil people you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.660" end="01:20:43.870" style="s2">it&#39;s not that you&#39;re born a rent seeker</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.340" end="01:20:45.730" style="s2">but everybody is looking for</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.870" end="01:20:47.650" style="s2">opportunities to profit in the market</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.730" end="01:20:49.420" style="s2">and the question is do they have good</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.650" end="01:20:51.340" style="s2">opportunities that don&#39;t involve rent</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.420" end="01:20:53.020" style="s2">seeking and if they didn&#39;t have good</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.340" end="01:20:54.250" style="s2">opportunities but they did have rent</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.020" end="01:20:56.170" style="s2">seeking opportunities wouldn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.250" end="01:20:57.850" style="s2">expect them to discover that and anybody</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.170" end="01:20:59.620" style="s2">who opted not to would be leaving the</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.850" end="01:21:02.260" style="s2">door open to anybody who would so we</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.620" end="01:21:03.700" style="s2">would expect to see the growth of rent</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.260" end="01:21:06.460" style="s2">seeking operations anywhere and</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.700" end="01:21:08.440" style="s2">everywhere it&#39;s possible so in any case</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.460" end="01:21:11.230" style="s2">rent seeking is a huge problem</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.440" end="01:21:14.650" style="s2">it is a doubly huge problem when you</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.230" end="01:21:17.440" style="s2">have governmental corruption built into</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.650" end="01:21:19.270" style="s2">your structures as we do because those</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.440" end="01:21:22.360" style="s2">who make their profit through</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.270" end="01:21:24.310" style="s2">rent-seeking and that will it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.360" end="01:21:25.949" style="s2">these people are inherently round</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.310" end="01:21:27.889" style="s2">seekers it may be that you</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.949" end="01:21:30.479" style="s2">people who have been very productive and</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.889" end="01:21:32.130" style="s2">20% of their fortune is the result of</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.479" end="01:21:33.360" style="s2">productivity and 80 percent of their</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.130" end="01:21:34.920" style="s2">fortune as the result of rent seeking</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.360" end="01:21:39.360" style="s2">and they probably don&#39;t even know the</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.920" end="01:21:42.659" style="s2">difference so the problem is when rent</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.360" end="01:21:44.550" style="s2">seeking produces profits and profits</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.659" end="01:21:46.889" style="s2">produces political power through some</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.550" end="01:21:50.940" style="s2">sort of corruption very often legal but</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.889" end="01:21:53.579" style="s2">immoral then what you get is a system</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.940" end="01:21:55.440" style="s2">that becomes built around protecting the</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.579" end="01:22:00.979" style="s2">interests of rent seekers and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.440" end="01:22:00.979" style="s2">where we find ourselves so let&#39;s fix it</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.199" end="01:22:08.340" style="s2">ok we have one more question then all</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.909" end="01:22:10.199" style="s2">right for Bret are we experiencing some</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.340" end="01:22:11.880" style="s2">sort of social collapse in the West it</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.199" end="01:22:14.070" style="s2">may be a bias on my part but we seem to</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.880" end="01:22:16.769" style="s2">be moving inexorably towards some climax</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.070" end="01:22:20.280" style="s2">socially geopolitically and economically</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.769" end="01:22:22.679" style="s2">I would say we are experiencing a gentle</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.280" end="01:22:24.420" style="s2">apocalypse which are calling it the</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.679" end="01:22:29.610" style="s2">rolling a pocket the rolling apocalypse</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.420" end="01:22:33.690" style="s2">all right it&#39;s a mild apocalypse yes we</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.610" end="01:22:35.760" style="s2">are you know if you read our upcoming</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.690" end="01:22:38.429" style="s2">book you will find us discussing the</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.760" end="01:22:41.880" style="s2">meaning of close calls what this is is</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.429" end="01:22:43.469" style="s2">actually an almost ideal close call for</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.880" end="01:22:45.989" style="s2">us to understand almost everything</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.469" end="01:22:48.420" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong with our system so that</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.989" end="01:22:52.769" style="s2">when this happens again next time we</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.420" end="01:22:57.059" style="s2">can&#39;t say this caught us off guard so my</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.769" end="01:22:59.959" style="s2">hope here is that this is mild enough</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.059" end="01:23:04.800" style="s2">that we get through it without a major</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.959" end="01:23:07.670" style="s2">depression without massive quantities of</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.800" end="01:23:11.099" style="s2">deaths all of those things but I</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.670" end="01:23:13.769" style="s2">certainly hope that it leaves an</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.099" end="01:23:17.400" style="s2">indelible mark and that it puts an end</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.769" end="01:23:21.659" style="s2">to certain childish nonsensical notions</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.400" end="01:23:23.340" style="s2">about how things have never been better</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.659" end="01:23:24.929" style="s2">because yeah things have never been</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.340" end="01:23:26.639" style="s2">better at one level and they&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.929" end="01:23:29.760" style="s2">been more dangerous at the very same</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.639" end="01:23:32.789" style="s2">time so here we are great place to end</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.760" end="01:23:35.189" style="s2">all right yeah well it&#39;s been great we</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.789" end="01:23:36.570" style="s2">will see you next time which if</p>
