<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of sincerity</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:20.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a belief in rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:22.240" style="s2">science and meritocracy and in the</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">and this seems to be the dominant modus</p>

<p begin="00:05:25.919" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">industry and this is where we get the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">motivational speakers the leadership</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">speakers the consultants the hero</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">consultants that appear</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">as though they have the single point of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">truth and you know here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:39.199" style="s2">the neat linear five-step plan on how</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:41.280" style="s2">you need to do things and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.199" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">and then sometimes the post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:43.919" style="s2">thought leader</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:46.080" style="s2">public intellectual comes in and points</p>

<p begin="00:05:46.080" end="00:05:49.120" style="s2">um the flaws in that kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">and brings a lot of skepticism to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.120" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">grand narratives that we espouse</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:55.440" style="s2">the trouble is though whilst this</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">critique is apt</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.440" end="00:05:58.720" style="s2">and needed and necessary it often</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:00.319" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.720" end="00:06:02.160" style="s2">lead to anything constructive it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.319" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">ever more deconstruction</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">and then the meta modern thought leader</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:07.520" style="s2">potentially appears</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">to do some sort of synthesis and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.520" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">reconstruction i say that but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:13.759" style="s2">necessarily believe it</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:15.840" style="s2">this is also nascent and emergent and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.759" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">for me my own path through this i kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.840" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">of i did a phd in motivation science i</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.479" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">then became a motivational speaker and</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">very all sincere and then i</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">started to become very jaded and very</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">pomo and then throughout all this i</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">realized ah actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:33.039" style="s2">if we become deft in the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">cultivate a mythos</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.039" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">and a mythos is like a set of stories</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.039" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">that are told about ourselves that then</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">allow us to cloak ourselves trojan horse</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">style to smuggle in good</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:44.960" style="s2">philosophical sensibilities into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:47.039" style="s2">heart of enterprise land there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:49.440" style="s2">good change that we can make</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.039" end="00:06:50.400" style="s2">and so that&#39;s kind of how i&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.440" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">to play things</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.400" end="00:06:53.759" style="s2">now as this uh thought little thing and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:56.160" style="s2">i think that there&#39;s a potential for a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.759" end="00:06:58.080" style="s2">lot of folks here too</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.160" end="00:06:59.759" style="s2">rather than simply and i&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.080" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">yancey strickler&#39;s dark forest theory of</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">the internet rather than</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">simply abandon all the mainstream um</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:07.599" style="s2">open web sources which then leaves a</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:10.720" style="s2">whole heap of people still</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.599" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">um subject to the predatory mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.720" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">of uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.280" end="00:07:15.680" style="s2">late capitalism we deny that arena our</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">and as much as as much as it fills me</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">with a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">mild loathing i i do like to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">to think that we can kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:28.160" style="s2">here we are in the cozy webs and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">in the stower</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.160" end="00:07:32.400" style="s2">and we we&#39;re able to cultivate uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">philosophical sensibilities druidic</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.400" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">sensibilities a kind of savviness</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">a deafness stoic principles and then yet</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">still we need to be able to navigate our</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">way back into the heart of enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:44.960" style="s2">land so that we might be able to plant</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:48.560" style="s2">some seeds and cause some mischief there</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">and um i guess i guess uh i&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:51.759" style="s2">wrapped myself around</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:53.199" style="s2">in in circles here in my own uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.759" end="00:07:55.759" style="s2">definition around</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.199" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">all of this and i&#39;m i&#39;m hoping that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.759" end="00:08:00.960" style="s2">causing enough provocations here to uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">get folks oh [ __ ] my um light has just</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.960" end="00:08:04.080" style="s2">fallen out again</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">hopefully i&#39;m um causing enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:06.879" style="s2">provocations here for some questions to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:12.960" style="s2">emerge</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.879" end="00:08:16.479" style="s2">um the risks in this industry are that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.960" end="00:08:18.240" style="s2">we can fall in love with our own myth</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.479" end="00:08:20.000" style="s2">and we can we can lose the ironic</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.240" end="00:08:22.160" style="s2">detachment the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">ironic sincerity that allows us stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.160" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">work and if we cling too tightly to a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:27.440" style="s2">single point of truth and then we</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">start to espouse that and we start to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.440" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">gain followers and all those things then</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:33.200" style="s2">then a lot of the themes that uh peter</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.680" end="00:08:35.279" style="s2">has written about in these letters</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.200" end="00:08:37.760" style="s2">that just comes to life there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.279" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">kind of booth and juxtaposition a dance</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.760" end="00:08:41.039" style="s2">that we must do if we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">effective in this arena and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.039" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">this translates to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">intentionally sabotaging our efforts</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">sometimes it translates to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:52.080" style="s2">resisting the um the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:54.160" style="s2">the call to optimization there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.080" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">plenty of focus i know i can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.160" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with peter</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">happens in my world but there&#39;s plenty</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">of folks that earnestly</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">suggest that there&#39;s ways that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:02.800" style="s2">things to optimize you know with your</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">newsletter lists you can create all</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">sorts of fancy schemes and campaigns to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">kind of drive real rep more revenue</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:11.120" style="s2">but if we kind of come back to okay what</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">is the role of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.120" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">a meta-modern thought leader and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">i&#39;m hesitant to label it as such because</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">it&#39;s all quite emergent and uh and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">nebulous and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">i would suggest that one of the roles</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">that we can do is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">bring complexity thinking into mix to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">act as complexity practitioners and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">philosopher poets</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">to awaken people to the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">there are multiple ways of seeing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">perhaps potentially</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">the result of our role is that we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">arrive at a richer synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">together or at least a protosynthesis</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:45.760" style="s2">that is continually updated and renewed</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:47.279" style="s2">i&#39;m um this is one of the things before</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.760" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">we got into this peter i was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.279" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">cool i&#39;m just going to riff</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.399" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">and talk and stuff and then i have this</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">classic zoom thing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">unless i&#39;m kind of sharing content</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">i kind of yearn for this agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.760" end="00:10:02.399" style="s2">kind of dance and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.760" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">in a moment i&#39;m going to be turning and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.399" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">asking you to consider some questions</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">and starting to get them in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:09.839" style="s2">q and a thread i&#39;ll give you some</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:13.440" style="s2">priming for the questions</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">um my intent this is this is an industry</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.440" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">and a modus</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:19.040" style="s2">uh that is fraught with peril</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">psychological existential peril and yet</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.040" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">there is the potential for us to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:26.079" style="s2">some good effect</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">um some of for example one of the i did</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.079" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">did some work for ceo of a financial</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">advisory group</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">and accounting firm wonderful wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:34.800" style="s2">person i did that there it seemed like a</p>

<p begin="00:10:34.800" end="00:10:37.839" style="s2">typical job but then that led to deeper</p>

<p begin="00:10:37.839" end="00:10:40.959" style="s2">that led to him reading the listening</p>

<p begin="00:10:40.959" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">and uh he&#39;s now my accountant financial</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:02.000" style="s2">i guess sometimes the risk is that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">get so caught up in that complexity in</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">our philosophy that we</p>

<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">and part of the challenge of being a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.480" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">modern thought leader is this weird</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">hybridization of signaling</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:18.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to kind of appear on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">radar in the modernist landscape in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.160" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">enterprise land</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got to have the language that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">allows you to sneak past the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.279" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">gatekeepers in an enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">and yet also at the same time you need</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">to be subtly signaling the irony that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:32.320" style="s2">says hey i know that you know that this</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:33.519" style="s2">is kind of [ __ ] but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.320" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">maybe we can smuggle in some good</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.519" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">sensibilities at the same time and this</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:39.680" style="s2">is a funny dance that i</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">haphazardly seem to have done okay with</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.680" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">over time and maybe there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:46.079" style="s2">sensibilities to share that</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:48.079" style="s2">and so in your questions i&#39;m i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.079" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m open to any questions but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.079" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">hopeful for the 45 minutes that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">have remaining here</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:55.760" style="s2">that there may be some of you thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">hmm maybe i can</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.760" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">you know with this rich synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">uh this protosynthesis through the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">various readings and experience and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:05.360" style="s2">expertise that you&#39;ve accrued</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a way that you can channel</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.360" end="00:12:10.480" style="s2">and show up in enterprise land or or</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:12.160" style="s2">play the role as a thought leader with</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.480" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">irony and sincerity in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">efficacious so as to</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">cultivate more of the sensibilities that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">will bring us closer to our world more</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.519" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">curious and kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:21.760" style="s2">i&#39;m hoping that maybe there&#39;s some folks</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">there that could do with some</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.760" end="00:12:24.240" style="s2">insight there i just certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:25.519" style="s2">have the answers i don&#39;t know how to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.240" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">a middleman thought leader i&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.519" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">enough as i go</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">um half the time i disagree with myself</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.839" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">maybe in amongst the mess we you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">some insight can emerge</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:40.399" style="s2">so with that super haphazard um</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">you know scattergun approach pete um</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.399" end="00:12:44.240" style="s2">how did i go okay i think i was all over</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">the place there</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:47.680" style="s2">i had this big imposter syndrome thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:48.160" style="s2">going on because of all those superstars</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">you have on</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">in the store right that appear and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:52.720" style="s2">like these galaxy mines as you call them</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.279" style="s2">that just</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.720" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">espouse these beautiful constellations</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.279" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">of wisdom and stuff and you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">um i&#39;ve mostly been impostering through</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:04.000" style="s2">my whole life and</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">so here i am yet again i haven&#39;t i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.000" end="00:13:07.040" style="s2">gotten away with it so far let&#39;s see how</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">the next 45 minutes goes</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.040" end="00:13:09.440" style="s2">well you&#39;re in good company my friend</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">because i feel that every time i invite</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.440" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">a speaker and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:15.120" style="s2">as well um yeah like uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">so i have a few threads i want to take</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">you down but again if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.600" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">i see some already in the chat just</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">throw them in the chat and then i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">call you to meet yourself</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:25.680" style="s2">so i think i told you that i have one</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">foot in the kind of the thought leader</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.680" end="00:13:27.760" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">corporate land with being a dale</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.760" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">carnegie trainer i&#39;m not active in it</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">um but when i was doing it and i was</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">kind of in this sandbox</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">it&#39;s like like i had to code switch you</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:41.040" style="s2">know like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">um and so i guess i just i&#39;ll just a</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.040" end="00:13:43.839" style="s2">general question how do you not lose</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:45.519" style="s2">yourself in the code switching</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.839" end="00:13:46.959" style="s2">and how do you maintain authenticity you</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.519" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">have any heuristics to know</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.959" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">when he said the irony when to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">just like speak like normie language</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:54.320" style="s2">it&#39;s beautiful it&#39;s uh yeah it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:57.680" style="s2">the question this is the tension</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.320" end="00:14:00.320" style="s2">and um one of the terms</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.680" end="00:14:01.760" style="s2">one of the notions i got quite clear</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.320" end="00:14:03.040" style="s2">this is like the most dangerous thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.760" end="00:14:04.959" style="s2">i&#39;m about to say here so take it with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">massive pinch yourself when i first</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.959" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">read this despite all the warnings uh it</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:11.839" style="s2">was like crack for me</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">um for about a a month um</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.839" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">we need to be mindful of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">blindness and so what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:18.800" style="s2">whenever we show up and work in an</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:20.240" style="s2">audience</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.800" end="00:14:21.680" style="s2">or work with a particular culture or a</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.240" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">group of people there&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.680" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">mix of folks at different developmental</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">stages now i don&#39;t i don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">adhere to any particular model i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:30.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">every individual model is kind of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.800" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">fraught to anchor to any of that but</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:35.440" style="s2">just generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">we&#39;re at apache levels of development</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.440" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">ourselves include and we all have much</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">more to learn</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.079" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">so often it&#39;s a kind of a calibration</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">a situational orientation towards</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">relevance realization as</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.160" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">john vavaky might say there&#39;s this kind</p>

<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:54.399" style="s2">um probes signals that you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:57.519" style="s2">respond to to get us get a read of where</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.399" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">folks are generally speaking though</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.519" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">my approach is kind of fox-like</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:03.760" style="s2">in the sense that i don&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">strong opinions</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">um i have weak opinions that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">strongly held as venkatesh rao of ribbon</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">farm might describe it a hedgehog kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">that goes in</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">uh and there are a lot of hedgehog</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">thought leaders out there that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">have a strong opinion and they have</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">products that are built around that and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:19.760" style="s2">they have things off the shelf and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.760" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">stuff um kind of anchored to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">particular program and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">and then they kind of come in and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the lens in which they see things</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">and i think that blinds them to</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">in terms of a heuristic i&#39;d be looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:41.199" style="s2">for the the kind of the fractal truths</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.440" end="00:15:42.639" style="s2">the kind of things that make sense at</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.199" end="00:15:46.000" style="s2">different levels of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.639" end="00:15:48.480" style="s2">um and that often translates to simple</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.000" end="00:15:49.120" style="s2">heuristics like at the at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.480" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.120" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">if we can get people to think and relate</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">with each other a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.880" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">complexly</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">if we can encourage folks to be a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">bit more curious and kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:03.279" style="s2">and if we can soften the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.800" end="00:16:05.440" style="s2">metric obsession and the linear rigidity</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.279" end="00:16:08.320" style="s2">that seems to be so</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.440" end="00:16:10.399" style="s2">um prevalent in in most modern</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.320" end="00:16:12.000" style="s2">institutions and open people up to new</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.399" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">ways of thinking considering and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.000" end="00:16:15.360" style="s2">then we&#39;re probably doing some good work</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:16.880" style="s2">so at the heart of it that&#39;s that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.360" end="00:16:18.560" style="s2">of that&#39;s the sensibility that i</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.880" end="00:16:20.240" style="s2">keep returning to i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.560" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">helpful at all um</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">but but it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.240" end="00:16:28.240" style="s2">and then one thing i noticed too doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.079" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">um the piggyback off that</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.240" end="00:16:34.240" style="s2">when when i was doing kind of the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">training and kind of like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.240" end="00:16:37.440" style="s2">speaking stuff i noticed i didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">to do much you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.440" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">i relied on sort of the my talent stack</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:42.000" style="s2">of being a good public speaker my acting</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:43.360" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.000" end="00:16:45.680" style="s2">and i was saying like kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">like cliche stuff stuff that you know i</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.680" end="00:16:50.480" style="s2">could stand behind</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">you know argue that i believe in uh but</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.480" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">they were cliche and then it was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">wow my god this is amazing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:59.680" style="s2">and uh yeah and you know i i didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">um so there&#39;s a point of like</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.680" end="00:17:02.480" style="s2">disappointment maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">boredom that i was experiencing in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.480" end="00:17:06.079" style="s2">and i didn&#39;t have enough yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">opportunity to do the trojan horse</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.079" end="00:17:09.679" style="s2">strategy yeah i wonder if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">wrestle with that yeah yeah so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.679" end="00:17:12.079" style="s2">this thing sometimes where you just you</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.079" end="00:17:15.360" style="s2">your meta narrator is just sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">watching yourself thinking oh there you</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">go you</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">silly monkey going through that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">pantomime performance again and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:22.959" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s like what i&#39;ve learned as</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">a writer</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.959" end="00:17:27.199" style="s2">um um from a meta modern lens because</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:28.960" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of bringing multiple cells to</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:31.760" style="s2">this because this kind of nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">cluster of different aspects of selfness</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.760" end="00:17:35.440" style="s2">and so when i&#39;m writing i enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">marginalia so i can have like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.440" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">mainstream thread and then the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">marginality is where i can kind of bring</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:41.280" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:42.720" style="s2">the year sands or yeah butts or the both</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.280" end="00:17:45.360" style="s2">ends and just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:46.000" style="s2">enrich and flourish it and i guess from</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.360" end="00:17:48.400" style="s2">a speaking</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">modus uh which is a lot you know we</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.400" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">don&#39;t really quite have in zoom</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">there&#39;s different parts on the stage</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">there&#39;s all the gesticulation there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">there&#39;s extreme ways to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:17:59.039" style="s2">irony even though you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:17:59.679" style="s2">something quite cliche and sincere and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:01.360" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.679" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">and these little hat tips most of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.360" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">wash over the audience and the dry humor</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really land but sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">pings that little cluster of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:11.600" style="s2">of folks that stay around at the end and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">then there&#39;s this kind of exchange of</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.600" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">ideas and senses and stuff and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:16.320" style="s2">there&#39;s been this like</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">little little extra blossoming of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.320" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">awakening and that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">things that you look for</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">but um but yeah it comes back to this um</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">i mean my frequent thing is that i tell</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2">i&#39;ll rock</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:28.720" style="s2">up and i&#39;ll share things and it&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:31.760" style="s2">over the head of too many people</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.720" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">um so yeah that&#39;s it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:34.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a tricky thing i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.960" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">quite know and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.799" end="00:18:38.640" style="s2">i never want to dumb things down but</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:40.640" style="s2">sometimes you need to kind of find the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.640" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">more common fractal that people can</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.640" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">resonate and relate to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">and um any themes</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">in the i guess the the corporate world</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">alive right now like you know you mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">the thought leader or like just</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">leadership like</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.320" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">any ones that maybe have that</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">existential opening to use andrew</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">tager&#39;s word that you can kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:03.280" style="s2">double click on and then yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">nice um</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.280" end="00:19:07.679" style="s2">okay so yeah there&#39;s always fads and</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">themes going through i mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.679" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">it was um disruption agile</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">transformation um</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:17.200" style="s2">all the common things now there&#39;s a book</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">that really</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.200" end="00:19:22.000" style="s2">changed my it accelerated my loathing</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">for the industry it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.000" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">a book called winners take all i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">remember who wrote it&#39;s the partner of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">the author of um the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2">art of gathering uh which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">also a very beautiful book but</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.840" end="00:19:37.039" style="s2">this notion of winners take all you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">probably mentioned that peter is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.039" end="00:19:40.400" style="s2">kind of like there is a theater of</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:42.559" style="s2">innovation that so often happens in</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.400" end="00:19:43.440" style="s2">enterprise land this kind of pan to mime</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.559" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.440" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">you know we say all the right things and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:47.679" style="s2">there&#39;s little hackathons and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:48.480" style="s2">experiments and stuff like that nothing</p>

<p begin="00:19:48.480" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">changes um and that&#39;s something i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.280" end="00:19:55.120" style="s2">kind of very hesitant to get swept up in</p>

<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">um so uh on that note yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:44.000" style="s2">you talk about the book winner takes all</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">that was um oh yeah yeah so that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.000" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">the the the realization that um</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">so when it comes to the themes it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2">every year there&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">spin on the same old ships that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.720" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">actually going to change anything and as</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:00.840" style="s2">we all know we&#39;re in the midst of a meta</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">crisis things are getting increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.840" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">dire</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">and one of the challenging one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:09.520" style="s2">most challenging things is</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">like if if we dial up um</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.520" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">our furore at this there look we all</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">have different roles to play sometimes i</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:15.679" style="s2">like people thinking about what mythic</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.679" end="00:21:19.039" style="s2">we&#39;re playing in this current chapter of</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">our lives and society</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.039" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">and you know for example peter you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">doing a this beautiful role of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">gathering</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">people in this like meaning crisis as we</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">cohere and make sense together it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">beautiful and it&#39;s answering a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">very real felt need that has been</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.159" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">missing for some time</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">uh and if we think about some folks are</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:40.640" style="s2">actually maybe their role is to draw</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">some attention to some things but as you</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.640" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">know with the memetic tribal wars and</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:46.799" style="s2">the paper you&#39;ve pioneered and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">all of that sometimes an excess of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">furore and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:51.360" style="s2">outrage doesn&#39;t actually help things and</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">sometimes i was writing down your latest</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:21:54.080" style="s2">post you said</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:56.159" style="s2">it&#39;s wise to be sneaky here so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.080" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">sneak our way to communitus</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.159" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">and i i really like the role of</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.960" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">sneakiness of the surreptitious of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.280" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">i feel like there&#39;s a congruency to</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">complexity practitioner here where</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">instead of like coming up with a grand</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:12.480" style="s2">plan and saying this is the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">we instead we we kind of we do the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.480" end="00:22:16.799" style="s2">tweaking we sense we kind of we</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">pull the levers sometimes this means we</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.799" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">smuggle our way in and we use some of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.559" end="00:22:21.679" style="s2">the language and the code that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">happening in enterprise land so that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.679" end="00:22:24.880" style="s2">can start to subvert it</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">and the beautiful thing about most</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.880" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">complexity thinking when people really</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:30.960" style="s2">start to contemplate that is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:33.360" style="s2">was a dangerous thing and that your mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.960" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">can literally uh implode and you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.360" end="00:22:37.360" style="s2">venture to the abyss and you know have</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:38.159" style="s2">to cross the chasm of nihilism and all</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.360" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">of that but</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.159" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">but this complexity thing you just start</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">well i wrote a book called um how to</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">lead a quest which</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">uh the thesis was um that uh we need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.840" end="00:22:51.120" style="s2">make distinctions between</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">meaningful progress and the delusion of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.120" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">progress the delusion of progress</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:56.880" style="s2">is where default thinking gets in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">way of meaningful progress and this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.880" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">where in many organizations it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:01.840" style="s2">more of a career advancement strategy to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:03.039" style="s2">broadcast you that you&#39;re doing the work</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.840" end="00:23:04.080" style="s2">than it is to actually do the work</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.039" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.080" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">and this creates a rich pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">business where everyone&#39;s busy but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:10.320" style="s2">not actually doing anything and</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">meaningful progress is that which brings</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">us closer to future relevance</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">and that as a kind of as a thought</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">bubble just</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the seed to plant in there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">it&#39;s pernicious because what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">meaningful progress really what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:25.440" style="s2">progress what is meaningful what do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:28.000" style="s2">mean by this</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.440" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">in what context from whose perspective</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.000" end="00:23:30.640" style="s2">and that question</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">for me i mean it&#39;s plagued me it</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.640" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">certainly hasn&#39;t made me more profitable</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">at all um</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:37.520" style="s2">and none of this by the way is a pathway</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">to great profits this is more about</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.520" end="00:23:40.720" style="s2">high level fulfillment in this role at</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">modest</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.720" end="00:23:45.039" style="s2">modest business success this this</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">question of meaningful progress</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.039" end="00:23:49.440" style="s2">i mean progress is kind of sneered out</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:50.720" style="s2">from post-modernist from a you know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.440" end="00:23:52.400" style="s2">modernist sense of progress from a</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.720" end="00:23:53.600" style="s2">meta-modern sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.400" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s something maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.600" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">something we can move towards but then</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">again after seeing tyson young reporter</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:23:59.360" style="s2">and reading his book</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">sand talk i&#39;m a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.360" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">skeptical about civilization nowadays</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">as we dance in this transitionary phase</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.600" end="00:24:08.559" style="s2">to the you know inevitable collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:11.440" style="s2">modern society</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.559" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s tricky to figure out our role</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">but the more that we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:16.640" style="s2">smuggle in philosophical sensibilities</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">and cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.640" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">you know savvy for complexity and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">more we can gather and cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">communities um</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">you know across different mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:28.240" style="s2">tribals uh tribes</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">um that seems to be a good path for us</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.240" end="00:24:30.799" style="s2">so i&#39;m doing this thing you give me a</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:32.559" style="s2">question i just kind of take it on this</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.799" end="00:24:34.000" style="s2">like lovely walk through the park and</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.559" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i answer it but i create</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.000" end="00:24:36.400" style="s2">enough distractions so yeah no one</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">notices</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.400" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">i&#39;m following you on the on the side i</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.320" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">culture</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.679" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">quite a bit but that seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.120" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">safety net that works for me</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">all right um so let&#39;s pivot thanks for</p>

<p begin="00:29:19.919" end="00:29:24.000" style="s2">quality to those types of questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:26.080" style="s2">like i&#39;ve been yearning to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.000" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">that the the kind of the existential</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.080" end="00:29:29.279" style="s2">challenges the psychological things of</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">how do you manage the cells and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.279" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">different arenas that</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:35.279" style="s2">questions and i find it really special</p>

<p begin="00:29:35.279" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">my pleasure uh and it&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.919" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">always on my mind given the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">kind of like the code switching speaking</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:46.159" style="s2">to all the memetic tribes and you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.760" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">um trying to relate to as much different</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.159" end="00:29:50.320" style="s2">reality towns as possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">yeah and not not and not getting so i</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:53.360" style="s2">mean there&#39;s a risk here that we can end</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">up reading and being exposed to such</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">brilliant ideas that we become</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:29:59.360" style="s2">like harder to relate at the barbecue</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:00.880" style="s2">you know the family bbq that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.360" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">going on there so this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.880" end="00:30:05.200" style="s2">this being this is where i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">the trickster is a very good archetype</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.200" end="00:30:08.480" style="s2">for us to keep in mind because the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:10.480" style="s2">trickster is a shape-shifter</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.480" end="00:30:12.880" style="s2">in most mythologies and they&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.480" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">kind of adapt to each different context</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.880" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">and i guess i guess embrace a multitude</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.840" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">of mythic roles so mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.840" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">sorry right so uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">let&#39;s go to the chats uh we got tim you</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.919" end="00:30:30.159" style="s2">got a lot of plus ones tim if you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:33.279" style="s2">unmute yourself and ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.159" end="00:30:36.799" style="s2">yeah um hi jason long time no see</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.279" end="00:30:38.080" style="s2">um look i i mean so there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.799" end="00:30:40.480" style="s2">things that that hit for me</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.080" end="00:30:41.919" style="s2">and i&#39;ll be fairly brief one is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.480" end="00:30:43.760" style="s2">idea of sneakiness</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.919" end="00:30:46.000" style="s2">and the whole trojan trojan horse thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.760" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">with big corporates i think is a really</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2">interesting theme</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:50.880" style="s2">to explore but the other thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.880" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">really coming to the front for me today</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.880" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">listening to this</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">is i mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">and it&#39;s implied in the topic but i</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:00.559" style="s2">think thought leader is completely</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:03.120" style="s2">obsolete</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.559" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">and and you know i think you know for if</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.120" end="00:31:07.279" style="s2">we&#39;re operating in complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:09.200" style="s2">we should be striving to be experiment</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.279" end="00:31:12.000" style="s2">leaders and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.200" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">you know given you know i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.000" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">we have a lot of ceos here today but</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:17.519" style="s2">but we you know we may or may not but</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:20.399" style="s2">what do you think about as</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.519" end="00:31:21.440" style="s2">actions that we can be taking right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.440" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">that might help us move things forward</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:29.279" style="s2">yeah thank you tim i love the question</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">and um and yeah that you&#39;re right i</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.279" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">thought the notion of thought leadership</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:34.080" style="s2">and i would say even say that</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:36.159" style="s2">unless we&#39;re talking about complicated</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.080" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">systems the notion of expertise is</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.159" end="00:31:42.720" style="s2">a little bit um suspect as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:46.320" style="s2">uh the thing that i look to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.720" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">um it&#39;s a good question i mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:49.120" style="s2">there&#39;s the distinction between a</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">complicated system has experts and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.120" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">authorities and a single point of</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.120" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">whereas in a you know in this rich</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">complex adaptive systems that we find</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:31:57.840" style="s2">ourselves in it&#39;s much more about being</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:01.279" style="s2">explorers and experimenters</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.840" end="00:32:04.880" style="s2">and tweakers and synthesizers um</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.279" end="00:32:06.159" style="s2">i i i find that there&#39;s a complexity</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.880" end="00:32:07.600" style="s2">practitioner by the name of sonia</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.159" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">blignort who</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.600" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">does work with dave snowden uh and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">kinetin thing and she has this beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">article on medium</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:16.799" style="s2">and what i&#39;ve learned as a complexity</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:20.000" style="s2">practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.799" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">and i i personally i really like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">term complexity practitioner and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">think it&#39;s promulgated in the market</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">that well and i don&#39;t think folks</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:28.080" style="s2">recognize it but</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">that&#39;s something that i often hold to as</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">the point of differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:33.039" style="s2">as opposed to someone who&#39;s coming in</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">supposedly with all the answers the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.039" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">complexity practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:38.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have all the answers is aware</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:40.320" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.240" end="00:32:42.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of a partnership process</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.320" end="00:32:44.240" style="s2">it&#39;s something that requires some</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.559" end="00:32:46.000" style="s2">sensing first there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.240" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a practitioner too though because</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.000" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">there&#39;s one of the traps that all of us</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:50.559" style="s2">can get</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:52.080" style="s2">lost in is this the temptation to marvel</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.559" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">at complexity and that you know i can</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:56.080" style="s2">find myself there whereas</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:58.080" style="s2">in in an arena we actually need to you</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.080" end="00:32:59.519" style="s2">know choosing to not choose is still a</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.080" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2">choice that has implications in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">complex system and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.200" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">because we are part of it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.960" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">shaping us as we are shaping</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">it there&#39;s there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">paradoxes and tensions we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">mindful of and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2">and thus you know the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:16.720" style="s2">practitioner thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">and if anyone finds the article um</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.720" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">uh sonia blignort um complexity</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:24.320" style="s2">you can google that and put it in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">chat thread um this the sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.320" end="00:33:28.240" style="s2">around that means that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:29.919" style="s2">promising outcomes we&#39;re not sticky</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.240" end="00:33:31.600" style="s2">we&#39;re not coming in with linear plans or</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.919" end="00:33:33.360" style="s2">predetermined processes</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.600" end="00:33:35.200" style="s2">we&#39;re coming in we&#39;re sensing and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.360" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">trying to take notice of the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">that are emerging there and then we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.799" end="00:33:40.000" style="s2">conducting those experiments</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">those weak probes and we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.000" end="00:33:43.120" style="s2">sense and assimilate some sort of sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">from it all</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.120" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">and this is interesting because it it</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:49.519" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really play to the cards of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:50.880" style="s2">thought leadership game of the expert</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.519" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">the charismatic hero that come in and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.880" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">save the day</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:56.000" style="s2">but i think that we&#39;re seeing a shift in</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:59.760" style="s2">the code of what people look for</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.000" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">and one of my own sales strategies</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:03.200" style="s2">you know when i&#39;m in conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">folks that are considering</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:06.640" style="s2">what may be a high value engagement</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:08.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.640" end="00:34:09.760" style="s2">i&#39;ll often do some sort of cheeky</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">downward comparison</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.760" end="00:34:12.960" style="s2">which will usually be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">downward comparison where i&#39;ll point to</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.960" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">a large firm and say look you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:17.679" style="s2">i&#39;m sure you&#39;re considering different</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">options and there are folks out there</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.679" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">that have</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.320" end="00:34:21.919" style="s2">well-established programs with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:24.399" style="s2">gravitas around them they can come in</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.919" end="00:34:26.159" style="s2">they&#39;re very safe options because they</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.399" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">you know they can steamroll through</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.159" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">any anything there but you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:31.200" style="s2">going to get a generic thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2">going to cost you a lot of money and</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.200" end="00:34:33.679" style="s2">there are folks out there that have</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">their own pet theories that think</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.679" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">they&#39;ve got all the answers and can come</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">in there</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">and that may be fun for a little while</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:41.599" style="s2">but i i sense that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:43.119" style="s2">in six months time we&#39;re probably going</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.599" end="00:34:44.879" style="s2">to be back in the same situation</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.119" end="00:34:46.399" style="s2">and besides cultures or whatever thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.879" end="00:34:48.480" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s complex we actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.399" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">need a much more sensitive approach so</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.480" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">that there&#39;s things there and i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">that if we collectively start to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t know terms are a tricky one</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">because if we adhere to them too tightly</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">they become corrupted and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:00.960" style="s2">the game a [ __ ] come in and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:03.040" style="s2">scale it and then turn you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.960" end="00:35:04.960" style="s2">we have to move to another term which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">why i call myself a wizard rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.960" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">thought leader</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:10.400" style="s2">no one really like there&#39;s enough of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">sense of the archetype that people</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.400" end="00:35:14.240" style="s2">understand oh wizard</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:15.680" style="s2">okay um person who thinks a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.240" end="00:35:18.079" style="s2">maybe you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.680" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">plays with magic and for me emergence is</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.079" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">a kind of magic so</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:23.440" style="s2">it works in my remit but i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:25.680" style="s2">hope that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.440" end="00:35:27.119" style="s2">merry-go-round has given some insights</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.680" end="00:35:27.839" style="s2">um thank you for the question i know</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.119" end="00:35:30.640" style="s2">that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.839" end="00:35:32.079" style="s2">you know you are of mind and and one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.640" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">the great things that the store is doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.079" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">is actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">bringing a lot of more of this stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">the surface like the work of nora</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">bateson</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">the um tyson young reporter like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:42.640" style="s2">there&#39;s so much the savviness</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:44.480" style="s2">that that&#39;s like this is the angle the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.640" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">complexity angle is where we need to tap</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.480" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:48.880" style="s2">but i&#39;ll say there&#39;s part of me that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:50.000" style="s2">kind of wants a lot of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:52.000" style="s2">institutions to die</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.000" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s some folks</p>

<p begin="00:35:55.599" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">here what will happen you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:00.320" style="s2">and then like we can&#39;t afford to do this</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:01.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s like well if you can&#39;t afford</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.320" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">to then good people</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.599" end="00:36:05.280" style="s2">ought to leave or you know reconsider</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">their options and then before</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.280" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">but i guess you&#39;re going to have these</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:10.960" style="s2">lifeless husks that keep on coasting by</p>

<p begin="00:36:49.839" end="00:36:54.640" style="s2">it definitely resonates um i had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.839" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">question about</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.640" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">your accountant uh scenario and i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:02.800" style="s2">that this actually bears some interest</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:04.960" style="s2">is there any deeper insight into</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.800" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">that sort of uh the accounting scenario</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.960" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">now i&#39;ll read on my question it was can</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">you speak more to the account</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">scenario as a model of bootstrapping</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">into the enterprise obviously just as</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:17.920" style="s2">other words for trojan horsing into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.920" end="00:37:22.720" style="s2">um is there there there for that model</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">because i&#39;m assuming this was passed on</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.720" end="00:37:26.560" style="s2">this was diffused and this was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:29.280" style="s2">scaled</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.560" end="00:37:30.079" style="s2">deeper through that medium i would say</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.280" end="00:37:31.839" style="s2">it was less</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.079" end="00:37:34.000" style="s2">i love your question and and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.839" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">and i think the tension of game a game b</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.000" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">is something that we&#39;re all grappling</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">with it&#39;s just one of the extra</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:43.440" style="s2">anxieties that we have in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">wonderful age that we live in um and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.440" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">the i would say it&#39;s less that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">passed through and diffused and more</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:49.920" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">arrived and created the conditions for</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.920" end="00:37:55.280" style="s2">such thoughts to be evoked</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">and so part of what a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.280" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">thought leader role i&#39;ll go back to my</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:37:59.920" style="s2">inverted commas since sam tim&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:01.280" style="s2">wonderful question because</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.920" end="00:38:02.560" style="s2">when i say thought leader i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.280" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">actually mean thought leader is just the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.560" end="00:38:05.280" style="s2">moniker that we can you know sneak our</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">way into the enterprise lane but</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.280" end="00:38:08.560" style="s2">the role of the complexity practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:10.880" style="s2">might be in</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.560" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">bringing the provocations and that that</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.880" end="00:38:14.560" style="s2">for you like it might be exposing people</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:16.079" style="s2">to ways of seeing and thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.560" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">weren&#39;t they weren&#39;t aware of before so</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.079" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">in my accountant</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:20.880" style="s2">thing i did something for the whole</p>

<p begin="00:38:25.680" end="00:38:29.119" style="s2">they ended up serving dinner first and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:30.480" style="s2">so i was in this room full of drunk</p>

<p begin="00:38:36.560" end="00:38:39.760" style="s2">deeply resonated so i got talking and</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.880" end="00:38:41.839" style="s2">then from there</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.760" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">book exchanges you keep in touch i came</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.160" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.880" end="00:39:02.960" style="s2">experimenting with hierarchy or</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">hierarchical um setups of</p>

<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">but maybe some game a b</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:14.320" style="s2">things and all this stuff is it&#39;s kind</p>

<p begin="00:39:17.040" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">case study but you can you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">sense some of the ripples that we can we</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">play into which then comes back into</p>

<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">i i&#39;d sometimes like to think that when</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.720" end="00:39:29.680" style="s2">i&#39;m speaking to an audience in</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:30.800" style="s2">enterprise land that there are sleeper</p>

<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">but the trouble is and to quote um</p>

<p begin="00:39:52.400" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">one of the risks i see for us playing</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">this game which comes back to peter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:39:57.599" style="s2">thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:39:59.200" style="s2">if you wear the mask for too long you</p>

<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:07.920" style="s2">you seek to not become so like</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.920" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">this tension of managing it all</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.920" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">this this means that sometimes it pays</p>

<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">in which the individuals looking for</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:10.240" style="s2">your services are relatively open to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:11.680" style="s2">change and enlightened perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.240" end="00:41:13.359" style="s2">whereas why would they hire a coach</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.680" end="00:41:15.040" style="s2">could you speak to specific experiences</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.359" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">where you had to try and crack</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.040" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">a relatively resistant crowd that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">already knows better perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.000" end="00:41:26.400" style="s2">but really don&#39;t have the commitment</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.480" end="00:41:28.319" style="s2">sorry whoever asked that and i stole it</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:29.599" style="s2">yeah it was john uh john would you like</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.319" end="00:41:31.839" style="s2">to just add anything to that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.599" end="00:41:31.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">you&#39;re mute yeah look</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.880" end="00:41:40.720" style="s2">no worries tim um you&#39;ve read the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">question but i guess</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.720" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">you know the the uh conversations that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:46.880" style="s2">happened in the meantime</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.079" end="00:41:48.400" style="s2">um you know when we when we are on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.880" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">inside and i have been on the outside</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.400" end="00:41:50.400" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">not as a coach but you know external</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.400" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">consultants and now on the inside</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:55.920" style="s2">and when you are perhaps one of those</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">two or three percent</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.920" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">that um desperately wish for change but</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.040" end="00:42:01.359" style="s2">you&#39;re surrounded by people who already</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">know best they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.359" end="00:42:04.800" style="s2">they&#39;ve adopted the language of agile</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">and so they think they&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.800" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">operating</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:13.119" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re pivoting yeah um and</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">so therefore it&#39;s just uh the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">there&#39;s really no sense that they need</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:18.480" style="s2">to change or if they do need to change</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">they already know how best to change and</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:26.480" style="s2">so um you know it</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:28.560" style="s2">in some sense we kind of i guess have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">resign ourselves to just playing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.560" end="00:42:31.040" style="s2">position but then on the other hand you</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:36.079" style="s2">desperately want to to be the agent of</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.480" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">that change as well and so i guess i was</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.079" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">asking whether you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:42.560" style="s2">perhaps access some of the to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:43.119" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been in situations perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.560" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.119" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">the crowd is particularly reticent or oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:49.680" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">barely get invited in yeah totally yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.680" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">thank you good question and i i do tend</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">to work well with um</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:42:58.480" style="s2">smart and skeptical audiences that have</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">seen it all before but if you put me</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:02.319" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">a room of sales people with alpha male</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.319" end="00:43:06.800" style="s2">you know sales folks that looking for</p>

<p begin="00:43:08.720" end="00:43:14.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot harder my strategy</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">is like there&#39;s always calibration like</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.640" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">you&#39;ve always got a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">like there&#39;s the agent arena you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">being being fit being um</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:24.000" style="s2">able to orientate yourself to or work</p>

<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:28.160" style="s2">um improv and keith abramson&#39;s work it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.960" end="00:43:30.319" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:32.000" style="s2">you it&#39;s you got to work with what&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="00:43:32.000" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">a strategy is often for me if i come</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.839" end="00:43:36.960" style="s2">back to this distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:39.680" style="s2">delusion of progress and that which</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.960" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">could be considered meaningful progress</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.680" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">that in the the context of constructive</p>

<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:53.520" style="s2">that there&#39;s this weird kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.800" end="00:43:55.119" style="s2">catalyzing that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.520" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">when you put certain things to language</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.119" end="00:43:57.839" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to one see this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:43:59.520" style="s2">translates to a burning platform or a</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.839" end="00:44:04.079" style="s2">burning aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.520" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">and i mean you know you go</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.079" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">i mean this is the same effect with all</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:08.240" style="s2">these things like david schmachenberger</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">um the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.240" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">uh being more aware of the exponential</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:15.599" style="s2">tech threat like the existential threat</p>

<p begin="00:44:15.599" end="00:44:20.319" style="s2">i can&#39;t unknow that now and there are</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.240" end="00:44:22.079" style="s2">certain things that just</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.319" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">shape the way you do and i i just feel</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.079" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">like you know when you when you say that</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">you want to be the agent</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:29.440" style="s2">i know you don&#39;t mean specifically but</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:31.920" style="s2">there is a kind of a humility to this</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.440" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">um or even like a modern juxtaposition</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:35.119" style="s2">of like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:37.760" style="s2">inflated sense of self-importance with a</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.119" end="00:44:39.920" style="s2">you know a bit of a glint</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.760" end="00:44:41.119" style="s2">uh at your own you know ironic</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.920" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">self-importance there</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.119" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">is is that we actually got to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">humble sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:48.560" style="s2">actually you know we come in and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">create some conditions and we evoke some</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.560" end="00:44:51.680" style="s2">things and we make some tweaks</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:53.920" style="s2">that people don&#39;t actually associate it</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.680" end="00:44:55.680" style="s2">with us and that&#39;s fine you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like there are different areas that</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.680" end="00:44:59.200" style="s2">we can come to</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">and if we think about like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.200" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">particularly represent audience and i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.200" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">because the more that people actually</p>

<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:21.359" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the person</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">the person who books you you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.359" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">audience itself then you&#39;ve got yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:26.960" style="s2">as your own audience as well and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:28.720" style="s2">navigating that sometimes it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:30.480" style="s2">ticking enough the client boxes giving</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.720" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">what the you know giving what the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.480" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">audience think they want</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:35.920" style="s2">uh to feel good in the moment but also</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:37.200" style="s2">kind of fulfilling your own needs and</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.920" end="00:46:38.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.200" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the tensions to to juggle</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.960" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">here but it&#39;s something that i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.240" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">where you&#39;re we can all you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.680" end="00:46:44.319" style="s2">us here</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:44.319" style="s2">can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:49.920" style="s2">all right uh rain you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.119" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">hey jason thanks thank you</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.640" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">maybe you can help me understand uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">within myself</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">why is it that i&#39;m so much less</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">resistant to this idea of sneakiness</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:11.440" style="s2">um than i am to other forms of of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">strategy or manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:15.200" style="s2">and the way i think is like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.760" end="00:47:19.200" style="s2">lot of modernists that</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.200" end="00:47:21.599" style="s2">um are um you know explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.200" end="00:47:22.400" style="s2">uh talking about effectiveness and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.599" end="00:47:25.920" style="s2">implicatly</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.400" end="00:47:29.359" style="s2">are manipulating and it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.920" end="00:47:32.400" style="s2">explicit manipulation but implicit um</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.359" end="00:47:34.079" style="s2">effectiveness and goodwill so the</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.400" end="00:47:35.839" style="s2">question sort of comes down to</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.079" end="00:47:37.760" style="s2">what is the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.839" end="00:47:40.800" style="s2">sneakiness and instrumentalism</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.760" end="00:47:44.079" style="s2">in your view oh i love it i love it</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.800" end="00:47:45.760" style="s2">um this is a great question i shall</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.079" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">ponder this further after this and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.760" end="00:47:51.680" style="s2">and try to write about this because um</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">gosh it irks me when i catch people</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.680" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">that that are sincerely using</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:59.760" style="s2">uh kind of manipulative or hypnotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.920" end="00:48:00.400" style="s2">or kind of like psychotechnology tools</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.760" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2">that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.400" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">they&#39;re sincerely using it as though</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">they don&#39;t know that the other parties</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">are doing it and that&#39;s just it just</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">irks me</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">if i was ever to deploy certain</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:11.359" style="s2">techniques and methods um</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">i would probably draw attention to what</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.359" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">i&#39;m doing like transparency</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:17.680" style="s2">like uh like say for example that</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.160" end="00:48:19.680" style="s2">downward comparison</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.680" end="00:48:21.760" style="s2">example that i gave before where i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.680" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">kind of list two of the other options</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.760" end="00:48:23.839" style="s2">and in a kind of a downward comparison</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:25.440" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.839" end="00:48:26.800" style="s2">i would often just point out the client</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.440" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">of course i&#39;m saying this because i want</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.800" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">you to</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:30.319" style="s2">work with me and i think we can do great</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">things together um</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.319" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a way of exercising the demons</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">quickly and swiftly as they occur</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:44.160" style="s2">so the the irony of sneakiness is if</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:45.599" style="s2">you&#39;re being overt about your sneakiness</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.160" end="00:48:47.839" style="s2">you get to be much more effective and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.599" end="00:48:49.359" style="s2">you get to kind of expunge yourself of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.839" end="00:48:50.400" style="s2">any of the ickiness of the process at</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.359" end="00:48:52.240" style="s2">the same time</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">so i generally try to avoid anything</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.240" end="00:48:55.280" style="s2">that makes me feel icky but as soon as i</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">find myself feeling icky</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.280" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">i&#39;ll draw attention to it and if this</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:00.559" style="s2">was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">physical stage you can literally step to</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.559" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">the side and like look to</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">look to where you were and what you were</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.680" end="00:49:07.040" style="s2">doing there&#39;s like like anyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">seen me on stage am i</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.040" end="00:49:10.559" style="s2">quite fluid and in like in like</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:14.720" style="s2">gesticule</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.559" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">form i am the i love this this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.720" end="00:49:17.119" style="s2">like overtly pointing out like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:19.680" style="s2">sneakiness</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.119" end="00:49:20.599" style="s2">um i think the sneakiness is also open</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.680" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">uh like that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.599" end="00:49:24.319" style="s2">implicit like the implications of</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">sneakiness</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.319" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">is if one is sneaking they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">gently</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">they&#39;re being hyper aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">environment around them they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:35.839" style="s2">looking to draw attention to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">uh they&#39;re not looking to create a</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.839" end="00:49:39.440" style="s2">ruckus and be loud and you know move</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:40.240" style="s2">fast and break things it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.440" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.240" end="00:49:43.760" style="s2">dispositional approach to affecting</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:45.359" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.760" end="00:49:47.040" style="s2">that is in in many ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.359" end="00:49:48.240" style="s2">de-centering yourself which means you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.040" end="00:49:51.520" style="s2">not you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.240" end="00:49:53.040" style="s2">it&#39;s uh and that that stuff you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:55.359" style="s2">that&#39;s probably why it appeals to you</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.040" end="00:49:56.319" style="s2">and i imagine many folks here as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.359" end="00:49:58.400" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.319" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">look at me and you can see a modernist</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.400" end="00:50:01.200" style="s2">thought leader</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">just subscribe to their newsletters</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.200" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">they&#39;ll probably have about</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:07.200" style="s2">uh a dozen photos of themselves in their</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:08.960" style="s2">own newsletter they&#39;ll have quotes of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.200" end="00:50:10.640" style="s2">themselves saying their own quote to a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.960" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">background photo of themselves making</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.640" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">the quote</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:16.160" style="s2">um they&#39;ll talk about they&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:18.000" style="s2">have an acronym built around their name</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.160" end="00:50:19.280" style="s2">um to talk about their formula for</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:21.920" style="s2">success or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.280" end="00:50:24.000" style="s2">and that stuff is that stuff is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.920" end="00:50:25.359" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to adhere to</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:27.119" style="s2">mind you though there&#39;s a trap with a</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.359" end="00:50:28.800" style="s2">postmodern mode</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.119" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">which can get so sneaky that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.800" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">actually in the effective</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:34.000" style="s2">altogether you&#39;re just scoffing and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">you are sitting in your corner with your</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.000" end="00:50:38.079" style="s2">cigarette and you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">um sneering at the world um but not</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.079" end="00:50:40.880" style="s2">actually necessarily showing up in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:41.680" style="s2">places where you could be affecting</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.880" end="00:50:43.680" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.680" end="00:50:45.599" style="s2">so there is a synthesis between the two</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.680" end="00:50:46.559" style="s2">roles but the disposition of sneakiness</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.599" end="00:50:48.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.559" end="00:50:49.839" style="s2">i think it works well for us complexity</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.000" end="00:50:52.319" style="s2">practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.839" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">thanks for the question i love it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.319" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">a great question</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:57.839" style="s2">um christian you had a question about</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.839" end="00:51:05.359" style="s2">practitioners you&#39;re gonna mute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">yeah uh i had a question and someone</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.359" end="00:51:10.800" style="s2">added to it so i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:14.559" style="s2">read her edition as well um</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.800" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">where&#39;s my question okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.559" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">is it possible to truly be a complexity</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">practitioner without the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">other complexity practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:27.520" style="s2">and i say i&#39;m trying to point at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">limitations of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.520" end="00:51:31.520" style="s2">in isolation the underlying idea here</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:35.839" style="s2">being that</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.520" end="00:51:37.920" style="s2">how can you truly approach complexity</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.839" end="00:51:40.240" style="s2">a singular place without you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.920" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">feedback and all those kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.240" end="00:51:44.000" style="s2">is there a trap in wanting to put on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:46.800" style="s2">costume of being</p>

<p begin="00:52:09.280" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">because yeah this this whole thing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about has been very</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.040" end="00:52:18.079" style="s2">um almost individual you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.319" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a risk here that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.079" end="00:52:20.720" style="s2">can fall into the trap thinking that oh</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.839" end="00:52:22.720" style="s2">look you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.720" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">cast yourself like this and then you too</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.720" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">can be you know the call will go out and</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.599" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">parachute in and work your magic and</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:30.480" style="s2">then jet pack off into the sunset and</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:32.800" style="s2">everyone&#39;s happier</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.480" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not like that and i&#39;m i&#39;m hesitant</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.800" end="00:52:35.520" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">as again like a complexity practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:38.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily something that</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.880" end="00:52:41.520" style="s2">clicks it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.079" end="00:52:43.920" style="s2">an affinity a disposition uh we</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.520" end="00:52:45.119" style="s2">only exist in uh relation to each other</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">to quote james cass</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.119" end="00:52:48.240" style="s2">you know one cannot be human by oneself</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.680" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.240" end="00:52:52.720" style="s2">our character has an inescapably fluid</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:55.760" style="s2">thing we co-create each other here</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.720" end="00:52:57.200" style="s2">and so you know think about this</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.760" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">complexity practitioner thing i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.200" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">be talking about it if i hadn&#39;t read the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:01.040" style="s2">post from</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">sonya blignon and i wouldn&#39;t have come</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.040" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">across her post if i hadn&#39;t listened to</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:06.559" style="s2">um dave snowden a conversation with jim</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:08.240" style="s2">wright and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.559" end="00:53:09.599" style="s2">and there&#39;s this cascade of things and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.240" end="00:53:10.559" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t be here because you know if</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.599" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">not for the work of</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.559" end="00:53:15.119" style="s2">of peter and the store like all of this</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.640" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">stuff right we&#39;re co-creating each other</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:21.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s inescapable like um</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">to quote david chapman if we think of</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.200" end="00:53:25.280" style="s2">ourselves it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:26.160" style="s2">nebulous but patent so the boundaries to</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.280" end="00:53:27.599" style="s2">self like is</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.160" end="00:53:29.280" style="s2">isn&#39;t it there&#39;s an inherent</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.599" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">interconnectedness and yet there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.280" end="00:53:33.760" style="s2">pattern and distinction too</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">and so being aware that cool that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.760" end="00:53:37.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:38.880" style="s2">organic realism kind of we&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.520" end="00:53:41.440" style="s2">this together</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.880" end="00:53:43.520" style="s2">and and then it&#39;s about how can we be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.440" end="00:53:45.520" style="s2">little bit more intentional around this</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.520" end="00:53:46.640" style="s2">and so i think one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.520" end="00:53:48.559" style="s2">resonates for</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.640" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">many folks the stella and this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">something that i&#39;m i&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:53.200" style="s2">stumbling and trying to put my own</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:56.400" style="s2">clarion calls out for too is</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.200" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">that um complexity practitioners or at</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.400" end="00:54:00.240" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:54:02.240" style="s2">those who um have an affinity for that</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.240" end="00:54:03.040" style="s2">disposition can kind of recognize each</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.240" end="00:54:04.480" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.040" end="00:54:06.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.480" end="00:54:08.480" style="s2">things like i would look for subtly</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.480" end="00:54:09.839" style="s2">um you know and when i find those folks</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.480" end="00:54:10.240" style="s2">it&#39;s wonderful and we keep in touch</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.839" end="00:54:13.040" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.240" end="00:54:14.960" style="s2">and but if i find like a belligerent</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.040" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">opinionated hedgehog then unlikely to</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.960" end="00:54:17.040" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:18.319" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not likely to give them a</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.040" end="00:54:18.880" style="s2">call on the weekend and see how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.319" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.880" end="00:54:22.800" style="s2">the complexity practitioners generally</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:24.800" style="s2">have uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.800" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a softness or a gentleness in in</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.800" end="00:54:28.240" style="s2">how we inquire things or</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:30.640" style="s2">if we kind of if we&#39;re being a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.240" end="00:54:33.599" style="s2">spirited it&#39;s done in an obviously</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.640" end="00:54:35.040" style="s2">um like in a performative manner that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:37.119" style="s2">transparent so</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.040" end="00:54:38.960" style="s2">anyone who reads the start of handsy</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.119" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">frank&#39;s listening society we&#39;ll see that</p>

<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:50.319" style="s2">um i&#39;m getting off track here</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:51.599" style="s2">the complexity things yeah i think we</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.319" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">need to find each other because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.599" end="00:54:54.079" style="s2">bloody</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:56.640" style="s2">it&#39;s freaking hard work like all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.079" end="00:54:58.559" style="s2">forces are geared towards still this</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.640" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">life is complicated let&#39;s find the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.559" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">absolute truth let&#39;s find</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:03.359" style="s2">the fix you know let&#39;s let&#39;s proceed</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.839" end="00:55:05.920" style="s2">with linear thinking</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.359" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">and the the ones of us that have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.920" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">little bit more savvy in this regard are</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:11.040" style="s2">a lot rarer it seems</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:12.880" style="s2">and we could do more to find each other</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:14.480" style="s2">and i&#39;d also add that um a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.880" end="00:55:15.119" style="s2">indigenous knowledges um have been</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.480" end="00:55:17.680" style="s2">practicing</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:18.559" style="s2">this stuff for uh many tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.680" end="00:55:19.839" style="s2">of years so</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.559" end="00:55:21.359" style="s2">um there&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.839" end="00:55:22.720" style="s2">savviness there that we could we could</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.359" end="00:55:24.799" style="s2">actually learn from too</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.720" end="00:55:26.160" style="s2">and i&#39;m actually remiss in um</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.799" end="00:55:27.760" style="s2">acknowledging and i just take this</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.160" end="00:55:29.920" style="s2">moment to pay my respect to</p>

<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:55.440" style="s2">um is there any kind of closing thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.040" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">anything you would like to leave us with</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.440" end="00:56:02.000" style="s2">um yeah thank you i think i</p>

<p begin="00:56:03.680" end="00:56:07.839" style="s2">questions here and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.119" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">the sense this kind of uh nameless</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.839" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">quality of communitas that is being</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:13.680" style="s2">cultivated here</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:16.400" style="s2">i think i approach this in hindsight</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.680" end="00:56:18.160" style="s2">with a little bit of um</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.400" end="00:56:20.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know in my own world it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.160" end="00:56:22.480" style="s2">easy to be the the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.480" end="00:56:23.680" style="s2">this is my smug you know just to take</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.480" end="00:56:24.720" style="s2">this with a pinch of salt it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.680" end="00:56:26.640" style="s2">to kind of show up and be</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.720" end="00:56:28.079" style="s2">like kind of clever and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.640" end="00:56:29.200" style="s2">charismatic and smart and so on in</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.079" end="00:56:31.200" style="s2">enterprise land</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:33.119" style="s2">but amongst you guys i feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.200" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">imposter syndrome and i started this</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.119" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">like with extreme intimidation i know</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">you had bio on earlier today</p>
