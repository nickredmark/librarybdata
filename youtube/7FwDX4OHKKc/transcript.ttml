<p begin="00:00:00.260" end="00:00:06.089" style="s2">there is a common perception that</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.319" end="00:00:07.620" style="s2">Western medicine is science-based</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.089" end="00:00:10.889" style="s2">right evidence-based is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.620" end="00:00:13.170" style="s2">primary term there are websites on</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.889" end="00:00:15.900" style="s2">science-based medicines that are focused</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.170" end="00:00:18.300" style="s2">on showing what kind of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.900" end="00:00:21.949" style="s2">research is missing for things outside</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.300" end="00:00:25.080" style="s2">of traditional Western approach and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.949" end="00:00:27.869" style="s2">natural medicine is generally some</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.080" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">degree of folk superstitions with maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">a little bit that has science and a</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:35.630" style="s2">little bit that is like hocus pocus</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">stuff and I think that&#39;s actually fair</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.630" end="00:00:41.940" style="s2">oftentimes when we come to I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:43.500" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously an assumption that if</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.940" end="00:00:45.180" style="s2">something is natural it&#39;s good for you</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.500" end="00:00:48.360" style="s2">that some people have that is very</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.180" end="00:00:49.500" style="s2">unsophisticated and if something</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.360" end="00:00:52.770" style="s2">synthetic gets bad for you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.500" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">oversimplified and muscle testing is</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.770" end="00:00:56.760" style="s2">very different diagnostic method than</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:00:59.100" style="s2">actually running labs and but what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.760" end="00:01:01.280" style="s2">wanting to bring about is that what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.100" end="00:01:04.170" style="s2">wanting you to get into here is it a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.280" end="00:01:06.180" style="s2">naturally oriented medicine doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.170" end="00:01:08.760" style="s2">not high-tech and it doesn&#39;t mean not</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.180" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">high science it means that it&#39;s science</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.760" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">trying to understand what the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">physiology is normally doing rather than</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:17.340" style="s2">just saying how do we override one very</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:19.229" style="s2">small part of it but to just speak to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.340" end="00:01:21.420" style="s2">that for a minute because when you say</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.229" end="00:01:23.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a divine intelligence right that</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.420" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">can also kind of speak to the like oh so</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.130" end="00:01:31.100" style="s2">are you doing prayer healing so a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">bit more does is Thea&#39;s Umrah quired is</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.100" end="00:01:37.890" style="s2">any particular other than rational</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:42.990" style="s2">belief system required and is what</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.890" end="00:01:44.970" style="s2">you&#39;re doing drawing upon the sciences I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.990" end="00:01:47.220" style="s2">love this question and I wish we had all</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.970" end="00:01:48.899" style="s2">night to talk about it because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.220" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">so many different directions we could go</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.899" end="00:01:53.549" style="s2">there so I&#39;ll just take the theism first</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">no absolutely not there&#39;s no religion in</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.549" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">here it is for me maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">classify it as a religion but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:04.020" style="s2">certainty within me and it is my truth</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:06.990" style="s2">with a capital T that every human body</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.020" end="00:02:09.090" style="s2">is capable of healing so I start every</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.990" end="00:02:11.069" style="s2">interaction with any person whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.090" end="00:02:12.840" style="s2">they&#39;re a patient or not under the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.069" end="00:02:14.849" style="s2">assumption that they can heal</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.840" end="00:02:18.870" style="s2">and whatever stands in their way can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.849" end="00:02:20.970" style="s2">moved does that answer the the god</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.870" end="00:02:24.450" style="s2">question so when you say a divine</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.970" end="00:02:24.989" style="s2">intelligence mm-hmm what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.450" end="00:02:27.510" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.989" end="00:02:30.930" style="s2">and I would say maybe in a if I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.510" end="00:02:35.239" style="s2">translate it into a closer to science</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.930" end="00:02:37.800" style="s2">language is that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.239" end="00:02:39.900" style="s2">self-organizing system that has very</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.800" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">complex regulatory mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.900" end="00:02:43.709" style="s2">evolved to regulate well yeah and if</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:46.260" style="s2">they&#39;re not regulating well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.709" end="00:02:48.930" style="s2">probably some problem in the way that if</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.260" end="00:02:50.940" style="s2">you identify it and clear it it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.930" end="00:02:54.120" style="s2">actually evolved to regulate well</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.940" end="00:02:56.010" style="s2">precisely you know and I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.120" end="00:02:59.400" style="s2">details of human evolution that&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.010" end="00:03:03.060" style="s2">area of expertise but exactly we came</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.400" end="00:03:05.849" style="s2">out of a system that the earth right we</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.060" end="00:03:07.709" style="s2">were here in earth and things like sea</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.849" end="00:03:10.890" style="s2">salt like we&#39;re understanding more and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.709" end="00:03:13.080" style="s2">more and more how sea salt is I created</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.890" end="00:03:16.200" style="s2">in these perfect ratios of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.080" end="00:03:17.700" style="s2">micronutrients that we need and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.200" end="00:03:19.799" style="s2">we were created on earth where the sea</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.700" end="00:03:21.510" style="s2">salt exists and instead of taking a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.799" end="00:03:23.370" style="s2">bunch of calcium and magnesium maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.510" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">makes more sense to get some sea salts</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.370" end="00:03:27.959" style="s2">and that our blood pressure will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:30.209" style="s2">better regulated that our adrenals will</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.959" end="00:03:31.890" style="s2">we be redder better regulated excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.209" end="00:03:34.890" style="s2">that all of these things might run a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.890" end="00:03:37.019" style="s2">little better if they are supported in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.890" end="00:03:38.040" style="s2">natural system now going that in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.019" end="00:03:39.870" style="s2">natural way</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.040" end="00:03:43.470" style="s2">that&#39;s an alignment with the way we</p>
