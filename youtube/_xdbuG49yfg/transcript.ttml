<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">felt like the right place and so we kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:18.159" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">started a public initiative to build a</p>

<p begin="00:03:27.200" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">and it became clear we needed to be back</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">home</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:35.200" style="s2">in canada where we&#39;re from and uh be</p>

<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:44.959" style="s2">understood and so we moved back in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:48.159" style="s2">midst of covid</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.959" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">and then just put the idea out there to</p>

<p begin="00:04:10.239" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">looked at a few different properties</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:15.519" style="s2">found this one</p>

<p begin="00:04:22.880" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">or as structures and with solar panels</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">it turns we had a conversation with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">owners and the owners wanted to partner</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:33.440" style="s2">with us they listened to our podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">loved the vision and offered to partner</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">with us on this project</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">yeah they&#39;ve been running it as a farm</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:43.360" style="s2">since the 90s as an organic farm</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">and they you know saw that partnering</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.360" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">with us would</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:48.160" style="s2">take it to the next level and add all</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:48.960" style="s2">the you know technology component and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.160" end="00:04:52.000" style="s2">the network</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.960" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">and the community aspect that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:55.520" style="s2">bring</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">and so yeah it&#39;s unfolded very</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">organically</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">in a very cool way just like we i</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">constantly feel like we&#39;re at the right</p>

<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:10.560" style="s2">doing this yeah so totally</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">um so i have a bunch of questions but</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.560" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">might be prudent to watch that that</p>

<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">in terms of how many people live there</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.839" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">i think we will cap it at 50 adults but</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">that will be over several years</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">to start we&#39;ll just have a couple</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">families living there because there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:12.720" style="s2">already some existing structures that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">can accommodate that but as we build</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.720" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">more structures and rezone parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">property to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:20.079" style="s2">fit more houses we&#39;ll increase the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">capacity um one thing that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.079" end="00:11:23.839" style="s2">important for us is to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">social cohesion is there</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.839" end="00:11:27.519" style="s2">um that we all get along and that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:30.800" style="s2">know we&#39;re all there</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.519" end="00:11:32.959" style="s2">purposefully working on something um in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">you know working on the project itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.959" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">or related projects that help</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">um grow and create the culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.320" end="00:11:41.600" style="s2">um so yeah for the first little while</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:43.680" style="s2">it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.600" end="00:11:45.600" style="s2">it&#39;ll be quite small but it&#39;ll grow over</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.680" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">time there&#39;s there&#39;s a point to this i</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.600" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">think is worth illustrating here that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">wasn&#39;t quite included in the video which</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">is the storytelling and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">the kind of we want to build a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:56.959" style="s2">documentary</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:58.079" style="s2">around this and then do more of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.959" end="00:11:59.600" style="s2">types of project and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.079" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">projects in the region and then around</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.600" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">the world yeah so we want to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.440" end="00:12:04.720" style="s2">what works and what doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:05.920" style="s2">document our failures and successes as</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.720" end="00:12:09.040" style="s2">we go forward</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.920" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">get a series of of either a web episode</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">or some sort of netflix</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:14.560" style="s2">series going and um so that&#39;s why i put</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">so much effort into the the initial</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.560" end="00:12:18.000" style="s2">video and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:18.959" style="s2">the selling of this idea out there</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.000" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.959" end="00:12:22.320" style="s2">i think that&#39;s going to play a big role</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:24.399" style="s2">in inspiring people that want to do this</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.320" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">thing themselves to start more of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.399" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">villages yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:29.600" style="s2">and the idea is not to uh create this as</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:31.279" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.600" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">this is the ultimate thing more like</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.279" end="00:12:35.839" style="s2">this is a testing ground</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:37.040" style="s2">and here&#39;s what works for us here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.839" end="00:12:38.320" style="s2">here&#39;s what worked and here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">didn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">uh people everywhere in the world can</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:45.440" style="s2">apply these same principles to start</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:47.279" style="s2">villages of their own rather than having</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.440" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">like this is the ultimate retreat center</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.279" end="00:12:51.519" style="s2">that you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:53.440" style="s2">you know come to uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.519" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">right so you&#39;re leading the way uh and</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.440" end="00:12:57.519" style="s2">by example and as an experiment and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">test to see what works</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.519" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">um and hopefully inspire other people um</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:02.959" style="s2">have you taken</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:04.240" style="s2">inspiration from any existing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.959" end="00:13:07.760" style="s2">intentional communities</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.240" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">uh current or prior um individuals</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.760" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">we&#39;re paying a lot of attention to we</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">started a regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:15.680" style="s2">smart village series on the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">and we&#39;ve interviewed a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.680" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">who are doing really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.240" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">projects of their own</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">not exactly the same model but some</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">similar crossover elements</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">i would say that we&#39;ve also taken</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">negative inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:30.959" style="s2">from existing eco villages like on what</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">not to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.959" end="00:13:34.320" style="s2">and this is where we saw an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">to do something different</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.320" end="00:13:37.440" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ve the feeling that i get looking</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">at it</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.440" end="00:13:40.399" style="s2">we don&#39;t we haven&#39;t been to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:42.639" style="s2">different smart villages but the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.399" end="00:13:43.839" style="s2">i get generally from our research</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.639" end="00:13:45.760" style="s2">is that there are a lot of people kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.839" end="00:13:49.199" style="s2">of escaping</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.760" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">um either technology or society</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.199" end="00:13:55.040" style="s2">or the impending apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">like any number of things people there</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.040" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">seems to be this escapist attitude and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">that&#39;s not what we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">we want to figure out ways to template a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:05.839" style="s2">different way of living</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">and also some sort of new culture</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.839" end="00:14:09.839" style="s2">uh because that&#39;s going to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">the founding seed that everything else</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.839" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">blossoms from</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:15.199" style="s2">so culture is a and the ability to be in</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:16.480" style="s2">relation</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.199" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">which is essentially what you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.480" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">doing here in in the stoa like</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:21.680" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be a very critical part</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.680" end="00:14:26.639" style="s2">and what is the sort of the sourcing</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:28.839" style="s2">application onboarding process like for</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.639" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">people who want to live in this smart</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.839" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">village</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:33.680" style="s2">well we&#39;re working through a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:35.920" style="s2">details i mean there are so</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.680" end="00:14:37.519" style="s2">many so many moving parts we don&#39;t only</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.920" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">been back in canada since march so</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.519" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to figure out we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">exactly know what the onboarding process</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:44.639" style="s2">is and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:46.959" style="s2">i don&#39;t think there&#39;s an easy way</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.639" end="00:14:47.839" style="s2">to figure out how well we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.959" end="00:14:49.519" style="s2">gel with people</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.839" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">and how well how much people can</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.519" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">contribute until they&#39;re actually on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">property</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">staying there for a short term period of</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">time and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">working how they they can contribute so</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">it&#39;s been an emergent process and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:03.760" style="s2">learning process so</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:07.040" style="s2">pretty transparent about is that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to do this</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.040" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">we&#39;re figuring it out as we go and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:13.279" style="s2">think that&#39;s really exciting</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">and like we&#39;re kind of approaching it as</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.279" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">a startup you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">startup mentality like it&#39;s okay to fail</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">and we know that you know we&#39;ll figure</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">out a lot of things as we go</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.320" end="00:15:25.600" style="s2">so yeah but as far as people coming on i</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.600" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna try and expand one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">first projects we&#39;re gonna do is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:34.079" style="s2">make a bit of an rv park so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">have more people coming on so we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.079" end="00:15:38.399" style="s2">have higher</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">uh levels of accommodation and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.399" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">people can test it out and then there</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:41.519" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">more structures and there&#39;ll be more</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.519" end="00:15:45.199" style="s2">spots for more permanent dwellings over</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.199" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">but for the first little while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.800" end="00:15:51.519" style="s2">focusing on people who are</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:53.519" style="s2">um entrepreneurial to you know in order</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.519" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">to build a culture and build out the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:59.600" style="s2">and and kind of inject a lot of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">but also the ability to execute on those</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:04.399" style="s2">yeah for that documentary i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.440" end="00:16:07.120" style="s2">a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.399" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">kind of like artistic experiment to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.120" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">along with this project</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">are you going to release it in segments</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:11.839" style="s2">you&#39;re going to release like a whole big</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:13.279" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.839" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">well generally when you&#39;re pitching to</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.279" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">netflix or any of these kind of bigger</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">stations you need a pilot you probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:22.480" style="s2">want a couple of episodes</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">and then you pitch that idea ongoing for</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.480" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">a period of time until you get picked up</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:29.440" style="s2">and funded to do a whole season</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">so i love the idea of focusing on a web</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.440" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">series</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">and just having no finite end</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">to that and then as we collect as we</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:39.199" style="s2">make more episodes then just be pitching</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">all along</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.199" end="00:16:42.480" style="s2">yeah and mike&#39;s background is in in film</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:44.480" style="s2">and audio</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.480" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">so he&#39;s got connections to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.480" end="00:16:50.240" style="s2">people working in the industry so</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:53.519" style="s2">yeah super cool</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.240" end="00:16:53.519" style="s2">you had a question on governance</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.000" end="00:16:57.279" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.440" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">where is he here ryan campbell</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.279" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">okay i&#39;ll read it on his behalf then um</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">what will governance or decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:11.600" style="s2">hierarchies look like do you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">protocols or software to help</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.600" end="00:17:17.439" style="s2">facilitate a social cohesion cohesion</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.959" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">yeah that is something we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.439" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">developing a good amount of experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">with with our group calls in the last</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:25.199" style="s2">um and we&#39;re very we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:28.640" style="s2">sticklers for</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.199" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">minimum minimum hierarchy and minimum</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:31.360" style="s2">rules</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:33.200" style="s2">and a lot of the time in those group</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:33.520" style="s2">calls people will call for more rules</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.520" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">we resist that like let&#39;s figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">to build our interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">uh conflict resolution abilities so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:46.160" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to account with a rule set</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">for every possible</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.160" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">disagreement or problem let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:53.120" style="s2">figure out how to get good at</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:53.840" style="s2">being in disagreement and resolving it</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.120" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.840" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">i i intend and so the short answer is no</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:04.559" style="s2">kind of governance structures we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:06.160" style="s2">uh right now the way things are set up</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:07.039" style="s2">is that there&#39;s a company that will own</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.160" end="00:18:09.679" style="s2">the land</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.039" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">and so the actual hard assets and a</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.679" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">degree of the voting rights will be</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">represented through</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:18.080" style="s2">certain types of shares in the company</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:19.679" style="s2">which different people will um yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.080" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">we don&#39;t exactly have that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.679" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">perfectly laid out but there will be</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">different shares that represent decision</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:27.600" style="s2">making and you might not care about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:30.320" style="s2">decision making of every aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">the village you might have a specific</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.320" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">areas</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.960" end="00:18:34.000" style="s2">of expertise so we&#39;re hoping to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:35.679" style="s2">represent that</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.000" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">and because we&#39;re starting with a small</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.679" end="00:18:40.160" style="s2">number of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">the uh the governance structure of just</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">like we sit in a circle and we talk it</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">out until we arrive at a conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">and until we&#39;re on the same page that</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:52.000" style="s2">i think it&#39;ll be sufficient for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">first while as the village grows and as</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.000" end="00:18:55.280" style="s2">there are more decision makers and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:57.039" style="s2">different projects</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.280" end="00:18:58.720" style="s2">then we will work out what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.039" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">decision-making structures</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.720" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">work best for that that scenario the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">other thing is we&#39;re pretty aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:06.160" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:07.200" style="s2">natural human tendency to create</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.160" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">bureaucracies</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">like it&#39;s something we are contending</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:12.640" style="s2">with in our group calls anyway with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">demand</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2">to create rules and we&#39;re very resistant</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">to that so</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.280" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">in that sense yeah i think i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.480" end="00:19:22.480" style="s2">good at that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">we&#39;ll just keep doing what we&#39;re doing i</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.480" end="00:19:26.080" style="s2">think it&#39;s working um but there will be</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.120" end="00:19:27.760" style="s2">times where there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.080" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">disagreement so i think what we might</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.760" end="00:19:32.000" style="s2">end up doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">is is having between uv and i uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.000" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">slightly higher amount of voting shares</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">so that we can swing it if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:39.360" style="s2">stalemate we can swing it in either</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:40.400" style="s2">direction and we&#39;re pretty good with</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.360" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">decision making like</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.400" end="00:19:43.600" style="s2">we can make fast decisions and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">really split down the middle then</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.600" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">fine we&#39;ll break the tie</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:50.160" style="s2">i just had this vision of like it</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.640" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">becoming jersey shore with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.160" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">documentary series and then the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:58.240" style="s2">disagreements are like amplified</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">drawings yeah i&#39;m yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.240" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">i pay a lot of attention the story</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:22.480" style="s2">really not want to do that so</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">let&#39;s have real conversations recorded</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:48.480" style="s2">across the borders i&#39;m not familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:51.840" style="s2">the like how taxes work or</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.480" end="00:21:53.200" style="s2">um if that&#39;s an issue well we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.840" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">the digital nomad thing for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.200" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">years so</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:58.480" style="s2">we kind of know our way around that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:22:00.240" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.480" end="00:22:02.080" style="s2">you know one thing we one situation we</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.240" end="00:22:04.640" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have is for people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.080" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">income to be completely dependent on us</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.640" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">on the property and on the business um</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.840" end="00:22:11.520" style="s2">just because that sets up some pretty</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:14.559" style="s2">gross dynamics over time where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.520" end="00:22:14.559" style="s2">there there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">super dependency that that i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.760" end="00:22:19.840" style="s2">is unhealthy</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.559" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ve been there before too and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.840" end="00:22:25.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really not healthy mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:27.200" style="s2">yeah so as far as immigration and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.280" end="00:22:28.799" style="s2">kind of thing um we expect people to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.200" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">figure that out on their own</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.799" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">like we we generally are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.440" end="00:22:35.039" style="s2">people who are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:37.520" style="s2">uh self-sufficient self-starters you</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.039" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">know can can figure things out</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.520" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">um so we do have some americans that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">planning to come</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:48.720" style="s2">and they are navigating that process</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">by themselves um but for the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.720" end="00:22:55.039" style="s2">yeah and actually one brit so</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.840" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">yeah you know what actually he&#39;s here um</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.039" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">uh daniel if you want to pipe up with</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.200" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">any of your progress with that you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">you also kind of make it obvious to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">now that we need to have like a resource</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:06.960" style="s2">page or something for immigration</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.880" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">um but yeah as far as the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.960" end="00:23:10.640" style="s2">self-employment goes</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">i mean you can be on a tourist visa for</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.640" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">a good</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:14.960" style="s2">length of time and i think you by</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">default get a six-month visa if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.960" end="00:23:19.120" style="s2">an american coming into</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:20.720" style="s2">canada something along those lines so</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.120" end="00:23:23.440" style="s2">six months out of the year i think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.720" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">it&#39;s permitted so there&#39;s there there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.440" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">a way to do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">at the beginning as far as like super</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:29.679" style="s2">long-term permanent stay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">something you got to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:32.960" style="s2">but i think yeah that&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">should do is put up an immigration</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.960" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">page somewhere yeah and right now with</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:39.360" style="s2">covid</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">um borders are closed so unless</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.360" end="00:23:43.440" style="s2">yeah people coming in from other</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">countries would have to have a good</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.440" end="00:23:49.360" style="s2">precedent to be here</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">in the eyes of immigration anyway yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.360" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">cool louise you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.520" end="00:24:01.039" style="s2">hi yeah i was wondering uh what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.480" end="00:24:03.520" style="s2">capital requirements or budget will be</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.039" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">anticipated to build all the common</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.520" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">space projects you propose in the video</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.840" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">ranging from</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">the event center to the new dwellings to</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.080" end="00:24:13.919" style="s2">maker&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:15.679" style="s2">space to the road well a fortunate</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.919" end="00:24:16.559" style="s2">benefit of the documentary is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.679" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.559" end="00:24:19.440" style="s2">and the podcast and the events and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:20.640" style="s2">everything that we&#39;re doing is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.440" end="00:24:24.799" style="s2">lot of space</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.640" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">for um sponsorship so</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.799" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">what and we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">experience with sponsorships as well so</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.600" end="00:24:30.559" style="s2">i anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:31.679" style="s2">that a lot of the maker space will be</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.559" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">funded through sponsorships and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.679" end="00:24:34.640" style="s2">donations</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">and we actually have a partner already</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.640" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">on the team who does that who kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">travels around and sets up maker spaces</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">and innovation centers he&#39;s already done</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:44.559" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:45.760" style="s2">in caslow so he knows how to do that so</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.559" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">we&#39;re probably going to use him as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.760" end="00:24:48.880" style="s2">resource</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">for that then when it comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.880" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">individual properties well maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:54.799" style="s2">want to take that</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;re currently in negotiations</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.799" end="00:25:00.240" style="s2">with several companies that do</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">building prefab construction and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.240" end="00:25:03.360" style="s2">sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">so we will have more information about</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.360" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">the specific costs</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">soon um as far as what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">looking to raise to start is 2 million</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">canadian and that&#39;s to acquire the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">property and do some updates</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:18.080" style="s2">but that&#39;s not to build build out</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">everything that&#39;s in the video that will</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.080" end="00:25:22.640" style="s2">probably be over several years and will</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">require more funding and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.640" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">give a specific number of how much that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:27.120" style="s2">will cost well our priority in the first</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.120" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">is definitely at least four new uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:37.039" style="s2">dwellings for just couples um so</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">probably not ideal for families but</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.039" end="00:25:40.720" style="s2">you know you would get like a single</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">kind of geodesic dome or something that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.720" end="00:25:43.919" style="s2">you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">move into and stay on um we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.919" end="00:25:49.039" style="s2">at prefab</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.360" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">houses cabins geodesic domes tiny homes</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.039" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">like different options</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:53.840" style="s2">the other thing that&#39;s worth mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">is the existing owners of the property</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.840" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">uh own and or they operate uh a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.840" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">timber framing company so they make</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">timber frame homes</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:07.600" style="s2">and they have typically</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">shipped them across throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.600" end="00:26:12.640" style="s2">states and canada</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:13.440" style="s2">but they their mill is less than five</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.640" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">minutes drive</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.440" end="00:26:17.120" style="s2">away from the property um and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">already got a lot of experience building</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.120" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">they&#39;ve um</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">on the property they&#39;ve built a number</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">of structures on the property already so</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:24.960" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be a great resource for</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">us for building and for keeping the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.960" end="00:26:29.279" style="s2">costs down</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2">and that also keeps it local you know it</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.279" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">solves a lot of the supply chain issues</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">that a lot of companies have seen with</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">covid because all the materials are</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">local</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:39.600" style="s2">labor is local but even with like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">geodesic domes</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.600" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">there&#39;s so much opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.880" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">sponsorships because suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:46.559" style="s2">you know if we have a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:47.840" style="s2">different types of dwellings they become</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.559" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">the showroom</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.840" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">for these companies to use they can send</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:53.919" style="s2">their people there they can be included</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:55.679" style="s2">in the documentary</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.919" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">series like there&#39;s a lot of exposure</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.679" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">that they get for just donating those</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:02.880" style="s2">materials to us so yeah we&#39;re looking to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">leverage a lot of different partnerships</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.880" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">to make this happen</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">yeah and then to tag on a question</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">uh i was wondering what the current</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">infrastructure is for that</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:16.559" style="s2">like plot of land like internet fiber</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">electricity water phone all those sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.559" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:22.720" style="s2">like modern um</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s been run as a organic</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.720" end="00:27:27.120" style="s2">farm since the 90s at least</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">it already has three houses on it which</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.120" end="00:27:31.520" style="s2">are fully functional and fully renovated</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">uh it has a bunch of barns and different</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.520" end="00:27:36.240" style="s2">structures for animals you know fencing</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:38.640" style="s2">it has three wells and three septic</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.240" end="00:27:41.360" style="s2">tanks one for each house</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.640" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">it&#39;s uh it has a grid connection but it</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.360" end="00:27:46.799" style="s2">also has two bays of solar panels</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:50.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s uh it produces its own energy</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.799" end="00:27:50.559" style="s2">and then it doesn&#39;t have batteries so at</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.080" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">night</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.559" end="00:27:55.360" style="s2">it will buy energy back from the grid</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">and it ends up being that they basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.360" end="00:27:58.880" style="s2">pay very little at all if at all for</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:02.640" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">over the year so um and we we</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.640" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">will probably look at at getting</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">batteries so that we can be completely</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">off-grid optional</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:11.679" style="s2">um but yeah it&#39;s already set up fully</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">and fully functional</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:14.840" style="s2">as far as internet it currently has a</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:18.480" style="s2">dish</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.880" end="00:28:34.000" style="s2">and it&#39;ll just cost us but that&#39;s within</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:34.000" style="s2">the budget</p>

<p begin="00:29:14.559" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">thoughts on eventually issuing your own</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">digital currency or utilizing crypto or</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.880" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">blockchain technology</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:26.240" style="s2">yes love that idea we&#39;ve had so many</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">people ask us that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.240" end="00:29:31.279" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve made a coin of my own just</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">for fun that&#39;s out there on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.279" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">blockchain don&#39;t go looking for it</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.360" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">really not a good investment um but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:40.080" style="s2">we thought about that because of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:42.720" style="s2">flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.080" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">and the programmability of uh using a</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.720" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">cryptocurrency on the property we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.399" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.880" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">i mean i know that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:50.799" style="s2">civilizations in the past and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">communities in the past have</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.799" end="00:29:55.520" style="s2">eventually created their own currency</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:29:56.880" style="s2">the with the technology that we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.520" end="00:29:58.559" style="s2">access to now there&#39;s a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:30:00.799" style="s2">flexibility so i&#39;m excited about that</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">idea but is it a necessity for the first</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.799" end="00:30:04.559" style="s2">year or two</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">no um but i i love the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.559" end="00:30:08.320" style="s2">everything having</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">of having an economy inside of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.320" end="00:30:12.880" style="s2">village and in</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:14.960" style="s2">to that like to an extent</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.880" end="00:30:16.159" style="s2">the entire region of the kootenays i</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">think that&#39;d be really cool</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.159" end="00:30:20.399" style="s2">i think for for the network aspect that</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:22.399" style="s2">would be really great um to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.399" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">some sort of a token that is used across</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.399" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">these types of villages all over the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.840" end="00:30:26.559" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.559" end="00:30:28.240" style="s2">yeah where you know people can trade</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.559" end="00:30:30.000" style="s2">accommodations kind of have programs</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.240" end="00:30:30.799" style="s2">where you go visit each other and learn</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.000" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">things or</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.799" end="00:30:34.799" style="s2">use each other&#39;s services yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:35.600" style="s2">definitely opportunity for that it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.799" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">just be</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.600" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">sometime down the road if anyone here</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:42.080" style="s2">has expertise on that actually that</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">would be great reach out to me privately</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.080" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">we&#39;ll chat very cool</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">okay um anna you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:56.240" style="s2">you can unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">there you go oh we&#39;re playing mute tag</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.760" end="00:31:06.960" style="s2">there you go</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:10.240" style="s2">hi um i&#39;m fascinated with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.960" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">and at the same time i&#39;m aware of so</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.240" end="00:31:15.600" style="s2">many other experiments</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:17.919" style="s2">in this field um</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.600" end="00:31:19.279" style="s2">so i&#39;m very interested in how do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.919" end="00:31:22.320" style="s2">differ</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.279" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">also the villages in italy</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.320" end="00:31:25.519" style="s2">which are empty and they are very</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:29.120" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.519" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">so so why not take over a village</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.120" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">already existing</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">well we we&#39;re not trying to be the only</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">one out there we&#39;re not trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:38.640" style="s2">competitive dynamics against other smart</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.440" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">villages</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.640" end="00:31:43.360" style="s2">so we had i mean we spent four or five</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:45.039" style="s2">years in bulgaria</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:46.480" style="s2">and have traveled around europe quite</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.039" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">extensively so we know about those</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.480" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">abandoned villages all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">well i&#39;m bulgarian by the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:56.159" style="s2">oh oh great yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:58.559" style="s2">nasty we</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.159" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">we decided that we would like to set</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.559" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">this up in our home country where our</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:05.919" style="s2">family lives</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">but i think that people in different</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.919" end="00:32:08.640" style="s2">countries</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">around the world can use the different</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.640" end="00:32:12.399" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:14.880" style="s2">you know infrastructure and and land and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.399" end="00:32:16.799" style="s2">zoning and whatever that suits to each</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.880" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">region and i think that&#39;s the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.799" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">it you know there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:22.559" style="s2">sort of different opportunities in every</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.840" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">area that people should be utilizing</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.559" end="00:32:26.000" style="s2">bulgaria has a huge advantage i mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:27.279" style="s2">they have entire villages that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.000" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">completely abandoned and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.279" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">people are saying in italy exactly</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:35.120" style="s2">um and i mean you can get your hands on</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">property on on an existing structure for</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.120" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">only a couple of thousand dollars so</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">it&#39;s uh it&#39;s attractive and there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:41.440" style="s2">of opportunity all over the world for</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.440" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">type of thing yeah we&#39;re kind of taking</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">a difficult route because canada is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:48.080" style="s2">little more expensive and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">so mobile we could do this in mexico or</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">we could do it in bulgaria or something</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:54.159" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:56.799" style="s2">um it needs to be feasible anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.159" end="00:32:59.679" style="s2">i think this is like this is a a new way</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.799" end="00:33:01.600" style="s2">that human civilization could live</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">and so we&#39;re you know i recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.600" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">there are some things that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.960" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">that are not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:09.519" style="s2">replicable for other people you know not</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">everyone has a podcast that they can</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.519" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">offer sponsorship on</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:14.640" style="s2">and get a bunch of free stuff so and not</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.640" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">might have the ability to crowdfund</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">something like this</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">but a lot of families do have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:22.880" style="s2">ability to</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">put their connections together pool</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.880" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">their resources and then buy it by at</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">least some</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:30.559" style="s2">level of acreage acreage and do</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">something like this themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.559" end="00:33:33.039" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of little bits and pieces</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">that you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.039" end="00:33:36.880" style="s2">do yourself and that&#39;s what we hope to</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.960" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">inspire people to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.880" end="00:33:40.320" style="s2">as far as what we&#39;re doing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:41.120" style="s2">different uh well we&#39;re integrating</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:42.960" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.960" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">definitely different</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:47.519" style="s2">um some of the ecovillages that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">looked at</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.519" end="00:33:50.559" style="s2">uh are trying to run away from</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.559" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">we don&#39;t see technology as evil or you</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:56.559" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:57.519" style="s2">bad somehow we want to integrate it just</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.559" end="00:33:59.919" style="s2">in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.519" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">technology should be serving human</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.919" end="00:34:04.840" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">and the bioregion and be out of the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.840" end="00:34:09.520" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.159" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">what else are we doing that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.520" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">well we&#39;re integrating a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">aspects like the self personal</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">development is really big for us</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">and we are very developmentally focused</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">rather than trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">to um present some sort of an ideology</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:27.440" style="s2">or some sort of perfect way of living</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:29.440" style="s2">that people need to follow</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">or you know institute some sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.440" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">religion or utopia</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.280" end="00:34:35.040" style="s2">or you know specific political structure</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:37.679" style="s2">we&#39;re very experimental</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.040" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">um we&#39;re kind of agnostic in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.679" end="00:34:40.639" style="s2">we just want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:42.079" style="s2">try different stuff and see what works i</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:44.879" style="s2">kind of like the idea of the burgundy</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.079" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">robes that we might just do that but</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.879" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s been a running joke</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">because everyone thinks we&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:52.639" style="s2">commune or a cult or something</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:54.480" style="s2">not everyone but once in a while we we</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.639" end="00:34:56.720" style="s2">do get people like oh so is this a</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.480" end="00:34:57.920" style="s2">religious thing or is it a commune</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.720" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">it&#39;s just like you know people have</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:01.760" style="s2">their own associations that they they</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">come up with based on what they&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.760" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve just started joking around</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.839" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">with these purple robes like you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:09.359" style="s2">the when you come and visit in the in</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">the visiting suite we&#39;ll have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.359" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">bathrobes be purple</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:20.000" style="s2">just as an inside joke cool</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">um emily hi</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.000" end="00:35:23.520" style="s2">um exciting to be here and hear about</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:26.560" style="s2">all of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.520" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">um my question is around</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.560" end="00:35:32.720" style="s2">like initial investment like are you</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:35.119" style="s2">like if i wanted to come up there and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.720" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">join would i be renting a space or</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.119" end="00:35:38.400" style="s2">are you gonna open it up for people</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">buying land</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.400" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">are they gonna buy land are they just</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:45.920" style="s2">gonna buy a structure like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s your legally the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.920" end="00:35:49.599" style="s2">path that&#39;s the most straightforward is</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">to be looking for loans from our</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.599" end="00:35:54.240" style="s2">community to be able to buy the property</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:55.920" style="s2">and then there will be multiple</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.240" end="00:35:57.920" style="s2">different types of businesses</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.920" end="00:35:59.599" style="s2">on the structure and hopefully people</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.920" end="00:36:02.560" style="s2">who come to move there will also</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.599" end="00:36:03.599" style="s2">start their own businesses um so there</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.560" end="00:36:06.480" style="s2">are going to be different</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.599" end="00:36:08.640" style="s2">investment opportunities in the future</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.480" end="00:36:10.079" style="s2">that said if people are loaning us</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.640" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">money there are a lot of perks that</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.079" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of bringing into that like</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">if you want to rent or stay on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:17.119" style="s2">property or lease something for an</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:17.839" style="s2">extended period of time you would get a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.119" end="00:36:19.599" style="s2">discount</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.839" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">if you&#39;re one of the original lenders</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.599" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">and first priority because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">actually been</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:25.760" style="s2">kind of an overwhelming demand for um</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:28.160" style="s2">first stays</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.760" end="00:36:29.280" style="s2">at the property yeah short especially</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:30.560" style="s2">long term stays</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.280" end="00:36:33.200" style="s2">so we&#39;re trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.560" end="00:36:35.839" style="s2">manage that and how to prioritize</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.200" end="00:36:37.680" style="s2">um yeah how to give those perks to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.839" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">people that help us fund the initial</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">round</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">it&#39;s also a good filter mechanism too to</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">do the loaning</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:45.520" style="s2">instead of the initial investor like to</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:47.760" style="s2">give equity away</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.520" end="00:36:48.640" style="s2">for the company that owns the land so</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.760" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:51.359" style="s2">because we&#39;re going to be living near</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:52.839" style="s2">each other all the time so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.359" end="00:36:55.599" style="s2">make sure there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.839" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">functional you know it&#39;s not that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.599" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">looking for a certain culture or a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:01.119" style="s2">certain type of person we want diversity</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:03.280" style="s2">of ideas but</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.119" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">how good are people at conflict</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.280" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">resolution</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:08.400" style="s2">like i want to i want to learn that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:10.960" style="s2">about people very quickly um</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.400" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">and that yeah how good are they at</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.960" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">collaborating</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">yeah and these are things that are very</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:17.280" style="s2">hard to each other teach i think and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.280" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">a priority for us to like build people</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">up from scratch like there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:26.640" style="s2">something you can come into this with</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">the set of skills and abilities that</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.640" end="00:37:31.839" style="s2">will prioritize yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:32.880" style="s2">so the it would be a loan the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.839" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">working with some people</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.880" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">is that they&#39;re loaning a larger chunk</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">of money and then we&#39;re figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.839" end="00:37:41.200" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:41.920" style="s2">the equity would look like in the future</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.200" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.920" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">a portion of that loan would convert</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:47.920" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:49.119" style="s2">uh equity in the company that owns the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.920" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">land which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.119" end="00:37:52.800" style="s2">similar to like a community land trust</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:54.480" style="s2">except it&#39;s owned by a company</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.800" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a more simple version of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.480" end="00:37:57.599" style="s2">because we&#39;ve looked at doing a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:37:58.320" style="s2">community land trust and talked to some</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.599" end="00:38:00.320" style="s2">people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.320" end="00:38:02.480" style="s2">actually successfully set it up it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.320" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">very lengthy process a lot of red tape</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.480" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">and you know we have a friend who spent</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">half a million dollars on lawyer fees</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">and several years just to set up this</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.359" end="00:38:12.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:14.000" style="s2">co-op ownership structure so it&#39;s within</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.880" end="00:38:14.800" style="s2">the current system it&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.000" end="00:38:16.800" style="s2">nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.800" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">so we&#39;re looking at simpler structures</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.800" end="00:38:21.599" style="s2">that kind of carry the same purpose</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:22.320" style="s2">yeah so a company that would own that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.599" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">would have</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.320" end="00:38:25.760" style="s2">would own the assets own the land and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.760" end="00:38:29.440" style="s2">has one singular business focus which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:31.920" style="s2">essentially like</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.440" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">renting and leasing the property or be</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.920" end="00:38:36.079" style="s2">almost like a real estate developer</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:37.920" style="s2">which is something we&#39;re exploring so</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.079" end="00:38:38.640" style="s2">that seems to me just to be the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.920" end="00:38:40.960" style="s2">route</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.640" end="00:38:42.480" style="s2">so essentially people would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.960" end="00:38:43.040" style="s2">forgive a portion of their loan in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.480" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.040" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">if the rest of the community agrees</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">um be able to convert a portion of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:53.839" style="s2">into equity</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">so my just a quick follow-up question</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.839" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">like my</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:38:58.560" style="s2">my my approach would be i would want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.280" end="00:39:02.000" style="s2">come up and stay</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.560" end="00:39:03.599" style="s2">for a chunk of time and field</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:05.359" style="s2">out the land and you know i live in</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.599" end="00:39:06.880" style="s2">santa cruz right now so this is also</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.359" end="00:39:10.320" style="s2">like a jump in latitude</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.880" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">um but yeah so to so</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.320" end="00:39:17.599" style="s2">when are you guys opening it up for</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:21.280" style="s2">uh people to come and stay for months or</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.599" end="00:39:23.359" style="s2">how yeah how is that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.280" end="00:39:25.040" style="s2">uh well we&#39;re we&#39;re planning on doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.359" end="00:39:27.760" style="s2">renovations we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.040" end="00:39:29.040" style="s2">living there by about the end of october</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.760" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">or november so we&#39;re going to spend the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.040" end="00:39:31.680" style="s2">winter there</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be doing renovations on</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.680" end="00:39:34.560" style="s2">the big house and</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">actually pretty much all of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.560" end="00:39:40.839" style="s2">structures there and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.200" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">hopefully setting up new structures for</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.839" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">visitors</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:45.520" style="s2">making some space for rvs to park</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">because a lot of people have expressed</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.520" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">interest in coming up in an rv and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">staying here for a while</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">so uh that will be a priority creating</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.599" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">some structures</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:57.040" style="s2">and spaces so that people can come and</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">visit for shorter periods of time to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.040" end="00:39:59.359" style="s2">feel it out and get to know everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.359" end="00:40:03.040" style="s2">if it&#39;s a good fit for them and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:06.319" style="s2">initial lenders really there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.040" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">couple that wants is is we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:09.680" style="s2">with right now about the loan structure</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">in the equity structure and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.680" end="00:40:13.200" style="s2">want to come as soon as possible and are</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.839" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">totally happy to be living there through</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.200" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">the winter so</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:19.119" style="s2">there is space i mean we have we</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:22.720" style="s2">definitely have the space for that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.119" end="00:40:24.480" style="s2">awesome thank you thanks</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.720" end="00:40:25.760" style="s2">david chilcott you had a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.480" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">questions if you can ask</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.760" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">one of them</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:38.800" style="s2">um so i&#39;m most interested</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:41.280" style="s2">in kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.800" end="00:40:42.800" style="s2">what you&#39;ve just been talking about uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.280" end="00:40:46.000" style="s2">kind of about the equity</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.800" end="00:40:50.480" style="s2">slash loan slash business structures</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.000" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">um and the relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.480" end="00:40:55.520" style="s2">ownership equity and decision making</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:57.119" style="s2">um it&#39;s not really a well-formed</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.520" end="00:41:00.240" style="s2">question but i&#39;d love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.119" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">a little more about how</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">the formal and the informal structures</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">align</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:09.520" style="s2">um other than what we&#39;ve already said</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.760" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">we&#39;re still working out the details</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.520" end="00:41:15.440" style="s2">because uh a big part of this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:16.400" style="s2">kind of letting it emerge in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.440" end="00:41:18.800" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.400" end="00:41:20.240" style="s2">for the people that are co-creating it</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.800" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">with us so</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.240" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">rather than having this like we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">it all figured out and we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.280" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">perfect top-down structure that</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">everybody plugs into</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">we&#39;re see we&#39;re saying it like no like</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:31.119" style="s2">the people who are coming and</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:32.720" style="s2">co-creating it with us</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.119" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">who are going to be stakeholders why</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.720" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">don&#39;t we just figure out what works</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:38.480" style="s2">between us like as as humans as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:40.800" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.480" end="00:41:42.480" style="s2">and so it&#39;s been working out well so far</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.800" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned a lot and figured out a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.480" end="00:41:45.760" style="s2">lot of the questions that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:47.680" style="s2">that were kind of unclear or that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.760" end="00:41:49.440" style="s2">were thinking about differently before</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.680" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">and after talking to people we realized</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.440" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">actually oh it&#39;s going to be better to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.960" end="00:41:54.079" style="s2">do it this way</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s really a changing it&#39;s a living</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.079" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:41:59.839" style="s2">it&#39;s not a static thing so yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:03.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve said so far is our current way of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.839" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">thinking as it evolves more and as we</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.040" end="00:42:08.240" style="s2">you know put things into contracts then</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">we will you know put out some updates in</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.240" end="00:42:10.800" style="s2">the future but</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:12.240" style="s2">for now this is where we&#39;re where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.800" end="00:42:15.280" style="s2">at yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">that makes good sense to me the idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.280" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">rather than have policies or rules as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">substitute for conversation that you get</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">skillful</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:28.800" style="s2">at having meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">authentic conversation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.800" end="00:42:32.560" style="s2">um one of the things that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">doing recently so um we have an online</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.560" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:37.119" style="s2">and uh in our online community this</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:39.520" style="s2">month we have a theme</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.119" end="00:42:40.960" style="s2">of indigenous wisdom so we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:42.160" style="s2">reading a bunch of books and having a</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.960" end="00:42:44.160" style="s2">bunch of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:46.480" style="s2">and doing podcast episodes around that</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.160" end="00:42:48.000" style="s2">theme and um</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.480" end="00:42:49.839" style="s2">you know just kind of noticing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">differences between the</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.839" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">indigenous mindset and the western</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">mindset western mindset is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">hyperstructured like everything has to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.280" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">be figured out and everything has to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">based on rules</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:02.160" style="s2">and people because they are so reliant</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">on rules they actually end up being</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.160" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">really out of touch with reality with</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening now</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:08.800" style="s2">in this moment with these people you</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:11.599" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.800" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">and what&#39;s emerging um and so we want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.599" end="00:43:15.040" style="s2">bring</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:17.280" style="s2">bring back that more of that connected</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.040" end="00:43:18.640" style="s2">mindset of what is actually emerging</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.280" end="00:43:20.480" style="s2">what&#39;s happening like what are the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.640" end="00:43:22.560" style="s2">opportunities and possibilities here</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.480" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">how are things changing just as a result</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.560" end="00:43:27.599" style="s2">of us</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.760" end="00:43:29.599" style="s2">talking here so it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.599" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">sometimes to people but</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:34.240" style="s2">once they get into it they realize that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.240" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">really works and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:40.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t scale</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:42.160" style="s2">which is probably why corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.640" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">you know these big institutions don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.160" end="00:43:47.040" style="s2">use it because it is really reliant on</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:49.119" style="s2">the relationship between two or three or</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.040" end="00:43:51.280" style="s2">you know a small group of people</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.119" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">um but in those kinds of configurations</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.280" end="00:43:54.640" style="s2">i think it works</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">really well and the the more people do</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.640" end="00:44:01.359" style="s2">it the more skillful they get at it</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:44:02.880" style="s2">yeah dunbar&#39;s number about 120-ish</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.359" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">the number of folks you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.880" end="00:44:08.240" style="s2">have connected</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:08.800" style="s2">relationship with yeah and and this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.240" end="00:44:10.480" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">um the earlier question was like how</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.480" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">many people are you gonna have living</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">there this is why we want to cap it at</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:16.240" style="s2">50 adults</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:18.000" style="s2">so that means that there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.240" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">several children and several neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.000" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">that you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">you know close relationships with but</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:26.160" style="s2">there are some books that have been</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">written by people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.160" end="00:44:29.599" style="s2">set up co-housing communities you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:32.000" style="s2">for decades</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.599" end="00:44:34.160" style="s2">all over the world and that&#39;s the number</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">that they came up with 40 to 50 adults</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.160" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">is the max that you want to have in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:38.079" style="s2">co-housing community</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:40.079" style="s2">if you get over that then it starts</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.079" end="00:44:42.400" style="s2">breaking down and there&#39;s just too many</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.079" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">um kind of clashing expectations and</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.400" end="00:44:47.599" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to come to consensus</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:50.720" style="s2">yeah thank you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.599" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">thanks david um i&#39;ll follow up with that</p>

<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:08.319" style="s2">example he has circling embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:10.400" style="s2">their ecology</p>

<p begin="00:45:19.200" end="00:45:21.440" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.920" end="00:45:23.839" style="s2">classes you have like something fixed or</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.440" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">you&#39;re waiting to see what emerges</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.839" end="00:45:30.319" style="s2">we already do uh some version of</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:31.599" style="s2">circling every thursday like it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.319" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">of that same like</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.599" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">that same check-in procedure that you do</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">with circling</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">um checking with yourself checking with</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.160" end="00:45:42.400" style="s2">the room um</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:44.319" style="s2">but the subject is not generally</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.400" end="00:45:45.839" style="s2">constrained to any arena it goes</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.319" end="00:45:46.960" style="s2">wherever it goes wherever we feel like</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.839" end="00:45:48.319" style="s2">bringing it and we might talk about</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.960" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">external events and stuff but we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.319" end="00:45:51.200" style="s2">a lot of practice doing that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:53.040" style="s2">would love to bring that into the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.200" end="00:45:55.599" style="s2">physical space</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.040" end="00:45:56.319" style="s2">it&#39;s basically a form of collective</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.599" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.319" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">yeah and it only works in a small group</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.720" end="00:46:02.240" style="s2">i think 15 is the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.480" end="00:46:03.839" style="s2">number of people that you you can have</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.240" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">until you start</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.839" end="00:46:08.720" style="s2">to break the coherence to me they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:11.200" style="s2">basically two</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:12.720" style="s2">really important schools of thought and</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.200" end="00:46:14.319" style="s2">personal development</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:16.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.319" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">interrelational aspect and then the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.880" end="00:46:20.319" style="s2">solo you know in silent darkness in your</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:22.319" style="s2">room</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.319" end="00:46:23.680" style="s2">kind of work like that meditative or</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.319" end="00:46:26.960" style="s2">psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.680" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">root um so</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:30.079" style="s2">those two things we have quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:32.319" style="s2">experience with</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.079" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">um more so the collective aspect in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.319" end="00:46:35.839" style="s2">last couple of years but</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:37.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve we used to have a meditation app</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:38.079" style="s2">we uv teaches meditation every monday</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.760" end="00:46:39.920" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.079" end="00:46:41.119" style="s2">that&#39;s a big part of our what we do</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.920" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.119" end="00:46:45.359" style="s2">so bringing that into the physical space</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">is pretty natural and easy</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.359" end="00:46:48.560" style="s2">and we plan to invite a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:52.160" style="s2">facilitators as well</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.560" end="00:46:53.440" style="s2">because um you know i think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.160" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">it&#39;s important to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.440" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">different modalities and different</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">perspectives so that it doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.839" end="00:47:01.599" style="s2">centralized</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">um so and there&#39;s already been a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:04.079" style="s2">interest</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:05.920" style="s2">you know from from the people that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.079" end="00:47:07.200" style="s2">previously interviewed on the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.920" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">and just people from my</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.200" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">network who&#39;ve come up and put up their</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:12.560" style="s2">hand and said hey i facilitate this sort</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:13.920" style="s2">of practice or this sort of thing i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.560" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">love to be part of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.920" end="00:47:19.680" style="s2">yeah yeah very cool</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:20.800" style="s2">um so we have about 10 minutes left i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.680" end="00:47:23.920" style="s2">curious how long that</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.800" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">video is like the one with the ariel</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.920" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">do you want to pivot to that sooner sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:30.640" style="s2">yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:32.000" style="s2">four minutes long wow that&#39;s almost the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:33.440" style="s2">exact same length as the other video</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.000" end="00:47:36.720" style="s2">yeah four minutes</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.440" end="00:47:39.920" style="s2">so maybe we&#39;ll feel one more question um</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.720" end="00:47:41.839" style="s2">or how about a statement uh christian</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.920" end="00:47:42.960" style="s2">you had a statement about the</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">interpersonal aspect</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.960" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">would you want to unmute yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:51.119" style="s2">yeah sure um i just wanted to say it</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">feels like the interpersonal aspects</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.119" end="00:47:53.359" style="s2">will be imported considering that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:56.480" style="s2">city</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.359" end="00:47:59.359" style="s2">itself is already hyper individualized</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.480" end="00:48:01.280" style="s2">so it kind of goes back to like peter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.359" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">questions like what are some specific</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.280" end="00:48:04.960" style="s2">things you&#39;ve been working on but i feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">like you guys already touched upon that</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.960" end="00:48:07.760" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.599" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">how is that like aspect really important</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.760" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">to you guys</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:15.119" style="s2">yeah i actually want to expand</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.680" end="00:48:17.359" style="s2">into something that we haven&#39;t talked</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.119" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">about yet from that question</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.359" end="00:48:20.480" style="s2">um so my vision for the long term of</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:23.599" style="s2">this place</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.480" end="00:48:25.920" style="s2">is to have basically a school</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.599" end="00:48:27.680" style="s2">so i&#39;ve been thinking a lot about how</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">children are raised and how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.680" end="00:48:30.720" style="s2">educated</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">you know how we&#39;re basically programmed</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.720" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">by society</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">and i think that it&#39;s not optimal for</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:37.599" style="s2">the kind of world that we&#39;re going into</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.599" end="00:48:42.319" style="s2">suitable for a more stable society for a</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">more stable climate but now that things</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">are becoming more chaotic and things are</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">changing very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">i think people need to be more adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:50.960" style="s2">and more responsive</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">so we need to change our parenting</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">practices and our education practices</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">to to fit that so that you know our</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:48:58.480" style="s2">children and adults can thrive in this</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:49:00.000" style="s2">new world that we&#39;re going into</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.480" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s my vision for the long term</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.000" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">like for the next you know 20 years or</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.440" end="00:49:05.280" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:06.079" style="s2">is um setting up a school and the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">that i see this</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.079" end="00:49:09.359" style="s2">is like how do we make regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:11.760" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">you know we the in the past people have</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.760" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2">talked about sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:17.280" style="s2">as kind of the you know the green</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:18.000" style="s2">approach to how we relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.280" end="00:49:19.520" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.000" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think that&#39;s enough because</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.520" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">sustainability means</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.200" end="00:49:26.800" style="s2">that we are uh maintaining something</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.040" end="00:49:28.160" style="s2">and maybe we&#39;re maintaining things that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.800" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">are not optimal</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.160" end="00:49:31.520" style="s2">so regenerative means restoring</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:33.920" style="s2">ecosystems to health</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.520" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">so you are an ecosystem too you as an</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.920" end="00:49:36.960" style="s2">individual like you are</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:38.559" style="s2">a collection of organs and different</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.960" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">systems that work together</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.559" end="00:49:43.200" style="s2">and then communities and and all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">interrelationships in those communities</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.200" end="00:49:46.559" style="s2">is also an ecosystem and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">the broader ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.559" end="00:49:50.400" style="s2">of the bioregion you know the plants and</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.480" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">animals and natural cycles in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.400" end="00:49:54.000" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">and so the the relationships between</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.000" end="00:49:56.079" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:57.920" style="s2">macro and microsystems are really</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.079" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">important and the relationships within</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.920" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">them are also extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.000" end="00:50:04.480" style="s2">so the health of those relationships is</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">is what makes the whole thing run</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.480" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">so i think that interrelational dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:10.480" style="s2">are absolutely at the core</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">of all of this and not just between</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.480" end="00:50:14.079" style="s2">humans but also</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">in how we relate to ourselves and how we</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.079" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">relate to all the living beings in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.680" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">bioregion</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:24.000" style="s2">so to be more specific um</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">i think a lot of it is emergent a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">is is in the moment while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">relating to each different</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:32.559" style="s2">living thing or system you&#39;re figuring</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:34.400" style="s2">out how to do it optimally i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.559" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a top-down thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.400" end="00:50:40.800" style="s2">so it&#39;s a lot of practice basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.640" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">yeah i hope that answers it and i hope</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.800" end="00:50:45.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not too</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.839" end="00:50:47.119" style="s2">nebulous cool so i&#39;ll ask the last</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.760" end="00:50:47.760" style="s2">question and maybe we can pivot to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.119" end="00:50:49.359" style="s2">video</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.760" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">and a lot of people are dropping so we</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.359" end="00:50:51.839" style="s2">didn&#39;t get to all the questions so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:50:53.280" style="s2">sorry um but a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">dropping advice too in the chat so</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.280" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">if you want to change uh save the chat</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.119" end="00:50:57.359" style="s2">before you guys leave you can do that i</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.480" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.359" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">um or i can send it to you after the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:03.280" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:04.319" style="s2">so the question i had is it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.280" end="00:51:07.280" style="s2">simple um</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.319" end="00:51:08.720" style="s2">what is your uh greatest concerns about</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.280" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">this project things you&#39;re most worried</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:10.880" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:12.800" style="s2">and what are the things you&#39;re most</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.880" end="00:51:15.760" style="s2">excited about</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.800" end="00:51:17.200" style="s2">great question yeah i i would think</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.760" end="00:51:19.520" style="s2">government interference</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.200" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">um we want you know we if here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.520" end="00:51:22.800" style="s2">example we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">doing this tesla car sharing program</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.800" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">because we partnered with another</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:27.440" style="s2">company who already has a fleet of</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">teslas and we were thinking like what</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.440" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">does it cost to actually get one so i</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:32.000" style="s2">looked into buying one</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.240" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">and i found out like the canadian</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:38.160" style="s2">government taxes</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:40.960" style="s2">these sustainable cars with about 12 000</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.160" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">on each purchase so you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.960" end="00:51:43.920" style="s2">lot of lip service when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:46.240" style="s2">government intervention and</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.920" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">and acceptance and help that i think is</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.240" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">not reflective in the taxes</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:51.920" style="s2">and not a reflective in how they</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:54.319" style="s2">actually support programs</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.920" end="00:51:55.359" style="s2">and i think if we got in the way of any</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.319" end="00:51:58.290" style="s2">type of like big</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.359" end="00:51:59.920" style="s2">business we could face some</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.290" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.920" end="00:52:05.359" style="s2">resistance on the other hand we are</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:06.960" style="s2">in talks with the local government i</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.359" end="00:52:09.520" style="s2">mean this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:10.240" style="s2">small town um it&#39;s not a big city so i</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.520" end="00:52:12.480" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.240" end="00:52:13.440" style="s2">um there will be a lot more opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.480" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">to innovate</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.440" end="00:52:17.200" style="s2">and work with the local government and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.680" end="00:52:20.319" style="s2">actually be able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.200" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">adjust the regulations to make this</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.319" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">thing possible and so far it&#39;s been you</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:24.480" style="s2">know the reception of our project has</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:27.440" style="s2">been very positive</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.480" end="00:52:29.839" style="s2">and so there&#39;s actually an another eco</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.440" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">village on vancouver island called ours</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">our eco village or ours eco village um</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:34.720" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.880" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">they&#39;ve been doing this for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.720" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">decades and they&#39;ve worked with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.000" end="00:52:39.520" style="s2">local government</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.880" end="00:52:41.440" style="s2">to actually change um some of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.520" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">regulations to enable that project</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:43.680" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:45.200" style="s2">they have had a very positive effect on</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.680" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">the community so the government sees it</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.200" end="00:52:48.400" style="s2">as a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.079" end="00:52:50.319" style="s2">so i hope to do the same you know to</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.400" end="00:52:52.720" style="s2">establish relationships with the local</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.319" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">structures to make it possible</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.720" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">um as far as what am i most afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">uh or most challenged by</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:06.240" style="s2">you know this is funny but the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">perception of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.240" end="00:53:11.839" style="s2">matters because when people come</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">with a preconceived notion of what this</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.839" end="00:53:14.800" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.640" end="00:53:16.319" style="s2">it changes how they interact again you</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.800" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">know it changes that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.319" end="00:53:19.440" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:21.839" style="s2">so we&#39;ve definitely had some funny</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.440" end="00:53:25.520" style="s2">reactions mostly positive but a few</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.839" end="00:53:28.800" style="s2">funny ones um and so i see that as an</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.520" end="00:53:29.760" style="s2">ongoing challenge that how do we</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.800" end="00:53:32.640" style="s2">storytell</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.760" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">in a way that accurately describes what</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.640" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:39.520" style="s2">and and helps people to understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.880" end="00:53:41.520" style="s2">uh where they fit in in what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.520" end="00:53:44.079" style="s2">and how it affects them</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.520" end="00:53:45.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s part of the reason why we want</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.079" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">to do this documentary</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.440" end="00:53:49.359" style="s2">so that we can you know transparently</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:50.800" style="s2">show what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.359" end="00:53:52.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of the reason why we</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.800" end="00:53:54.880" style="s2">want to create templates</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.880" end="00:53:56.400" style="s2">and document processes for how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.880" end="00:53:58.400" style="s2">doing things so that we can show people</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.400" end="00:54:00.400" style="s2">ah yeah this is how it&#39;s structured</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.400" end="00:54:02.240" style="s2">and you know you can you can learn from</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.400" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">this you can take it or even just like</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.240" end="00:54:04.319" style="s2">if people</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">are not interested in setting it up</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.319" end="00:54:08.640" style="s2">themselves they can see how we do things</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:11.760" style="s2">and why we do things in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.640" end="00:54:13.359" style="s2">so yeah a lot of transparency and uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.760" end="00:54:14.559" style="s2">also inviting people to come out and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.359" end="00:54:16.319" style="s2">stay i mean that&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.559" end="00:54:17.599" style="s2">priority holding a lot of events so that</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.319" end="00:54:18.559" style="s2">people can just come and see it for</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.599" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.559" end="00:54:21.760" style="s2">that it&#39;s not a closed community or you</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:25.359" style="s2">know sex called</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.760" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">sex cult the meta-modern</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.359" end="00:54:31.599" style="s2">wild wild country that&#39;s associated yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">cool um so yeah we have about four</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.599" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">minutes left wanna</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">watch the sure there&#39;s no audio here so</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">we can continue to</p>

<p begin="00:55:14.559" end="00:55:17.839" style="s2">is the dividing line of the property</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.079" end="00:55:18.880" style="s2">we&#39;re facing south now we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.839" end="00:55:21.520" style="s2">north</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.880" end="00:55:24.240" style="s2">um so there&#39;s a southern property that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.520" end="00:55:26.079" style="s2">bigger than the current one</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.240" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">than this one that we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.079" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">potentially acquiring in the future if</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:32.799" style="s2">funding permits you can see there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:32.799" style="s2">lot of farmland</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.119" end="00:55:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s um mostly surrounded by crown land</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.920" end="00:55:39.200" style="s2">which means government on land so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.760" end="00:55:42.240" style="s2">just forest</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.200" end="00:55:44.799" style="s2">um it&#39;s just at the edge of a town</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.240" end="00:55:46.480" style="s2">about five kilometers out of town this</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.799" end="00:55:48.559" style="s2">is the five bedroom house these are the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.480" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">solar panels here there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.559" end="00:55:52.799" style="s2">kennel for dogs</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:55.839" style="s2">uh there&#39;s like kinds of stuff for</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.799" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">having animals and stuff they used to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.839" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">well known in the region for being deer</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">farmers they had hundreds of deer</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">um on the property and then at different</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:05.520" style="s2">times had</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:07.119" style="s2">horses and cows and pigs and all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.520" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">of different animals</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.119" end="00:56:11.440" style="s2">so yeah the current owners have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">experience in farming which is cool</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.440" end="00:56:17.200" style="s2">yeah um there&#39;s yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:18.480" style="s2">this is there&#39;s a bunch of vegetables</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.200" end="00:56:22.480" style="s2">being grown there right now</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.480" end="00:56:25.680" style="s2">organic and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.480" end="00:56:28.240" style="s2">the river where um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.680" end="00:56:29.200" style="s2">a small stream that runs from the river</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.240" end="00:56:31.119" style="s2">um so we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:33.040" style="s2">access to the water from that stream as</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.119" end="00:56:34.720" style="s2">well for irrigation</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.040" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">and there are also several wells on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.720" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">property the property actually extends</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:40.640" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:42.799" style="s2">along this line above the ridge so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.640" end="00:56:44.640" style="s2">not all flat a good portion of it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.799" end="00:56:46.799" style="s2">also this forested area</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.640" end="00:56:48.640" style="s2">about 40 of it actually is that forested</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.799" end="00:56:49.520" style="s2">area and that&#39;s probably that portion is</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.640" end="00:56:50.720" style="s2">unzoned</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.520" end="00:56:53.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s probably where we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.720" end="00:56:55.200" style="s2">start building some of the structures</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.280" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">this is on that side this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.200" end="00:56:58.880" style="s2">two bedroom houses</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:57:00.000" style="s2">and then there is this path that</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.880" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">connects</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.000" end="00:57:04.480" style="s2">the two-bedroom house to the second</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:05.760" style="s2">two-bedroom house and along this path is</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.480" end="00:57:06.880" style="s2">where we&#39;re thinking of building a lot</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.760" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">of the different structures</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.880" end="00:57:11.200" style="s2">the dome the four domes that we start at</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:14.319" style="s2">the beginning or tiny homes or cabins</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.200" end="00:57:16.240" style="s2">yeah and so it&#39;s quite a lot of space um</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.319" end="00:57:18.079" style="s2">and then up here is the path leading to</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.240" end="00:57:19.599" style="s2">what&#39;s currently being used as an airbnb</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:23.119" style="s2">this is a two bedroom house here</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.599" end="00:57:24.839" style="s2">there&#39;s water like there&#39;s wells and</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">storage areas and all kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.839" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">there yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">the fact that part of the property is</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:32.240" style="s2">unzoned is very handy because it means</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.480" end="00:57:34.000" style="s2">there are fewer limitations on what we</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.240" end="00:57:34.960" style="s2">can build and how many structures we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.000" end="00:57:37.119" style="s2">build</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.960" end="00:57:39.040" style="s2">um yeah the other side of the property</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.119" end="00:57:40.319" style="s2">is zoned agricultural so it does have</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.040" end="00:57:41.680" style="s2">limitations but</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.319" end="00:57:43.920" style="s2">we are going to work with the local</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.680" end="00:57:44.960" style="s2">government to change the zoning so that</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.920" end="00:57:47.520" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.960" end="00:57:49.680" style="s2">um have more structures um among the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.520" end="00:57:52.799" style="s2">farmland as well</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.680" end="00:57:56.079" style="s2">it&#39;s beautiful yeah it is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.799" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s really nice um it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.079" end="00:58:00.240" style="s2">two hours from the local airport it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:02.640" style="s2">about an hour and a half from nelson</p>
