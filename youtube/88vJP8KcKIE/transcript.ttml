<p begin="00:00:14.059" end="00:00:20.160" style="s2">so hello there my name is Andrew sweetie</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.310" end="00:00:24.990" style="s2">and I&#39;d like to talk to you today about</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.160" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">a few things primarily I want to put in</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.990" end="00:00:31.320" style="s2">my two cents worth about the Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:32.850" style="s2">Jordan Peterson debates and I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.320" end="00:00:36.239" style="s2">made a video for a while because mostly</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.850" end="00:00:38.610" style="s2">mmm I think my strong point is writing</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:41.879" style="s2">rather than communicating in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.610" end="00:00:44.789" style="s2">fashion but that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.879" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">want to try to experiment with this</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.789" end="00:00:49.079" style="s2">medium and really learn how to speak in</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:50.420" style="s2">front of a camera because it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.079" end="00:00:55.680" style="s2">easy thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.420" end="00:00:59.090" style="s2">so thank you for your patience I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.680" end="00:01:02.960" style="s2">a new microphone I&#39;m going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.090" end="00:01:05.460" style="s2">make podcasts I have a few conversations</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.960" end="00:01:08.510" style="s2">coming up with some very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.460" end="00:01:11.939" style="s2">people so if you like this</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.510" end="00:01:13.140" style="s2">feel free to support me on patreon so</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.939" end="00:01:16.740" style="s2">that I can make it much more</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.140" end="00:01:20.490" style="s2">professional and slick and fun and all</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.740" end="00:01:24.420" style="s2">that so so firstly I&#39;d like to share</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.490" end="00:01:29.360" style="s2">some of my thoughts about the bootlegs</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:32.520" style="s2">right of the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.360" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">debates okay and I&#39;ve written three</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.520" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">articles on medium about it and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">been thinking about this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:44.040" style="s2">for years and I&#39;m thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:45.509" style="s2">phenomenon of the New Atheists mmm why</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.040" end="00:01:49.430" style="s2">they&#39;re extremely compelling to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.509" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">people and why I think ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.430" end="00:01:57.180" style="s2">they&#39;re wrong wrong while being right</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">about a lot of things so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.180" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">position that&#39;s that&#39;s where I take my</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">stand the person who I think so far has</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:08.580" style="s2">articulated this most interestingly is</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:10.729" style="s2">Jonathan pazzo in his on his YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.580" end="00:02:13.340" style="s2">site symbolic world</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.729" end="00:02:16.209" style="s2">where he like Jordan Pearson talks about</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.340" end="00:02:19.659" style="s2">the fact that we live in a symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.209" end="00:02:23.349" style="s2">universe as much as a materialistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.659" end="00:02:27.739" style="s2">concrete one okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.349" end="00:02:30.170" style="s2">so Jordan Peterson has a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.739" end="00:02:33.379" style="s2">interesting take on religion and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.170" end="00:02:36.769" style="s2">very novel one and it&#39;s not strictly</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.379" end="00:02:38.390" style="s2">speaking I don&#39;t think theological he</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.769" end="00:02:43.239" style="s2">doesn&#39;t speak that much about belief in</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.390" end="00:02:46.129" style="s2">God and he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t try to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.239" end="00:02:49.160" style="s2">prove the existence of God in any kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.129" end="00:02:53.959" style="s2">of theological sense he talks about God</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.160" end="00:03:00.680" style="s2">in terms of its psychological primacy</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.959" end="00:03:03.079" style="s2">you could say in our world so he&#39;s tried</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.680" end="00:03:05.170" style="s2">to talk about religious actions from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.079" end="00:03:08.750" style="s2">psychological point of view and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.170" end="00:03:10.280" style="s2">sometimes he dips into metaphysics but</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.750" end="00:03:13.220" style="s2">most of the time he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.280" end="00:03:18.500" style="s2">neuroscience and myth and this whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.220" end="00:03:20.180" style="s2">rich burnout rich literature and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.500" end="00:03:24.530" style="s2">psychological themes of this literature</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.180" end="00:03:28.970" style="s2">and why let&#39;s say the the archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.530" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">okay of you know Christian Christian</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.970" end="00:03:34.069" style="s2">archetypes and the archetypes of ancient</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:37.579" style="s2">religion in general are not only deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.069" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re absolutely essential on</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.579" end="00:03:43.400" style="s2">the other hand he does this without</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">necessarily any kind of membership to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.400" end="00:03:51.829" style="s2">any church or Dogma or any and he</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:54.919" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have he&#39;s not speaking from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.829" end="00:03:58.669" style="s2">point of view or the authority of any</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.919" end="00:04:02.150" style="s2">particular church so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.669" end="00:04:04.250" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of interesting and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.150" end="00:04:05.419" style="s2">interests me because the much of the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.250" end="00:04:07.790" style="s2">books on his reading list of books that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.419" end="00:04:11.180" style="s2">I read as he as a young man Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.790" end="00:04:13.160" style="s2">Dostoevsky George Orwell these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.180" end="00:04:16.459" style="s2">books I was passionate about as a young</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.160" end="00:04:18.010" style="s2">person and I also felt very that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.459" end="00:04:21.549" style="s2">what was happening in the universities</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.010" end="00:04:21.549" style="s2">wealth somehow</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.889" end="00:04:27.260" style="s2">separated from my my real interests</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.510" end="00:04:29.900" style="s2">which were those particular writers</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.260" end="00:04:33.570" style="s2">especially Carl Jung</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.900" end="00:04:36.450" style="s2">because Carl Jung very quickly changed</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.570" end="00:04:39.660" style="s2">me from being an atheist into being</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.450" end="00:04:41.160" style="s2">someone interested in religion this this</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.660" end="00:04:45.090" style="s2">happened was a very young person I read</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.160" end="00:04:47.280" style="s2">his biography and it just it just blew</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.090" end="00:04:50.820" style="s2">up in my mind in other words I became</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.280" end="00:04:53.250" style="s2">less interested in you know critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.820" end="00:04:55.050" style="s2">the church and not necessarily wanting</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.250" end="00:04:58.169" style="s2">to become a member of any church but but</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.050" end="00:05:01.310" style="s2">still wanting to - still acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.169" end="00:05:03.930" style="s2">that there&#39;s something deep in</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.310" end="00:05:07.560" style="s2">archetypal view of this archetypal view</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.930" end="00:05:09.290" style="s2">of the world so one thing I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.560" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">very interesting about Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.290" end="00:05:16.740" style="s2">discussion and it&#39;s interesting that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:18.930" style="s2">person he uses right - - to make us his</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.740" end="00:05:22.820" style="s2">points as Nietzsche and Nietzsche was</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.930" end="00:05:26.490" style="s2">perhaps the most virulent you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.820" end="00:05:31.080" style="s2">vociferous critique of of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.490" end="00:05:35.310" style="s2">ever he almost despised Christianity so</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.080" end="00:05:38.729" style="s2">I think what Peterson is doing here is</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.310" end="00:05:42.360" style="s2">he&#39;s taking the greatest critique of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.729" end="00:05:46.130" style="s2">Christian Church and try to understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.360" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">that and and and not since steel Manning</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.130" end="00:05:54.389" style="s2">the entire let&#39;s say post Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:58.340" style="s2">world and seeing the the the you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.389" end="00:06:01.139" style="s2">the the the positive aspects of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.340" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">this might have something to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.139" end="00:06:05.150" style="s2">fact that he&#39;s talking to - sam harris</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:10.229" style="s2">who&#39;s sam harris is probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.150" end="00:06:11.700" style="s2">articulate proponent of atheism even</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.229" end="00:06:15.720" style="s2">though I will argue over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.700" end="00:06:19.710" style="s2">that sam harris is somewhat has a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.720" end="00:06:21.870" style="s2">somewhat suspicious kind of position</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.710" end="00:06:27.260" style="s2">which he has one foot in religion and</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.870" end="00:06:27.260" style="s2">one foot out of it so he&#39;s he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.220" end="00:06:35.550" style="s2">he&#39;s very attached to his his atheism</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.750" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">and he&#39;s made a whole career on it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.550" end="00:06:44.700" style="s2">yet he wants to keep the nice positive</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:50.640" style="s2">aspects of religion which i think is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.700" end="00:06:52.380" style="s2">sneaky move but anyway the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.640" end="00:06:54.570" style="s2">thing about Peterson&#39;s discussion of God</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.380" end="00:06:57.390" style="s2">is he&#39;s trying to actually think through</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.570" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">it right he&#39;s not just accepting it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.390" end="00:07:04.620" style="s2">faith so he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s thinking through</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:06.930" style="s2">what what this this concept of God means</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.620" end="00:07:08.700" style="s2">and its primacy you know in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.930" end="00:07:14.460" style="s2">and in our lives and the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.700" end="00:07:16.410" style="s2">know we haven&#39;t somehow been able to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.460" end="00:07:18.450" style="s2">rid of God as a concept right it just</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.410" end="00:07:21.210" style="s2">keeps coming back and it seems like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.450" end="00:07:25.380" style="s2">more that we push this concept the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.210" end="00:07:28.710" style="s2">the more it comes up in in pathological</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.380" end="00:07:32.670" style="s2">forms and we could see that with the new</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.710" end="00:07:36.780" style="s2">atheist movement which is against God</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.670" end="00:07:41.310" style="s2">but but really is is makes science into</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.780" end="00:07:44.250" style="s2">a god and science is God in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.310" end="00:07:49.470" style="s2">that science is the highest thing right</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.250" end="00:07:53.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the most it&#39;s the way to the truth</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.470" end="00:07:56.040" style="s2">okay and then traditionally you know God</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.880" end="00:07:58.470" style="s2">has been the way to the truth so now God</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.040" end="00:08:03.350" style="s2">is people like Sam Harris are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.470" end="00:08:03.350" style="s2">replace God with rationality and science</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.530" end="00:08:13.470" style="s2">on the other hand people like Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.630" end="00:08:19.290" style="s2">and John and Padua argued that the logos</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.470" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">right or the word huh or you know logic</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.290" end="00:08:26.010" style="s2">or the original impulse of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:32.219" style="s2">- well Peterson says make habitable</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.010" end="00:08:35.310" style="s2">order from chaos is is actually where</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.219" end="00:08:38.370" style="s2">science and empiricism and rationality</p>

<p begin="00:08:38.370" end="00:08:41.800" style="s2">scientific revolution didn&#39;t come out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.650" end="00:08:44.200" style="s2">nowhere right</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.800" end="00:08:46.360" style="s2">it came out of you know millennial of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.200" end="00:08:49.089" style="s2">sort of thinking about these questions</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.360" end="00:08:52.540" style="s2">of what it means to be human being and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.089" end="00:08:54.370" style="s2">what is truth of course science as we</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.540" end="00:08:57.220" style="s2">know it didn&#39;t exist when the Bible was</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.370" end="00:08:59.980" style="s2">written and the Bible it was was I guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.220" end="00:09:05.140" style="s2">and and other stories and traditional</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.980" end="00:09:08.829" style="s2">religious stories were and still are in</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.140" end="00:09:12.730" style="s2">some ways about value right and not</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.829" end="00:09:17.980" style="s2">about objective fact about what matters</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.730" end="00:09:21.339" style="s2">and these little stories right contain a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.980" end="00:09:26.649" style="s2">kind of wisdom that is that reveals</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.339" end="00:09:30.310" style="s2">itself through time and and there&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.649" end="00:09:34.120" style="s2">of no bottom to a story like Cain and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.310" end="00:09:37.149" style="s2">Abel mmm or the Genesis story or the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.120" end="00:09:39.899" style="s2">Christian story these stories and other</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.149" end="00:09:42.790" style="s2">stories and different religions contain</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.899" end="00:09:45.190" style="s2">perennial you know Troost and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.790" end="00:09:49.420" style="s2">not the kind of truth that is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.190" end="00:09:52.870" style="s2">dogmatic it doesn&#39;t say this is the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.420" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">it is it says the fact that&#39;s it it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.870" end="00:09:57.610" style="s2">the form of a story means it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:10:00.520" style="s2">form of an exploration</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.610" end="00:10:04.930" style="s2">it&#39;s a journey it&#39;s not that&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.520" end="00:10:08.860" style="s2">not a final answer and that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.930" end="00:10:12.310" style="s2">it&#39;s worthwhile whether you are you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.860" end="00:10:14.020" style="s2">an Orthodox believing type of person or</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.310" end="00:10:17.829" style="s2">just an intelligent person you know to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.020" end="00:10:19.870" style="s2">to become literate literate in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.829" end="00:10:23.770" style="s2">and and and other other great stories</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.870" end="00:10:29.140" style="s2">because these stories are foundational</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.770" end="00:10:32.740" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.140" end="00:10:40.269" style="s2">hard to argue with but people of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.740" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">do so i you know i i&#39;ve you know exposed</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.269" end="00:10:45.130" style="s2">myself since i&#39;m not a pure christian</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:47.550" style="s2">although i feel a real affinity to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.130" end="00:10:53.320" style="s2">christian religion to different sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.550" end="00:10:57.430" style="s2">interpretations of the body</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.320" end="00:11:01.000" style="s2">of Christianity and 1:1 in Judaism</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.430" end="00:11:04.270" style="s2">interests me somewhat and and I find it</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.000" end="00:11:05.500" style="s2">rather similar to Peterson&#39;s view and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.270" end="00:11:06.310" style="s2">I just want to throw this out there</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.500" end="00:11:09.280" style="s2">uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.310" end="00:11:14.710" style="s2">I was listening to this sort of very</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.280" end="00:11:17.080" style="s2">non-orthodox wild kind of Jewish mystic</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.710" end="00:11:18.730" style="s2">and he was saying that in Judaism</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.080" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea that we have to save</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.730" end="00:11:24.010" style="s2">God right and it&#39;s a very different idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:26.800" style="s2">than the Christian idea where God is</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.010" end="00:11:29.470" style="s2">this perfect you know being that we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.800" end="00:11:34.180" style="s2">to you know imitate rather that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.470" end="00:11:36.460" style="s2">human the human the human goal is</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.180" end="00:11:42.190" style="s2">actually that God okay in the early</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.460" end="00:11:45.400" style="s2">stories is is you know he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.190" end="00:11:50.310" style="s2">behaves in ways that are brutal right</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.400" end="00:11:54.610" style="s2">and he he&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.310" end="00:12:00.760" style="s2">compassionate and he perhaps hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.610" end="00:12:03.520" style="s2">become perhaps the fact that he is</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.760" end="00:12:06.700" style="s2">created man says something about God</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.520" end="00:12:11.290" style="s2">right because man is such a flawed</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.700" end="00:12:15.520" style="s2">creature therefore is God flawed maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.290" end="00:12:17.200" style="s2">God has actually schizophrenic so this</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.520" end="00:12:19.240" style="s2">is one interpretation which might seem</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.200" end="00:12:21.310" style="s2">sort of wild that the God is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.240" end="00:12:26.610" style="s2">crazy God and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s human</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.310" end="00:12:29.530" style="s2">beings job to heal God but I find that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.610" end="00:12:33.180" style="s2">somewhat similar to Peterson&#39;s view that</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.530" end="00:12:35.620" style="s2">you know we need to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.180" end="00:12:40.570" style="s2">rather than just sit around and wait to</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.620" end="00:12:41.890" style="s2">be saved and I think this also has</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.570" end="00:12:44.710" style="s2">something to do with a tradition that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.890" end="00:12:47.680" style="s2">I&#39;m more familiar with Buddhism and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.710" end="00:12:50.490" style="s2">think Buddhism is much more about you</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:50.490" style="s2">know liberation</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.140" end="00:12:59.910" style="s2">through practice uh-huh then then then</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.610" end="00:13:02.130" style="s2">waiting for grace but of course both</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.910" end="00:13:06.750" style="s2">those things are important in grace and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.130" end="00:13:08.490" style="s2">liberation so grace would be what would</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.750" end="00:13:13.890" style="s2">grace be what&#39;s the definition of grace</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.490" end="00:13:15.630" style="s2">a definition of grace is simply well you</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.890" end="00:13:18.120" style="s2">could say that the fact that you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.630" end="00:13:22.019" style="s2">there&#39;s words coming out of your mouth</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.120" end="00:13:23.750" style="s2">the fact that you know the color red the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.019" end="00:13:27.390" style="s2">fact that there&#39;s this world of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.750" end="00:13:29.940" style="s2">potential and beauty around us okay and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.390" end="00:13:36.570" style="s2">we can align ourselves with that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.940" end="00:13:38.700" style="s2">that&#39;s grace so there&#39;s grace and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.570" end="00:13:41.730" style="s2">then there&#39;s you know responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.700" end="00:13:44.250" style="s2">which means unlike what Sam Harrison</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.730" end="00:13:46.529" style="s2">says you know he makes this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.250" end="00:13:49.740" style="s2">argument against free will that you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.529" end="00:13:53.040" style="s2">there is some sense that it&#39;s our job to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.740" end="00:13:57.810" style="s2">align ourselves with the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.040" end="00:14:00.240" style="s2">archetypes so and what are archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.810" end="00:14:02.100" style="s2">it&#39;s a good question because are they</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.240" end="00:14:06.630" style="s2">the same thing as platonic forms for</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.100" end="00:14:07.890" style="s2">example I think the Petersons definition</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.630" end="00:14:09.660" style="s2">of archetypes is very interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.890" end="00:14:17.279" style="s2">said archetypes are limits they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.660" end="00:14:18.870" style="s2">limit there&#39;s some kind of ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.279" end="00:14:21.300" style="s2">potential that you can&#39;t go any further</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.870" end="00:14:23.220" style="s2">than so for example Satan is a limit of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.300" end="00:14:25.529" style="s2">evil purity it&#39;s it&#39;s like pure evil</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.220" end="00:14:27.779" style="s2">it&#39;s the archetype of Satan and then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.529" end="00:14:31.199" style="s2">archetype of Christ is the archetype of</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.779" end="00:14:34.920" style="s2">the self-sacrificing hero that is only</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.199" end="00:14:37.620" style="s2">love right so that&#39;s so they we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.920" end="00:14:41.130" style="s2">these you set up these ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.620" end="00:14:46.820" style="s2">possibilities and then you as a human</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.130" end="00:14:49.230" style="s2">being exists within that within that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.820" end="00:14:51.029" style="s2">symbolic world of possibilities right</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.230" end="00:14:55.170" style="s2">you have the possibility to fall very</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.029" end="00:14:57.540" style="s2">far into hell right if you started to</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.170" end="00:15:00.390" style="s2">you know snort cocaine on a regular</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.540" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">basis you could or you could fall into</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.390" end="00:15:06.649" style="s2">hell right and if you whereas if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:09.790" style="s2">dedicated your life to to helping other</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.649" end="00:15:13.430" style="s2">people you might find you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.790" end="00:15:15.470" style="s2">discovered a world of incredible you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.430" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">know meaning and which is like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.470" end="00:15:21.290" style="s2">kingdom of heaven or which is like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:26.269" style="s2">City of God on the hill or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.290" end="00:15:28.670" style="s2">want to call it okay so Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.269" end="00:15:31.930" style="s2">argued that you know this God you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.670" end="00:15:34.610" style="s2">this God principle is essential</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.930" end="00:15:37.700" style="s2">regardless of our beliefs right that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.610" end="00:15:41.510" style="s2">need this higher view or we need</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.700" end="00:15:42.829" style="s2">something above us and we just as we</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.510" end="00:15:48.230" style="s2">need to be reminded that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.829" end="00:15:49.730" style="s2">something below us it&#39;s like I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.230" end="00:15:51.410" style="s2">thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.730" end="00:15:53.500" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t want if you went to a court</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.410" end="00:15:56.589" style="s2">of law you wouldn&#39;t want a judge right</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.500" end="00:15:58.970" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t want this person to be</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.970" end="00:16:02.959" style="s2">something bad you would want something</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.860" end="00:16:05.269" style="s2">higher to be responsible for your fate</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:08.360" style="s2">you know you would want the law right to</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.360" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">just human beings without any higher</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.140" end="00:16:20.120" style="s2">principles we&#39;d probably just tear</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:23.810" style="s2">ourselves to pieces it would seem and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.120" end="00:16:26.600" style="s2">can observe all of the 2007 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.810" end="00:16:29.240" style="s2">revolutions where people have attempted</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.600" end="00:16:31.730" style="s2">to build a utopian society based on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.240" end="00:16:35.240" style="s2">five-year plan and reason and all that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.730" end="00:16:39.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s been a catastrophic failure in</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.240" end="00:16:42.760" style="s2">in every sense right and even before</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.800" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">that in the French Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.760" end="00:16:52.970" style="s2">you know the idea was that this archaic</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.160" end="00:16:55.220" style="s2">superstition that revolution you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.970" end="00:17:00.380" style="s2">that religion represented had to be</p>

<p begin="00:17:02.750" end="00:17:05.929" style="s2">was a time where you know the neighbors</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.980" end="00:18:43.279" style="s2">funny that I was listening to Eric</p>

<p begin="00:18:43.279" end="00:18:47.450" style="s2">wrote only archetypes of the kind found</p>

<p begin="00:19:13.700" end="00:19:17.899" style="s2">astonishing I guess about Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.559" end="00:19:20.750" style="s2">that he&#39;s offering religious myth and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.899" end="00:19:24.769" style="s2">saying it&#39;s a value to both the atheist</p>

<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:10.310" style="s2">that allowed her to get to that point</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.430" end="00:20:48.590" style="s2">are fairies in the garden okay</p>

<p begin="00:21:03.100" end="00:21:06.980" style="s2">perhaps you might admit to the</p>

<p begin="00:21:35.150" end="00:21:39.410" style="s2">interesting question which I won&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.790" end="00:21:41.580" style="s2">about here but at least we could say</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.410" end="00:21:48.090" style="s2">that they exist in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.580" end="00:21:49.740" style="s2">for at the minimum so metaphor symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.090" end="00:21:55.470" style="s2">truth okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.740" end="00:21:58.830" style="s2">non material truth love for example okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.470" end="00:22:04.410" style="s2">it should not be conflated with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.830" end="00:22:07.050" style="s2">observation of objective facts okay we</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.410" end="00:22:09.780" style="s2">need to observe objective facts at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.050" end="00:22:13.070" style="s2">function but it&#39;s certainly not the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.780" end="00:22:15.420" style="s2">entire spectrum of human experience and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.070" end="00:22:21.780" style="s2">it&#39;s a very limited part of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.420" end="00:22:23.610" style="s2">in fact we live in the world of well</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.780" end="00:22:29.670" style="s2">Peterson would say we live in the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.610" end="00:22:32.940" style="s2">of values of meaning not merely things</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.670" end="00:22:36.120" style="s2">objects okay the word ration means to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.940" end="00:22:38.970" style="s2">cut things into pieces right we ration</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.120" end="00:22:42.780" style="s2">things into pieces this is what we do</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.970" end="00:22:44.570" style="s2">with our left brain we this is what</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.780" end="00:22:49.110" style="s2">allows us to have language this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.570" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">fantastic right but if you remain just</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.110" end="00:22:54.750" style="s2">within that ration rationing of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:57.480" style="s2">you get this fragmented world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.750" end="00:23:00.990" style="s2">completely fragmented it has no nothing</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.480" end="00:23:05.030" style="s2">holding it together so no wonder people</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.990" end="00:23:08.460" style="s2">go crazy when you try to violently rip</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.030" end="00:23:10.410" style="s2">you know fabric of society out from</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.460" end="00:23:12.510" style="s2">under them like like they did in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.410" end="00:23:14.040" style="s2">mouse revolutions and stealth and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.510" end="00:23:17.970" style="s2">know Stella nice revolutions and any</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.040" end="00:23:25.830" style="s2">kind of atheist revolution seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.970" end="00:23:27.870" style="s2">that sort of effect that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.830" end="00:23:31.530" style="s2">there is not some kind of authentic</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.870" end="00:23:34.560" style="s2">atheism I I think there is but the angry</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.530" end="00:23:36.840" style="s2">atheists are fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.560" end="00:23:39.630" style="s2">fundamentally that they really are they</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.840" end="00:23:42.540" style="s2">they have this belief in rationality</p>

<p begin="00:23:54.629" end="00:23:59.529" style="s2">so anyway I think that I think also we</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.789" end="00:24:01.239" style="s2">could say that how do we find truth well</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.529" end="00:24:03.700" style="s2">first we have intuition we have</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.869" end="00:25:37.539" style="s2">dragons fairies dogs are real and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.719" end="00:25:40.149" style="s2">they&#39;re just as real as atoms molecules</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.539" end="00:25:43.929" style="s2">DNA perhaps or even more real in terms</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.149" end="00:25:45.519" style="s2">of our actual lived experience so in</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.929" end="00:25:48.429" style="s2">terms of the Christian story it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.519" end="00:25:49.929" style="s2">interesting that that you know one thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.429" end="00:25:50.979" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed about Peterson&#39;s discussion</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.929" end="00:25:54.399" style="s2">of Christ is he doesn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.979" end="00:25:55.659" style="s2">Christ as a savior but as a hero and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.399" end="00:25:58.149" style="s2">know you usually hear about Christ as</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.659" end="00:26:01.509" style="s2">Savior I guess it&#39;s the same thing in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.149" end="00:26:03.809" style="s2">sense but it&#39;s just another way to look</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.509" end="00:26:03.809" style="s2">at it</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.050" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">so is Christ a person well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.180" end="00:26:17.240" style="s2">another question I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:23.340" style="s2">able to answer its Christ the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.240" end="00:26:25.080" style="s2">archetype for self-sacrifice you know I</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.340" end="00:26:26.940" style="s2">think Peterson&#39;s emphasis is on</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.080" end="00:26:29.070" style="s2">imitation of Christ rather than sitting</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.940" end="00:26:32.340" style="s2">around waiting for Christ to save you</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.070" end="00:26:37.530" style="s2">right but again these things you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.340" end="00:26:39.690" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know if we become saved</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.530" end="00:26:46.020" style="s2">in the sense of existentially healed</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.690" end="00:26:55.170" style="s2">until we we take a step towards healing</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.020" end="00:26:57.270" style="s2">ourselves or saving ourselves so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.170" end="00:27:00.690" style="s2">there&#39;s also an interesting fact I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.270" end="00:27:03.960" style="s2">in Peterson&#39;s writing is that he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.690" end="00:27:06.800" style="s2">the kind of secular preacher he&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.960" end="00:27:09.810" style="s2">this evangelical charisma in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.800" end="00:27:11.790" style="s2">to his lectures and he can and he talks</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.810" end="00:27:13.500" style="s2">about science and reason and that kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.790" end="00:27:14.910" style="s2">of thing so he&#39;s able to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.500" end="00:27:18.870" style="s2">science and reason he&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.910" end="00:27:20.700" style="s2">integrate modern view and to something</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.870" end="00:27:23.670" style="s2">that is passionately alive and engaged</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.700" end="00:27:25.920" style="s2">you know if you go and watch a people in</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.670" end="00:27:28.290" style="s2">a Baptist Church you might think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.920" end="00:27:30.750" style="s2">bloody insane but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.290" end="00:27:34.050" style="s2">alive about this possession by the Holy</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.750" end="00:27:36.510" style="s2">Spirit and speaking in tongues and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.050" end="00:27:39.240" style="s2">all of this which the modern and merely</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.510" end="00:27:40.890" style="s2">rational a man may be he understands a</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.240" end="00:27:43.560" style="s2">lot of things intellectually but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.890" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t have this direct heart</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.560" end="00:27:56.580" style="s2">connection with with rapturous estatic</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">or deep experiences so so yeah we need</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.580" end="00:28:03.300" style="s2">this you know we need you know modernity</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:05.430" style="s2">and we need to use our rational minds to</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.300" end="00:28:09.570" style="s2">the best of our ability but we also need</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.430" end="00:28:12.770" style="s2">to experience there&#39;s a hunger in human</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.570" end="00:28:16.950" style="s2">being for transcendental deeper you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.770" end="00:28:19.360" style="s2">experiences to step into a state that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.950" end="00:28:23.530" style="s2">beyond the ego</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:25.960" style="s2">or the self-image or our limited</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.530" end="00:28:32.830" style="s2">perception of reality into something</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.960" end="00:28:34.780" style="s2">greater there&#39;s this guy named Richard</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.830" end="00:28:38.760" style="s2">Kearney who had this idea called</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.780" end="00:28:41.650" style="s2">antitheism and it&#39;s the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.760" end="00:28:44.200" style="s2">antitheism is is is an idea for those</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.650" end="00:28:49.480" style="s2">who have moved away from God like</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.200" end="00:28:51.990" style="s2">they&#39;ve become atheists and then come</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.480" end="00:28:56.910" style="s2">back right</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.990" end="00:28:59.500" style="s2">so they recover God after losing God</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.910" end="00:29:02.140" style="s2">which is very interesting and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.500" end="00:29:05.110" style="s2">it&#39;s actually part of the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.140" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">story you know Jesus sort of he&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.110" end="00:29:09.910" style="s2">cross and he says why have you forsaken</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.640" end="00:29:14.680" style="s2">me he&#39;s become you become an angry</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.910" end="00:29:17.680" style="s2">atheist for a moment and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.680" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">you know so so he loses his faith in God</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.680" end="00:29:22.650" style="s2">right and so perhaps his loss of faith</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:25.270" style="s2">and this loss of meaning in this loss of</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.650" end="00:29:27.940" style="s2">dimension is a necessary stage that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.270" end="00:29:34.030" style="s2">culture has to go through before they</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.940" end="00:29:39.730" style="s2">can find it again so do we really need</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.030" end="00:29:41.470" style="s2">the God principle well depends what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.730" end="00:29:43.270" style="s2">mean by God as Peterson says over and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.470" end="00:29:45.580" style="s2">over again and I really like that cuz</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.270" end="00:29:49.740" style="s2">he&#39;s not giving us a cliche answer he</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.580" end="00:29:52.090" style="s2">has this long list of stuff to say I</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.740" end="00:29:56.500" style="s2">think I have one of his definitions of</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.090" end="00:29:58.870" style="s2">God here God is truthful speech logos</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.500" end="00:30:01.930" style="s2">that rectifies pathological hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.870" end="00:30:03.550" style="s2">and confronts chaos of being itself and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.930" end="00:30:05.560" style="s2">generates habitable order a</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.550" end="00:30:07.720" style="s2">transcendental reality that is only</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.560" end="00:30:10.330" style="s2">observable o&#39;clock across the longest</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.720" end="00:30:12.460" style="s2">iteration timeframes God is how we</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.330" end="00:30:14.350" style="s2">imagine and collectively represent the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.460" end="00:30:17.020" style="s2">existence and action of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.350" end="00:30:19.090" style="s2">across time as the most real aspects of</p>

<p begin="00:30:19.090" end="00:30:23.860" style="s2">the longest time frames but are not</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.070" end="00:30:27.040" style="s2">necessarily apprehensible as objects in</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.860" end="00:30:28.269" style="s2">the here now and now so what does that</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.040" end="00:30:30.580" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.269" end="00:30:33.369" style="s2">it&#39;s complex and I don&#39;t know I could</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.580" end="00:30:35.219" style="s2">give you an answer but then in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.369" end="00:30:37.599" style="s2">debates between Harrison and Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.219" end="00:30:40.389" style="s2">Harris comes in and says excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.599" end="00:30:44.889" style="s2">Jordan but is this also the God that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.389" end="00:30:47.589" style="s2">says you can&#39;t masturbate so you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.889" end="00:30:49.809" style="s2">see that Peterson has a very he has</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.589" end="00:30:54.129" style="s2">about 12 different definitions of God</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.809" end="00:30:57.249" style="s2">and Harris has only one and his one</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.129" end="00:31:03.249" style="s2">definition of God is like the bad father</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.249" end="00:31:05.229" style="s2">right the the guy who&#39;s the the the one</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.249" end="00:31:09.009" style="s2">who gives you rules that you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.229" end="00:31:11.799" style="s2">to follow the one who you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.009" end="00:31:14.200" style="s2">tyrant that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s God for for</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.799" end="00:31:17.320" style="s2">poor Harris it&#39;s the God who says you</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.200" end="00:31:20.499" style="s2">can&#39;t have fun you can&#39;t masturbate that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.320" end="00:31:22.089" style="s2">there are rules and regulations and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.499" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">you have to follow them to lead a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.089" end="00:31:29.049" style="s2">life and you know traditional religion</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:31.599" style="s2">you know and Harris straw man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.049" end="00:31:34.299" style="s2">traditional religion he takes the worst</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.599" end="00:31:38.169" style="s2">aspects of it and continually gives</p>

<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:48.009" style="s2">know anything that you know he um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.690" end="00:31:50.169" style="s2">interesting I was thinking that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.009" end="00:31:52.179" style="s2">criticizing the new religions right and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.169" end="00:31:54.820" style="s2">the new religions are usually religions</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.179" end="00:31:56.859" style="s2">that have sort of you know been twisted</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.820" end="00:31:58.239" style="s2">by modernity that you know by people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.859" end="00:32:01.509" style="s2">think that they can create their own</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.239" end="00:32:03.369" style="s2">religion and sam harris is that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.509" end="00:32:07.299" style="s2">a person he&#39;s the guy who thinks he can</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.369" end="00:32:09.459" style="s2">create his own religion and his religion</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.299" end="00:32:10.899" style="s2">is about reason and love that&#39;s what he</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.459" end="00:32:12.989" style="s2">says right reason and love right but</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.899" end="00:32:19.089" style="s2">reason and love you know is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.989" end="00:32:24.789" style="s2">really the two wings of logos and you</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.430" end="00:33:41.810" style="s2">sufficiently small and narrow it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.760" end="00:33:47.060" style="s2">easy right it&#39;s so easy to you know go</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.810" end="00:33:49.460" style="s2">through history and and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.060" end="00:33:52.250" style="s2">talk about the excesses totally next</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.460" end="00:33:56.210" style="s2">excesses of religion and see how they</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.250" end="00:33:58.900" style="s2">operate today as well and then come to</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.210" end="00:34:01.430" style="s2">the conclusion that all religion is bad</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.900" end="00:34:04.520" style="s2">you know say that you know life sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.430" end="00:34:06.380" style="s2">began in the Enlightenment Western Amman</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.520" end="00:34:08.540" style="s2">light invented all these people in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.380" end="00:34:14.710" style="s2">axial age like Buddha Confucius Plato</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.540" end="00:34:17.300" style="s2">Jesus you know and and and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.710" end="00:34:20.149" style="s2">thousands tens of thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.300" end="00:34:23.830" style="s2">before that people who have been trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.149" end="00:34:26.330" style="s2">to live communally together and you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.830" end="00:34:30.770" style="s2">have been working with religious</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.330" end="00:34:32.389" style="s2">archetypes so you can&#39;t just sweep that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.770" end="00:34:37.550" style="s2">all the way and we&#39;ve tried that in it</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.389" end="00:34:39.800" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t worked so the kind of secular</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.550" end="00:34:43.370" style="s2">spirituality morality morality which sam</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.800" end="00:34:46.129" style="s2">Harris thinks is desirable can only</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.370" end="00:34:49.190" style="s2">happen in and if you have a set of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.129" end="00:34:51.020" style="s2">axioms collective practices and poetic</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.190" end="00:34:52.639" style="s2">enactments and that would have to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.020" end="00:34:55.690" style="s2">religion our you could call it something</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.639" end="00:34:55.690" style="s2">else if you want but</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.700" end="00:35:04.070" style="s2">so Sam Harris is self-contradictory he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.850" end="00:35:07.370" style="s2">a fundamentalist and he his relentless</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.070" end="00:35:12.440" style="s2">attack on religion is a historical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.370" end="00:35:13.820" style="s2">facile certainly he&#39;s the only one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.440" end="00:35:18.710" style="s2">the new atheist who believes their</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.820" end="00:35:20.360" style="s2">transcendental states only he refuses to</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.710" end="00:35:22.640" style="s2">acknowledge the the context in which</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.360" end="00:35:24.590" style="s2">they were they were born the proof he</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.640" end="00:35:26.690" style="s2">discards the teachers and the lineage</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.590" end="00:35:29.600" style="s2">and that whole rich mythopoetic s--</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.690" end="00:35:32.390" style="s2">right what he wants his religion based</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.600" end="00:35:34.840" style="s2">on his own authorities on human human</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.390" end="00:35:34.840" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.730" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">so Jordan Peterson has about 25</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.530" end="00:35:47.050" style="s2">different definitions of God and and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:52.600" style="s2">know for him God is a working principle</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.050" end="00:35:57.290" style="s2">and something to be in awe and afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.600" end="00:36:00.260" style="s2">just for the fact of creation I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.290" end="00:36:02.360" style="s2">whereas Sam Harrison has is talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.260" end="00:36:04.700" style="s2">about a very different God that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.360" end="00:36:10.120" style="s2">the kind of God that nobody really</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.700" end="00:36:10.120" style="s2">believes in not even a smart 16 year old</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.830" end="00:36:20.630" style="s2">so we agree with Sam that it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.500" end="00:36:23.510" style="s2">attacking biblical literalism and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.630" end="00:36:26.210" style="s2">fundamentalism and everybody knows that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.510" end="00:36:29.330" style="s2">you know maybe these laws from the Iron</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.210" end="00:36:31.310" style="s2">Age the hand chopping and all that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.330" end="00:36:33.500" style="s2">don&#39;t want that you know we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.310" end="00:36:37.010" style="s2">able to criticize that and we know that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.500" end="00:36:39.920" style="s2">religion has this pathologies but you</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.010" end="00:36:47.420" style="s2">know science also has its pathologies it</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.920" end="00:36:50.450" style="s2">has its hydrogen bombs so we need to go</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.420" end="00:36:55.430" style="s2">beyond both this literalism in science</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.450" end="00:36:57.860" style="s2">right that there&#39;s only things and this</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.430" end="00:37:00.290" style="s2">religious literalism where you interpret</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.860" end="00:37:02.810" style="s2">you know the Bible and an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.290" end="00:37:05.810" style="s2">literal literal way right it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.810" end="00:37:08.390" style="s2">you throw away evolution</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.810" end="00:37:13.450" style="s2">and although we&#39;ve learned in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.390" end="00:37:16.220" style="s2">world my thesis and what I&#39;ve understood</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.450" end="00:37:18.680" style="s2">about having thought of this for some</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.220" end="00:37:23.450" style="s2">time is that the new atheists have</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.680" end="00:37:26.540" style="s2">created a religion unconsciously uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.450" end="00:37:31.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s a religion they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.540" end="00:37:34.010" style="s2">being saved by reason they have martyrs</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.520" end="00:37:38.390" style="s2">they worship martyrs Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.010" end="00:37:40.970" style="s2">Hitchens Galileo whoever they wear long</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.390" end="00:37:44.600" style="s2">write robes they have costumes they get</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.970" end="00:37:48.950" style="s2">together in stadiums for you know I said</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.600" end="00:37:51.140" style="s2">they static recognition of reason the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.950" end="00:37:53.480" style="s2">god of reason there&#39;s all these new</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.140" end="00:37:55.430" style="s2">atheist priests out and they don&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.480" end="00:37:57.710" style="s2">they&#39;re priests right because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.430" end="00:38:01.160" style="s2">better than that but they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.710" end="00:38:03.020" style="s2">priests Richard Dawkins has a summer</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.160" end="00:38:04.430" style="s2">camp and he in the summer camp they</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.020" end="00:38:08.510" style="s2">tried to explain to people that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.430" end="00:38:11.090" style="s2">really no such thing as Santa Claus the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.510" end="00:38:13.610" style="s2">Tooth Fairy and and all those things are</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.090" end="00:38:17.210" style="s2">just childish you know myths and we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.610" end="00:38:19.370" style="s2">to grow up and become rational and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.210" end="00:38:23.480" style="s2">the scientific method is the only one</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.370" end="00:38:25.070" style="s2">way to to get to the truth well Sam</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.480" end="00:38:27.620" style="s2">Harris doesn&#39;t see that precisely he</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.070" end="00:38:28.370" style="s2">says oh yeah you know the stories are</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.620" end="00:38:32.990" style="s2">nice</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.370" end="00:38:36.560" style="s2">the songs are nice he makes very light</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.990" end="00:38:39.230" style="s2">of those things he you never hear him</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.560" end="00:38:42.250" style="s2">talk about literature or poetry or art</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.230" end="00:38:45.350" style="s2">or music or at least in the most</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.250" end="00:38:47.860" style="s2">reductive reductionist ways because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.350" end="00:38:51.050" style="s2">he&#39;s completely entrenched in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.860" end="00:38:55.730" style="s2">scientific scientism in this ideology of</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.050" end="00:38:58.010" style="s2">scientism so he&#39;s at the same time he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.730" end="00:39:03.230" style="s2">cute he&#39;s a curious guy and he&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.010" end="00:39:07.600" style="s2">and met religious teachers he&#39;s met you</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.230" end="00:39:09.410" style="s2">know great buddhist sages you know and</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.600" end="00:39:11.570" style="s2">traditionally when you when you meet a</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.410" end="00:39:13.880" style="s2">great teacher you bow down to them in</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.570" end="00:39:15.440" style="s2">you you you you say please give me the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.880" end="00:39:16.650" style="s2">teachings and then you practice these</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:19.350" style="s2">teachings and it takes</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.650" end="00:39:20.910" style="s2">and then you learned something but sam</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.350" end="00:39:22.650" style="s2">harris goes and meets them and he says I</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.910" end="00:39:25.170" style="s2">like this part and I&#39;m gonna keep this</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.650" end="00:39:28.050" style="s2">and then you can you can keep all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.170" end="00:39:32.490" style="s2">rest it&#39;s a very arrogant you know point</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.050" end="00:39:34.140" style="s2">of view it&#39;s like the the the adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.490" end="00:39:36.990" style="s2">who just won&#39;t admit that he has parents</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.140" end="00:39:38.220" style="s2">right he&#39;s angry about his parents he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.990" end="00:39:39.600" style="s2">angry about all the bad things as</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.220" end="00:39:45.080" style="s2">parents does so he says I have no</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.600" end="00:39:50.100" style="s2">parents I feel it&#39;s it&#39;s not a mature</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.080" end="00:39:54.000" style="s2">view of the world because if a mature</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.100" end="00:39:57.650" style="s2">view of the world involves recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:57.650" style="s2">that there are things greater than you</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.390" end="00:40:04.770" style="s2">so there&#39;s something empty in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.970" end="00:40:06.690" style="s2">disembodied merely rational vision of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.770" end="00:40:10.380" style="s2">spirituality it&#39;s like the entire myth</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.690" end="00:40:12.360" style="s2">of poetics and I don&#39;t I said this word</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.380" end="00:40:15.210" style="s2">before cuz I like it myth or poetics</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.360" end="00:40:18.870" style="s2">that&#39;s myth and poetry it&#39;s this rich</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.210" end="00:40:24.870" style="s2">symbolic lore you can&#39;t just throw it</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.870" end="00:40:27.450" style="s2">away meaning has always been the realm</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.870" end="00:40:30.810" style="s2">of spirit right not the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.450" end="00:40:34.230" style="s2">measurement not the realm of numbers not</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.810" end="00:40:37.170" style="s2">the observation of physical systems that</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.230" end="00:40:39.570" style="s2">belongs to science and science is fine I</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.170" end="00:40:43.380" style="s2">have no problem with science but to</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.570" end="00:40:45.090" style="s2">reduce religion to scientism strips the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.380" end="00:40:47.120" style="s2">poetry and the spiritual endeavor and</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.090" end="00:40:49.290" style="s2">and and you just have techniques</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.120" end="00:40:51.720" style="s2">meditation techniques that&#39;s what sam</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.290" end="00:40:56.780" style="s2">Harris you know teaches we have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.720" end="00:40:56.780" style="s2">meditate right meditation techniques</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.760" end="00:41:08.369" style="s2">so Peterson&#39;s trying to make build a</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.240" end="00:41:10.950" style="s2">bridge turn a Peter cinn to - you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.369" end="00:41:13.350" style="s2">from religion - from let&#39;s say his</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.950" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">training and biology and evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.350" end="00:41:19.980" style="s2">biology to the great truths of religion</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:23.310" style="s2">which is a which is he says that what</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.980" end="00:41:25.140" style="s2">he&#39;s adding to this Jungian business of</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.310" end="00:41:26.820" style="s2">archetypes he&#39;s adding the biological</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.140" end="00:41:29.790" style="s2">element and so I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.820" end="00:41:34.140" style="s2">fascinating and but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.790" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">actually new most of the earliest</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.140" end="00:41:37.980" style="s2">scientists were pretty religious you</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:40.500" style="s2">have Hildegard the big din you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.980" end="00:41:42.990" style="s2">Francis Bacon you have Isaac Newton you</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.500" end="00:41:44.850" style="s2">have Joanna&#39;s Kepler they were all</p>

<p begin="00:44:35.450" end="00:44:40.550" style="s2">Torah of laws and that&#39;s a punishment</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.550" end="00:44:42.260" style="s2">because people don&#39;t really want to meet</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.550" end="00:44:43.670" style="s2">God directly and that there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.260" end="00:44:46.340" style="s2">something else called the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.670" end="00:44:51.560" style="s2">Torah and that&#39;s when you speak directly</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.340" end="00:44:55.550" style="s2">to the divine there are ideas like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.560" end="00:44:57.830" style="s2">there is an exoteric you know an outer</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.550" end="00:45:00.860" style="s2">part to the religion and an esoteric an</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.830" end="00:45:02.960" style="s2">inner part to the religion and there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.860" end="00:45:04.850" style="s2">levels of essa&#39; terrors there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.960" end="00:45:11.390" style="s2">different levels you know and there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.850" end="00:45:13.220" style="s2">vastly complex and deep so we maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.390" end="00:45:15.020" style="s2">need some laws to help govern our</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.220" end="00:45:18.220" style="s2">society like you know don&#39;t masturbate</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.020" end="00:45:18.220" style="s2">you know too much</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.839" end="00:45:24.520" style="s2">you might become a bit depraved and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.900" end="00:45:26.049" style="s2">know we need laws like we need traffic</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.520" end="00:45:27.660" style="s2">lights you know otherwise people crash</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.049" end="00:45:33.210" style="s2">into each other so there are laws and</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.660" end="00:45:33.210" style="s2">some of these laws are a bit archaic and</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.319" end="00:45:42.520" style="s2">it&#39;s unfortunate but that&#39;s not all</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.859" end="00:45:46.240" style="s2">there is to to let&#39;s say spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.520" end="00:45:52.150" style="s2">and religion religion yes it can be a</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.240" end="00:45:53.980" style="s2">deadening formal monstrous for us but it</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.150" end="00:45:56.920" style="s2">can also be in a liveing for us it can</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.980" end="00:45:59.230" style="s2">also save people it saves their souls</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.920" end="00:46:01.930" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s like religion the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.230" end="00:46:03.910" style="s2">function of religion is in many ways to</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.930" end="00:46:07.890" style="s2">save people from themselves from their</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.910" end="00:46:10.089" style="s2">own ego mania and if we don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.890" end="00:46:17.230" style="s2">then how are you going to save yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.089" end="00:46:22.599" style="s2">from yourself sometimes your rationale</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.230" end="00:46:25.029" style="s2">rational mind is not the answer</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.599" end="00:46:29.650" style="s2">sometimes you have to invoke things that</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.029" end="00:46:33.190" style="s2">are beyond yourself whatever that is and</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.650" end="00:46:35.589" style="s2">you know at a certain point language</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.190" end="00:46:39.309" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go there we can&#39;t hardly talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.589" end="00:46:42.579" style="s2">about it but you know people have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.309" end="00:46:44.170" style="s2">experiencing religious experiences since</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.579" end="00:46:48.039" style="s2">the beginning of time and and they</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.170" end="00:46:50.170" style="s2">always will and and these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.039" end="00:46:53.980" style="s2">are usually described in poetry because</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.170" end="00:46:55.750" style="s2">they can&#39;t be described in words it</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.980" end="00:47:01.569" style="s2">can&#39;t be described in law but through</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.750" end="00:47:04.510" style="s2">logical systems of analysis and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.569" end="00:47:09.849" style="s2">a range also a range of practices you</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.510" end="00:47:17.380" style="s2">know from virtue practices to inner yoga</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.849" end="00:47:23.339" style="s2">practices to prayer to all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.380" end="00:47:23.339" style="s2">imaginative collective activities</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.650" end="00:47:33.260" style="s2">to invoke and invite divine forces into</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.770" end="00:47:36.650" style="s2">human beings and if you look at the best</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.260" end="00:47:40.040" style="s2">I just thought of basketball for some</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.650" end="00:47:43.420" style="s2">reason you know you know human beings</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.040" end="00:47:45.920" style="s2">are capable of nearly you know divine</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.420" end="00:47:49.670" style="s2">activities and they&#39;re also capable of</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.920" end="00:47:52.359" style="s2">the most terrible demonic activities so</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.670" end="00:47:55.730" style="s2">I think the idea of God and the devil is</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.359" end="00:48:01.490" style="s2">appropriate and accurate on a</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.730" end="00:48:04.369" style="s2">metaphorical level at least so when I</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.490" end="00:48:06.619" style="s2">was practicing Zen I had a as n master</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.369" end="00:48:09.550" style="s2">and he he said he asked me this thing he</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.619" end="00:48:11.750" style="s2">gave me this Khan you know and cones are</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.550" end="00:48:13.310" style="s2">sort of riddles you have to answer but</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.750" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">you don&#39;t answer them in an irrational</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.310" end="00:48:19.160" style="s2">intellectual way you have to answer them</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:23.150" style="s2">with your whole being and he asked me</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.160" end="00:48:25.880" style="s2">where is God so he wasn&#39;t trying to tell</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.150" end="00:48:28.430" style="s2">me that draw a picture well maybe if I</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.880" end="00:48:31.340" style="s2">drew a picture maybe the divine could be</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.430" end="00:48:33.950" style="s2">present in that but he was he was posing</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.340" end="00:48:35.900" style="s2">not as as a : as a question I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.950" end="00:48:39.380" style="s2">Peterson does that I don&#39;t think he</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.900" end="00:48:41.570" style="s2">gives us a Dogma to work with which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.380" end="00:48:43.240" style="s2">which is quite refreshing and I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.570" end="00:48:45.140" style="s2">it&#39;s driving people back into</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.240" end="00:48:45.770" style="s2">investigations of religion and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.140" end="00:48:47.600" style="s2">that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.770" end="00:48:52.280" style="s2">it might even be driving him back to</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.600" end="00:48:56.750" style="s2">church but the net effect in any case to</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.280" end="00:49:01.460" style="s2">me is is very good so maybe God is like</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.750" end="00:49:04.280" style="s2">a Zen Cohen maybe maybe Peterson&#39;s God</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.460" end="00:49:07.730" style="s2">is somewhat Cohen like that&#39;s why he</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.280" end="00:49:11.710" style="s2">won&#39;t give you a definition and he won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.730" end="00:49:11.710" style="s2">pretend to know</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.820" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">so again I want to say that guys like</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.750" end="00:49:32.630" style="s2">Sam Harris are priests you know in a way</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">they&#39;re secular priests they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.630" end="00:49:39.530" style="s2">preaching to people and they&#39;re offering</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:45.170" style="s2">this Ark of reason this vessel you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.530" end="00:49:49.340" style="s2">this this holy vessel to protect us from</p>

<p begin="00:49:49.340" end="00:49:55.220" style="s2">they&#39;re warning us you know the waters</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.320" end="00:49:57.710" style="s2">are rising and we need to believe and</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.220" end="00:50:00.380" style="s2">have hope and rationality and reason is</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.710" end="00:50:09.290" style="s2">the good news and and and we could get</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.380" end="00:50:12.140" style="s2">illuminated and everything we fear is</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.290" end="00:50:17.180" style="s2">outside of reason about is outside that</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.140" end="00:50:19.040" style="s2">that world that we can describe you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.180" end="00:50:24.020" style="s2">they&#39;re building the Church of</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.040" end="00:50:26.710" style="s2">rationality and in that church we will</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.020" end="00:50:30.440" style="s2">build a world of limit us well-being and</p>

<p begin="00:59:18.710" end="00:59:27.800" style="s2">come from some kind of leap of faith</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.060" end="00:59:31.210" style="s2">some kind of unreasonable intuition and</p>

<p begin="00:59:31.210" end="00:59:36.200" style="s2">so I seem to have to repeat again that</p>

<p begin="00:59:44.480" end="00:59:48.770" style="s2">are other modes of knowing rather than</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.250" end="00:59:51.170" style="s2">merely conceptual ones so when the</p>

<p begin="01:00:18.050" end="01:00:23.420" style="s2">then we&#39;d like to believe there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:01:41.050" end="01:01:52.000" style="s2">right the French Revolution was an</p>

<p begin="01:01:52.000" end="01:01:57.130" style="s2">to the world but this logic and reason</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.940" end="01:01:59.530" style="s2">was represented by this gut this vicious</p>

<p begin="01:02:21.550" end="01:02:29.830" style="s2">the example Peterson uses is from crime</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.650" end="01:02:30.910" style="s2">and punishment mm-hmm or is it notes</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.830" end="01:02:31.390" style="s2">from the underground no crime and</p>

<p begin="01:03:14.380" end="01:03:17.890" style="s2">he wants to put everything in the box of</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.000" end="01:03:23.800" style="s2">reason but everything won&#39;t fit in that</p>
