<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:23.609" style="s2">learned about you from reading about you</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.050" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">and listening to you on other shows is</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.609" end="00:00:29.099" style="s2">that you were homeschooled that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.760" end="00:00:31.800" style="s2">and at the same time you&#39;re a really</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.099" end="00:00:34.590" style="s2">bright guy who is very knowledgeable and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.800" end="00:00:36.239" style="s2">articulate I would consider you and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.590" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">don&#39;t throw this term around but I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:39.870" style="s2">consider you to be someone that&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:42.239" style="s2">intelligent to the point where you could</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.870" end="00:00:44.070" style="s2">be called brilliant and I don&#39;t call</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.239" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">everyone brilliant you&#39;re a really smart</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.070" end="00:00:47.100" style="s2">guy</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:48.840" style="s2">so why did your parents elect to</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.100" end="00:00:52.140" style="s2">home-school you and what impact does</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.840" end="00:00:55.590" style="s2">that had on your yeah on your you know a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.140" end="00:00:57.149" style="s2">mental acuity so it was a educational</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.590" end="00:01:00.090" style="s2">experiment my parents were interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.149" end="00:01:03.390" style="s2">and my dad particularly spent his life</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.090" end="00:01:04.739" style="s2">thinking about educational philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.390" end="00:01:07.080" style="s2">and human potential and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.739" end="00:01:10.350" style="s2">actually actualize human potential</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.080" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">better and my mom had shared interests</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.350" end="00:01:13.380" style="s2">in different skills and so they they</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">decided to take it on together and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.380" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">experiment was what happens if we give a</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:20.820" style="s2">kid no curriculum at all no fixed</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:23.130" style="s2">curriculum so I didn&#39;t have English and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.820" end="00:01:26.310" style="s2">social studies in mathematics and but</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.130" end="00:01:28.470" style="s2">just expose them to everything possible</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.310" end="00:01:32.040" style="s2">facilitate their interests and see what</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.470" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">happens and so that was the experiment</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.040" end="00:01:36.450" style="s2">and having gone through the whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2">experiment we could do it much better</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.450" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">now there were parts that learned along</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.150" end="00:01:42.329" style="s2">the way but the effective parts that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:49.619" style="s2">would say we&#39;re a successful experiment</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.329" end="00:01:51.990" style="s2">is every kid has profound fascination</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.619" end="00:01:54.560" style="s2">with life in their own ways and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.990" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">usually do a good job of breaking it and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.560" end="00:01:59.659" style="s2">we also usually do a good job of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:02:02.759" style="s2">training them not to think well so</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.659" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">little kids ask what is that what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.759" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">that what is that at first right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:08.459" style="s2">the first question they&#39;re getting the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:11.700" style="s2">anatomy of universe down and then why</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.459" end="00:02:13.160" style="s2">why why and the depth of why run into</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.700" end="00:02:14.750" style="s2">philosophically and physically</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.160" end="00:02:17.120" style="s2">need questions that we usually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.750" end="00:02:18.710" style="s2">know how to answer and so we give them</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:19.400" style="s2">we just don&#39;t answer them or give them</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.710" end="00:02:22.940" style="s2"> answers</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.400" end="00:02:24.740" style="s2">what made-up answers yes yeah but or</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.940" end="00:02:26.150" style="s2">some less conscious parents who say</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.740" end="00:02:29.000" style="s2">because I said so</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.150" end="00:02:30.320" style="s2">yeah because it just is or God made it</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.000" end="00:02:32.870" style="s2">that way or whatever so when ready to</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.320" end="00:02:34.310" style="s2">asks why is the sky blue and most adults</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.870" end="00:02:36.200" style="s2">realize they don&#39;t actually know</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.310" end="00:02:37.790" style="s2">something that is that fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.200" end="00:02:41.150" style="s2">our experience every day right and all</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.790" end="00:02:43.160" style="s2">human experience they either say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.150" end="00:02:44.600" style="s2">know how do you spell cat right like to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.160" end="00:02:45.700" style="s2">move it into the domain of the gnome but</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.600" end="00:02:47.660" style="s2">they move it from something that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.700" end="00:02:50.870" style="s2">fundamental about the nature of universe</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.660" end="00:02:52.580" style="s2">to something that wasn&#39;t and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.870" end="00:02:54.290" style="s2">really want to explain why the sky is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.580" end="00:02:56.750" style="s2">blue you have to understand that our</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.290" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">upper atmosphere is made of nitrogen and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.750" end="00:03:00.470" style="s2">oxygen and the percentage of it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:02.630" style="s2">nitrogen specifically as n2 and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.470" end="00:03:04.370" style="s2">molecules work and how light coming from</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.630" end="00:03:05.750" style="s2">the Sun works and the speed of light and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.370" end="00:03:08.150" style="s2">diffraction and understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.750" end="00:03:10.190" style="s2">optics is and it like there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.150" end="00:03:11.990" style="s2">deep things and then the wait that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.190" end="00:03:13.790" style="s2">it is that specific wavelength but why</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.990" end="00:03:15.230" style="s2">do I subjectively experience it as blue</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.790" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">so now we&#39;re looking at the mind brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.230" end="00:03:19.130" style="s2">interface right and the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:21.470" style="s2">between consciousness and physics and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.130" end="00:03:23.180" style="s2">kids want to know that right they want</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.470" end="00:03:24.860" style="s2">to know why is fire hot which again is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.180" end="00:03:27.470" style="s2"> deep question and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.860" end="00:03:29.090" style="s2">every kid asks these things and since we</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.470" end="00:03:31.460" style="s2">don&#39;t know we don&#39;t facilitate what</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.090" end="00:03:33.830" style="s2">they&#39;re naturally fascinated in that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.460" end="00:03:35.450" style="s2">passed me by and we force them to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.830" end="00:03:38.330" style="s2">interested in stuff that is totally not</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.450" end="00:03:39.800" style="s2">interesting and in doing so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.330" end="00:03:40.880" style="s2">teach them the interesting things we</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.800" end="00:03:42.470" style="s2">don&#39;t teach them the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.880" end="00:03:44.150" style="s2">foundational about life that actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.470" end="00:03:46.040" style="s2">lead to the ability to understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.150" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">everything else and we actually break</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.040" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">their interest in life which is why then</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.840" end="00:03:52.580" style="s2">they just want to veg out and watch TV</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:54.920" style="s2">or you know the the whole welfare person</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.580" end="00:03:56.530" style="s2">phenomena who yeah is actually I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.920" end="00:03:59.720" style="s2">gonna say they become great taxpayers</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.530" end="00:04:02.000" style="s2">but see those are broken people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.720" end="00:04:04.190" style="s2">the key insight is that everyone is born</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.000" end="00:04:05.990" style="s2">fascinated interested and if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.190" end="00:04:07.670" style="s2">facilitate that then not only are you</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.990" end="00:04:09.560" style="s2">helping them learn a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.670" end="00:04:11.209" style="s2">and you&#39;re and they&#39;re gonna be fussing</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.560" end="00:04:12.890" style="s2">about different things some more in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.209" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">direction of aesthetics or ethics or</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.890" end="00:04:16.820" style="s2">fundamental science or athletics or but</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:20.090" style="s2">there will be a unique genius</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.820" end="00:04:21.560" style="s2">actualization if it&#39;s followed and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.090" end="00:04:23.720" style="s2">that was the experiment and we could go</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.560" end="00:04:26.280" style="s2">on about educational philosophy but one</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.720" end="00:04:28.980" style="s2">of the key like insights there is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.280" end="00:04:31.080" style="s2">we have an educational system in the US</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.980" end="00:04:32.730" style="s2">right now and in most of the West it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.080" end="00:04:36.180" style="s2">built in the industrial revolution to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.730" end="00:04:38.220" style="s2">make industrial pots brand it was there</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.180" end="00:04:40.050" style="s2">thank you no I love going here I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.220" end="00:04:41.460" style="s2">hoping I&#39;d hoping we could get into this</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.050" end="00:04:45.570" style="s2">so carry on please</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.460" end="00:04:48.270" style="s2">and so as we started to look at building</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.570" end="00:04:50.910" style="s2">industrial supply chains then we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.270" end="00:04:52.860" style="s2">every assembly line worker before we had</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.910" end="00:04:54.600" style="s2">automated that task to basically be</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.860" end="00:04:56.820" style="s2">anatomica right they would do the exact</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.600" end="00:04:58.890" style="s2">same thing and so anyone who had been</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.820" end="00:04:59.610" style="s2">trained into doing that could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.890" end="00:05:01.140" style="s2">replaceable</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.610" end="00:05:03.570" style="s2">they were fungible for anyone else and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.140" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">any MBA from a good business school was</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.570" end="00:05:07.530" style="s2">replaceable for any other MBA any vp of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:09.660" style="s2">marketing and so we want to take unique</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.530" end="00:05:12.390" style="s2">humans and collapse them into fungible</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.660" end="00:05:13.710" style="s2">roles and so then we can just have an</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.390" end="00:05:15.150" style="s2">org chart and say I&#39;m looking for three</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.710" end="00:05:17.490" style="s2">of these and four of these totally</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.150" end="00:05:18.900" style="s2">replaceable in the process of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.490" end="00:05:21.540" style="s2">when you collapse the uniqueness of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.900" end="00:05:23.340" style="s2">human into a fungible role there&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.540" end="00:05:26.130" style="s2">course the intrinsic motive to do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.340" end="00:05:27.510" style="s2">is gone deep competition in comparison</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.130" end="00:05:29.040" style="s2">because we&#39;re competing on being the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.510" end="00:05:30.360" style="s2">exact same role so we&#39;re competing on</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.040" end="00:05:32.130" style="s2">the same metrics rather than any</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.360" end="00:05:34.890" style="s2">uniqueness like there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.130" end="00:05:37.770" style="s2">compare Salvador Dali and MC Escher and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.890" end="00:05:39.540" style="s2">DaVinci because how the would you</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.770" end="00:05:41.550" style="s2">do that right like there you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.540" end="00:05:44.030" style="s2">compare them on the same metrics and if</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.550" end="00:05:46.140" style="s2">like if Dali hadn&#39;t done what he did</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.030" end="00:05:47.580" style="s2">some other artists wouldn&#39;t have done</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.140" end="00:05:49.500" style="s2">the same thing universe would just have</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.580" end="00:05:51.030" style="s2">been less that was the uniqueness of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.500" end="00:05:52.710" style="s2">that being expressing in a totally</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.030" end="00:05:53.970" style="s2"> unique way which is why all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.710" end="00:05:57.270" style="s2">artists for history hadn&#39;t done that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.970" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">thing and so so much of the jealousy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.270" end="00:06:01.710" style="s2">the comparison competition also comes</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">from being collapsed to categories and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.710" end="00:06:05.550" style="s2">there were reasons why we did this as we</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:08.040" style="s2">you know for all of human history until</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.550" end="00:06:10.169" style="s2">not that long ago until the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.040" end="00:06:11.880" style="s2">what we call civilization ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.169" end="00:06:13.950" style="s2">years ago give or take for eight million</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.880" end="00:06:16.229" style="s2">years of hominid history we never had</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.950" end="00:06:18.330" style="s2">got more than 150 people and those</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.229" end="00:06:19.890" style="s2">hundred and fifty person tribes every</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.330" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">one could be pretty unique and actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.890" end="00:06:22.979" style="s2">get along well because they knew</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:24.780" style="s2">everybody else and they could actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.979" end="00:06:26.940" style="s2">keep track of it and as soon as you want</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.780" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">to go to start having very large numbers</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.940" end="00:06:30.600" style="s2">we had to create some homogeneity</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">between everyone so we started making</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.600" end="00:06:34.229" style="s2">them a lot more like termites or ants</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.180" style="s2">which are animals that can do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.229" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">them working together but within a class</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.180" end="00:06:39.090" style="s2">a worker ant row</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.440" end="00:06:40.920" style="s2">they&#39;re all fungible right they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.090" end="00:06:42.480" style="s2">replaceable for each other so this</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.920" end="00:06:44.430" style="s2">system is very much like that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.480" end="00:06:46.170" style="s2">education is the indoctrination and to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.430" end="00:06:48.510" style="s2">be going from a unique human to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.170" end="00:06:52.650" style="s2">fungible boughten dude you just</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.510" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">described my hole in a very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.650" end="00:06:59.430" style="s2">intellectual way my whole experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:07:01.890" style="s2">subjectively with education and it the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.430" end="00:07:03.450" style="s2">whole time you&#39;re talking about caste</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.890" end="00:07:07.950" style="s2">and this is why I do what I do because</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.450" end="00:07:09.990" style="s2">I&#39;m so curious and so fascinated by by</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.950" end="00:07:13.260" style="s2">the way things work and what they the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.990" end="00:07:17.060" style="s2">questions of why right and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.260" end="00:07:20.220" style="s2">always seeking truth even as a kid like</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.060" end="00:07:22.110" style="s2">how does this work why does it work but</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.220" end="00:07:24.810" style="s2">the system that I was put into and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.110" end="00:07:27.510" style="s2">literally physically the desks I was put</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.810" end="00:07:29.760" style="s2">into we&#39;re like little torture chambers</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.510" end="00:07:34.350" style="s2">and and my creativity was actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.760" end="00:07:36.780" style="s2">discouraged and and was you know almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.350" end="00:07:38.190" style="s2">forced you know forced to join the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.780" end="00:07:39.810" style="s2">basketball team because I was having</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.190" end="00:07:41.310" style="s2">behavioral problems and their solution</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.810" end="00:07:42.390" style="s2">was like cool make him conform to</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.310" end="00:07:44.160" style="s2">something that makes him even more</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.390" end="00:07:45.810" style="s2">insecure and feel like even more of an</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.160" end="00:07:48.060" style="s2">outsider being the kid with the long</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.810" end="00:07:50.100" style="s2">hair and refusing to wear the right</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.060" end="00:07:52.020" style="s2">shoes so I wore my vans and slid around</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.100" end="00:07:53.640" style="s2">the court and got made fun of and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.020" end="00:07:56.250" style="s2">know harassed and picked on and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.640" end="00:07:58.200" style="s2">like that and it&#39;s like once I turned</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.250" end="00:08:00.060" style="s2">the day turned 18 I quit high school I</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.200" end="00:08:01.740" style="s2">was marking it off on my calendar like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.060" end="00:08:03.570" style="s2">prisoner you know putting notches on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.740" end="00:08:06.870" style="s2">wall is like marking the calendar talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.570" end="00:08:09.150" style="s2">tober 29th 1988 and that was the day of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.870" end="00:08:11.100" style="s2">freedom and from that moment on once I</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.150" end="00:08:13.620" style="s2">left school then I became obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.100" end="00:08:15.570" style="s2">learning and so it&#39;s so interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.620" end="00:08:18.030" style="s2">look from the standpoint of your</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.570" end="00:08:20.550" style="s2">perspective because it wasn&#39;t that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.030" end="00:08:23.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to learn it&#39;s that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.550" end="00:08:26.370" style="s2">want to learn that way that those topics</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.280" end="00:08:28.290" style="s2">those topics and that way yes and so now</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.370" end="00:08:31.020" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know here I&#39;m 47 and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.290" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">like I&#39;m like the most curious child</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.020" end="00:08:35.460" style="s2">like energy I think there is I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:37.020" style="s2">don&#39;t know anyone that&#39;s as curious is</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.460" end="00:08:38.250" style="s2">me about the way things work and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.020" end="00:08:40.500" style="s2">such a gift to be able to interview</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.250" end="00:08:43.680" style="s2">people yeah and and really learn about</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.500" end="00:08:45.450" style="s2">this stuff so so that&#39;s so no note how</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.680" end="00:08:47.640" style="s2">fortuitous that your parents you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.450" end="00:08:49.710" style="s2">you were so situated that your parents</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.640" end="00:08:49.980" style="s2">got that right you had an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.710" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.980" end="00:08:56.370" style="s2">different paths now is because you</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:58.410" style="s2">didn&#39;t actually identify you you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.370" end="00:09:00.120" style="s2">actually succeed at school in that way</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.410" end="00:09:00.810" style="s2">that you were able to actually do</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.120" end="00:09:02.190" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.810" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">to the degree you succeed at it then</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.190" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">you&#39;re trapped by the continuation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:08.519" style="s2">that curve forever so notice the smarter</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.480" end="00:09:10.910" style="s2">the kids are smart meaning good at that</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.519" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">particular definition of smart the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.910" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">earlier we push them in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:15.209" style="s2">hyperspecialization</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:17.100" style="s2">right we want to get them in AP classes</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.209" end="00:09:18.120" style="s2">towards their specialty young and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.100" end="00:09:20.190" style="s2">the further we push them in</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.120" end="00:09:22.709" style="s2">specialization so by the time they do</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.190" end="00:09:23.880" style="s2">their dissertation 10 people in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.709" end="00:09:26.100" style="s2">world know what the they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.880" end="00:09:28.199" style="s2">about so they know so much about such a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.100" end="00:09:29.970" style="s2">narrow area so they&#39;re not thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.199" end="00:09:32.310" style="s2">about big picture things or thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.970" end="00:09:36.180" style="s2">interdisciplinary things at all that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.310" end="00:09:38.630" style="s2">means that the smartest people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.180" end="00:09:40.470" style="s2">actually questioning macroeconomics and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.630" end="00:09:42.060" style="s2">questioning culture and questioning</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.470" end="00:09:44.190" style="s2">governance questioning the foundational</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.060" end="00:09:46.440" style="s2">axioms of how we do academia or science</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.190" end="00:09:47.940" style="s2">because they&#39;re they&#39;re just doing one</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.440" end="00:09:51.630" style="s2">tiny little thing so we&#39;re training them</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.940" end="00:09:54.300" style="s2">to be very sharp cogs in the industrial</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.630" end="00:09:56.490" style="s2">way yeah that&#39;s true and the only people</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.300" end="00:09:57.930" style="s2">are usually left thinking about any big</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.490" end="00:09:59.490" style="s2">picture things are people that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.930" end="00:10:00.930" style="s2">have those types of proclivities and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.490" end="00:10:03.149" style="s2">that is that your way of taking things</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.930" end="00:10:05.010" style="s2">that could be dangerous and making them</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.149" end="00:10:07.139" style="s2">not only not dangerous but very good</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.010" end="00:10:09.959" style="s2">tools of the continuation of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.139" end="00:10:11.910" style="s2">particular system and so because you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.959" end="00:10:13.110" style="s2">didn&#39;t actually do that well at it then</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.910" end="00:10:14.610" style="s2">you were able to say I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.110" end="00:10:17.190" style="s2">to do something totally different right</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.610" end="00:10:18.449" style="s2">well that that it&#39;s interesting it</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.190" end="00:10:20.130" style="s2">reminds me of something I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.449" end="00:10:22.079" style="s2">about on the show and there was this I</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.130" end="00:10:24.810" style="s2">gotta find this freaking it was some</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.079" end="00:10:25.980" style="s2">study or evaluation or paper or</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.810" end="00:10:27.350" style="s2">something that I came across at one</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.980" end="00:10:30.750" style="s2">point and it was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.350" end="00:10:32.970" style="s2">entrepreneurship and how the top 10</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.750" end="00:10:35.459" style="s2">people with the highest IQs in the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.970" end="00:10:37.110" style="s2">all work for someone else and all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.459" end="00:10:39.300" style="s2">great inventors and the you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.110" end="00:10:40.829" style="s2">monumental colossal entrepreneurs in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.300" end="00:10:43.230" style="s2">world dropped out of high school didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.829" end="00:10:47.880" style="s2">go to college I mean it&#39;s this universal</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.230" end="00:10:49.829" style="s2">trend that the smartest people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.880" end="00:10:52.230" style="s2">think outside of the box and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.829" end="00:10:53.819" style="s2">theory was that the people that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.230" end="00:10:54.930" style="s2">describing that are highly specialized</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.819" end="00:10:58.500" style="s2">and that rise to the top of their class</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.930" end="00:11:00.630" style="s2">intellectually that they&#39;re so smart</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.500" end="00:11:02.590" style="s2">that they&#39;re able to over calculate the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.630" end="00:11:05.980" style="s2">risks involved in event</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.590" end="00:11:07.420" style="s2">of creativity whereas if you have a more</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.980" end="00:11:08.650" style="s2">of a visionary creative type that</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.420" end="00:11:10.810" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit within that box but also</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.650" end="00:11:14.050" style="s2">obviously still has a certain degree of</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.940" end="00:11:51.550" style="s2">think about this if the kid who gets a</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.140" end="00:12:16.390" style="s2">you can extend it a little bit which you</p>

<p begin="00:12:37.900" end="00:12:44.980" style="s2">so true so when when kids are praised</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.820" end="00:12:48.790" style="s2">for getting things right you them</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.980" end="00:12:51.160" style="s2">up because a number of things one so</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.790" end="00:12:53.710" style="s2">think about this in general all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.160" end="00:12:55.480" style="s2">praise that kids get is when they do</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.710" end="00:12:57.640" style="s2">something that the authority wants them</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.480" end="00:12:59.290" style="s2">to do and has already designated as</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.640" end="00:13:00.490" style="s2">right and good and true right so whether</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.490" end="00:13:04.300" style="s2">parents they get praised for doing what</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.890" end="00:13:06.280" style="s2">someone else wanted them to do they</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.300" end="00:13:07.810" style="s2">almost always get punishment for doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.280" end="00:13:09.670" style="s2">things that made sense to them that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.810" end="00:13:13.380" style="s2">wanted to do so this is how you</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.670" end="00:13:15.840" style="s2">conditioned people to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.380" end="00:13:18.300" style="s2">well you know cogs within an</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.840" end="00:13:20.700" style="s2">authoritarian system where we defer our</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.300" end="00:13:23.130" style="s2">own agency our ability to assess the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.700" end="00:13:25.290" style="s2">world in our own agency to somebody that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.130" end="00:13:26.310" style="s2">knows better than us and the teacher the</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.310" end="00:13:32.460" style="s2">represent that and then it becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.440" end="00:13:35.820" style="s2">boss and the you know macroeconomy the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.460" end="00:13:39.810" style="s2">state the etc writ large and so if we</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.820" end="00:13:41.820" style="s2">want people that actually can really be</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.810" end="00:13:44.310" style="s2">innovative we can&#39;t train them that way</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.820" end="00:13:47.640" style="s2">we have to train them to self assess and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.310" end="00:13:49.440" style="s2">self initiate and not actually get hits</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.640" end="00:13:51.720" style="s2">of praise from getting something right</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.440" end="00:13:53.280" style="s2">that others already figured out and when</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.720" end="00:13:55.230" style="s2">we do that like oftentimes there&#39;s a kid</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.280" end="00:13:57.930" style="s2">who becomes a Spelling Bee champion or</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.230" end="00:13:59.610" style="s2">math genius because they just happen to</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.930" end="00:14:01.230" style="s2"> figure out like how spelling</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.610" end="00:14:03.330" style="s2">works or how math works and they got so</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.230" end="00:14:04.620" style="s2">much praise for it and they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.330" end="00:14:07.050" style="s2">getting enough unconditional love</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.620" end="00:14:09.840" style="s2">otherwise that they were optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.050" end="00:14:12.210" style="s2">the extrinsic reward associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.840" end="00:14:14.550" style="s2">math of getting the prey is even though</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.210" end="00:14:15.960" style="s2">they might actually hate math or be not</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.550" end="00:14:17.630" style="s2">terribly interested in that they just</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.960" end="00:14:20.520" style="s2">happened to get it if you didn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.630" end="00:14:21.870" style="s2">then you might find math is alright but</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.520" end="00:14:23.580" style="s2">they&#39;re actually fascinated by art and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.870" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">so then they can become very good at</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.580" end="00:14:28.020" style="s2">something they have no passion for and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:32.580" style="s2">it&#39;s all based on extrinsic motive that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.020" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">is damaging intrinsic motive why do you</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.580" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">have kids</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:38.340" style="s2">I don&#39;t have kids like you get great dad</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">dude I was picturing your kid man</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.340" end="00:14:42.780" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be so well developed if</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:43.410" style="s2">and when you have them I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.780" end="00:14:45.570" style="s2">don&#39;t either</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.410" end="00:14:48.870" style="s2">and I think partially because I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.570" end="00:14:50.430" style="s2">terrified of not doing a good job of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.870" end="00:14:52.770" style="s2">because I still feel like I&#39;m doing so</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.430" end="00:14:56.010" style="s2">much work on myself but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.770" end="00:14:58.140" style="s2">interesting to think about a generation</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.010" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">of people close to our age that have an</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.140" end="00:15:02.490" style="s2">understanding of things in this way that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:05.430" style="s2">can actually assure in the next</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.490" end="00:15:07.560" style="s2">generation of human that is allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.430" end="00:15:11.220" style="s2">express their full potential without</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.560" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">being confined into this system and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.220" end="00:15:16.080" style="s2">most of the people that have the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:19.170" style="s2">have have had the deepest exploration</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.080" end="00:15:22.280" style="s2">about the nature of reality either</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.170" end="00:15:24.170" style="s2">aren&#39;t having kids because they see</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.280" end="00:15:25.820" style="s2">how much is wrong with the world and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.170" end="00:15:27.530" style="s2">they&#39;re applying that creative and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.820" end="00:15:28.940" style="s2">parental energy to trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.530" end="00:15:33.260" style="s2">problems in the world or they don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.940" end="00:15:34.790" style="s2">secure enough in the world with nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.260" end="00:15:36.290" style="s2">war looming again for the first time in</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.790" end="00:15:39.650" style="s2">macroeconomic collapse and climate</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.290" end="00:15:45.260" style="s2">change etc to want to bring kids in so</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.650" end="00:15:46.700" style="s2">yep so ok so moving on into I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.260" end="00:15:48.470" style="s2">there&#39;s so much I mean there&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.700" end="00:15:49.670" style="s2">literally so much to unpack in any one</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.470" end="00:15:51.530" style="s2">of these topics but there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.670" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">things I want to cover with you but the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.530" end="00:15:54.320" style="s2">education thing definitely piqued my</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:55.940" style="s2">interest just learning that you were</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.320" end="00:15:57.890" style="s2">homeschooled but you&#39;re a really bright</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.940" end="00:16:01.130" style="s2">guy so where&#39;s the connection and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.890" end="00:16:03.320" style="s2">making sense now what about see I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.130" end="00:16:05.180" style="s2">go to college to me higher education was</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.320" end="00:16:07.310" style="s2">moved to Hollywood play in a band deal</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.180" end="00:16:10.220" style="s2">drugs done I mean I had it figured out</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.310" end="00:16:12.890" style="s2">so I thought then I went to LA CC for</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.220" end="00:16:14.390" style="s2">like two weeks I took health and which</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.890" end="00:16:15.830" style="s2">you know later I guess came to serve me</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.390" end="00:16:17.930" style="s2">if I only made it two weeks and I took</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.830" end="00:16:19.850" style="s2">health and classical guitar I was like</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.930" end="00:16:20.810" style="s2">oh cool learn how to play rad guitar go</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.850" end="00:16:22.580" style="s2">in there like oh we&#39;re gonna learn how</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.810" end="00:16:25.310" style="s2">to read music I was like no that&#39;s math</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.580" end="00:16:26.960" style="s2">I&#39;m out but when I look at higher</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.310" end="00:16:29.510" style="s2">education now just from what I see in</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.960" end="00:16:31.280" style="s2">social media there&#39;s this just where we</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.510" end="00:16:34.850" style="s2">are culturally is so interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.280" end="00:16:36.400" style="s2">this millennial generation I read</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.850" end="00:16:38.750" style="s2">something the other day for example that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.400" end="00:16:41.570" style="s2">they surveyed a bunch of Millennials and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.750" end="00:16:44.270" style="s2">50% of them indicated that they would</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.570" end="00:16:45.550" style="s2">prefer communism over capitalism you</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.270" end="00:16:49.880" style="s2">know and there&#39;s this whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.550" end="00:16:51.980" style="s2">post-modernism and and Marxist ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.880" end="00:16:54.170" style="s2">all this to me really crazy stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.980" end="00:16:55.940" style="s2">this seemed to have seeped its way into</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.170" end="00:16:58.070" style="s2">higher education and you have this</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.940" end="00:17:00.950" style="s2">generation of kids that are in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.070" end="00:17:04.520" style="s2">weird Orwellian 1984 thought police</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.950" end="00:17:07.010" style="s2">political correct insanity like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.520" end="00:17:08.810" style="s2">the deal with with that right now and do</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.010" end="00:17:10.189" style="s2">you know what I&#39;m talking about and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.810" end="00:17:13.339" style="s2">and do you think this has been</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.189" end="00:17:16.670" style="s2">perpetuated intentionally or is this</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.339" end="00:17:20.089" style="s2">just a natural progression of a plus B</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.670" end="00:17:23.180" style="s2">equals C and how things have carried on</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.089" end="00:17:26.390" style="s2">alright that&#39;s it like quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.180" end="00:17:29.990" style="s2">really deep topics mixed together and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.390" end="00:17:31.400" style="s2">unwound yeah so post-modernism as one</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.990" end="00:17:32.030" style="s2">topic in its relationship to higher</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.400" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.030" end="00:17:35.460" style="s2">okay the trend of higher education writ</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:38.130" style="s2">large and the other issue</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.460" end="00:17:40.770" style="s2">beyond post-modernism looking at macro</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.130" end="00:17:42.540" style="s2">economy and questioning capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.770" end="00:17:45.030" style="s2">looking at other macroeconomic systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.540" end="00:17:47.430" style="s2">and generational dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.030" end="00:17:48.990" style="s2">millenials are expressing are all</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.430" end="00:17:50.730" style="s2">important and they&#39;re somewhat tight but</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.990" end="00:17:52.230" style="s2">they&#39;re also some different dynamics so</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.730" end="00:17:54.750" style="s2">in my classic interview style I just</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.230" end="00:17:57.420" style="s2">asked six questions under one umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.750" end="00:17:59.130" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;ll take a stab at any part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.420" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">that to me I&#39;m just you know I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.130" end="00:18:03.030" style="s2">zoomed out and I&#39;m looking at things</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:04.860" style="s2">that I see like that like we kids don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.030" end="00:18:07.020" style="s2">understand communism doesn&#39;t work how</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.860" end="00:18:09.750" style="s2">did we get there you know it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.020" end="00:18:11.670" style="s2">so bizarre to me in this whole I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.750" end="00:18:14.100" style="s2">know the climate of so there&#39;s free</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.670" end="00:18:16.140" style="s2">speech being crushed unless they people</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.100" end="00:18:19.140" style="s2">agree with you like the sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.140" end="00:18:23.550" style="s2">snowflake weird safeSpace whole College</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.140" end="00:18:25.740" style="s2">thing okay so the issue as I see it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.550" end="00:18:27.870" style="s2">actually quite nuanced and complex and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.740" end="00:18:32.040" style="s2">most of the reactionary simplistic takes</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.870" end="00:18:34.500" style="s2">on it are part of the problem so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.040" end="00:18:38.190" style="s2">explore this nuance all right cool so</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.500" end="00:18:39.480" style="s2">let&#39;s take em the issue of race okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.190" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">which is right at the heart of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.480" end="00:18:45.180" style="s2">topic we can make it race we can look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:46.950" style="s2">gender we can look at transgender LGBTQ</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.180" end="00:18:49.350" style="s2">we can look at any of those dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.950" end="00:18:50.820" style="s2">that are part of the the identity</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.350" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">politics part you&#39;re bringing up right</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.820" end="00:18:57.210" style="s2">now this is related to post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:18:58.890" style="s2">and it derives some of its intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.210" end="00:19:01.380" style="s2">basis from post-modernism but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.890" end="00:19:03.000" style="s2">related to some other key things so if</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.380" end="00:19:04.980" style="s2">we look at race and we look at black</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.000" end="00:19:14.100" style="s2">lives matter or people of color movement</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.980" end="00:19:18.450" style="s2">or etc we have not ever properly dealt</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.100" end="00:19:20.520" style="s2">with the fact that this country was that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.450" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">this land that we call this country was</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.520" end="00:19:25.670" style="s2">fully inhabited by lots of nations of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:29.850" style="s2">people that would completely slaughtered</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.670" end="00:19:31.620" style="s2">to make this land right it was we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.850" end="00:19:32.490" style="s2">gonna we&#39;re getting taxation without</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.620" end="00:19:34.020" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.490" end="00:19:35.370" style="s2">in London we don&#39;t want to be here</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.020" end="00:19:36.900" style="s2">anymore so we&#39;re gonna go somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.370" end="00:19:38.550" style="s2">and hey look there&#39;s a whole continent</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.900" end="00:19:40.170" style="s2">that&#39;s totally free because we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.550" end="00:19:41.880" style="s2">better military than equipment than they</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.170" end="00:19:45.180" style="s2">do so we can kill all those people and</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.880" end="00:19:47.070" style="s2">take the whole land there&#39;s a real moral</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.180" end="00:19:48.540" style="s2"> problem - having your moral</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.070" end="00:19:49.020" style="s2">legitimacy as the United States of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.540" end="00:19:50.430" style="s2">America</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.020" end="00:19:52.740" style="s2">beautiful Constitution Declaration of</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.430" end="00:19:55.310" style="s2">Independence being based on genocide and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.740" end="00:19:57.660" style="s2">we&#39;re pretty happy to acknowledge like</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.310" end="00:19:59.340" style="s2">after Germany&#39;s genocide they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.660" end="00:20:01.290" style="s2">up right there&#39;s a whole cultural thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.340" end="00:20:04.410" style="s2">but our genocide was not that long</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.290" end="00:20:06.360" style="s2">before and it was more people there was</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.410" end="00:20:09.420" style="s2">a lot more people wow that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.360" end="00:20:12.570" style="s2">and it was the genocide of the Native</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.420" end="00:20:15.360" style="s2">American people employing the slavery of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.570" end="00:20:17.370" style="s2">the Africans and we mean real</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.360" end="00:20:19.050" style="s2">slavery like captured the people by</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.370" end="00:20:20.370" style="s2">military force killed lots of them</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.050" end="00:20:23.910" style="s2">tortured and killed lots of them</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.370" end="00:20:26.070" style="s2">lynching etc and we like we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.910" end="00:20:28.050" style="s2">to really acknowledge that this country</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.070" end="00:20:29.790" style="s2">was built with that it was built with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.050" end="00:20:34.050" style="s2">pretty decent amount of Chinese slavery</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.790" end="00:20:41.370" style="s2">a lot of African slavery and one major</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.050" end="00:20:42.750" style="s2">genocide alright so then we&#39;ve got you</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.370" end="00:20:43.980" style="s2">know we have to fight a war to finally</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.750" end="00:20:46.680" style="s2">get rid of slavery not that long ago</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.980" end="00:20:48.120" style="s2">like really not that long ago where</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.680" end="00:20:50.460" style="s2">there are old people alive today that</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.120" end="00:20:52.800" style="s2">still remember elements of slavery</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.460" end="00:20:56.130" style="s2">dynamics right like that&#39;s a big deal to</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.800" end="00:20:58.110" style="s2">get but then ok so we abolish slavery</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.130" end="00:20:59.430" style="s2">without abolishing the mindset that was</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.110" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">associated with it so a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.430" end="00:21:02.490" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to gone so then we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.720" end="00:21:07.290" style="s2">Jim Crow and segregation and all that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.490" end="00:21:10.110" style="s2">and then we kind of overturn that kinda</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.290" end="00:21:12.450" style="s2">right but slaves actually economically</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.110" end="00:21:13.770" style="s2">work really well it&#39;s kind of nice to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.450" end="00:21:14.970" style="s2">able to have people do all the work</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.770" end="00:21:16.470" style="s2">and not get paid and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.970" end="00:21:17.850" style="s2">concentrate the profit margins and as</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.470" end="00:21:19.890" style="s2">soon as you don&#39;t want to do that with</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.850" end="00:21:21.060" style="s2">the slaves now people got to take you</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.890" end="00:21:22.500" style="s2">know other people have to take the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.060" end="00:21:24.300" style="s2">jobs and who wants to jobs and now</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.500" end="00:21:26.310" style="s2">you have to dilute the profit margin to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.300" end="00:21:28.970" style="s2">pay minimum wages so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.310" end="00:21:31.310" style="s2">people that didn&#39;t like that right for</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.970" end="00:21:34.530" style="s2">legitimate understandable reasons and</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.310" end="00:21:36.450" style="s2">they could justify making another group</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.530" end="00:21:38.790" style="s2">of people different enough that slavery</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.450" end="00:21:42.150" style="s2">was better than their own sacrifice in</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.790" end="00:21:46.500" style="s2">that zero sum game dynamic right or near</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.150" end="00:21:49.920" style="s2">zero-sum games anyway and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.500" end="00:21:51.870" style="s2">okay so now it&#39;s not full segregation</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.920" end="00:21:53.010" style="s2">legally but that mindset still there and</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.870" end="00:21:56.100" style="s2">the people who are coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.010" end="00:21:57.740" style="s2">segregation have generations of trauma</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.100" end="00:22:00.420" style="s2">and no education and no inheritance</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.740" end="00:22:02.190" style="s2">right as opposed to people who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.420" end="00:22:02.530" style="s2">coming from generations of education in</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.190" end="00:22:04.630" style="s2">hair</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.530" end="00:22:07.120" style="s2">and not the same types of trauma so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.630" end="00:22:09.070" style="s2">have the ghetto phenomena and what that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.120" end="00:22:11.020" style="s2">means and we we know how epigenetic</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.070" end="00:22:13.180" style="s2">trauma works now generationally right we</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.020" end="00:22:15.700" style="s2">know how mimetic trauma works and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.180" end="00:22:20.200" style="s2">then we look at do we still have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.700" end="00:22:21.220" style="s2">system of systemic injustice yes we</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.200" end="00:22:22.990" style="s2">still have a system of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.220" end="00:22:25.210" style="s2">injustice and anyway person who wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.990" end="00:22:26.710" style="s2">just train to be black recognizes that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.210" end="00:22:28.360" style="s2">the ethics of the pie slice theorem</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.710" end="00:22:32.020" style="s2">aren&#39;t in place right pie slice theorem</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.360" end="00:22:33.850" style="s2">is if it&#39;s just there is a cemetry right</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.020" end="00:22:35.170" style="s2">between you and I which is all kite the</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.650" end="00:22:49.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem and that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.440" end="00:22:51.640" style="s2">dynamic here so there is a real response</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:54.610" style="s2">to unresolved trauma that is still</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.640" end="00:22:56.530" style="s2">affecting things now that said the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.610" end="00:22:59.350" style="s2">response is coming from a place that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.530" end="00:23:01.450" style="s2">largely influenced by trauma rather than</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.350" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2">clear strategy and trauma usually</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.450" end="00:23:05.500" style="s2">perpetuates itself and so if a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.240" end="00:23:09.370" style="s2">people with black lives matter is saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.500" end="00:23:11.230" style="s2">hey there are real issues where where</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.370" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">there are a lot of black people who are</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.230" end="00:23:16.420" style="s2">getting killed by police for reasons</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:18.010" style="s2">that are totally unfounded and then not</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.420" end="00:23:19.180" style="s2">getting prosecuted in the same way not</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.010" end="00:23:21.400" style="s2">getting attention in the same way like</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.180" end="00:23:23.350" style="s2">that&#39;s a real deal and how does anyone</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.400" end="00:23:25.300" style="s2">go about trying to go to school and feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.350" end="00:23:27.370" style="s2">safe when you can be going to school</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.370" end="00:23:32.260" style="s2">that kind of dynamic occur all right so</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.340" end="00:23:35.190" style="s2">then they go shut down a freeway out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.260" end="00:23:37.660" style="s2">like upset and anger whatever and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.190" end="00:23:39.810" style="s2">while that&#39;s trying to get attention for</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.660" end="00:23:42.430" style="s2">something that is real it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.810" end="00:23:45.750" style="s2">strategically problematic right because</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.430" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">then you have the alt-right largely</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.750" end="00:23:51.400" style="s2">arising as a response to those type of</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:52.690" style="s2">dynamics saying look our way of life</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.400" end="00:23:57.040" style="s2">that we care about is being threatened</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.690" end="00:23:58.870" style="s2">and look these people are rioting and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.040" end="00:24:01.090" style="s2">causing chaos and whatever they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.870" end="00:24:03.970" style="s2">validating our ideas about them not</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.090" end="00:24:07.450" style="s2">being strategic good thinkers etc and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.970" end="00:24:09.370" style="s2">and because of a postmodern dynamic that</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.450" end="00:24:11.140" style="s2">in general the progressive left has it</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.370" end="00:24:13.120" style="s2">makes it harder for them to cohere</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.140" end="00:24:14.890" style="s2">because they want to validate everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">perspective because they&#39;re suffering</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.890" end="00:24:18.190" style="s2">they&#39;re still in response</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:20.470" style="s2">to the pain of imperialism or one in</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.190" end="00:24:22.299" style="s2">perspective is imposed on everyone so</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.470" end="00:24:23.799" style="s2">part of the response is to say hey</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.299" end="00:24:24.970" style="s2">everybody actually has a perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.799" end="00:24:26.290" style="s2">the perspective that you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.970" end="00:24:28.299" style="s2">just true because it&#39;s science or</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.290" end="00:24:29.559" style="s2">whatever a lot of our social science</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.299" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">that arose at the same time as our</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.559" end="00:24:34.169" style="s2">physical science was actually just</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:37.030" style="s2">imperialism and so post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.169" end="00:24:39.370" style="s2">emerged amongst I&#39;m radically</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.030" end="00:24:42.370" style="s2">simplifying here post-modernism emerged</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.370" end="00:24:45.190" style="s2">with a partial meaningful truth which</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.370" end="00:24:46.510" style="s2">was to say this is just objectively true</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.190" end="00:24:48.160" style="s2">this is science we did the right</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.510" end="00:24:50.230" style="s2">epistemology subjectively true and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.160" end="00:24:51.580" style="s2">true for everybody doesn&#39;t acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.230" end="00:24:53.140" style="s2">that especially as we get into the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.580" end="00:24:56.710" style="s2">social sciences there&#39;s a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.140" end="00:24:59.110" style="s2">bias right and so we you know we went</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.710" end="00:25:01.210" style="s2">looking for monogamy and pair-bonding in</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.110" end="00:25:03.809" style="s2">the animal kingdom because of Victorian</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.210" end="00:25:06.820" style="s2">age ideas that actually made us do</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.809" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">zoology badly right and so we&#39;d like we</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.820" end="00:25:09.669" style="s2">see that kind of thing everywhere so</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:11.799" style="s2">post Martin said actually different</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.669" end="00:25:13.240" style="s2">perspectives on reality running</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.799" end="00:25:14.919" style="s2">different experiments end up yielding</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.240" end="00:25:17.620" style="s2">different kind of insights and we still</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.919" end="00:25:19.419" style="s2">know that are you healthiest on a vegan</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.620" end="00:25:21.580" style="s2">diet or a paleo diet I can show you just</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.419" end="00:25:23.169" style="s2">as much research on both of</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.580" end="00:25:25.960" style="s2">those that look at different metrics</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.169" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">right and so whether I&#39;m looking at pH</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.960" end="00:25:30.580" style="s2">or I&#39;m looking at insulin levels or I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:32.110" style="s2">looking at telomere levels like I&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.580" end="00:25:34.450" style="s2">different answers and also which</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.110" end="00:25:36.669" style="s2">populations but when I try and reduce</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.450" end="00:25:38.169" style="s2">health to some finite set of metrics and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.669" end="00:25:40.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a million metrics that</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.169" end="00:25:43.030" style="s2">we can&#39;t calculate I can get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.570" end="00:25:45.190" style="s2">partial answers that seem like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.030" end="00:25:46.390" style="s2">answer and seem like complete science</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.190" end="00:25:48.490" style="s2">because I&#39;m studying a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.390" end="00:25:50.260" style="s2">system in a very simplistic way so bias</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.490" end="00:25:51.580" style="s2">is very easy when you trying to set a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.260" end="00:25:52.900" style="s2">complex system in a simple way because</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.580" end="00:25:53.890" style="s2">your metrics look really clear</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.900" end="00:25:56.250" style="s2">that they just don&#39;t happen to be all</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.890" end="00:25:58.120" style="s2">the metrics that matter and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.250" end="00:25:59.830" style="s2">post-modernism acknowledged that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.120" end="00:26:03.880" style="s2">said hey all the perspectives actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.830" end="00:26:06.610" style="s2">have to be factored now there was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.880" end="00:26:10.600" style="s2">of virulent version of that that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.610" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">acknowledge there all the perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.600" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">should be acknowledged but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:14.860" style="s2">all going to be equally true some of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:16.330" style="s2">them can have distortion in them so we</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.860" end="00:26:18.730" style="s2">need to be able to bet for distortion</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.330" end="00:26:21.450" style="s2">and all the perspectives are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.730" end="00:26:24.309" style="s2">less different in simpler systems so in</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.450" end="00:26:25.630" style="s2">chemistry the epistemology is more</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.309" end="00:26:27.549" style="s2">straightforward than it is in social</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.630" end="00:26:28.470" style="s2">sciences and some of the virulent</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.549" end="00:26:30.390" style="s2">version of</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.470" end="00:26:33.450" style="s2">post-modernism to start rejecting truth</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.390" end="00:26:35.270" style="s2">writ large right like any claim of truth</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.450" end="00:26:37.710" style="s2">as a clip is an imperialist claim and</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.270" end="00:26:41.039" style="s2">nobody can claim truth and all</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.710" end="00:26:42.870" style="s2">perspectives are equally true and but we</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.039" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">can see that that was a virulent version</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.870" end="00:26:50.880" style="s2">of an appropriate response or a to Abram</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:53.309" style="s2">period is &#39;m capitalism along with</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.880" end="00:26:55.650" style="s2">fucking&#39;s like you know colonialism like</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.309" end="00:26:57.900" style="s2">all kind of Co emerged and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.650" end="00:26:59.340" style="s2">untangle those was like part of the goal</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.900" end="00:27:00.260" style="s2">there so if you actually read Foucault</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.340" end="00:27:02.820" style="s2">or dare at all</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.260" end="00:27:05.039" style="s2">there&#39;s meaningful good thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.820" end="00:27:06.929" style="s2">there most of what you see happening</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.039" end="00:27:08.909" style="s2">that tries to intellectually reify</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.929" end="00:27:10.470" style="s2">itself with those people is not actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.909" end="00:27:12.539" style="s2">being done very well but that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.470" end="00:27:13.799" style="s2">trauma is influencing a lot of it but</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.539" end="00:27:15.630" style="s2">then on the other side we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.799" end="00:27:19.230" style="s2">actually taken responsibility to deal</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.630" end="00:27:21.809" style="s2">with that that trauma was created so</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.230" end="00:27:24.350" style="s2">when I say it&#39;s nuanced it is and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.809" end="00:27:27.240" style="s2">really big deal because if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.350" end="00:27:30.360" style="s2">the all the alt-right and the control</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.240" end="00:27:32.520" style="s2">left they have moved to a level of</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.360" end="00:27:34.580" style="s2">polarization and radicalization that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.520" end="00:27:38.429" style="s2">very hard to imagine how that reconciles</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.580" end="00:27:42.470" style="s2">and with a tremendous amount of fear on</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.429" end="00:27:44.850" style="s2">both sides and trauma on both sides and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.470" end="00:27:47.130" style="s2">associated with that the desire for</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.850" end="00:27:49.200" style="s2">secession from the nation the desire for</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.130" end="00:27:51.059" style="s2">whatever that leads to war in a world</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:52.140" style="s2">where military technology assets that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.059" end="00:27:53.640" style="s2">don&#39;t get to make it through wars the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.140" end="00:27:54.870" style="s2">way we did in the past and so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.640" end="00:27:56.370" style="s2">hey look we fought a war with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.870" end="00:27:58.409" style="s2">British to come get this area and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.370" end="00:28:01.770" style="s2">worked well yeah we had muskets</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.409" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">right and as the military technology</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.770" end="00:28:05.730" style="s2">goes up it becomes more and more</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">problematic and when we get to the level</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.730" end="00:28:11.400" style="s2">where you have decentralized exponential</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:13.919" style="s2">technology which is where we&#39;re at right</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.400" end="00:28:18.179" style="s2">now we don&#39;t get to make it through Wars</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.919" end="00:28:19.470" style="s2">anymore and humanity has always had</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.179" end="00:28:21.390" style="s2">different dynamics that led us to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.470" end="00:28:22.710" style="s2">polarization and radicalization and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.390" end="00:28:24.360" style="s2">war and we have to actually learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.710" end="00:28:26.460" style="s2"> deal with that and part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.360" end="00:28:28.400" style="s2">we have to be able to understand how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.460" end="00:28:31.429" style="s2">take multiple perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.400" end="00:28:34.710" style="s2">they have partial truth that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.429" end="00:28:36.030" style="s2">successful parts you know find the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.710" end="00:28:38.850" style="s2">successful parts and figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.030" end="00:28:40.350" style="s2">do dialectic how to do synthesis and be</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.850" end="00:28:41.910" style="s2">able to find a solution that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.350" end="00:28:43.290" style="s2">just solve for some things well</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.910" end="00:28:44.910" style="s2">journalizing harm to something else it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.290" end="00:28:47.880" style="s2">effective but actually sold for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.910" end="00:28:51.180" style="s2">whole set okay so that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.880" end="00:28:53.850" style="s2">post-modernism snowflake part that makes</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.180" end="00:28:56.550" style="s2">perfect sense because to me looking from</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.850" end="00:28:59.730" style="s2">the outside I&#39;m like I I see the trauma</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.550" end="00:29:03.540" style="s2">and I see that these young people that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.730" end="00:29:06.090" style="s2">are wrapped up in that ideology I see</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.540" end="00:29:07.230" style="s2">them as victims you know and but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.090" end="00:29:10.620" style="s2">didn&#39;t think about the past I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.230" end="00:29:12.630" style="s2">like your victims of a perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.620" end="00:29:14.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve adopted and I guess because there</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.630" end="00:29:16.530" style="s2">was trauma and I&#39;m just like god it</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.160" end="00:29:18.990" style="s2">feels so bad that this kid thinks the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.530" end="00:29:21.560" style="s2">communism works it&#39;s just like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.990" end="00:29:26.430" style="s2">now I want to address this part yeah</p>

<p begin="00:30:22.730" end="00:30:31.170" style="s2">because if I over fished the ocean right</p>

<p begin="00:30:31.170" end="00:30:34.200" style="s2">take all these fish out of the</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.100" end="00:31:33.850" style="s2">do it inside of a container you work on</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.930" end="00:31:35.970" style="s2">AI and it fails and sometimes it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.850" end="00:31:40.300" style="s2">work and sometimes it kills everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.970" end="00:31:42.610" style="s2">because it is an autopoietic tech it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.300" end="00:31:44.350" style="s2">a self-organizing self authoring tech</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.610" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">light bulb isn&#39;t it works or it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:50.650" style="s2">but biotech right where you make a new</p>

<p begin="00:31:50.650" end="00:31:55.570" style="s2">and it does its own mutation that is a</p>

<p begin="00:31:57.180" end="00:32:01.960" style="s2">and nuclear wasn&#39;t right nuclear is a</p>

<p begin="00:32:01.960" end="00:32:08.410" style="s2">bad but nanotech biotech and AI are</p>

<p begin="00:32:30.460" end="00:32:35.650" style="s2">towards the cliff and the arms race is</p>

<p begin="00:32:40.900" end="00:32:46.180" style="s2">why do we have 600 times that many like</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.920" end="00:32:47.290" style="s2">why the do you keep making nukes</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.180" end="00:32:49.390" style="s2">after you have enough to kill everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.290" end="00:32:50.530" style="s2">down to viruses because if you have a</p>

<p begin="00:32:56.260" end="00:32:58.990" style="s2">supply and demand is a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.460" end="00:33:01.090" style="s2">there&#39;s an initial demand you create a</p>

<p begin="00:33:01.090" end="00:33:03.640" style="s2">you manufacture artificial demand which</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.470" end="00:33:05.320" style="s2">is why we buy all kinds of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.640" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make us happy that we think will</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.410" end="00:33:15.190" style="s2">so capitalism is actually broken</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.620" end="00:33:16.780" style="s2">existentially so there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.190" end="00:33:18.610" style="s2">learned that okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.780" end="00:33:19.780" style="s2">Marxism had some nice ideas and there</p>

<p begin="00:33:20.950" end="00:33:24.130" style="s2">course if we really go study if we never</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.510" end="00:33:25.390" style="s2">implemented Marxism just like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.130" end="00:33:27.040" style="s2">never implemented lazy faire capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.390" end="00:33:29.590" style="s2">we&#39;ve implemented weird models of</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.040" end="00:33:31.570" style="s2">capitalism and by the time the USSR came</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.590" end="00:33:33.880" style="s2">around it was nothing like Marxism for a</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.880" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">actually work at scale it it works that</p>

<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:06.550" style="s2">get researched when the money goes in</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.260" end="00:35:07.990" style="s2">has to have ROI back out of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.550" end="00:35:09.130" style="s2">capitalist system so the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.990" end="00:35:10.960" style="s2">people are recognizing that in</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.130" end="00:35:12.430" style="s2">questioning is a very good thing now the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.960" end="00:35:13.840" style="s2">fact they try to find other things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.430" end="00:35:15.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t work as the answer is just a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.840" end="00:35:17.230" style="s2">basic basically hopelessness and a lack</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.760" end="00:35:20.590" style="s2">of knowing how to go about solving</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.230" end="00:35:21.190" style="s2">something so hard so one of the</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.190" end="00:35:25.329" style="s2">of my life is what is the macroeconomy</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.750" end="00:35:27.069" style="s2">of the future what are the governance</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.329" end="00:35:29.589" style="s2">system sort of the civilization systems</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.069" end="00:35:31.510" style="s2">they can allow us to actually human</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.589" end="00:35:33.819" style="s2">together well without needing to go to</p>

<p begin="00:35:37.089" end="00:35:42.220" style="s2">etc and it&#39;s not any system that has</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.640" end="00:35:43.060" style="s2">ever happened so we can get into that if</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.220" end="00:35:45.099" style="s2">you want to or we can go to other</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.060" end="00:35:47.260" style="s2">directions but also most of the young</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.099" end="00:35:49.390" style="s2">people who say communism what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.260" end="00:35:50.050" style="s2">really saying is Denmark looks better</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.390" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">than here</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.050" end="00:35:55.960" style="s2">like that&#39;s a social kind of dynamic</p>

<p begin="00:36:00.839" end="00:36:06.310" style="s2">largely secular because of that like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.390" end="00:36:07.900" style="s2">Nordic countries just look better they</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.310" end="00:36:09.940" style="s2">are they&#39;re just better there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.900" end="00:36:12.339" style="s2">more socialized dynamics now are they</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.940" end="00:36:16.300" style="s2">better on every metric no if you look</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.339" end="00:36:18.460" style="s2">here we have a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.300" end="00:36:19.869" style="s2">innovation here because of certain types</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.460" end="00:36:24.550" style="s2">of freedoms and a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.869" end="00:36:27.940" style="s2">damage and our bell curve is very spread</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.550" end="00:36:31.150" style="s2">out and so for everyone who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.940" end="00:36:33.880" style="s2">winning at the system to say nobody is</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.150" end="00:36:35.319" style="s2">losing as bad in Denmark as they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.880" end="00:36:36.520" style="s2">here and there&#39;s a lot less of them and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.319" end="00:36:37.630" style="s2">they&#39;re not ruining the environment as</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.520" end="00:36:39.550" style="s2">fast they&#39;re actually figuring their</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.630" end="00:36:42.760" style="s2">trash problem out maybe let&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.550" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">think about this and I&#39;m actually not</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.760" end="00:36:46.810" style="s2">proposing Denmark as a solution I am</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:49.240" style="s2">saying there are a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.810" end="00:36:51.940" style="s2">are actually evidentially better on</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.240" end="00:36:53.589" style="s2">meaningful metrics and things that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.940" end="00:36:56.140" style="s2">adequate to the scope of what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.589" end="00:36:58.180" style="s2">with almost 8 billion people and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.140" end="00:37:02.950" style="s2">distributed exponential technology don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.180" end="00:37:05.319" style="s2">yet exist oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.950" end="00:37:07.000" style="s2">that&#39;s amazing that is a lot to unpack</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.319" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s funny because I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.000" end="00:37:11.740" style="s2">actually talked about any of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:13.780" style="s2">issues on the show it&#39;s always very much</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.740" end="00:37:16.300" style="s2">about meditation or mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.780" end="00:37:18.670" style="s2">spirituality or just full-on health</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.300" end="00:37:20.440" style="s2">stuff but I know that you have a systems</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.670" end="00:37:22.420" style="s2">approach so kind of zooming out and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.440" end="00:37:25.060" style="s2">looking at like whoa what&#39;s even beyond</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.420" end="00:37:27.069" style="s2">hey am i optimizing my sleep or take you</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.060" end="00:37:29.230" style="s2">know how does my blood work look this</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.069" end="00:37:31.530" style="s2">year I mean this is stuff that goes way</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.230" end="00:37:33.300" style="s2">above and beyond that and where we</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.530" end="00:37:35.130" style="s2">from here which is interesting I just</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.300" end="00:37:36.630" style="s2">think it you know I earned the question</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.130" end="00:37:37.910" style="s2">because I I knew that you&#39;d be someone</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.630" end="00:37:41.550" style="s2">that could answer it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.910" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">encouraged more questioning but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.550" end="00:37:45.810" style="s2">such an interesting time to be alive</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:47.790" style="s2">that&#39;s like sometimes it&#39;s hard for me</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.810" end="00:37:49.530" style="s2">not to deviate from my format and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.790" end="00:37:51.930" style="s2">basic topics and get way off into this</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.530" end="00:37:53.910" style="s2">stuff because I&#39;m watching things happen</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.930" end="00:37:56.160" style="s2">that have never happened before as we</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.910" end="00:37:58.460" style="s2">all are right it&#39;s just such a trippy</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.160" end="00:38:00.510" style="s2">time on earth and there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.460" end="00:38:02.820" style="s2">positive things going on and I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.510" end="00:38:04.800" style="s2">there&#39;s this massive awakening thanks to</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.820" end="00:38:06.900" style="s2">people like you and shows like this and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.800" end="00:38:08.730" style="s2">just the proliferation of information</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.900" end="00:38:10.800" style="s2">through social media through the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.730" end="00:38:12.780" style="s2">internet but at the same time it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.800" end="00:38:14.220" style="s2">dark and we are on this you know as you</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.780" end="00:38:17.250" style="s2">said about to go over the waterfall I</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.220" end="00:38:18.870" style="s2">mean we are at the precipice of absolute</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.250" end="00:38:21.810" style="s2">destruction while at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.870" end="00:38:23.430" style="s2">there&#39;s this light that&#39;s really I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.810" end="00:38:25.920" style="s2">we&#39;re in this sort of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.430" end="00:38:28.830" style="s2">evolution at the same time it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.920" end="00:38:30.740" style="s2">interesting so let&#39;s just for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.830" end="00:38:32.760" style="s2">yeah on the are we talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.740" end="00:38:34.410" style="s2">biohacking meditation spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.760" end="00:38:37.650" style="s2">individual optimization are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.410" end="00:38:39.300" style="s2">about interpersonal collective optimist</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.650" end="00:38:40.980" style="s2">well nor that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying normally</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.300" end="00:38:43.080" style="s2">on the show it&#39;s more just subjective</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.980" end="00:38:44.940" style="s2">each person optimizing and then that</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.080" end="00:38:47.160" style="s2">rippling out into the community at large</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.940" end="00:38:48.570" style="s2">right but we&#39;ve sort of like zoomed out</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.160" end="00:38:50.610" style="s2">and are coming back in from the other</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.570" end="00:38:51.960" style="s2">direction so there&#39;s a stomach model</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.610" end="00:38:57.060" style="s2">here&#39;s what we have to think about them</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.960" end="00:38:59.070" style="s2">together if we work on increasing our</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.060" end="00:39:00.990" style="s2">cognitive capacity and our energy and</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.070" end="00:39:02.460" style="s2">etc so that we can do more of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.990" end="00:39:05.490" style="s2">killing the world then we go extinct</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.460" end="00:39:07.290" style="s2">faster because of it all right amazing</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.490" end="00:39:09.750" style="s2">ourselves to like integrate into a</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.290" end="00:39:12.000" style="s2">system that is not working and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.750" end="00:39:15.180" style="s2">most of it right like that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.000" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">we watched as we started you know neuro</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.180" end="00:39:20.850" style="s2">hacker we were looking at the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:24.900" style="s2">smart drug sales going up and smart</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.850" end="00:39:26.850" style="s2">drugs that increased hyper competing</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.900" end="00:39:29.370" style="s2">increased motivation and drive</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.850" end="00:39:31.470" style="s2">well decreasing empathy decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.370" end="00:39:35.400" style="s2">creativity and making hyper competing</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.470" end="00:39:38.100" style="s2">Psychopaths like modafinil that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.400" end="00:39:39.510" style="s2">adderall adder okay but modafinil can do</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.100" end="00:39:42.150" style="s2">things in that direction and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.510" end="00:39:43.470" style="s2">different I just came to I don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.150" end="00:39:44.200" style="s2">adderall but i do min to have an</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.470" end="00:39:47.020" style="s2">elephant</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.200" end="00:39:48.340" style="s2">and when I&#39;m on modafinil I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.020" end="00:39:49.690" style="s2">I&#39;ve become a bad person but I</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.340" end="00:39:52.240" style="s2">definitely am NOT interested in</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.690" end="00:39:54.610" style="s2">interfacing with other humans at all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:56.350" style="s2">like very task-oriented and locked into</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.610" end="00:39:57.850" style="s2">whatever I&#39;m doing which has its place</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.350" end="00:39:59.110" style="s2">but it&#39;s definitely not like hey man I</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.850" end="00:40:01.030" style="s2">should go out and give some hugs right</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.110" end="00:40:03.270" style="s2">now like get out of my way don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.030" end="00:40:05.860" style="s2">interrupt me I&#39;m focused so how did you</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.270" end="00:40:07.810" style="s2">this is the key thing is like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.860" end="00:40:10.060" style="s2">learn how to win at the game that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.810" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">killing the world right no let&#39;s not do</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.060" end="00:40:15.970" style="s2">that right let&#39;s learn how to have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:18.400" style="s2">capacity to create a new game and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.970" end="00:40:21.370" style="s2">I mean like that&#39;s really the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:22.750" style="s2">I want to emphasize here and even the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.370" end="00:40:27.460" style="s2">people who are winning at the current</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.750" end="00:40:32.710" style="s2">game are not living happy meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.460" end="00:40:35.050" style="s2">lives for the most part when we look at</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.710" end="00:40:36.880" style="s2">hyper normal stimuli right why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.050" end="00:40:38.320" style="s2">easy to get addicted to sugar because in</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.880" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">an evolutionary environment we just</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.320" end="00:40:41.350" style="s2">didn&#39;t have sugar right we had a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:44.010" style="s2">bit of fruit and the fruit was not</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.350" end="00:40:46.210" style="s2">hybridized so so there was a major</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.010" end="00:40:47.980" style="s2">involved opening reaction to get it</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.210" end="00:40:49.750" style="s2">because the caloric density offered</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.180" end="00:40:59.050" style="s2">almost simulating and then we find that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.070" end="00:41:00.610" style="s2">of course social media is a hyper normal</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.050" end="00:41:02.080" style="s2">stimuli cuz everybody&#39;s pictures are</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.080" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">and everybody&#39;s liking you in you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:08.110" style="s2">like real difficulties of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.190" end="00:41:08.770" style="s2">and it can be a huge number of people in</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.110" end="00:41:11.620" style="s2">a short amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.770" end="00:41:13.860" style="s2">and porn is a hyper normal stimuli and</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.620" end="00:41:16.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole generation of kids</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.860" end="00:41:18.310" style="s2">becoming adults who don&#39;t know how to</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.080" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">erectile and etc because they have</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.680" end="00:41:26.260" style="s2">oversaturated a certain kind of stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:29.830" style="s2">and normal stimuli are actually they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.260" end="00:41:31.330" style="s2">insensitive to it right and video games</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.830" end="00:41:32.740" style="s2">are hyper normal sense so we&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.330" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">world that&#39;s just all hyper normals and</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.740" end="00:41:36.730" style="s2">I which is addiction which always</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:38.290" style="s2">corresponds with less fulfillment right</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.730" end="00:41:39.790" style="s2">because it&#39;s desensitizing you to</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.290" end="00:41:41.740" style="s2">actually getting pleasure from life and</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.790" end="00:41:44.950" style="s2">so you need the hyper normal stimuli to</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.740" end="00:41:47.170" style="s2">get the hit and so you need the whatever</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.950" end="00:41:49.570" style="s2">it is however many likes that your thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.170" end="00:41:51.280" style="s2">gets her and the hyper normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.570" end="00:41:53.590" style="s2">proliferate sin the presence of hypo</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.280" end="00:41:55.810" style="s2">normal stimuli which is we don&#39;t live in</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.590" end="00:41:57.190" style="s2">a tribe which is our</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.810" end="00:41:57.970" style="s2">evolutionary environment where we</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.380" end="00:42:03.040" style="s2">humans regularly and to imagine in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.080" end="00:42:06.010" style="s2">tribe where you&#39;re dancing around the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.040" end="00:42:07.390" style="s2">campfire regularly most people find that</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.010" end="00:42:08.260" style="s2">when they go camping with friends they</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.390" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">aren&#39;t checking their phone as much</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.260" end="00:42:12.010" style="s2">right after the first day or two in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:13.990" style="s2">addiction kind of chills and of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.010" end="00:42:17.260" style="s2">presence of more authentic fulfillment</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.990" end="00:42:21.609" style="s2">there is less emptiness pushing some hip</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.260" end="00:42:24.220" style="s2">and so the society we&#39;ve optimized for</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.609" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">is a hyper hypo normal stimuli to</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.220" end="00:42:29.140" style="s2">everything meaningful we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">everybody&#39;s lonely and has some</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.140" end="00:42:34.060" style="s2">sense of meaninglessness and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:36.280" style="s2">pressure you know together and so then</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.060" end="00:42:38.560" style="s2">in that in that place addiction is going</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.280" end="00:42:40.210" style="s2">to run rampant and most people have 30</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.560" end="00:42:41.500" style="s2">to 50 different addictive behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.210" end="00:42:43.119" style="s2">meaning compulsive they know isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.500" end="00:42:45.849" style="s2">good for them they keep doing totally</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.119" end="00:42:48.369" style="s2">that&#39;s really interesting because in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.849" end="00:42:51.310" style="s2">model of the 12 steps which has been</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.369" end="00:42:54.150" style="s2">them the most effective single thing in</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.310" end="00:42:57.160" style="s2">removing deadly addictions from my life</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.150" end="00:42:58.990" style="s2">the model there is what I think people</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.160" end="00:43:00.760" style="s2">from the outside of that model think is</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.990" end="00:43:01.990" style="s2">that oh you go there and you quit</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.760" end="00:43:03.820" style="s2">drinking or you go there and you quit</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.990" end="00:43:06.190" style="s2">sex or overeating or whatever it is you</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.820" end="00:43:08.140" style="s2">go to some 12-step group and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.190" end="00:43:10.180" style="s2">what your problem is but that you get</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.140" end="00:43:11.740" style="s2">there as subjectively one gets there and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.180" end="00:43:14.349" style="s2">you go oh that was actually the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.740" end="00:43:16.180" style="s2">symptom right so I&#39;m addicted to heroin</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.349" end="00:43:19.960" style="s2">well why because of everything you just</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.180" end="00:43:22.320" style="s2">described so is this just a set of</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.960" end="00:43:24.280" style="s2">principles then going to just take that</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.320" end="00:43:26.410" style="s2">addiction away know what it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.280" end="00:43:28.540" style="s2">do is it&#39;s going to give me a framework</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.410" end="00:43:30.550" style="s2">to live by spiritual principles</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.540" end="00:43:35.349" style="s2">ineffable laws right that I can apply to</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.550" end="00:43:37.390" style="s2">my life to become more fulfilled and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.349" end="00:43:40.030" style="s2">then the need for that thing that I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.390" end="00:43:41.560" style="s2">using goes away and it&#39;s the straight I</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.030" end="00:43:43.810" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve experienced this again and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.560" end="00:43:45.940" style="s2">again and again using that model of</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.810" end="00:43:49.180" style="s2">getting the human connection and a</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.940" end="00:43:51.750" style="s2">spiritual connection and like living by</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.180" end="00:43:56.290" style="s2">those principles that kind of keep your</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.750" end="00:43:58.570" style="s2">mind and emotions in check then that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.290" end="00:44:00.940" style="s2">problem is removed and when the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.570" end="00:44:02.180" style="s2">principles represent a pretty small</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.940" end="00:44:04.160" style="s2">percent and human</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.180" end="00:44:06.170" style="s2">represents a pretty large person like</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:08.150" style="s2">the group dynamic and the group support</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.170" end="00:44:09.410" style="s2">I guess that&#39;s not tribe we&#39;re missing</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.150" end="00:44:11.000" style="s2">right you walk into a room and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.410" end="00:44:13.370" style="s2">25 people in there that you might not</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.000" end="00:44:15.650" style="s2">know but they you understand one another</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.370" end="00:44:17.810" style="s2">on a deep level because you&#39;ve both</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.650" end="00:44:19.280" style="s2">suffered in the same way think about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.810" end="00:44:20.810" style="s2">how many people get the blue book read</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.280" end="00:44:24.680" style="s2">on their own apply the principles and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.810" end="00:44:26.990" style="s2">quit their addiction no nobody that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.680" end="00:44:28.880" style="s2">now that&#39;s funny whether they join that</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.990" end="00:44:30.230" style="s2">group or they be joining the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.880" end="00:44:32.450" style="s2">group where they join whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.230" end="00:44:34.700" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly the fact that we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.450" end="00:44:36.920" style="s2">actually social primates right involved</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.700" end="00:44:38.960" style="s2">in a travel environment and so when in</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.920" end="00:44:40.850" style="s2">the 12-step thing what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.960" end="00:44:42.470" style="s2">the main thing happening in those rooms</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.850" end="00:44:43.910" style="s2">is you have people having authentic</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.470" end="00:44:45.380" style="s2">sharing about things they don&#39;t normally</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.910" end="00:44:46.580" style="s2">get to share about so they feel seen</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.380" end="00:44:50.570" style="s2">they see other people in there&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.580" end="00:44:52.970" style="s2">intimacy right and most the time again</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.570" end="00:44:55.610" style="s2">the world praised us for certain very</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.970" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">narrow things and we&#39;re optimizing for a</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.610" end="00:45:00.380" style="s2">lie all the time</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:03.290" style="s2">now just because this is adjacent to a</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.380" end="00:45:05.090" style="s2">topic I want to discuss this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.290" end="00:45:07.670" style="s2">the things that is most gruesome about</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.090" end="00:45:10.790" style="s2">social media and I&#39;ll say most gruesome</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.670" end="00:45:13.070" style="s2">about the topic of personal branding and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.790" end="00:45:15.860" style="s2">I&#39;m using the word gruesome you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.070" end="00:45:17.240" style="s2">acknowledging is probably I struggle</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.860" end="00:45:22.510" style="s2">with this a lot so I&#39;m looking forward</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.240" end="00:45:27.710" style="s2">to what you have to say when someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.510" end="00:45:29.570" style="s2">creates a brand as a business but even</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.710" end="00:45:31.010" style="s2">if not they&#39;re just social media and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.570" end="00:45:32.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a persona right but let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.010" end="00:45:35.360" style="s2">the brand as a very clear example</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.680" end="00:45:36.770" style="s2">they&#39;re now a life coach there are yoga</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.360" end="00:45:38.780" style="s2">teacher they&#39;re an Instagram model but</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.770" end="00:45:40.760" style="s2">whatever the it is right which has</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.780" end="00:45:42.050" style="s2">become radically easier there used to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.760" end="00:45:44.030" style="s2">a few people too that would based on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.050" end="00:45:46.910" style="s2">media tech now everybody gets it to some</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.030" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">degree of this then what happens is I</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.910" end="00:45:50.780" style="s2">have a feed background an analytics</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:52.850" style="s2">mechanism of how much people like my</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.780" end="00:45:55.100" style="s2">persona which is how many likes the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.850" end="00:45:56.840" style="s2">thing gets and how many clicks and</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.100" end="00:45:59.810" style="s2">impressions and purchases whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.840" end="00:46:02.150" style="s2">know thing and so I&#39;m going to now split</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.810" end="00:46:03.260" style="s2">test optimize my persona based on what</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.150" end="00:46:04.670" style="s2">people are responding to and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.260" end="00:46:09.710" style="s2">gonna respond the hyper normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.670" end="00:46:12.230" style="s2">and so the brand is going to get based</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.710" end="00:46:14.180" style="s2">on the financial driver based on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.230" end="00:46:14.870" style="s2">analytics is going to evolve in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.180" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">direction of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.870" end="00:46:17.510" style="s2">it&#39;s maximum engagement it&#39;s gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:19.610" style="s2">further and further from who I actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.510" end="00:46:21.290" style="s2">am there will be whole areas of who I am</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.610" end="00:46:22.970" style="s2">that I definitely don&#39;t share because</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.290" end="00:46:26.750" style="s2">they will actually be anti-correlated to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.970" end="00:46:28.490" style="s2">what gets the like it and the more</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.750" end="00:46:30.230" style="s2">people are liking that thing now that I</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.490" end="00:46:33.170" style="s2">feel different than the more depressed I</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.230" end="00:46:35.120" style="s2">feel right the more addictive desire I</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.170" end="00:46:37.370" style="s2">have in that depression let&#39;s go ready</p>

<p begin="00:46:37.370" end="00:46:42.290" style="s2">thing that&#39;s gonna get a likes and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.190" end="00:46:43.460" style="s2">more I feel like a fraud and a phony and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.290" end="00:46:44.360" style="s2">that if anyone really saw me they</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.460" end="00:46:46.580" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t love me and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.360" end="00:46:47.990" style="s2">unlovable and etc right so in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.580" end="00:46:49.910" style="s2">12-step room the opposite of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.990" end="00:46:52.250" style="s2">happening right someone is actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.910" end="00:46:53.870" style="s2">saying I&#39;m a up I just did</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.250" end="00:46:54.200" style="s2">all this dumb me like I get it me</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.870" end="00:46:57.320" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.200" end="00:47:00.410" style="s2">yeah whoa a real human interaction just</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.320" end="00:47:03.530" style="s2">occurred yeah and which is rare yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.410" end="00:47:05.990" style="s2">which is really rare and this starts to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.530" end="00:47:08.930" style="s2">be the basis it&#39;s not sufficient right</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.990" end="00:47:10.580" style="s2">but it starts to be the basis of a human</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.930" end="00:47:12.620" style="s2">life that doesn&#39;t drive addiction as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.580" end="00:47:15.290" style="s2">way to deal with the emptiness right</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.620" end="00:47:17.930" style="s2">remove the emptiness and then the need</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.290" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">to run from it goes away it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.930" end="00:47:22.100" style="s2">interesting though as you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:24.260" style="s2">about the social media persona and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.100" end="00:47:25.820" style="s2">profile because I&#39;ve owned a company for</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.260" end="00:47:28.340" style="s2">nine years and it&#39;s it&#39;s a company and</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.820" end="00:47:29.960" style="s2">has its own identity and then myself and</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.340" end="00:47:31.460" style="s2">my partner were the drivers or the face</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.960" end="00:47:33.260" style="s2">of that company at a certain point but</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.460" end="00:47:35.510" style="s2">then we sort of phased out as we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.260" end="00:47:37.310" style="s2">in our own separate career paths and</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.510" end="00:47:39.680" style="s2">things and mind&#39;s gone away from fashion</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.310" end="00:47:41.480" style="s2">so I I really enjoy the process of</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.680" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">building a brand and a personality and</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.480" end="00:47:44.840" style="s2">you know coming up with your core values</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:46.280" style="s2">in the mission and like it&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.840" end="00:47:48.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a living entity which has been</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.280" end="00:47:50.240" style="s2">amazing but I really struggled when I</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.200" end="00:47:52.640" style="s2">started the podcast and decided to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.240" end="00:47:54.620" style="s2">out of you know having this identity as</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.640" end="00:47:56.030" style="s2">a fashion stylist and a musician and all</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.620" end="00:47:58.190" style="s2">the things that I was so identified with</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.030" end="00:48:00.950" style="s2">before that I don&#39;t just ran their</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.190" end="00:48:03.200" style="s2">course or weren&#39;t my true hearts passion</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.950" end="00:48:05.270" style="s2">and so I decided to do this podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:06.710" style="s2">make this brand called Luke story you</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.270" end="00:48:08.900" style="s2">know I have this thing the life stylist</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.710" end="00:48:11.480" style="s2">and you know I really had a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.900" end="00:48:14.390" style="s2">with launching it there&#39;s about two</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.480" end="00:48:16.370" style="s2">years ago because I didn&#39;t know how real</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.390" end="00:48:19.700" style="s2">I wanted to be or that I would have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.370" end="00:48:22.190" style="s2">courage to be and how forth coming and</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.700" end="00:48:24.680" style="s2">just transparent and authentic I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.190" end="00:48:26.330" style="s2">to be about my past and my struggles</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.680" end="00:48:27.920" style="s2">with addiction and just current</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.330" end="00:48:30.740" style="s2">struggles and everything and</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.920" end="00:48:33.260" style="s2">so I I kind of paused for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.740" end="00:48:36.260" style="s2">before I put anything out until I really</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.260" end="00:48:39.410" style="s2">was sure that I was willing to accept a</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.260" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">possible rejection or other consequences</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.410" end="00:48:43.970" style="s2">of just being me and I&#39;ve done this</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:48.260" style="s2">social experiment now for about a year</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.970" end="00:48:51.109" style="s2">and a half where I&#39;ve just pushed my my</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.260" end="00:48:53.390" style="s2">own boundaries of transparency and</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.109" end="00:48:55.910" style="s2">authenticity just to see what would</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.390" end="00:48:58.849" style="s2">happen if I am in fact disliked or</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.910" end="00:49:00.769" style="s2">rejected or abandoned or ostracized by</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.849" end="00:49:02.839" style="s2">the world at large or what we call a</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.769" end="00:49:05.390" style="s2">following or a fan base or listeners or</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.839" end="00:49:09.069" style="s2">whatever and it&#39;s been so Buzard I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.390" end="00:49:13.430" style="s2">been talking about this a lot it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.069" end="00:49:15.920" style="s2">more goofy and real and just true I can</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.430" end="00:49:18.619" style="s2">be like treating social media and my</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.920" end="00:49:20.510" style="s2">outward facing persona and brand like</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.619" end="00:49:21.799" style="s2">I&#39;m in a 12-step meeting and just like</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.510" end="00:49:24.799" style="s2">hey this is the I&#39;m going through</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.799" end="00:49:26.690" style="s2">it&#39;s a certain degree of you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.799" end="00:49:29.000" style="s2">prudence I guess you know I don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.690" end="00:49:31.720" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be lose your tact you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.000" end="00:49:35.420" style="s2">what I mean but I&#39;m finding this</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.720" end="00:49:37.430" style="s2">spiritual explosion of growth and just</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.420" end="00:49:39.619" style="s2">allowing myself to finally be seen and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.430" end="00:49:42.710" style="s2">to really accept myself and love myself</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.619" end="00:49:45.170" style="s2">and what&#39;s so weird about it and this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.710" end="00:49:47.480" style="s2">just this cosmic joke that I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.170" end="00:49:51.829" style="s2">constantly giggling that is that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.480" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">actually get more approval from showing</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.829" end="00:49:55.339" style="s2">these aspects of myself that I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:57.410" style="s2">hidden because I was embarrassed about</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.339" end="00:50:00.859" style="s2">or you know my insecurities my struggles</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.410" end="00:50:02.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like actually people liked me more</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.859" end="00:50:05.180" style="s2">for the things that I&#39;ve been afraid for</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.210" end="00:50:09.230" style="s2">them to see in my whole entire life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.180" end="00:50:10.880" style="s2">like this strange paradox which on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.230" end="00:50:12.319" style="s2">other side of it I&#39;ve lived that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.880" end="00:50:13.490" style="s2">will decide you were describing is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.319" end="00:50:15.170" style="s2">oh I&#39;m going to present things in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.490" end="00:50:17.029" style="s2">certain way so that I&#39;m like I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.170" end="00:50:18.769" style="s2">that&#39;s there to some degree but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.029" end="00:50:21.289" style="s2">kind of flipped that on its head and</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.769" end="00:50:23.839" style="s2">just like alright how myself can I be</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.289" end="00:50:26.150" style="s2">and what point at which do people go</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.839" end="00:50:28.279" style="s2">alright you&#39;re too much we&#39;re abandoning</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.150" end="00:50:30.920" style="s2">you we actually don&#39;t like you what does</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.279" end="00:50:32.420" style="s2">that sort of you know primal egoic fear</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.920" end="00:50:34.849" style="s2">and I&#39;m just having such a great time</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.420" end="00:50:37.160" style="s2">like using social media actually as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.849" end="00:50:39.769" style="s2">tool to make myself uncomfortably</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.160" end="00:50:40.519" style="s2">vulnerable yeah and then to find that it</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.769" end="00:50:40.990" style="s2">was a boogeyman</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.519" end="00:50:43.300" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.990" end="00:50:45.700" style="s2">like a phantom fear who gives a if</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.300" end="00:50:47.619" style="s2">they like you or not it&#39;s like if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.700" end="00:50:50.680" style="s2">have that self-worth which I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.619" end="00:50:52.750" style="s2">starting to cultivate more actively than</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.680" end="00:50:54.220" style="s2">I don&#39;t know even the response doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.750" end="00:50:56.380" style="s2">matter but it&#39;s fascinating when the</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.220" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">response is positive two things that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.380" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">would think like oh god now people are</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:02.619" style="s2">really gonna think I&#39;m an idiot or</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.400" end="00:51:05.530" style="s2">whatever you know just letting that be</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.619" end="00:51:06.970" style="s2">seen on a on a macro more public level</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.530" end="00:51:08.650" style="s2">and then it&#39;s give me the ability to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.970" end="00:51:10.570" style="s2">that more as you mentioned the word</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.650" end="00:51:13.720" style="s2">intimacy you know just my friends but</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.570" end="00:51:16.360" style="s2">okay I just want to be real I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.720" end="00:51:18.369" style="s2">one of my goals in life is to you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.360" end="00:51:19.869" style="s2">to some day pass on and if anyone could</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.369" end="00:51:22.360" style="s2">say anything just be like at least he</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.869" end="00:51:23.730" style="s2">wasn&#39;t phony yeah you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.360" end="00:51:26.200" style="s2">like just to be authentic and real</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.730" end="00:51:30.250" style="s2">despite whatever false one might have so</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.200" end="00:51:34.710" style="s2">so in the world where we have Ubiquiti</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.250" end="00:51:37.570" style="s2">loneliness and liquidus depression and</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.710" end="00:51:41.730" style="s2">without talking about it everybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.570" end="00:51:44.230" style="s2">that there is a longing for authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.730" end="00:51:47.530" style="s2">right and a longing for intimacy and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.230" end="00:51:48.820" style="s2">people will respond to that and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.530" end="00:51:50.440" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome right and I love that</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.820" end="00:51:51.640" style="s2">you&#39;re having that experience with</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.440" end="00:51:56.859" style="s2">people and sharing that experience of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.640" end="00:51:58.450" style="s2">people and anyone who wants to share</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.859" end="00:52:00.780" style="s2">themselves where there will be a</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.450" end="00:52:03.280" style="s2">personal brand that&#39;s the only way to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.780" end="00:52:07.660" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make their life sock and</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.280" end="00:52:10.080" style="s2">actually propagate in the world now</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.660" end="00:52:12.670" style="s2">there will still be times where there is</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.080" end="00:52:14.980" style="s2">something that is less authentic that</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.670" end="00:52:17.710" style="s2">sells better and this is where you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.980" end="00:52:20.770" style="s2">to say okay choosing between two masters</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.710" end="00:52:22.600" style="s2">where I don&#39;t really write it&#39;s a tricky</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.770" end="00:52:26.609" style="s2">one sometimes but it&#39;s one to just have</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.600" end="00:52:26.609" style="s2">continuous awareness of and vigilance of</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.030" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">so so at a certain point when I guess</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.170" end="00:52:35.170" style="s2">you hit a threshold perhaps where you</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:37.780" style="s2">really have to start looking at things</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.170" end="00:52:39.520" style="s2">from scalability and from having a brand</p>

<p begin="00:53:49.270" end="00:53:52.990" style="s2">because the marketers are you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.190" end="00:53:55.720" style="s2">advertisers are gonna pay for that so</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.990" end="00:53:57.270" style="s2">the goal is keep you have as many people</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.720" end="00:54:00.190" style="s2">spend as much time on site as possible</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.270" end="00:54:01.570" style="s2">now what&#39;s actually good for you in your</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.190" end="00:54:03.790" style="s2">life is to get the off of the</p>

<p begin="00:54:03.790" end="00:54:07.600" style="s2">right but since we&#39;re gonna get paid</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.890" end="00:54:09.040" style="s2">more by more time on site then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.600" end="00:54:10.450" style="s2">gonna figure out the most addictive</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.040" end="00:54:11.860" style="s2">things to do with the newsfeed that will</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.450" end="00:54:14.080" style="s2">keep you clicking and you know paying</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.860" end="00:54:15.970" style="s2">attention right as much as possible and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.080" end="00:54:18.490" style="s2">then justify why it&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.970" end="00:54:21.850" style="s2">because we have to have to do that right</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.490" end="00:54:23.560" style="s2">and so then if you look at keep just you</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.850" end="00:54:25.870" style="s2">just described a rift in so many of my</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.560" end="00:54:27.280" style="s2">relationships you know the woman classic</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.870" end="00:54:28.990" style="s2">like what do you oh you have to be on</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.280" end="00:54:32.050" style="s2">Instagram like all day I&#39;m like hey this</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.990" end="00:54:35.920" style="s2">is my work like that&#39;s always my excuse</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.050" end="00:54:37.750" style="s2">part of my job and you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.920" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">an interesting thing because the studies</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.750" end="00:54:40.810" style="s2">keep rolling out of the more time people</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:46.270" style="s2">spend on screens the more depressed they</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.810" end="00:54:49.210" style="s2">are and for a gazillion reasons right</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.270" end="00:54:51.610" style="s2">right is there for the most part there</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.210" end="00:54:53.650" style="s2">isn&#39;t any real intimacy authenticity etc</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.610" end="00:54:55.480" style="s2">and those interactions if so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.650" end="00:54:58.480" style="s2">tiniest fragment of the total time spent</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.480" end="00:55:00.820" style="s2">and even to the degree there is the real</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.480" end="00:55:02.530" style="s2">kinesthetic feedback of intimacy with</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.820" end="00:55:04.180" style="s2">another person is not happening it</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.530" end="00:55:05.870" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t good sides of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.180" end="00:55:07.100" style="s2">course the ability to have people</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.870" end="00:55:09.620" style="s2">with people in other parts of the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.100" end="00:55:12.050" style="s2">and be able to have messages that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.620" end="00:55:13.910" style="s2">valuable be shared has value those will</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.050" end="00:55:15.410" style="s2">be the parts that we solely focus on if</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.910" end="00:55:19.300" style="s2">we have a profit stream associated with</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.410" end="00:55:19.300" style="s2">it because we need to justify that right</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.480" end="00:55:26.570" style="s2">so this is where it becomes important to</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.650" end="00:55:29.750" style="s2">really look at what is meaningful now</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.570" end="00:55:31.610" style="s2">come back for a moment to the individual</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.750" end="00:55:34.610" style="s2">optimization right biohacking individual</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.610" end="00:55:37.130" style="s2">concision we&#39;re interested in people</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.610" end="00:55:39.170" style="s2">optimizing as individuals so that they</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.130" end="00:55:40.970" style="s2">have more capacity to actually do things</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.170" end="00:55:42.290" style="s2">that are meaningful because when people</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.970" end="00:55:44.320" style="s2">look at climate change and they look at</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.290" end="00:55:46.850" style="s2">species extinction and they look at</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.320" end="00:55:49.520" style="s2">refugee issues and etc they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.850" end="00:55:51.950" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what to do with that go</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.520" end="00:55:55.010" style="s2">back on Facebook let&#39;s go back to work</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.950" end="00:55:56.330" style="s2">list but fit and again back to education</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.010" end="00:55:57.710" style="s2">they&#39;re waiting for somebody to tell</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.330" end="00:55:59.690" style="s2">them what to do and do a good job at it</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.710" end="00:56:01.220" style="s2">as opposed to be able to self assess in</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.690" end="00:56:02.630" style="s2">a very complex scenario what might</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.220" end="00:56:04.580" style="s2">actually be effective because if anybody</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.630" end="00:56:06.110" style="s2">knew it&#39;d be happening right to</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.580" end="00:56:08.210" style="s2">self assess what needs to be done and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.110" end="00:56:10.820" style="s2">then to actually start to initiate and</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.210" end="00:56:13.190" style="s2">and do that and self author so</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.820" end="00:56:15.470" style="s2">individual optimization for that purpose</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.190" end="00:56:17.540" style="s2">is meaningful but it&#39;s interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.470" end="00:56:19.190" style="s2">the pursuit of happiness is core to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.540" end="00:56:24.260" style="s2">mission statement of our country right</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.190" end="00:56:26.060" style="s2">and the pursuit of happiness is a is an</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.260" end="00:56:27.560" style="s2">oxymoron it&#39;s a misnomer because when</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.060" end="00:56:29.420" style="s2">one is pursuing happiness they will</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.560" end="00:56:31.190" style="s2">definitely not be happy yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.420" end="00:56:33.800" style="s2">inherently dissatisfied if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.190" end="00:56:36.110" style="s2">seeking yeah they&#39;re affirming their</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.800" end="00:56:37.970" style="s2">emptiness lack of happiness and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.110" end="00:56:39.950" style="s2">in a fundamentally narcissistic pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.970" end="00:56:41.330" style="s2">and happiness occurs when you let the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.950" end="00:56:43.400" style="s2">narcissism go and actually connect</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.330" end="00:56:45.500" style="s2">manfully to the world right and</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.400" end="00:56:47.240" style="s2">happiness is mostly this direction not</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.500" end="00:56:49.610" style="s2">this direction right mostly you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.240" end="00:56:51.920" style="s2">yeah and that also that also impacts</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.610" end="00:56:54.440" style="s2">another piece of the of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:56:56.690" style="s2">recovery is once one has enough</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.440" end="00:56:58.130" style="s2">stability I mean kind of the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.690" end="00:56:59.870" style="s2">of this doing go help the next person</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.130" end="00:57:01.340" style="s2">that comes along that is struggling in</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.870" end="00:57:03.200" style="s2">ways in which you have and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.340" end="00:57:04.970" style="s2">that&#39;s where the magic happens right</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.200" end="00:57:07.580" style="s2">that&#39;s when the lights turn on when you</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.970" end="00:57:09.320" style="s2">make a difference right yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.580" end="00:57:10.910" style="s2">not just because now you&#39;re affirming</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.320" end="00:57:11.960" style="s2">the principles to yourself until you</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.910" end="00:57:13.970" style="s2">want to live them it&#39;s that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.960" end="00:57:15.800" style="s2">also because now your life actually has</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.970" end="00:57:17.330" style="s2">a sense of meaning exactly where it</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.800" end="00:57:19.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need a hit from something else</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.330" end="00:57:22.600" style="s2">as much yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.480" end="00:57:24.730" style="s2">yeah and I think yeah I figured that out</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.600" end="00:57:27.310" style="s2">pretty early on into my recovery which</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.730" end="00:57:29.440" style="s2">was almost 21 years ago like the first</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.310" end="00:57:31.750" style="s2">time I was even just together enough to</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.440" end="00:57:33.400" style="s2">have a car and give some kid a ride you</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.750" end="00:57:35.500" style="s2">know and just be of service and that was</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.400" end="00:57:38.140" style="s2">like God I was experiencing the helpers</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.500" end="00:57:39.640" style="s2">high and then even know it and now to</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.140" end="00:57:42.880" style="s2">have the ability to do that on a on a</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.640" end="00:57:44.110" style="s2">more broad scale of having a podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.880" end="00:57:46.150" style="s2">making these videos and talking to</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.110" end="00:57:47.740" style="s2">people like you and and and getting</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.150" end="00:57:49.240" style="s2">feedback although it&#39;s not you know a</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.740" end="00:57:51.190" style="s2">true connection but like a direct</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.240" end="00:57:53.620" style="s2">message or a Facebook message like oh my</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.190" end="00:57:54.820" style="s2">god I&#39;ve struggled with X Y &amp; Z and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.620" end="00:57:56.470" style="s2">been listening to your shadow and now</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.820" end="00:57:58.570" style="s2">I&#39;m getting over it I mean it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.470" end="00:58:01.270" style="s2">well okay my life has meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.570" end="00:58:04.300" style="s2">purpose finally and not to say that</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.270" end="00:58:05.710" style="s2">being a plumber or working construction</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.300" end="00:58:07.510" style="s2">or working at a gas station or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.710" end="00:58:08.800" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t as well because you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.510" end="00:58:10.810" style="s2">there&#39;s people needed in all of these</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.800" end="00:58:12.280" style="s2">different areas but to do the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.810" end="00:58:14.470" style="s2">I really love to do it&#39;s been so</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.280" end="00:58:19.480" style="s2">fulfilling and it directly helps people</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.470" end="00:58:21.280" style="s2">on a on a really deep level so god man</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.480" end="00:58:23.380" style="s2">that&#39;s funny I was just gonna like touch</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.280" end="00:58:26.050" style="s2">on like just sprinkle on a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.380" end="00:58:27.520" style="s2">things that we went into and yeah I have</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.050" end="00:58:28.930" style="s2">a feeling weird up I&#39;m gonna have to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.520" end="00:58:30.340" style="s2">coming down a lot of fuel and if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.930" end="00:58:32.170" style="s2">have me because there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.340" end="00:58:36.060" style="s2">conversations that need to need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.170" end="00:58:39.340" style="s2">happen but I definitely want to get into</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.060" end="00:58:42.790" style="s2">you know neuro hacker collective what</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.340" end="00:58:44.200" style="s2">you guys are doing qualia just getting</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.790" end="00:58:46.420" style="s2">now that we sort of created a framework</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.200" end="00:58:48.280" style="s2">and a reason that someone would want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.420" end="00:58:49.900" style="s2">optimize themselves as other than just</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.280" end="00:58:51.940" style="s2">like coal now I can get more stuff for</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.900" end="00:58:55.420" style="s2">myself and be happier for myself but to</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.940" end="00:58:57.340" style="s2">actually you know be a piece of biology</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.420" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">and consciousness that can go out into</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.340" end="00:59:00.580" style="s2">the world and have some discernment in</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:06.730" style="s2">terms of what I want to put my energy</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.580" end="00:59:08.680" style="s2">into or not so how did neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.730" end="00:59:10.090" style="s2">collective come to be and what are you</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.680" end="00:59:14.410" style="s2">guys all about for those that are</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.090" end="00:59:16.060" style="s2">unfamiliar yeah so there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.410" end="00:59:17.890" style="s2">founders and they all had interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.060" end="00:59:20.740" style="s2">different stories that kind of came</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.890" end="00:59:21.880" style="s2">together all I&#39;ll share mine here&#39;s so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.740" end="00:59:23.710" style="s2">was running a think-tank that was</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.880" end="00:59:25.090" style="s2">working on the types of issues were</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.710" end="00:59:27.400" style="s2">talking about social issues how do we</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.090" end="00:59:29.980" style="s2">actually have civilization self organize</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.400" end="00:59:31.330" style="s2">well and so one of the things we know</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.980" end="00:59:32.590" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty easy</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.330" end="00:59:33.850" style="s2">you know this is that all the problems</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.590" end="00:59:35.740" style="s2">we want to solve our problems that are</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.850" end="00:59:38.380" style="s2">caused by human action whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.740" end="00:59:40.780" style="s2">looking at species extinction or climate</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.380" end="00:59:42.460" style="s2">change or female genital mutilation or</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.780" end="00:59:47.950" style="s2">war like this or human behavior mod</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.460" end="00:59:49.780" style="s2">topics right and so how do we get how do</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.950" end="00:59:51.220" style="s2">we support humans to behave in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.780" end="00:59:53.110" style="s2">are good for themselves and good for the</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.220" end="00:59:54.730" style="s2">whole simultaneously without directly or</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.110" end="00:59:56.230" style="s2">indirectly custom harm so then it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.730" end="00:59:58.090" style="s2">question is what are all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.230" end="00:59:59.650" style="s2">influence in behavior obviously we</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.090" end="01:00:01.960" style="s2">talked about economics if a particular</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.650" end="01:00:04.270" style="s2">action is incentive it&#39;s pretty hard to</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.960" end="01:00:05.710" style="s2">prevent it right so how do we create an</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.270" end="01:00:07.240" style="s2">economic system where the whale is not</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.710" end="01:00:08.530" style="s2">worth more dead than it is live if we</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.240" end="01:00:10.960" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have any whales that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.530" end="01:00:13.360" style="s2">where topic right how do we create you</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.960" end="01:00:14.680" style="s2">know social systems and tech influences</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.360" end="01:00:16.330" style="s2">our behavior our environment influence</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.680" end="01:00:17.830" style="s2">our behavior our psychology our</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.330" end="01:00:20.350" style="s2">worldview our definition of what is</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.830" end="01:00:22.120" style="s2">fundamentally meaningful does but our</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.350" end="01:00:26.440" style="s2">biology also influences our behavior and</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.120" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">everybody who has ever had a you know a</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.440" end="01:00:30.490" style="s2">pretty significant sickness or even just</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:33.630" style="s2">have their hormones out of balance or a</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.490" end="01:00:35.650" style="s2">hangover knows that your physiology can</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.630" end="01:00:37.840" style="s2">go into a state that affects your</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.650" end="01:00:41.350" style="s2">psychology and your cognitive capacity</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.840" end="01:00:42.790" style="s2">and disposition significantly where if</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.350" end="01:00:44.800" style="s2">your neurotransmitters are off or your</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.790" end="01:00:48.370" style="s2">hormones are off or etc in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.800" end="01:00:51.360" style="s2">way accessing gratitude or happiness or</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.370" end="01:00:54.550" style="s2">hope it might be very very hard and</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.360" end="01:00:56.140" style="s2">staying out of anger frustration etc</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.550" end="01:00:57.760" style="s2">might be very hard and that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.140" end="01:00:59.020" style="s2">affect behavioral not only their own</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.760" end="01:01:01.870" style="s2">suffering but also behavioral</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.020" end="01:01:03.310" style="s2">predispositions same with complex</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.870" end="01:01:05.290" style="s2">thinking I&#39;ve actually got to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.310" end="01:01:07.180" style="s2">have a decent working memory to be able</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.290" end="01:01:09.100" style="s2">to hold multiple perspectives at once</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.180" end="01:01:11.110" style="s2">and synthesize them if I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.100" end="01:01:12.550" style="s2">enough working memory to hold multiple</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.110" end="01:01:15.720" style="s2">perspectives at the same time I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.550" end="01:01:17.860" style="s2">default into a simplistic perspective so</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.720" end="01:01:20.070" style="s2">right which is why I&#39;m malnourished</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.860" end="01:01:25.900" style="s2">people are so easy to brainwash right</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.070" end="01:01:27.250" style="s2">that is a part of it and so the you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.900" end="01:01:30.540" style="s2">the thing we started looking at there is</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.250" end="01:01:32.140" style="s2">how does physiology affect human</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.540" end="01:01:34.270" style="s2">predisposition not just their own</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.140" end="01:01:36.300" style="s2">experience but how likely they are to</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.270" end="01:01:39.580" style="s2">behave violently or</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.300" end="01:01:41.590" style="s2">behave charitably psychopathy empathy</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.580" end="01:01:43.030" style="s2">you know types of dynamics and also the</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.590" end="01:01:45.160" style="s2">ability to understand complex</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.030" end="01:01:46.660" style="s2">things the emotional resilience to hang</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.160" end="01:01:48.370" style="s2">in with in difficult times and</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.660" end="01:01:51.040" style="s2">understanding more about mind brain</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.370" end="01:01:53.230" style="s2">interface there is a bi-directional</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.040" end="01:01:54.610" style="s2">interface both influenced each other as</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.230" end="01:01:57.190" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at the way the brain and</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.610" end="01:02:00.310" style="s2">the physiology affect the mind right the</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.190" end="01:02:02.740" style="s2">emotion and the cognitive dimensions we</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.310" end="01:02:04.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a genetic like oh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.740" end="01:02:06.010" style="s2">you have a genetic predisposition for</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.810" end="01:02:06.640" style="s2">psychopathy therefore you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.010" end="01:02:08.890" style="s2">psychopath</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.640" end="01:02:11.320" style="s2">typically the genetic predispositions</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.890" end="01:02:12.880" style="s2">for a psychiatric thing are our genes</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.320" end="01:02:15.790" style="s2">that do something like process a</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.880" end="01:02:17.530" style="s2">specific nutrient right like well we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.790" end="01:02:19.660" style="s2">look at psychiatric issues from genes</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.530" end="01:02:22.060" style="s2">that process the methylation of a B</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.660" end="01:02:24.400" style="s2">vitamin or the excretion of a mineral</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.060" end="01:02:26.260" style="s2">like copper and zinc or something and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.400" end="01:02:28.030" style="s2">if those nutrients are necessary for a</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.260" end="01:02:30.160" style="s2">specific type of brain function like</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.030" end="01:02:32.050" style="s2">empathy or impulse control and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.160" end="01:02:34.350" style="s2">not being processed well then you might</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.050" end="01:02:37.840" style="s2">not be able to have impulse control and</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.350" end="01:02:40.180" style="s2">what with what we actually can do about</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.840" end="01:02:42.190" style="s2">it is without changing your genome just</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.180" end="01:02:44.440" style="s2">actually say oh the gene that would code</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.190" end="01:02:45.730" style="s2">for the transform of this vitamin isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.440" end="01:02:47.170" style="s2">happening we can just give the post</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.730" end="01:02:48.550" style="s2">transform version of the vitamin and</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.170" end="01:02:50.560" style="s2">that mental illness is actually better</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.550" end="01:02:51.780" style="s2">so this is the kind of field of</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.560" end="01:02:54.670" style="s2">Integrative Psychiatry</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.780" end="01:02:56.950" style="s2">psychopharmacology and I started seeing</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.670" end="01:02:59.560" style="s2">how many of the dynamics that address</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.950" end="01:03:01.450" style="s2">the world have a physiologic component</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.560" end="01:03:03.190" style="s2">to them and started to look at could we</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.450" end="01:03:05.710" style="s2">up regulate the neural networks that</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.190" end="01:03:07.210" style="s2">mediate empathy that mediate impulse</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.710" end="01:03:08.830" style="s2">control to mediate emotional resilience</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.210" end="01:03:11.290" style="s2">that mediate complex thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.830" end="01:03:14.170" style="s2">mediate a sense of agency so the human</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.290" end="01:03:16.420" style="s2">bio Hardware was not only predisposed to</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.170" end="01:03:18.250" style="s2">feel better but also predisposed to have</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.420" end="01:03:20.860" style="s2">increased capacity and behave in ways</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.250" end="01:03:23.680" style="s2">that are fundamentally more you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.860" end="01:03:25.540" style="s2">pro-social which just does correspond</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.680" end="01:03:27.850" style="s2">with healthier - right it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.540" end="01:03:29.560" style="s2">because we grow evolving in a social</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.850" end="01:03:31.120" style="s2">environment healthy people are</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.560" end="01:03:33.460" style="s2">pro-social right think about a</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.120" end="01:03:34.870" style="s2">psychopath in a tribe doesn&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.460" end="01:03:36.040" style="s2">very well right they&#39;re gonna get killed</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.870" end="01:03:37.540" style="s2">or taken out of the tribe or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.040" end="01:03:39.610" style="s2">gonna get better but they don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.540" end="01:03:41.110" style="s2">get to be in a social deep social</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.610" end="01:03:44.710" style="s2">environment without pro-social behavior</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.110" end="01:03:47.610" style="s2">and work and so neural hackers started</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.710" end="01:03:49.570" style="s2">for me with a deep exploration into</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.610" end="01:03:51.490" style="s2">understanding how we can affect human</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.570" end="01:03:53.390" style="s2">physiology in ways that decreases</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.490" end="01:03:56.180" style="s2">suffering increases capacity</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.390" end="01:03:58.609" style="s2">positive disposition the first product</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.180" end="01:04:00.470" style="s2">we launched qualia was one of minion</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.609" end="01:04:02.839" style="s2">this next year a bunch of the additional</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.470" end="01:04:05.539" style="s2">ones are coming out in very cool oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.839" end="01:04:07.730" style="s2">excited and I want to get into the</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.539" end="01:04:11.660" style="s2">quality thing because people I get a lot</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.730" end="01:04:14.539" style="s2">of inquiries about it and I&#39;m I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.660" end="01:04:16.160" style="s2">into it but well we&#39;ll go into that side</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.539" end="01:04:17.989" style="s2">a little of the framework but I</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.160" end="01:04:22.009" style="s2">definitely want to cover that cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.989" end="01:04:25.849" style="s2">exciting so in a world where we have so</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.009" end="01:04:27.529" style="s2">much distraction from all of the things</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.849" end="01:04:30.380" style="s2">going off from social media and on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.529" end="01:04:31.880" style="s2">phone and etc with so much hyper</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.380" end="01:04:34.880" style="s2">competitive pressure to try and produce</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.880" end="01:04:36.319" style="s2">almost everyone has a pretty strong</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.880" end="01:04:38.749" style="s2">sense of pressure to want to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.319" end="01:04:40.819" style="s2">focus better and to be able to have more</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.749" end="01:04:42.619" style="s2">sustained attention and gets it done</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.819" end="01:04:44.480" style="s2">well having a pretty significant</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.619" end="01:04:46.640" style="s2">challenge doing that and not only the</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.480" end="01:04:49.130" style="s2">you know focus issues like from</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.640" end="01:04:51.829" style="s2">distraction but insufficient nutrients</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.130" end="01:04:53.359" style="s2">that are necessary certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.829" end="01:04:57.380" style="s2">toxic exposure that affects the brain</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.359" end="01:04:59.450" style="s2">you know etc so so we see this ramp in</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.380" end="01:05:04.099" style="s2">energy drinks so more and more caffeine</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.450" end="01:05:05.900" style="s2">and in smart drug usage and and so with</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.099" end="01:05:08.630" style="s2">smart drugs in particular which in</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.900" end="01:05:09.920" style="s2">Contra distinction to brain nutrients or</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.630" end="01:05:11.420" style="s2">things you would just get from a normal</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.920" end="01:05:13.009" style="s2">healthy diet but we probably don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.420" end="01:05:14.630" style="s2">enough because of depleted topsoil and</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.009" end="01:05:16.069" style="s2">whatever else right and those are just</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.630" end="01:05:17.210" style="s2">nutrients it in our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.069" end="01:05:19.910" style="s2">environment we&#39;re necessary for brain</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.210" end="01:05:22.190" style="s2">function no we also didn&#39;t try to do 12</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.910" end="01:05:23.660" style="s2">hours of productive work that was</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.190" end="01:05:24.950" style="s2">cognitive per to him and evolution</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.660" end="01:05:26.329" style="s2">environments we&#39;re using nutrients</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.950" end="01:05:28.880" style="s2">differently so we might have increased</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.329" end="01:05:31.400" style="s2">nutrient need of obviously got radically</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.880" end="01:05:33.319" style="s2">decreased topsoil density interesting</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.400" end="01:05:35.269" style="s2">right so going on and collecting acorns</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.319" end="01:05:37.430" style="s2">for a couple hours that they are hunting</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.269" end="01:05:38.900" style="s2">for rabbits or whatever it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.430" end="01:05:41.529" style="s2">different from sitting down and solving</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.900" end="01:05:45.619" style="s2">the complex problems that we are in this</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.529" end="01:05:47.150" style="s2">technological age so interesting you</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.619" end="01:05:49.759" style="s2">know deficiencies pretty rampant</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.150" end="01:05:51.799" style="s2">different kinds of toxicity like you</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.759" end="01:05:55.730" style="s2">know just volatile organic compounds in</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.799" end="01:05:58.339" style="s2">this paint and this carpet are you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.730" end="01:06:00.079" style="s2">there&#39;s hundreds of VOCs in the air that</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.339" end="01:06:01.670" style="s2">were breathing just normal stuff right</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.079" end="01:06:04.069" style="s2">little own industrial pollution in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.670" end="01:06:06.170" style="s2">atmosphere and glyphosate in agriculture</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.069" end="01:06:07.069" style="s2">whatever else and they&#39;re almost all</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.170" end="01:06:09.709" style="s2">either percentage</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.069" end="01:06:11.449" style="s2">neurotoxins or endocrine disruptors and</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.709" end="01:06:13.880" style="s2">like it&#39;s a significant issue so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.449" end="01:06:15.289" style="s2">basically as as tool builders we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.880" end="01:06:17.329" style="s2">built a world that we&#39;re not adapted for</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.289" end="01:06:19.249" style="s2">and so how do how do we deal with that</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.329" end="01:06:20.630" style="s2">we were looking at the cognitive issues</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.249" end="01:06:22.699" style="s2">one of the first ones or many we looked</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.630" end="01:06:24.289" style="s2">at you know issues related to anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.699" end="01:06:26.180" style="s2">and depression and pain and addiction</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.289" end="01:06:28.819" style="s2">and sleep and those are all things we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.180" end="01:06:30.619" style="s2">talk about but you know we saw this</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.819" end="01:06:32.119" style="s2">meteoric rise of energy drinks so</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.619" end="01:06:35.119" style="s2">they&#39;re doing 15 billion dollars</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.119" end="01:06:37.279" style="s2">domestically pretty young you know 300</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.119" end="01:06:38.829" style="s2">milligrams of caffeine at a time and God</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.279" end="01:06:41.089" style="s2">knows what else man</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.829" end="01:06:43.249" style="s2">anytime I see someone drinking one of</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.089" end="01:06:44.779" style="s2">those things I&#39;m just like me cuz you</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.249" end="01:06:46.039" style="s2">every once a while the 7-eleven I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.779" end="01:06:47.119" style="s2">just pick something up not like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.039" end="01:06:48.769" style="s2">gonna buy of it I just read the</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.119" end="01:06:52.759" style="s2">ingredients out of just morbid curiosity</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.769" end="01:06:56.119" style="s2">I&#39;m like oh my god it&#39;s like so toxic</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.759" end="01:06:58.880" style="s2">man so you know the artificial flavors</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.119" end="01:07:00.890" style="s2">sweeteners colors are not adding to</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.880" end="01:07:02.359" style="s2">brain health dude and in just the water</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.890" end="01:07:05.900" style="s2">you think when you go buy a drink is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.359" end="01:07:07.699" style="s2">water it&#39;s fluoridated tap water in most</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.900" end="01:07:08.989" style="s2">cases that&#39;s really the bulk of what</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.699" end="01:07:10.729" style="s2">you&#39;re getting when you buy a 12 ounce</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.989" end="01:07:13.519" style="s2">whatever drink you&#39;re drinking a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.729" end="01:07:15.289" style="s2">of tap water so you&#39;ve you&#39;ve got you</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.519" end="01:07:18.289" style="s2">know that kind of rise then you see with</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.289" end="01:07:20.449" style="s2">smart drugs obviously we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.289" end="01:07:23.589" style="s2">people on prescription adderall</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.449" end="01:07:25.699" style="s2">wellbutrin by vans modafinil for</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.589" end="01:07:27.890" style="s2">psychiatric disorders for cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.699" end="01:07:30.199" style="s2">disorders and there&#39;s a pretty big</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.890" end="01:07:32.180" style="s2">question about what percentage of those</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.199" end="01:07:35.109" style="s2">actual prescription cases are good for</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.180" end="01:07:37.039" style="s2">people I&#39;m stating that conservatively</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.109" end="01:07:39.729" style="s2">but then we have all the people on</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.039" end="01:07:42.019" style="s2">off-label right use which is not even</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.729" end="01:07:45.410" style="s2">prescribed they&#39;re just black market you</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.019" end="01:07:48.829" style="s2">know universities midterm and final at</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.410" end="01:07:50.390" style="s2">all sales everywhere right and even well</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.829" end="01:07:53.839" style="s2">be trimmed up or know lots of different</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.390" end="01:07:55.249" style="s2">things and so estimate is something like</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.839" end="01:07:57.949" style="s2">15 billion dollars a year</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.249" end="01:07:59.839" style="s2">also in off-label smart drug sales</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.949" end="01:08:03.319" style="s2">something like 5 billion in that role</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.839" end="01:08:06.109" style="s2">and they work right like they work for a</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.319" end="01:08:07.969" style="s2">very narrow set of metrics so if I want</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.109" end="01:08:10.089" style="s2">to focus get my midterm done or my tech</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.969" end="01:08:13.039" style="s2">start up or whatever it is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.089" end="01:08:15.420" style="s2">dopaminergic dynamics from the adderall</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.039" end="01:08:18.839" style="s2">are gonna make me focus better and have</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.420" end="01:08:19.890" style="s2">more motivation and more Drive now some</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.839" end="01:08:22.350" style="s2">of the interesting things that we find</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.890" end="01:08:23.969" style="s2">is because it&#39;s just modifying dopamine</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.350" end="01:08:26.040" style="s2">and not looking at acetylcholine and</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.969" end="01:08:28.020" style="s2">what how it&#39;s involved in memory not</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.040" end="01:08:30.000" style="s2">looking at glutamate not looking at all</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.020" end="01:08:32.190" style="s2">of the rest of neuro chemistry and not</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.000" end="01:08:34.259" style="s2">even looking at all of the dopamine</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.190" end="01:08:35.580" style="s2">process just typically one small part</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.259" end="01:08:37.980" style="s2">that one synthetic molecules can</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.580" end="01:08:39.719" style="s2">override you get certain effects on</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.980" end="01:08:42.420" style="s2">certain side effects and certain missing</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.719" end="01:08:44.279" style="s2">effects right so we get increased focus</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.420" end="01:08:45.660" style="s2">but we don&#39;t get increased memory man</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.279" end="01:08:48.630" style="s2">she get decreased memory of certain</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.660" end="01:08:52.850" style="s2">kinds that all decrease creativity and</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.630" end="01:08:54.480" style="s2">then decreased empathy increased anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.850" end="01:08:56.370" style="s2">aggressiveness sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.480" end="01:08:59.429" style="s2">depersonalization D realization</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.370" end="01:09:01.859" style="s2">decreased task switching you know etc</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.429" end="01:09:04.440" style="s2">these are really important thing so and</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.859" end="01:09:06.870" style="s2">because even insofar as we&#39;re affecting</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.440" end="01:09:08.460" style="s2">dopamine we&#39;re just overriding a</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.870" end="01:09:10.199" style="s2">regulatory system providing a whole</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.460" end="01:09:12.359" style="s2">bunch of an insane chemical not actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.199" end="01:09:13.859" style="s2">saying how does this system regulate its</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.359" end="01:09:15.120" style="s2">own dopamine and how can we support it</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.859" end="01:09:17.370" style="s2">to do that then we&#39;re gonna create</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.120" end="01:09:19.650" style="s2">dependence and addiction and so these</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.370" end="01:09:21.330" style="s2">were the things that I saw was a scaling</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.650" end="01:09:23.880" style="s2">amount of dependence and addiction and</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.330" end="01:09:25.589" style="s2">very narrow positives with a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.880" end="01:09:28.080" style="s2">positives that were necessary missing</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.589" end="01:09:30.060" style="s2">and meaningful side-effects so the</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.080" end="01:09:32.100" style="s2">question in that space we worked with</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.060" end="01:09:35.009" style="s2">people in a in an integrative medical</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.100" end="01:09:36.810" style="s2">clinical environment - when we had their</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.009" end="01:09:39.330" style="s2">genomics we had their blood labs we had</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.810" end="01:09:40.920" style="s2">brain scans to customize chemistry that</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.330" end="01:09:42.989" style="s2">helped them tremendously so we knew we</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.920" end="01:09:44.759" style="s2">can do that and then question was can we</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.989" end="01:09:45.509" style="s2">do that at scale without personalization</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.759" end="01:09:47.009" style="s2">which I didn&#39;t know because</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.509" end="01:09:48.330" style="s2">personalization is a big deal and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.009" end="01:09:51.089" style="s2">working towards methods to build a</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.330" end="01:09:53.429" style="s2">personalized there are some things that</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.089" end="01:09:54.510" style="s2">I just won&#39;t do widely cuz they have to</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.429" end="01:09:56.489" style="s2">be personalized they&#39;re so different</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.510" end="01:09:58.020" style="s2">person-to-person so alright right we</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.489" end="01:10:00.179" style="s2">don&#39;t have any type of folate or folic</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.020" end="01:10:01.830" style="s2">acid because whether someone should be</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.179" end="01:10:03.300" style="s2">on a methylated or nonmetal label it</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.830" end="01:10:04.380" style="s2">makes such a really big difference there</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.300" end="01:10:05.880" style="s2">right we just don&#39;t with that</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.380" end="01:10:08.160" style="s2">access if we can&#39;t personalize that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.880" end="01:10:10.110" style="s2">but there are a lot of axes that</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.160" end="01:10:12.000" style="s2">everyone who is self selecting into a</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.110" end="01:10:13.590" style="s2">particular kind of thing like something</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.000" end="01:10:15.780" style="s2">for cognitive enhancement do pretty well</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.590" end="01:10:19.469" style="s2">across the whole board so you know high</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.780" end="01:10:20.910" style="s2">success and well tolerated so what we</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.469" end="01:10:22.530" style="s2">wanted to do with quality was say can we</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.910" end="01:10:24.440" style="s2">make an alternative so that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.530" end="01:10:27.949" style="s2">have to go to just a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.440" end="01:10:29.960" style="s2">caffeine or off-label smart drugs or</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.949" end="01:10:31.610" style="s2">just suffer without the ability to focus</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.960" end="01:10:32.540" style="s2">they will actually help them in what</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.610" end="01:10:34.610" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.540" end="01:10:37.100" style="s2">with enough subjective effect that they</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.610" end="01:10:39.620" style="s2">actually feel it and that will actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.100" end="01:10:42.320" style="s2">have a much wider host of positive</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.620" end="01:10:44.660" style="s2">effects that we&#39;re getting focusing</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.320" end="01:10:46.489" style="s2">concentration and drive but also</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.660" end="01:10:48.500" style="s2">emotional resilience and task switching</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.489" end="01:10:50.660" style="s2">and creativity and analysis and</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.500" end="01:10:53.150" style="s2">synthesis and you know so we we started</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.660" end="01:10:55.040" style="s2">by doing a a kind of cognitive map of</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.150" end="01:10:56.540" style="s2">what are all of the states and all of</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.040" end="01:10:57.800" style="s2">the capacities that people are looking</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.540" end="01:11:00.320" style="s2">for when they were they wanting to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.800" end="01:11:02.719" style="s2">productive work and then saying what are</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.320" end="01:11:04.070" style="s2">the underlying physiologic pathways that</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.719" end="01:11:06.949" style="s2">mediate those that we know about from</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.070" end="01:11:10.150" style="s2">the various neuro scientific and</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.949" end="01:11:13.160" style="s2">bioscience fields and then can we</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.150" end="01:11:14.840" style="s2">understand how those systems work so how</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.160" end="01:11:16.130" style="s2">does the body regulate dopamine so you</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.840" end="01:11:17.719" style="s2">know as you start to look at you say</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.130" end="01:11:19.430" style="s2">alright so protein comes in dietarily</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.719" end="01:11:21.949" style="s2">gets broken down to amino acids</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.430" end="01:11:23.780" style="s2">phenylalanine converts into tyrosine</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.949" end="01:11:25.130" style="s2">converts to n acetyl tyrosine converts</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.780" end="01:11:27.290" style="s2">to l-dopa crosses the blood-brain</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.130" end="01:11:29.719" style="s2">barrier converts to dopamine and a</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.290" end="01:11:32.540" style="s2">presynaptic neuron transport a protein</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.719" end="01:11:34.370" style="s2">down an axon crosses a synapse has to</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.540" end="01:11:36.230" style="s2">get by synaptic enzymes that will break</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.370" end="01:11:39.199" style="s2">it down in different ways hydroxylase</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.230" end="01:11:40.460" style="s2">and they may OB and CMT and etc and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.199" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">goes into one of a few dopamine</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.460" end="01:11:43.100" style="s2">receptors</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:44.480" style="s2">there&#39;s inter cellular dynamics that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.100" end="01:11:46.070" style="s2">involved so you just start to look at</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.480" end="01:11:48.860" style="s2">that and say how does the body do this</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.070" end="01:11:50.719" style="s2">thing on its own and are there</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.860" end="01:11:53.239" style="s2">deficiencies in any of those key</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.719" end="01:11:55.910" style="s2">nutrients or transform factors or things</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.239" end="01:11:58.489" style="s2">that are oftentimes under fully</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.910" end="01:12:00.110" style="s2">supported that we can support and that</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.489" end="01:12:01.670" style="s2">would be just looking at dopamine right</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.110" end="01:12:04.060" style="s2">then you do that with acetylcholine when</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.670" end="01:12:06.890" style="s2">you look at glutamate then you look at</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.060" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">functions like neurogenesis but is</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.890" end="01:12:09.680" style="s2">continuously developing new neurons are</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:11.510" style="s2">there things that actually support</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.680" end="01:12:13.940" style="s2">increased neurogenesis or neuro etaf</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.510" end="01:12:16.969" style="s2">that gee killing old neurons better so</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.940" end="01:12:18.140" style="s2">you don&#39;t have senescence so we looked</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.969" end="01:12:20.930" style="s2">at what are the host of things people</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.140" end="01:12:22.730" style="s2">are looking for there are healthy states</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.930" end="01:12:24.410" style="s2">and capacities what is the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.730" end="01:12:26.449" style="s2">physiology involved how does that</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.410" end="01:12:28.100" style="s2">physiology naturally regulate and what</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.449" end="01:12:30.410" style="s2">what what might we be able to do to</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.100" end="01:12:33.199" style="s2">support the natural regulatory systems</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.410" end="01:12:35.510" style="s2">so that people both have a more complete</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.199" end="01:12:37.400" style="s2">positive state and that rather than</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.510" end="01:12:38.179" style="s2">create dependence right there on it for</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.400" end="01:12:40.249" style="s2">a while</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.179" end="01:12:42.320" style="s2">overrode their regulatory system and now</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.249" end="01:12:43.880" style="s2">there&#39;s addiction that it actually is</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.320" end="01:12:45.260" style="s2">supporting the robustness of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.880" end="01:12:45.800" style="s2">regulatory system so that when they get</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.260" end="01:12:47.689" style="s2">off it</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.800" end="01:12:50.749" style="s2">there is elevation from baseline that</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.689" end="01:12:51.979" style="s2">lasts right the exact opposite side</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.749" end="01:12:55.280" style="s2">effect in the exact opposite of</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.979" end="01:12:57.469" style="s2">dependence so that was our goal and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.280" end="01:12:59.599" style="s2">we did hundreds of iterations bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.469" end="01:13:01.639" style="s2">testing you know after doing full litter</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.599" end="01:13:03.050" style="s2">to review database of five hundred no</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.639" end="01:13:04.369" style="s2">tropic chemicals and looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.050" end="01:13:05.929" style="s2">pathways of them and then looking at</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.369" end="01:13:08.659" style="s2">positive synergies negative synergies</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.929" end="01:13:11.030" style="s2">delivery mechanisms and we ended up</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.659" end="01:13:13.780" style="s2">getting to this formula</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.030" end="01:13:16.400" style="s2">you know that&#39;s there right now which</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.780" end="01:13:18.800" style="s2">over a large enough number of people</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.400" end="01:13:20.389" style="s2">over a large enough amount of time</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.800" end="01:13:22.639" style="s2">tested well enough that we were actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.389" end="01:13:24.619" style="s2">really happy with it and so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.639" end="01:13:26.689" style="s2">first product and that the goal there</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.619" end="01:13:29.659" style="s2">was to be able to support people having</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.689" end="01:13:31.309" style="s2">increased productive capacity rate</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.659" end="01:13:32.900" style="s2">increased cognitive clarity and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.309" end="01:13:37.189" style="s2">associated emotional states like</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.900" end="01:13:40.939" style="s2">resilience and and drive that was</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.189" end="01:13:42.739" style="s2">actually not bad for people and good for</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.939" end="01:13:44.360" style="s2">people now I can&#39;t claim that we know</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.739" end="01:13:46.099" style="s2">that because we haven&#39;t done long enough</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.360" end="01:13:48.499" style="s2">term trials with enough metrics with</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.099" end="01:13:50.570" style="s2">enough controls to claim all that but</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.499" end="01:13:52.070" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve done preclinical trials</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.570" end="01:13:54.110" style="s2">with pre and post brain scans and</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.070" end="01:13:57.260" style="s2">biometrics and seen you know really</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.110" end="01:14:00.289" style="s2">meaningful statistical correlations and</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.260" end="01:14:02.539" style="s2">we&#39;ve had I don&#39;t forty thousand people</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.289" end="01:14:06.380" style="s2">over three years we&#39;re collecting data</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.539" end="01:14:09.050" style="s2">from what their experience is really so</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.380" end="01:14:10.519" style="s2">we we&#39;re very happy about that and</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.050" end="01:14:12.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the first car that didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.519" end="01:14:15.050" style="s2">know what it kind of is is a complex</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.800" end="01:14:17.119" style="s2">approach because her brain is a complex</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.050" end="01:14:18.439" style="s2">system embodies a complex system so</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.119" end="01:14:20.389" style="s2">rather than here&#39;s one molecule to</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.439" end="01:14:21.949" style="s2">override it it&#39;s how does it</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.389" end="01:14:24.019" style="s2">self-regulate and can we support it</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.949" end="01:14:26.869" style="s2">self-regulation across many related axes</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.019" end="01:14:28.070" style="s2">now if we were gonna approach anxiety we</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.869" end="01:14:30.889" style="s2">would do it the same way if we were</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.070" end="01:14:34.579" style="s2">gonna approach pain rather than you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.889" end="01:14:35.780" style="s2">just some end set or opiate we do it the</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.579" end="01:14:38.179" style="s2">same way how does the body naturally</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.780" end="01:14:39.820" style="s2">produce its own opiates how does it</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.179" end="01:14:42.190" style="s2">naturally deal with inflammation</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.820" end="01:14:43.389" style="s2">and can we support those dynamics if</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.190" end="01:14:48.579" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna work with sleep we go to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.389" end="01:14:49.599" style="s2">same way so those are things I like I</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.579" end="01:14:51.760" style="s2">can&#39;t wait to see what you guys are</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.599" end="01:14:53.619" style="s2">coming up with next so there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.760" end="01:14:56.860" style="s2">of things in there that I really like is</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.619" end="01:14:59.409" style="s2">that you guys really were very</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.860" end="01:15:01.090" style="s2">thoughtful about the synergy between the</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.409" end="01:15:02.710" style="s2">different compounds I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.090" end="01:15:04.239" style="s2">lot of cowboys and Indians right now in</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.710" end="01:15:06.750" style="s2">the nootropic spaces I&#39;m sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.239" end="01:15:08.889" style="s2">aware where you see the same kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.750" end="01:15:10.510" style="s2">formulations on 10 different products</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.889" end="01:15:12.010" style="s2">and it&#39;s like one guy just looked at</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.510" end="01:15:14.409" style="s2">what the next guys doing on a label oh</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.010" end="01:15:16.420" style="s2">yeah here that&#39;s good for short-term</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.409" end="01:15:17.770" style="s2">memory focus cognition whatever blah</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.420" end="01:15:20.590" style="s2">blah and they just kind of throw those</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.770" end="01:15:22.750" style="s2">stacks out there without necessarily for</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.590" end="01:15:24.070" style="s2">thought as to how those interact with</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.750" end="01:15:26.949" style="s2">one another right so you have one</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.070" end="01:15:28.690" style="s2">molecule and it does one thing and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.949" end="01:15:30.579" style="s2">just even say that that that effect of</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.690" end="01:15:31.630" style="s2">that molecule is universal and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.579" end="01:15:33.190" style="s2">choosing ones that are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.630" end="01:15:35.320" style="s2">universally affecting people in the same</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.190" end="01:15:36.909" style="s2">way but then you combine that with other</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.320" end="01:15:37.810" style="s2">molecules another one&#39;s another ones and</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.909" end="01:15:40.659" style="s2">now you have something totally different</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.810" end="01:15:43.570" style="s2">you have a third party compound now</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.659" end="01:15:46.030" style="s2">right and so that can go well or not</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.570" end="01:15:48.639" style="s2">based on self experimentation there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.030" end="01:15:49.960" style="s2">been times where I&#39;ve you know taken too</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.639" end="01:15:52.150" style="s2">many different things at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.960" end="01:15:54.099" style="s2">and too much of them and I&#39;m having the</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.150" end="01:15:56.560" style="s2">opposite effect where I can&#39;t focus and</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.099" end="01:15:58.659" style="s2">I&#39;m actually feel like I&#39;m freaking nuts</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.560" end="01:16:01.000" style="s2">because I took too many smart drugs or</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.659" end="01:16:03.250" style="s2">whatever I overdosed on yohimbe wants</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.000" end="01:16:05.800" style="s2">for example just random like don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.250" end="01:16:08.020" style="s2">that kids at home you know pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.800" end="01:16:10.599" style="s2">to the the dosage and stuff but I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.020" end="01:16:12.099" style="s2">what&#39;s cool about qualia is that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.599" end="01:16:12.760" style="s2">really looked at how things relate to</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.099" end="01:16:15.010" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.760" end="01:16:16.179" style="s2">that you&#39;re not putting anything in</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.010" end="01:16:18.760" style="s2">there that&#39;s gonna cause your body to</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.179" end="01:16:20.440" style="s2">down regulate its own production we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.760" end="01:16:22.690" style="s2">to the point where there&#39;s a dependency</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.440" end="01:16:24.610" style="s2">and oh my god now I can&#39;t make this</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.690" end="01:16:26.409" style="s2">neurotransmitter or whatever because</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.610" end="01:16:30.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve it&#39;s been done for me for so long</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.409" end="01:16:32.409" style="s2">and then also I did the whole basis of</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.400" end="01:16:33.969" style="s2">it is coming from what I like about the</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.409" end="01:16:36.389" style="s2">company itself is that it&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.969" end="01:16:40.030" style="s2">this intention that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.389" end="01:16:42.010" style="s2">create people with biology that runs</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.030" end="01:16:43.690" style="s2">better so they&#39;ll be better people I</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.010" end="01:16:45.099" style="s2">mean to me that makes total sense I had</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.690" end="01:16:47.530" style="s2">to flew a couple of months ago and I was</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.099" end="01:16:50.199" style="s2">in Colorado and I had to speak at two</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.530" end="01:16:52.740" style="s2">events and they were pretty substantial</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.199" end="01:16:55.470" style="s2">for me and I was so</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.740" end="01:16:57.900" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t I could not make myself be</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.470" end="01:17:00.810" style="s2">in a good mood like I literally just</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.900" end="01:17:02.340" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be happy you know it&#39;s just I</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.810" end="01:17:04.110" style="s2">was just depressed and even though my</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.340" end="01:17:06.330" style="s2">mind was right and I wasn&#39;t fighting it</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.110" end="01:17:07.830" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t like caught in some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.330" end="01:17:09.630" style="s2">negative spiral I wasn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.830" end="01:17:11.040" style="s2">negative at all it just wasn&#39;t in a good</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.630" end="01:17:11.520" style="s2">mood that it&#39;s well happy like I do</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.040" end="01:17:13.980" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.520" end="01:17:17.460" style="s2">so I wasn&#39;t firing on all cylinders you</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.980" end="01:17:20.010" style="s2">know so I really think that you do have</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.460" end="01:17:21.560" style="s2">to approach your own development from</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.010" end="01:17:24.870" style="s2">all sides in other words I can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.560" end="01:17:28.140" style="s2">eating you know glyphosate and aspartame</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.870" end="01:17:30.390" style="s2">and all this evil things that they put</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.140" end="01:17:31.920" style="s2">in food and just think I can meditate my</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.390" end="01:17:34.290" style="s2">way into a higher consciousness while</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.920" end="01:17:35.970" style="s2">I&#39;m destroying my biology in the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.290" end="01:17:38.280" style="s2">way I can&#39;t become obsessed with herbs</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.970" end="01:17:39.840" style="s2">and superfoods and your tropics and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.280" end="01:17:42.720" style="s2">be running around flipping people off in</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.840" end="01:17:44.100" style="s2">traffic caught in my trauma issues you</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.720" end="01:17:45.630" style="s2">know it&#39;s like you have to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.100" end="01:17:47.070" style="s2">approach it from all angles so I like</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.630" end="01:17:48.630" style="s2">that you&#39;re not like hey guys let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.070" end="01:17:50.760" style="s2">a cool vitamin that makes people better</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.630" end="01:17:53.670" style="s2">at computer work it&#39;s like now we have a</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.760" end="01:17:57.120" style="s2">larger scope of vision which is really</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.670" end="01:17:59.730" style="s2">cool now back to the qualia it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.120" end="01:18:02.340" style="s2">interesting to observe the friends that</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.730" end="01:18:03.720" style="s2">I&#39;ve turned on to it and you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.340" end="01:18:06.120" style="s2">listeners of the show and stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.720" end="01:18:09.240" style="s2">that is that I haven&#39;t I&#39;ve yet to have</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.120" end="01:18:11.490" style="s2">anyone say that they had a negative</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.240" end="01:18:13.830" style="s2">experience as a result where with a lot</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.490" end="01:18:15.630" style="s2">of other nootropics people say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.830" end="01:18:17.190" style="s2">too stimulating or it made them tired</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.630" end="01:18:19.890" style="s2">made them like this made them like that</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.190" end="01:18:23.340" style="s2">so I&#39;ve had no one report back like oh</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.890" end="01:18:25.320" style="s2">my god I felt horrible and only a couple</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.340" end="01:18:28.800" style="s2">people that were like man I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.320" end="01:18:30.690" style="s2">notice anything yeah so the majority of</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.800" end="01:18:32.190" style="s2">people that I&#39;ve interacted with that</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.690" end="01:18:34.350" style="s2">have tried are like oh my god this is</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.190" end="01:18:35.760" style="s2">the best thing ever like what where has</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.350" end="01:18:38.100" style="s2">this been my whole life like an</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.760" end="01:18:40.170" style="s2">overwhelmingly positive experience and</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.100" end="01:18:41.610" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s been like for me too</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.170" end="01:18:42.900" style="s2">which is one of the reasons I wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.610" end="01:18:44.340" style="s2">track you down and I found out there was</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.900" end="01:18:45.930" style="s2">so much more to your story than just</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.340" end="01:18:49.680" style="s2">being like you know a guy that knows</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.930" end="01:18:50.430" style="s2">about nootropics but for me what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.680" end="01:18:52.110" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.430" end="01:18:54.270" style="s2">speaking of especially the the</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.110" end="01:18:57.240" style="s2">down-regulation piece is that when I</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.270" end="01:18:59.070" style="s2">started I took the full dose I think it</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.240" end="01:19:01.200" style="s2">was three of number one and six of</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.070" end="01:19:02.460" style="s2">number two and I did that a lot and it</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.200" end="01:19:04.350" style="s2">kind of just brought me up to a nice</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.460" end="01:19:05.679" style="s2">base level and then at a certain point</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.350" end="01:19:08.889" style="s2">that became a little</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.679" end="01:19:11.349" style="s2">to stimulating and now I&#39;m like I take</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.889" end="01:19:13.449" style="s2">one number one to number two and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.349" end="01:19:16.389" style="s2">like I feel great there&#39;s no need to</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.449" end="01:19:19.059" style="s2">even push it beyond that so it actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.389" end="01:19:22.119" style="s2">has the opposite effect of building up a</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.059" end="01:19:24.459" style="s2">tolerance a right that was intended yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.119" end="01:19:26.769" style="s2">so good job on that because with most</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.459" end="01:19:28.269" style="s2">other things you take it and you take it</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.769" end="01:19:29.559" style="s2">in you build the tolerance you need more</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.269" end="01:19:30.760" style="s2">and more and then your body forgets how</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.559" end="01:19:32.679" style="s2">to make it and you end up in this</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.760" end="01:19:33.999" style="s2">imbalance but I think that there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.679" end="01:19:35.559" style="s2">something really cool about what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.999" end="01:19:38.739" style="s2">done I&#39;m gonna come back to the problems</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.559" end="01:19:40.179" style="s2">of capitalism for a minute yeah every</p>

<p begin="01:19:48.729" end="01:19:52.179" style="s2">because I was pounding so much of it and</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.320" end="01:19:53.800" style="s2">now I&#39;m like actually I&#39;m getting too</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.179" end="01:19:55.269" style="s2">many shipments I had to stop that and</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.800" end="01:19:57.519" style="s2">just order when I run out cuz I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.269" end="01:19:59.889" style="s2">run out it&#39;s so you guys aren&#39;t your</p>

<p begin="01:19:59.889" end="01:20:07.420" style="s2">theory so it going so you think about it</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.599" end="01:20:09.459" style="s2">from say I&#39;m a pharma company and there</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.420" end="01:20:11.679" style="s2">are MBAs that are looking at the</p>

<p begin="01:20:11.679" end="01:20:17.289" style="s2">decisions right I mean at the financial</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.459" end="01:20:19.119" style="s2">metrics and spreadsheets and and saying</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.289" end="01:20:21.280" style="s2">okay maximize lifetime revenue of a</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.119" end="01:20:23.400" style="s2">customer the things that treat symptoms</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.280" end="01:20:25.719" style="s2">forever so we say depression is not</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.400" end="01:20:26.949" style="s2">curable you have a biochemical imbalance</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.719" end="01:20:28.599" style="s2">which is like some magic term</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.949" end="01:20:31.599" style="s2">biochemical miles with a bucket cause of</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.599" end="01:20:33.369" style="s2">it right genetic it&#39;s just just a magic</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.599" end="01:20:35.559" style="s2">term for we don&#39;t know where we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.369" end="01:20:37.630" style="s2">bothered to look at it and in depth and</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.559" end="01:20:39.429" style="s2">so we have to simply treat that forever</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.630" end="01:20:40.630" style="s2">heart disease automatically treat that</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.429" end="01:20:44.439" style="s2">forever cholesterol we&#39;re gonna treat it</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.630" end="01:20:46.329" style="s2"> all right so that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.439" end="01:20:50.380" style="s2">from a lifetime revenue point of view</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.329" end="01:20:52.900" style="s2">and if it creates side effects did need</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.380" end="01:20:56.320" style="s2">other drugs to resolve them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.900" end="01:20:58.689" style="s2">called a cross seller and a perfect and</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.320" end="01:20:59.709" style="s2">then if to maximize lifetime value I</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.689" end="01:21:02.159" style="s2">want to start them as young as possible</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.709" end="01:21:05.340" style="s2">so we make up new diseases like a TD</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.159" end="01:21:08.619" style="s2">after we put two ritalin shitty</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.340" end="01:21:10.510" style="s2">desks and so they still make those desks</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.619" end="01:21:13.150" style="s2">like they have my seventies this little</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.510" end="01:21:15.130" style="s2">wooden prisons so we get them started as</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.150" end="01:21:18.680" style="s2">early as possible on an iatrogenic cycle</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.130" end="01:21:20.990" style="s2">right so pretty much everything that</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.680" end="01:21:22.490" style="s2">in medicine we wanted to do the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.990" end="01:21:24.350" style="s2">if it causes addiction we want to create</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.490" end="01:21:25.400" style="s2">a long-term benefit because the side</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.350" end="01:21:26.870" style="s2">effects you want the side effects to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.400" end="01:21:28.310" style="s2">comprehensively positive if the people</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.870" end="01:21:30.380" style="s2">have to stay on it we want them to get</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.310" end="01:21:30.800" style="s2">off of it right that like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.380" end="01:21:33.650" style="s2">goal</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.800" end="01:21:35.930" style="s2">and so really theory of market should</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.650" end="01:21:37.670" style="s2">not apply to medicine because people</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.930" end="01:21:39.350" style="s2">really can&#39;t choose to not participate</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.670" end="01:21:41.390" style="s2">with something that will make them</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.350" end="01:21:42.920" style="s2">better if they&#39;re sick and since they</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.390" end="01:21:44.030" style="s2">really can&#39;t choose not to do that</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.920" end="01:21:45.410" style="s2">theory of markets as a up thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.030" end="01:21:47.750" style="s2">just like there shouldn&#39;t be for-profit</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.410" end="01:21:49.010" style="s2">prisons right and so this was hard for</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.750" end="01:21:50.300" style="s2">us because and is why we started with</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.010" end="01:21:51.620" style="s2">supplement as opposed to bigger things</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.300" end="01:21:54.890" style="s2">we could have done is because I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.620" end="01:21:57.620" style="s2">want to take capital from any financial</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.890" end="01:21:59.330" style="s2">service places that would then bind us</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.620" end="01:22:01.550" style="s2">to doing things were unethical so like</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.330" end="01:22:03.200" style="s2">our right our cost of goods to make</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.550" end="01:22:06.380" style="s2">qualia is more expensive than most</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.200" end="01:22:08.300" style="s2">Metroplex retail and it&#39;s because if you</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.380" end="01:22:10.070" style="s2">want to use the right form right you use</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.300" end="01:22:11.450" style="s2">the phosphorylated version of this and</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.070" end="01:22:12.920" style="s2">the methylated version of this and etc</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.450" end="01:22:14.090" style="s2">and with the right concentration of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.920" end="01:22:16.370" style="s2">dose you knows you take nine</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.090" end="01:22:17.990" style="s2">capsules yeah but and that&#39;s not filler</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.370" end="01:22:20.300" style="s2">it&#39;s because it just takes that much of</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.990" end="01:22:21.920" style="s2">those things it&#39;s just expensive no and</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.300" end="01:22:23.720" style="s2">also the fact that you guys aren&#39;t using</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.920" end="01:22:25.220" style="s2">excipient sand binders and all that</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.720" end="01:22:27.110" style="s2">weird stuff which I always notice right</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.220" end="01:22:28.940" style="s2">away I&#39;m like I go to the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.110" end="01:22:30.620" style="s2">label and a suddenly I got that there it</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.940" end="01:22:32.360" style="s2">is which means that you can&#39;t work with</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.620" end="01:22:33.350" style="s2">almost any manufacturers because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.360" end="01:22:35.120" style="s2">what they need to make it work in their</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.350" end="01:22:38.780" style="s2">machine it&#39;s a magnesium stearate and</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.120" end="01:22:40.370" style="s2">and all this stuff right yeah so all all</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.780" end="01:22:41.960" style="s2">of that like doing the integrity thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.370" end="01:22:44.570" style="s2">is just a hard thing to make work</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.960" end="01:22:46.250" style="s2">fiscally but like you have found with</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.570" end="01:22:47.630" style="s2">your podcast if you do there will be</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.250" end="01:22:48.920" style="s2">people that are attracted to that thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.630" end="01:22:51.050" style="s2">and it can grow so that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.920" end="01:22:58.250" style="s2">trying to do that&#39;s cool yeah the real</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.050" end="01:23:00.770" style="s2">deal so in terms of the other things</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.250" end="01:23:03.170" style="s2">that people typically use I want to just</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.770" end="01:23:06.200" style="s2">run run a couple of these by you because</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.170" end="01:23:08.030" style="s2">I take my qualia I guess about five days</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.200" end="01:23:10.130" style="s2">a week and as I said it&#39;s been strange</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.030" end="01:23:12.050" style="s2">that my dosage has gone down it must be</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.130" end="01:23:14.120" style="s2">fixing me that&#39;s the way I look at it</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.050" end="01:23:15.800" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s connecting synapses or</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.120" end="01:23:17.360" style="s2">something that were off and other</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.800" end="01:23:18.920" style="s2">they&#39;re getting more in alignment so</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.360" end="01:23:21.980" style="s2">what I look at it but there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.920" end="01:23:24.200" style="s2">things to that depending on where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.980" end="01:23:26.030" style="s2">going what I&#39;m doing I find to be useful</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.200" end="01:23:27.470" style="s2">so today for example I knew that I was</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.030" end="01:23:29.150" style="s2">gonna have a very social day I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.470" end="01:23:31.310" style="s2">to be talking to you I&#39;m being interview</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.150" end="01:23:32.900" style="s2">the way back home after this so I did a</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.310" end="01:23:36.110" style="s2">number of different things one of them</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.900" end="01:23:37.850" style="s2">being phenibut for example which I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.110" end="01:23:39.800" style="s2">maybe do once a week or something like</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.850" end="01:23:43.699" style="s2">that and I just find it&#39;s just a really</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.800" end="01:23:46.969" style="s2">great social lubricant and then I also</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.699" end="01:23:51.739" style="s2">took some piracetam because I find that</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.969" end="01:23:54.260" style="s2">it really helps me with speech so some</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.739" end="01:23:57.199" style="s2">of these other things I&#39;ll do but I</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.260" end="01:23:59.989" style="s2">could give Joe here piracetam and it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.199" end="01:24:02.000" style="s2">give him anxiety or he won&#39;t notice</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.989" end="01:24:04.699" style="s2">anything or I give someone else I gave a</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.000" end="01:24:06.020" style="s2">girlfriend once phenibut and she</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.699" end="01:24:08.780" style="s2">probably took a little bit too much but</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.020" end="01:24:10.610" style="s2">she got deathly ill you know andand what</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.780" end="01:24:12.710" style="s2">I would take for this it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.610" end="01:24:14.360" style="s2">sprinkle to me to her she was a bit</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.710" end="01:24:17.090" style="s2">smaller and just had this huge adverse</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.360" end="01:24:19.280" style="s2">reaction same thing I modafinil is</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.090" end="01:24:23.420" style="s2">another one that I really like and for</p>

<p begin="01:27:20.770" end="01:27:25.500" style="s2">category and in general people should</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.200" end="01:27:27.580" style="s2">explore there if they are well educated</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.500" end="01:27:29.590" style="s2">it&#39;s like if they really educate</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.580" end="01:27:31.840" style="s2">themselves well about the topic and they</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.590" end="01:27:33.430" style="s2">and they&#39;re really paying attention in a</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.840" end="01:27:35.200" style="s2">quantified self kind of way to the</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.430" end="01:27:36.880" style="s2">results and they should not be looking</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.200" end="01:27:39.340" style="s2">at doing that super regularly now there</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.880" end="01:27:41.500" style="s2">are exceptions so Debra know for</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.340" end="01:27:43.720" style="s2">instance works through mao-b inhibition</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.500" end="01:27:46.230" style="s2">so mao-b</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.720" end="01:27:47.670" style="s2">is a enzyme in this</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.230" end="01:27:49.530" style="s2">apps that breaks down certain</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.670" end="01:27:51.660" style="s2">neurotransmitters like dopamine like</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.530" end="01:27:56.130" style="s2">other catecholamines like phenyl fo me</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.660" end="01:27:57.870" style="s2">so if you inhibit the mao-b those</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.130" end="01:27:59.640" style="s2">neurotransmitters will get across the</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.870" end="01:28:02.340" style="s2">sentence more into the postsynaptic</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.640" end="01:28:06.090" style="s2">neuron this can be very dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.340" end="01:28:08.850" style="s2">because if you take that with anything</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.090" end="01:28:11.040" style="s2">that is also increasing mono aunt means</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.850" end="01:28:12.810" style="s2">going those types of neurotransmitters</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.040" end="01:28:14.190" style="s2">going into the synapse specifically ones</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.810" end="01:28:16.620" style="s2">it should be broken down by mao-b they</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.190" end="01:28:18.690" style="s2">can get to to high level so one wants to</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.620" end="01:28:20.910" style="s2">be careful with that and so what would</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.690" end="01:28:22.020" style="s2">be some things that you with Debra know</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.910" end="01:28:23.760" style="s2">for example that you wouldn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.020" end="01:28:26.460" style="s2">combine with that at all</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.760" end="01:28:28.020" style="s2">interesting and that doesn&#39;t mean nobody</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.460" end="01:28:32.100" style="s2">does it and has a good experience what</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.020" end="01:28:35.100" style="s2">about my daffodil same right so if if</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.100" end="01:28:37.140" style="s2">you are now they&#39;re different modafinil</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.100" end="01:28:39.560" style="s2">we don&#39;t know all the mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.140" end="01:28:42.420" style="s2">modafinil that well it is the least</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.560" end="01:28:46.050" style="s2">symptomatic dopaminergic for the most</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.420" end="01:28:47.550" style="s2">part for most people it seems like it</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.050" end="01:28:49.770" style="s2">works through transporter proteins</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.550" end="01:28:51.360" style="s2">largely which is gonna be a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.770" end="01:28:56.610" style="s2">less tricky than many of the other</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.360" end="01:28:58.140" style="s2">mechanisms but if if you are flooding</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.610" end="01:28:59.610" style="s2">the synapse with dopamine and not</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.140" end="01:29:02.910" style="s2">breaking it down you can get to</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.610" end="01:29:04.739" style="s2">dangerously high levels right and not</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.910" end="01:29:06.960" style="s2">everyone has too high</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.739" end="01:29:09.590" style="s2">Mao beat genetically some people&#39;s mao-b</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.960" end="01:29:11.540" style="s2">is too low they actually feel anxious</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.590" end="01:29:16.260" style="s2">because they have too many of those</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.540" end="01:29:18.360" style="s2">excitatory neurotransmitters and never</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.260" end="01:29:19.650" style="s2">know what makes them feel terrible but</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.360" end="01:29:22.350" style="s2">there are a lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.650" end="01:29:24.960" style="s2">genetically / producers of mao-b</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.350" end="01:29:26.850" style="s2">and they will have certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.960" end="01:29:28.350" style="s2">depression tendencies because their</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.850" end="01:29:30.900" style="s2">transmitters are just not getting across</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.350" end="01:29:32.130" style="s2">the synapse that well and if they take</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.900" end="01:29:33.510" style="s2">something that&#39;s just increasing the</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.130" end="01:29:34.860" style="s2">level of dopamine they might feel better</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.510" end="01:29:36.600" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually not doing the right</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.860" end="01:29:37.920" style="s2">part of the mechanism right in the right</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.600" end="01:29:40.110" style="s2">part of the pathway what&#39;s going on for</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.920" end="01:29:41.970" style="s2">them if they actually break down the</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.110" end="01:29:44.250" style="s2">excessive levels of mao be that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.970" end="01:29:45.570" style="s2">genetically producing and there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.250" end="01:29:46.950" style="s2">things that can cause a male bee to go</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.570" end="01:29:49.680" style="s2">up other than just genetics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.950" end="01:29:51.540" style="s2">inducible and so as people age mao-b</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.680" end="01:29:53.220" style="s2">goes up dopamine goes down it&#39;s a part</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.540" end="01:29:54.960" style="s2">of Aging which is why Debra knows one of</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.220" end="01:29:59.070" style="s2">the few drugs it is actually correlated</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.960" end="01:30:00.119" style="s2">to be a life extension agent and there</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.070" end="01:30:01.079" style="s2">are people who in their young</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.119" end="01:30:02.489" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t do well with it when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.079" end="01:30:04.349" style="s2">older they would because there may o be</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.489" end="01:30:06.179" style="s2">levels one from a healthy place where it</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.349" end="01:30:07.320" style="s2">would imbalance them to being excessive</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.179" end="01:30:08.760" style="s2">and no balances them</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.320" end="01:30:10.649" style="s2">so Deborah no can actually be</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.760" end="01:30:12.329" style="s2">therapeutic for some people for other</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.649" end="01:30:14.639" style="s2">people it&#39;ll be an enhancement that they</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.329" end="01:30:16.769" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do regularly so to the degree</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.639" end="01:30:18.360" style="s2">you&#39;re getting into stronger tools you</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.769" end="01:30:20.820" style="s2">should have more education just like in</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.360" end="01:30:22.499" style="s2">any field right like playing with the</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.820" end="01:30:23.579" style="s2">skill soft rather than the handsaw you</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.499" end="01:30:25.050" style="s2">kind of need to learn a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.579" end="01:30:27.559" style="s2">because there&#39;s more the consequence but</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.050" end="01:30:30.749" style="s2">you can also do cooler stuff with it</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.559" end="01:30:33.809" style="s2">so for us empowered responsibilities and</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.749" end="01:30:35.429" style="s2">self education is a really key thing</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.809" end="01:30:36.809" style="s2">because we want people to be empowered</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.429" end="01:30:38.219" style="s2">in their own health and not just feel</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.809" end="01:30:39.659" style="s2">like a victim and waiting for someone to</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.219" end="01:30:41.519" style="s2">tell them what to do who has no way of</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.659" end="01:30:43.019" style="s2">knowing what their own experiences are</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.519" end="01:30:45.479" style="s2">spending enough time even if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.019" end="01:30:46.800" style="s2">well-educated doctor they wear their</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.479" end="01:30:48.659" style="s2">fiscal structure only allows them has</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.800" end="01:30:50.219" style="s2">been five minutes of time like they just</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.659" end="01:30:52.559" style="s2">can&#39;t apply what they write that well</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.219" end="01:30:54.649" style="s2">right so smart drugs is one category</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.559" end="01:30:57.300" style="s2">research chemicals is another category</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.649" end="01:30:59.760" style="s2">well you have a bunch of chemicals that</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.300" end="01:31:01.829" style="s2">are not actually categorized as a drug</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.760" end="01:31:03.809" style="s2">they&#39;re also not categorized as a</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.829" end="01:31:05.789" style="s2">nutraceutical they are for research</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.809" end="01:31:08.099" style="s2">purposes only and they live in that kind</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.789" end="01:31:09.780" style="s2">of regulatory Bardo and that&#39;s most of</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.099" end="01:31:11.909" style="s2">the know tropics they like the rasa</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.780" end="01:31:14.249" style="s2">Tam&#39;s and women the rasa temps are in</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.909" end="01:31:16.769" style="s2">that category and the AMPA Keens those</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.249" end="01:31:19.769" style="s2">are the kind of two primary categories</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.769" end="01:31:23.340" style="s2">that people get into but then also the</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.769" end="01:31:25.709" style="s2">NSI 189 the p21 the cerebral ice and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.340" end="01:31:29.610" style="s2">lots of the phenibut right they live in</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.709" end="01:31:31.709" style="s2">that research chemical category and some</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.610" end="01:31:34.499" style="s2">of those are basically smart drugs that</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.709" end="01:31:36.239" style="s2">just didn&#39;t go through approval but and</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.499" end="01:31:38.159" style="s2">then some of them are more what we call</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.239" end="01:31:41.729" style="s2">a formal no tropic which is something</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.159" end="01:31:43.919" style="s2">that can increase cognitive some aspect</p>

<p begin="01:31:47.369" end="01:31:52.590" style="s2">happens to be one that&#39;s therapeutic for</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.019" end="01:31:54.510" style="s2">you so and then we&#39;ve also got brain</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.590" end="01:31:57.989" style="s2">nutrients which are just the amino acids</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.510" end="01:31:59.459" style="s2">fatty acids vitamins minerals that the</p>

<p begin="01:31:59.459" end="01:32:03.719" style="s2">often deficient and then you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.919" end="01:32:05.039" style="s2">tentacles and you know plants that</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.719" end="01:32:06.719" style="s2">modulate different things in different</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.039" end="01:32:09.239" style="s2">botanicals can be very powerful right</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.719" end="01:32:11.230" style="s2">you can you can get l-dopa from mucuna</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.239" end="01:32:13.300" style="s2">which is a parkinson&#39;s man</p>

<p begin="01:32:13.300" end="01:32:18.220" style="s2">kind of dos but you can get very potent</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.700" end="01:32:20.260" style="s2">botanicals so all those categories of</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.220" end="01:32:22.390" style="s2">things to play with and of course as</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.260" end="01:32:23.170" style="s2">people really get into biohacking and</p>

<p begin="01:34:58.420" end="01:35:04.090" style="s2">it if we get out of if we really look at</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.530" end="01:35:05.890" style="s2">the rat studies and we say what kind of</p>

<p begin="01:35:26.440" end="01:35:31.930" style="s2">of birth thank you right now we pulled</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.010" end="01:35:34.210" style="s2">every single study ever done on central</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.930" end="01:35:35.230" style="s2">moccasin that we can 586 studies most of</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.210" end="01:35:37.750" style="s2">which weren&#39;t online we had to go to</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.230" end="01:35:39.610" style="s2">medical libraries find them in other</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.750" end="01:35:41.770" style="s2">countries and other languages right</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.610" end="01:35:42.880" style="s2">because they they were started the</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.770" end="01:35:45.100" style="s2">research further than the fifty so they</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.880" end="01:35:47.920" style="s2">just would never put online translate</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.100" end="01:35:48.820" style="s2">them all and then we had a few PhDs in</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.920" end="01:35:51.130" style="s2">neural chemistry</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.820" end="01:35:52.540" style="s2">neuroanatomy etc do a structured</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.130" end="01:35:53.800" style="s2">literature review meta-analysis of all</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.540" end="01:35:55.600" style="s2">that for us to come up talk with our</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.800" end="01:35:58.600" style="s2">opinion on central you know there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.600" end="01:35:59.860" style="s2">a trivial thing to do but it matters if</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.600" end="01:36:03.040" style="s2">you really don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.860" end="01:36:04.900" style="s2">so I like the wild west of the space</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.040" end="01:36:07.510" style="s2">because people are starting to take more</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.900" end="01:36:09.040" style="s2">responsibility rather than just with the</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.510" end="01:36:10.150" style="s2">doctor tell them what to do and they get</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.040" end="01:36:12.100" style="s2">mad at the doctor when it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.150" end="01:36:13.480" style="s2">yeah when the doctor couldn&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.100" end="01:36:15.130" style="s2">spend enough time with them or keep</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.480" end="01:36:18.910" style="s2">up-to-date with all the research</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.130" end="01:36:20.650" style="s2">happening but I really do long for</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.910" end="01:36:22.360" style="s2">higher quality control and it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.650" end="01:36:23.740" style="s2">the things we&#39;re working on and we can</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.360" end="01:36:25.450" style="s2">only work on as fast as we can afford</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.740" end="01:36:27.510" style="s2">without moving into fiscal models that</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.450" end="01:36:29.950" style="s2">suck which is the the tricky part but</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.510" end="01:36:31.090" style="s2">like neuro tech you know we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.950" end="01:36:33.680" style="s2">about different devices that we have</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.090" end="01:36:35.760" style="s2">around the house in pmf and etc</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.680" end="01:36:38.160" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty easy to say this seems</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.760" end="01:36:39.480" style="s2">compelling let&#39;s share it well what</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.160" end="01:36:41.010" style="s2">we&#39;re working to do right now is with</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.480" end="01:36:43.170" style="s2">all the types of neuro tech whether</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.010" end="01:36:45.570" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about low-level laser</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.170" end="01:36:47.910" style="s2">therapy and transcranial intranasal</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.570" end="01:36:51.210" style="s2">lasers or we&#39;re talking about PMF or TMS</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.910" end="01:36:53.340" style="s2">or you know whatever right for us it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.210" end="01:36:55.290" style="s2">process of doing the full letter to</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.340" end="01:36:57.360" style="s2">review on everything that&#39;s known about</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.290" end="01:36:58.500" style="s2">this where who what things does it</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.360" end="01:37:00.930" style="s2">affect what things does it not affect</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.500" end="01:37:03.780" style="s2">safe etcetera and then doing full</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.930" end="01:37:05.910" style="s2">research on the actual products and say</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.780" end="01:37:07.590" style="s2">does this product have the</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.910" end="01:37:09.630" style="s2">specifications that the literature shows</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.590" end="01:37:10.920" style="s2">are useful and then curate those things</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.630" end="01:37:14.100" style="s2">so we&#39;re building a platform to do that</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.920" end="01:37:16.340" style="s2">it&#39;s just a non-trivial process and the</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.100" end="01:37:18.270" style="s2">same with just curating knowledge on</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.340" end="01:37:20.340" style="s2">nootropics is in the forum you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.270" end="01:37:21.690" style="s2">like some real gems and then a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.340" end="01:37:23.610" style="s2"> and it&#39;s not gonna say obvious</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.690" end="01:37:25.770" style="s2">which ones are the gems in the same</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.610" end="01:37:27.750" style="s2">like if you look in the bodybuilder</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.770" end="01:37:29.489" style="s2">world you go to the steroid forums some</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.750" end="01:37:31.020" style="s2">of the smartest endocrinologist anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.489" end="01:37:33.989" style="s2">are in there and then there&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.020" end="01:37:35.340" style="s2">much done bro science um it&#39;s like but</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.989" end="01:37:38.010" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know the field well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.340" end="01:37:39.230" style="s2">all same you don&#39;t know right so</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.010" end="01:37:41.520" style="s2">this is something that we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.230" end="01:37:43.350" style="s2">working to do is to have a moderation</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.520" end="01:37:45.420" style="s2">process where everything that goes there</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.350" end="01:37:47.220" style="s2">is better now that&#39;s cool man that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:37:49.739" end="01:37:52.830" style="s2">know another positive thing about right</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.300" end="01:37:54.870" style="s2">now is that I think more people are</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.830" end="01:37:58.290" style="s2">waking up to the fact that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.870" end="01:38:00.660" style="s2">actually have to rely on the allopathic</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.290" end="01:38:02.250" style="s2">medical system like I have episodes and</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.660" end="01:38:03.870" style="s2">I call them things like learning to</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.250" end="01:38:06.630" style="s2">become your own doctor you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.870" end="01:38:08.880" style="s2">like you really can do a lot on your own</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.630" end="01:38:10.980" style="s2">and then if you&#39;re if you are tied into</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.880" end="01:38:12.890" style="s2">someone good and functional medicine and</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.980" end="01:38:15.120" style="s2">they&#39;re able to kind of you know be a</p>

<p begin="01:38:15.120" end="01:38:18.930" style="s2">and knowledge but like with my</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.710" end="01:38:20.550" style="s2">relationship to medicine is I do a lot</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.930" end="01:38:22.380" style="s2">of my own research and footwork and</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.550" end="01:38:24.420" style="s2">order my own labs and geek out in like</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.380" end="01:38:25.770" style="s2">which labs are the best and most updated</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.420" end="01:38:27.930" style="s2">because even my functional medicine</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.770" end="01:38:30.300" style="s2">doctor they&#39;re still in the labs that</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.930" end="01:38:31.920" style="s2">were the best GI test last year I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.300" end="01:38:34.340" style="s2">no man and the biohacking community</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.920" end="01:38:36.690" style="s2">there&#39;s new labs with you know new</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.340" end="01:38:38.880" style="s2">parameters and things like that and I</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.690" end="01:38:41.220" style="s2">really feel the sense of power and</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.880" end="01:38:43.140" style="s2">autonomy because I&#39;m you know I know my</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.220" end="01:38:44.100" style="s2">limitations in terms of my body of</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.140" end="01:38:45.270" style="s2">knowledge and what I may have been</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.100" end="01:38:46.980" style="s2">capable of</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.270" end="01:38:49.860" style="s2">understanding or care to take the time</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.980" end="01:38:51.780" style="s2">to learn when it comes to my biology but</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.860" end="01:38:53.310" style="s2">I know what I know and then I go to the</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.780" end="01:38:55.310" style="s2">experts that are higher of the food</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.310" end="01:38:58.200" style="s2">chain and in their area of special</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.310" end="01:39:01.080" style="s2">specialization right so it&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.200" end="01:39:03.960" style="s2">that that you guys are thinking that far</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.080" end="01:39:04.740" style="s2">ahead and enabling people to help</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.960" end="01:39:06.210" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.740" end="01:39:11.430" style="s2">one of the parts I&#39;m most excited about</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.210" end="01:39:13.590" style="s2">is a integrative medical functional</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.430" end="01:39:15.360" style="s2">medical program so we&#39;ve got a number of</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.590" end="01:39:17.070" style="s2">doctors who are kind of the best</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.360" end="01:39:17.280" style="s2">integrative psychiatrists that I&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.070" end="01:39:20.010" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.280" end="01:39:21.810" style="s2">yeah well psychiatrists or just</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.010" end="01:39:26.540" style="s2">functional medicine that does second or</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.810" end="01:39:29.760" style="s2">pharmacology and so you know we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.540" end="01:39:31.590" style="s2">allowed to provide medical information</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.760" end="01:39:34.950" style="s2">prescribe diagnose treat anything like</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.590" end="01:39:37.260" style="s2">that right so if people and if someone</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.950" end="01:39:38.670" style="s2">is on has psych conditions or on psych</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.260" end="01:39:40.680" style="s2">meds you don&#39;t use our stuff because</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.670" end="01:39:42.660" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s real interactions that</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.680" end="01:39:43.830" style="s2">need to be factored but we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.660" end="01:39:45.000" style="s2">just say go to your doctor if your</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.830" end="01:39:46.890" style="s2">doctor doesn&#39;t know anything we want to</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.000" end="01:39:48.330" style="s2">provide better resources so go to your</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.890" end="01:39:49.440" style="s2">doctor and here are doctors that</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.330" end="01:39:52.520" style="s2">actually know that field really well</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.440" end="01:39:55.320" style="s2">they can run a qejy on you they can run</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.520" end="01:39:58.440" style="s2">neural hormones they can run your Walsh</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.320" end="01:39:59.670" style="s2">metabolic labs they can run your gut</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.440" end="01:40:01.560" style="s2">brain access they can look at your</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.670" end="01:40:05.400" style="s2">genomics etc and actually do the the</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.560" end="01:40:09.030" style="s2">best of what functional brain chemistry</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.400" end="01:40:10.530" style="s2">optimization currently looks like and so</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.030" end="01:40:11.820" style="s2">that&#39;s something that we&#39;ll be rolling</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.530" end="01:40:13.730" style="s2">out in this next year and then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.820" end="01:40:16.110" style="s2">been already working with another that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.730" end="01:40:18.180" style="s2">amazing that&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.110" end="01:40:21.000" style="s2">yeah because you do need that that</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.180" end="01:40:22.410" style="s2">middleman you know you&#39;re just a freakin</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.000" end="01:40:25.110" style="s2">genius and you have the time and energy</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.410" end="01:40:26.580" style="s2">to devote to yourself but I think each</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.110" end="01:40:28.800" style="s2">one of us can only take it to a certain</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.580" end="01:40:30.090" style="s2">level and we need you know we need that</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.800" end="01:40:31.770" style="s2">help but it&#39;s like how do you find a</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.090" end="01:40:33.270" style="s2">good one I always get the question of</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.770" end="01:40:35.880" style="s2">who&#39;s the best functional medicine</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.270" end="01:40:37.770" style="s2">doctor and I&#39;m just I just made it easy</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.880" end="01:40:40.110" style="s2">on myself after working with a number of</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.770" end="01:40:42.300" style="s2">them individually and I just joined</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.110" end="01:40:44.010" style="s2">parsley health which is like a you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.300" end="01:40:46.140" style="s2">sort of I think of it as the uber of</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.010" end="01:40:48.060" style="s2">functional medicine just a a modern</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.140" end="01:40:50.970" style="s2">interface and a membership model rather</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.060" end="01:40:52.440" style="s2">than paying per visit and and I find it</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.970" end="01:40:53.790" style="s2">to be really effective because they can</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.440" end="01:40:55.320" style="s2">deal with my insurance in the billing</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.790" end="01:40:56.760" style="s2">and they know how to code the labs and</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.320" end="01:40:58.620" style="s2">stuff but it&#39;s still very much</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.760" end="01:40:58.950" style="s2">self-directed like I could just follow</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.620" end="01:41:00.420" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.950" end="01:41:03.510" style="s2">program probably be healthy but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.420" end="01:41:05.730" style="s2">always digging deeper so I&#39;ll do you</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.510" end="01:41:07.290" style="s2">know three different tests for metals</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.730" end="01:41:09.420" style="s2">where they might just order me the pre</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.290" end="01:41:11.010" style="s2">and post challenged your intestine like</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.420" end="01:41:13.110" style="s2">oh that gives me a certain metric but</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.010" end="01:41:15.480" style="s2">just hair analysis there&#39;s blood there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.110" end="01:41:17.850" style="s2">other ways you can dive into that but</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.480" end="01:41:19.470" style="s2">it&#39;s helpful to have someone you trust</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.850" end="01:41:21.780" style="s2">that&#39;ll go along with what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.470" end="01:41:24.570" style="s2">he&#39;s back in the Western medicine model</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.780" end="01:41:26.280" style="s2">I go into the general practitioner and</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.570" end="01:41:28.050" style="s2">be like hey I have X Y &amp; Z wrong they</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.280" end="01:41:30.180" style="s2">send me out to a number of specialists</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.050" end="01:41:31.500" style="s2">that are their cronies and it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.180" end="01:41:33.000" style="s2">get stuck in that whole thing and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.500" end="01:41:34.500" style="s2">going in there telling them about some</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.000" end="01:41:36.510" style="s2">new supplement or technology and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.500" end="01:41:39.240" style="s2">doctors like what I don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.510" end="01:41:40.920" style="s2">about that you know like I was having</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.240" end="01:41:43.530" style="s2">some problems with like vertigo and</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.920" end="01:41:46.050" style="s2">dizziness and I you know went up the the</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.530" end="01:41:47.520" style="s2">ladder in LA medical system which i</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.050" end="01:41:48.840" style="s2">think is probably a pretty good place to</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.520" end="01:41:51.210" style="s2">live if you want some you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.840" end="01:41:53.670" style="s2">high-level medical care and I got sent</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.210" end="01:41:55.290" style="s2">to did you know the world&#39;s best EMT</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.670" end="01:41:57.120" style="s2">that people travel from all over the</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.290" end="01:41:58.350" style="s2">world I go sit down with this guy said</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.120" end="01:41:59.550" style="s2">yeah man I don&#39;t know man I have you</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.350" end="01:42:01.140" style="s2">know I have a little hearing loss over</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.550" end="01:42:02.520" style="s2">here that&#39;s about 20% I&#39;m well aware of</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.140" end="01:42:03.810" style="s2">that but I have this thing where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.520" end="01:42:06.900" style="s2">getting dizzy all the time and I always</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.810" end="01:42:08.460" style="s2">feel carsick and he ran some tests for</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.900" end="01:42:10.440" style="s2">me I came in again he goes yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.460" end="01:42:13.200" style="s2">you probably should just not drink</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.440" end="01:42:14.820" style="s2">coffee I think it&#39;s the the caffeine can</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.200" end="01:42:17.400" style="s2">do that like really this is what you</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.820" end="01:42:19.530" style="s2">guys this the best you guys can do is</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.400" end="01:42:21.270" style="s2">that the caffeine is making me you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.530" end="01:42:23.370" style="s2">it was just like oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.270" end="01:42:25.290" style="s2">I could have done a much better job of</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.370" end="01:42:27.240" style="s2">being my own doctor and of course I you</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.290" end="01:42:29.550" style="s2">know finding finding the root of that</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.240" end="01:42:30.930" style="s2">but it&#39;s a cool time to be alive where</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.550" end="01:42:32.640" style="s2">those of us that are waking up and have</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.930" end="01:42:35.450" style="s2">access to information like you guys are</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.640" end="01:42:38.880" style="s2">providing can really take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.450" end="01:42:41.460" style="s2">well no and not become this dependent</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.880" end="01:42:45.300" style="s2">infant on the teat of Western medicine</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.460" end="01:42:46.320" style="s2">and all the inherent expenses and things</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.300" end="01:42:48.060" style="s2">that come along with that</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.320" end="01:42:51.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s really important to keep the</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.060" end="01:42:54.060" style="s2">Pareto principle in mind which is it</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.600" end="01:42:55.560" style="s2">does get complex quickly and to be able</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.060" end="01:42:58.020" style="s2">to synthesize that complexity is a</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.560" end="01:43:00.630" style="s2">really deep topic and the foundations</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.020" end="01:43:02.610" style="s2">are still 80% of it and the foundations</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.630" end="01:43:04.260" style="s2">are not that hard right I mean they</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.610" end="01:43:05.400" style="s2">might be hard to do from a discipline</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.260" end="01:43:09.660" style="s2">point of view in the life that is</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.400" end="01:43:11.730" style="s2">conditioned otherwise but if someone is</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.660" end="01:43:12.480" style="s2">not sleeping enough sleeping well and</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.730" end="01:43:14.670" style="s2">sleeping enough</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.480" end="01:43:16.500" style="s2">everything else they&#39;ll do is just tiny</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.670" end="01:43:20.280" style="s2">diminishing returns in comparison and</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.500" end="01:43:22.890" style="s2">sleeping enough right right and if</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.280" end="01:43:24.960" style="s2">someone is not exercising and if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.890" end="01:43:26.580" style="s2">not generally eating well and if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.960" end="01:43:31.800" style="s2">not doing some kinds of stress</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.580" end="01:43:34.590" style="s2">management and mental processes then the</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.800" end="01:43:37.770" style="s2">you know biohacking is actually a way to</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.590" end="01:43:39.480" style="s2">support living shittily right trying to</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.770" end="01:43:41.940" style="s2">like symptom manage the fact that their</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.480" end="01:43:45.540" style="s2">life actually sucks right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.940" end="01:43:46.890" style="s2">just not the way to go right and so if</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.540" end="01:43:48.870" style="s2">someone really just does the</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.890" end="01:43:51.660" style="s2">foundational stuff it&#39;s amazing how much</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.870" end="01:43:54.030" style="s2">of it that addresses and even like I say</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.660" end="01:43:56.219" style="s2">we look at heavy metals so I can do a</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.030" end="01:43:58.739" style="s2">pre and post provocation test and I can</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.219" end="01:43:59.880" style="s2">test with the MPs or DMS a or EDTA and</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.739" end="01:44:04.290" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna get different specific</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.880" end="01:44:06.090" style="s2">findings and I can look at hair labs</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.290" end="01:44:08.429" style="s2">which will give me a different time</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.090" end="01:44:11.460" style="s2">scale of what&#39;s being excreted and I can</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.429" end="01:44:14.460" style="s2">look at you know metal antibody stands</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.460" end="01:44:17.040" style="s2">ND and then what I&#39;m gonna find is okay</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.460" end="01:44:18.810" style="s2">there are specific chelation or binders</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.040" end="01:44:21.440" style="s2">that I&#39;m going to use differentially if</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.810" end="01:44:24.900" style="s2">it&#39;s lead versus mercury right or</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.440" end="01:44:27.000" style="s2">gadolinium or whatever it is that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.900" end="01:44:29.760" style="s2">lot to figure out it&#39;s a lot of expense</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.000" end="01:44:31.860" style="s2">and if I just put the person in a sauna</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.760" end="01:44:34.050" style="s2">every day and I gave them chlorella in</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.860" end="01:44:38.400" style="s2">the morning that would be 80% as good</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.050" end="01:44:41.160" style="s2">right yeah and so it&#39;s just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.400" end="01:44:42.780" style="s2">important like one of the things we want</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.160" end="01:44:44.580" style="s2">people to know is that there are</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.780" end="01:44:47.760" style="s2">foundational things that if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.580" end="01:44:49.440" style="s2">have the time money proclivity will</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.760" end="01:44:52.800" style="s2">really help them be radically healthier</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.440" end="01:44:54.270" style="s2">and and then optimization on top of that</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.800" end="01:44:56.370" style="s2">it&#39;s nice right</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.270" end="01:44:58.140" style="s2">right yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s well stated</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.370" end="01:45:00.660" style="s2">sometimes they&#39;ll find myself taking a</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.140" end="01:45:02.969" style="s2">50 pills in the morning trying to turn</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.660" end="01:45:04.949" style="s2">my brain on and then I realized maybe if</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.969" end="01:45:08.550" style="s2">I hadn&#39;t gone to bed at 2:00 a.m. and</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.949" end="01:45:10.469" style="s2">woken up at 7:30 you know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.550" end="01:45:12.840" style="s2">that&#39;s very true some of those things</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.469" end="01:45:14.070" style="s2">are just basic lifestyle choices if you</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.840" end="01:45:16.949" style="s2">eat if you think about it if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.070" end="01:45:20.250" style="s2">gonna eat food in its measured in pounds</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.949" end="01:45:22.050" style="s2">and it&#39;s all nutrients right that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.250" end="01:45:23.370" style="s2">stalks in our nutrient and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.050" end="01:45:24.160" style="s2">gonna take supplements that are measured</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.370" end="01:45:26.540" style="s2">in grey</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.160" end="01:45:27.710" style="s2">the supplement the word supplement means</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.540" end="01:45:29.750" style="s2">to supplement that what you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.710" end="01:45:31.550" style="s2">from right-right like getting the pounds</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.750" end="01:45:34.610" style="s2">right is a big deal right</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.550" end="01:45:37.370" style="s2">and similarly was sleep like when you</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.610" end="01:45:38.750" style="s2">exercise all that torn muscle that it</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.370" end="01:45:40.640" style="s2">needs repair is gonna be repairing</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.750" end="01:45:41.900" style="s2">during sleep during Delta&#39;s they can</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.640" end="01:45:43.490" style="s2">particular and all those nutrients that</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.900" end="01:45:46.790" style="s2">need to go into new tissues are gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.490" end="01:45:48.200" style="s2">that during sleep and so if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.790" end="01:45:49.790" style="s2">sleeping enough like all the other stuff</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.200" end="01:45:52.070" style="s2">just kind of doesn&#39;t matter that much</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.790" end="01:45:53.840" style="s2">and so this is one of the places where I</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.070" end="01:45:56.390" style="s2">want to empower people in the face of</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.840" end="01:45:59.510" style="s2">the complexity to know that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.390" end="01:46:02.330" style="s2">simplicity that is most of it which is</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.510" end="01:46:04.730" style="s2">if you live a life that is relatively</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.330" end="01:46:08.030" style="s2">closer to an evolutionary environment in</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.730" end="01:46:10.880" style="s2">evolutionary life you&#39;ll just do a lot</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.030" end="01:46:12.650" style="s2">better and then all the other stuff if</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.880" end="01:46:14.930" style="s2">you&#39;re sick you definitely want to go</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.650" end="01:46:16.490" style="s2">find good functional practitioners and</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.930" end="01:46:19.700" style="s2">if you really want to optimize you want</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.490" end="01:46:20.060" style="s2">to go yeah well said well said I love it</p>

<p begin="01:50:34.060" end="01:50:41.060" style="s2">so companies like juve and buy light and</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.230" end="01:50:44.450" style="s2">other ones they yakking on intranasal</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.060" end="01:50:49.850" style="s2">trans clay transcranial whole-body near</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.450" end="01:50:51.110" style="s2">infrared and visible infrared and we</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.850" end="01:50:53.420" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t need that if we just been a fan</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.110" end="01:50:55.100" style="s2">of Sun right but if you don&#39;t spend</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.420" end="01:50:57.680" style="s2">enough time in the Sun it is removed</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.100" end="01:50:59.270" style="s2">from normal indoor lighting because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.680" end="01:51:01.250" style="s2">the part that makes it expensive it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.270" end="01:51:03.170" style="s2">it uses that more energy to make warm</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.250" end="01:51:04.430" style="s2">light right so rather than do the whole</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.170" end="01:51:07.790" style="s2">house you just do your body with your</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.430" end="01:51:11.120" style="s2">clothes off and right now it&#39;d be you</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.790" end="01:51:13.010" style="s2">know we photosynthesize molecules like</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.120" end="01:51:14.540" style="s2">plants do not as many as plants plants</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.010" end="01:51:15.830" style="s2">or all surface area of photosynthesis</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.540" end="01:51:17.480" style="s2">were not that much surface area but we</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.830" end="01:51:19.820" style="s2">it&#39;s a meaningful part so we know that</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.480" end="01:51:22.250" style="s2">the blue water and UV into the spectrum</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.820" end="01:51:23.960" style="s2">helps us with vitamin D and the way that</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.250" end="01:51:25.340" style="s2">it does vitamin D synthesis is different</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.960" end="01:51:27.950" style="s2">than all really supplementing vitamin D</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.340" end="01:51:31.550" style="s2">so there&#39;s meaningfulness there but</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.950" end="01:51:35.060" style="s2">nitric oxide is also photo synthesized</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.550" end="01:51:37.610" style="s2">from exposure to light and ATP</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.060" end="01:51:38.990" style="s2">specifically is up regulated</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.610" end="01:51:40.130" style="s2">mitochondria output of ATP is up</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.990" end="01:51:43.100" style="s2">regulated from the red end of the</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.130" end="01:51:44.630" style="s2">spectrum and so up regulating ATP output</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.100" end="01:51:46.550" style="s2">is kind of just good for everything</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.630" end="01:51:48.140" style="s2">right this generates increased cellular</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.550" end="01:51:50.960" style="s2">energy to do whatever the cells are</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.140" end="01:51:53.060" style="s2">doing so that&#39;s a that&#39;s what I like and</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.960" end="01:51:55.550" style="s2">I do like transcranial and intranasal</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.060" end="01:51:58.610" style="s2">applications especially where there is</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.550" end="01:52:00.170" style="s2">TBI or tinnitus or things there where</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.610" end="01:52:02.690" style="s2">you don&#39;t quite know how to address it</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.170" end="01:52:03.889" style="s2">specifically but you know interesting</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.690" end="01:52:07.060" style="s2">because I do the nay</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.889" end="01:52:09.710" style="s2">the v-lite the 810 nanometers</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.060" end="01:52:10.940" style="s2">near-infrared it&#39;s invisible right I</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.710" end="01:52:13.190" style="s2">used that when I used to have the one</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.940" end="01:52:14.630" style="s2">that was six something it was very read</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.190" end="01:52:16.639" style="s2">it lit up the whole front of her face</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.630" end="01:52:18.440" style="s2">which I just like that for a fact I</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.639" end="01:52:22.310" style="s2">don&#39;t know which one does what and then</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.440" end="01:52:25.639" style="s2">I do the jus and I love both of those as</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.310" end="01:52:27.380" style="s2">well like seriously I mean but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.639" end="01:52:29.090" style="s2">the thing I also get a lot of Sun my</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.380" end="01:52:31.070" style="s2">vitamin D levels are off the chart I</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.090" end="01:52:32.210" style="s2">still supplement with it here&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.070" end="01:52:34.040" style="s2">thing that I wanted to get your opinion</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.210" end="01:52:35.119" style="s2">and I always say okay it&#39;s the end of</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.040" end="01:52:37.969" style="s2">the interview and that it goes on for</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.119" end="01:52:39.800" style="s2">another hour but in all seriousness with</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.969" end="01:52:41.630" style="s2">the spectrum of light because I I do</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.800" end="01:52:44.150" style="s2">sungazing have been doing that for years</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.630" end="01:52:46.909" style="s2">grounding all on the Sun gazing when the</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.150" end="01:52:49.580" style="s2">Sun rises or goes down I get full naked</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.909" end="01:52:51.350" style="s2">Sun as much as possible so I&#39;m getting a</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.580" end="01:52:53.239" style="s2">lot of the natural spectrums I limit</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.350" end="01:52:55.820" style="s2">blue light at night like pretty hardcore</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.239" end="01:52:58.219" style="s2">in the home when it gets dark outside it</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.820" end="01:52:59.989" style="s2">also gets amber and red inside like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.219" end="01:53:02.090" style="s2">dialing that in my sleeps great</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.989" end="01:53:05.090" style="s2">circadian rhythm but when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.090" end="01:53:06.080" style="s2">the spectrums of sunlight you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.090" end="01:53:08.690" style="s2">different people might have different</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.080" end="01:53:09.949" style="s2">opinions on this but based on being a 47</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.690" end="01:53:12.380" style="s2">year old guy and knowing what the sky</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.949" end="01:53:14.900" style="s2">looks like normally with planes in it or</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.380" end="01:53:17.690" style="s2">planes not in it there is unequivocally</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.900" end="01:53:20.800" style="s2">some geoengineering going on on the</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.690" end="01:53:23.150" style="s2">planet and I think anyone that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.800" end="01:53:26.000" style="s2">acknowledge that to some degree like has</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.150" end="01:53:27.619" style="s2">serious psychological issues having you</p>

<p begin="01:53:27.619" end="01:53:30.860" style="s2">weird clouds and the formations and</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.659" end="01:53:32.929" style="s2">stuff we have now there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.860" end="01:53:35.900" style="s2">something going on which is of course a</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.929" end="01:53:37.369" style="s2">different conversation but with with the</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.900" end="01:53:39.260" style="s2">weather manipulation of what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.369" end="01:53:40.699" style="s2">going on in the sky I often wonder</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.260" end="01:53:42.830" style="s2">because it does have a parent Lee</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.699" end="01:53:44.869" style="s2">something to do with reflecting the</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.830" end="01:53:46.850" style="s2">sun&#39;s you know radiation back out into</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.869" end="01:53:49.760" style="s2">space to pull the planet wherever the</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.850" end="01:53:51.770" style="s2">fuck&#39;s going on but the the temperature</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.760" end="01:53:53.929" style="s2">of the light and the spectrum of light</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.770" end="01:53:56.119" style="s2">is being altered in an unnatural way</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.929" end="01:53:58.610" style="s2">from whatever&#39;s being done in our skies</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.119" end="01:54:00.230" style="s2">do you think that that&#39;s having you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.610" end="01:54:01.730" style="s2">an effect on our biology just aside from</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.230" end="01:54:04.670" style="s2">whatever toxins might we might be</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.730" end="01:54:10.130" style="s2">breathing in with just the actual nature</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.670" end="01:54:12.940" style="s2">of light itself of course very short</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.130" end="01:54:15.840" style="s2">answer to a long question</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.940" end="01:54:20.190" style="s2">so geoengineering is</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.840" end="01:54:22.590" style="s2">an approach to us recognizing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.190" end="01:54:24.030" style="s2">very close to positive feedback loops on</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.590" end="01:54:25.739" style="s2">certain climate change dynamics and</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.030" end="01:54:28.440" style="s2">people freak out and write a freakout</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.739" end="01:54:31.020" style="s2">says well we need to actually get the</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.440" end="01:54:33.300" style="s2">temperature down because even before the</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.020" end="01:54:35.099" style="s2">acid is killing the coral from ocean</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.300" end="01:54:36.719" style="s2">acidification from co2 diffusing into</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.099" end="01:54:38.400" style="s2">the water as carbonic acid even before</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.719" end="01:54:40.409" style="s2">the trophic cascades are killing the</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.400" end="01:54:43.199" style="s2">coral from the large fish dying off from</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.409" end="01:54:44.460" style="s2">overfishing the temperature is the main</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.199" end="01:54:46.829" style="s2">thing driving them into bleaching and</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.460" end="01:54:48.389" style="s2">hypometabolism they can&#39;t stay in that</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.829" end="01:54:50.309" style="s2">place very long most of the</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.389" end="01:54:51.510" style="s2">photosynthesis of the world happens in</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.309" end="01:54:54.809" style="s2">the oceans and a lot of it depends on</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.510" end="01:54:57.719" style="s2">the coral so how do we get the and and</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.809" end="01:55:00.210" style="s2">the positive feedback loop on that on</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.719" end="01:55:01.110" style="s2">the albedo cycle at the caps like so</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.210" end="01:55:03.539" style="s2">it&#39;s like whoa we need to get</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.110" end="01:55:06.300" style="s2">temperature down so the idea of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.539" end="01:55:07.710" style="s2">just reflect 20% in sunlight by putting</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.300" end="01:55:10.650" style="s2">particles never atmosphere that will</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.710" end="01:55:13.679" style="s2">reflect 20% sunlight is the same exact</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.650" end="01:55:16.800" style="s2">approach as our cholesterol high use a</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.679" end="01:55:19.170" style="s2">statin mmm it is right it&#39;s addressing</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.800" end="01:55:20.670" style="s2">the symptom in a way that will then have</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.170" end="01:55:23.699" style="s2">effects that are negative for other</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.670" end="01:55:24.900" style="s2">parts of it because we&#39;re scared of the</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.699" end="01:55:26.309" style="s2">symptom without understanding what</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.900" end="01:55:29.010" style="s2">caused it and addressing it at a college</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.309" end="01:55:30.929" style="s2">level so of course what we should be</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.010" end="01:55:34.670" style="s2">focused on is how do we just increase</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.929" end="01:55:37.139" style="s2">photosynthesis for sequesteration and</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.670" end="01:55:38.610" style="s2">decrease emissions and what has to</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.139" end="01:55:42.750" style="s2">happen to be able to do that at what</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.610" end="01:55:44.489" style="s2">scale in time but yeah well it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.750" end="01:55:48.719" style="s2">interesting allopathic medicine is</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.489" end="01:55:50.489" style="s2">looking at individual metrics that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.719" end="01:55:52.650" style="s2">correlated to something and how do we</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.489" end="01:55:55.349" style="s2">exogenously override that individual</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.650" end="01:55:57.449" style="s2">metric without looking at what brought</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.349" end="01:55:59.400" style="s2">it about to be that way and so complex</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.449" end="01:56:00.960" style="s2">multifactorial dynamics we suck out</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.400" end="01:56:03.300" style="s2">which is why we don&#39;t have a single cure</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.960" end="01:56:05.130" style="s2">for any chronic illness we can cut</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.300" end="01:56:07.219" style="s2">cancers out radiate amount poison out we</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.130" end="01:56:09.300" style="s2">can&#39;t make them stop growing and</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.219" end="01:56:11.059" style="s2">understand why they grow in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.300" end="01:56:13.559" style="s2">current medicine same with psych</p>

<p begin="01:56:14.639" end="01:56:18.389" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have a single college</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.590" end="01:56:20.309" style="s2">we&#39;re actually awesome at acute cause</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.389" end="01:56:22.349" style="s2">issues right right right</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.309" end="01:56:23.379" style="s2">if it&#39;s an acute injury or an acute</p>

<p begin="01:56:23.379" end="01:56:27.849" style="s2">or an acute toxicity that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.649" end="01:56:29.829" style="s2">straightforward and we know how to treat</p>

<p begin="01:56:29.829" end="01:56:33.249" style="s2">than a cute single cause then we kind of</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.929" end="01:56:35.260" style="s2">suck at it right now because it requires</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.249" end="01:56:37.419" style="s2">a different approach to science of this</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.260" end="01:56:39.550" style="s2">complexity approach which also requires</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.419" end="01:56:41.769" style="s2">a different fiscal model and a different</p>

<p begin="01:56:53.409" end="01:56:57.879" style="s2">geoengineering is like allopathic</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.599" end="01:57:00.579" style="s2">medicine is that into the environment</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.879" end="01:57:02.769" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s funnier and and</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.579" end="01:57:04.300" style="s2">definitely it&#39;s affecting the light</p>

<p begin="01:57:04.300" end="01:57:07.209" style="s2">top devices a lot of the stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.010" end="01:57:09.550" style="s2">coming out now they think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.209" end="01:57:11.739" style="s2">effective is ways to sort of use</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.550" end="01:57:13.239" style="s2">technology to mimic nature in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.739" end="01:57:15.309" style="s2">and that&#39;s how I think about an infrared</p>

<p begin="01:57:15.309" end="01:57:18.849" style="s2">things that I do is quote unquote bio</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.320" end="01:57:21.189" style="s2">hacks are grounding you know using</p>

<p begin="01:57:21.189" end="01:57:29.739" style="s2">it&#39;s all really just trying to create</p>

<p begin="01:57:42.849" end="01:57:45.249" style="s2">back in something closer to an</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.079" end="01:57:47.530" style="s2">evolutionary environment so our air</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.249" end="01:57:50.229" style="s2">filter right it&#39;s not making special air</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.530" end="01:57:53.229" style="s2">it&#39;s just making right I saw that you</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.229" end="01:57:55.719" style="s2">have one over there too yeah and our</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.229" end="01:57:58.929" style="s2">water filters are also still not as good</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.719" end="01:58:01.449" style="s2">as spring water right do you have a</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.929" end="01:58:03.219" style="s2">pristine hydro filter you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.449" end="01:58:06.340" style="s2">purse okay they&#39;re there in Laguna Beach</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.219" end="01:58:07.869" style="s2">you know not far from here but I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.340" end="01:58:09.820" style="s2">a lot of research on the filters and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.869" end="01:58:11.619" style="s2">gonna interview that guy but I think if</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.820" end="01:58:14.199" style="s2">I had to have a filter he&#39;d probably be</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.619" end="01:58:16.899" style="s2">the guy he vortexes the water he puts</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.199" end="01:58:19.269" style="s2">magnesium bicarbonate silica back in it</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.899" end="01:58:20.979" style="s2">I mean he&#39;s like he&#39;s like making spring</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.269" end="01:58:23.439" style="s2">water out of municipal water it&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.979" end="01:58:24.729" style="s2">but anyway but you know whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.439" end="01:58:26.889" style="s2">changing our weather we&#39;re pulling</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.729" end="01:58:28.359" style="s2">toxins out of the environment or like</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.889" end="01:58:29.949" style="s2">you know it&#39;s mentioning the BOC here</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.359" end="01:58:33.459" style="s2">actually it&#39;s not releasing much because</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.949" end="01:58:34.469" style="s2">I used the AFM safe coat okay and safe</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.459" end="01:58:35.969" style="s2">coats another</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.469" end="01:58:38.340" style="s2">I think is awesome if you have a place</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.969" end="01:58:39.929" style="s2">that&#39;s new carpet new paint or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.340" end="01:58:41.610" style="s2">going to paint or install things the</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.929" end="01:58:43.739" style="s2">non-toxic products that if it makes a</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.610" end="01:58:47.130" style="s2">religion no away cool that is going in</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.739" end="01:58:48.690" style="s2">the show notes but yeah I mean so much</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.130" end="01:58:50.039" style="s2">of it is just recreating evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.690" end="01:58:54.960" style="s2">environments there&#39;s like so many people</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.039" end="01:58:58.139" style="s2">who are ill go like move to or visit</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.960" end="01:59:01.920" style="s2">some more rural natural place and think</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.139" end="01:59:03.150" style="s2">you better right and so that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.920" end="01:59:05.099" style="s2">it and then there&#39;s a course advance</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.150" end="01:59:07.019" style="s2">shed that is not just doing that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.099" end="01:59:08.579" style="s2">what are the weather kind of tricks you</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.019" end="01:59:12.150" style="s2">got up your sleeve that I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.579" end="01:59:15.840" style="s2">observed walking by tech tech wise</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.150" end="01:59:18.690" style="s2">well qejy based neurofeedback is awesome</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.840" end="01:59:20.550" style="s2">mmm and whether you&#39;re doing alpha-theta</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.690" end="01:59:22.739" style="s2">training or SMR training or Delta</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.550" end="01:59:24.539" style="s2">training should be based off your qejy</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.739" end="01:59:26.639" style="s2">and someone knows how knows how to do</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.539" end="01:59:28.289" style="s2">that well I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.639" end="01:59:30.030" style="s2">went to peak brain since you look I go</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.289" end="01:59:31.739" style="s2">there all the time yeah but Andrews good</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.030" end="01:59:34.739" style="s2">yeah Andrew is good I interviewed him</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.739" end="01:59:37.349" style="s2">here on the show and I was on his show -</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.739" end="01:59:39.090" style="s2">yeah brilliant guy so that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.349" end="01:59:41.159" style="s2">therapy right now</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.090" end="01:59:43.079" style="s2">I mean TMS is actually interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.159" end="01:59:43.440" style="s2">it&#39;s early but it&#39;s interesting for many</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.079" end="01:59:46.999" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.440" end="01:59:46.999" style="s2">well it&#39;s TMS transcranial magnetic</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.539" end="01:59:52.199" style="s2">stimulation is profoundly interesting in</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.940" end="01:59:54.329" style="s2">the early studies at University of</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.199" end="01:59:56.749" style="s2">Arizona and some Japanese universities</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.329" end="01:59:59.460" style="s2">in curing Alzheimer&#39;s I&#39;m through their</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.749" end="02:00:04.889" style="s2">novel proposed mechanism involving</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.460" end="02:00:08.280" style="s2">microtubules so but it&#39;s too early to</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.889" end="02:00:09.809" style="s2">really know what it&#39;s doing so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.280" end="02:00:11.699" style="s2">number of high-tech methods that are</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.809" end="02:00:13.739" style="s2">really cool and specifically there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.699" end="02:00:15.960" style="s2">also but some of the most high-tech ones</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.739" end="02:00:17.039" style="s2">are are actually still evolutionary</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.960" end="02:00:21.929" style="s2">Merriman ones like the cutting edge of</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.039" end="02:00:23.909" style="s2">microbial mix is mostly that the vaginal</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.929" end="02:00:25.170" style="s2">flora and the breast milk of indigenous</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.909" end="02:00:27.290" style="s2">people who were never exposed to</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.170" end="02:00:30.340" style="s2">chlorinated water and</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.290" end="02:00:34.160" style="s2">antibiotics and glyphosate have a whole</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.340" end="02:00:35.660" style="s2">bunch of bacteria that we just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.160" end="02:00:37.010" style="s2">have in probiotics anywhere else that</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.660" end="02:00:40.610" style="s2">are actually part of our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.010" end="02:00:43.340" style="s2">virus ignition for epigenetic modulation</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.610" end="02:00:46.040" style="s2">or genome so that&#39;s a very cutting edge</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.340" end="02:00:47.930" style="s2">right understanding about the genetics</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.040" end="02:00:49.460" style="s2">and microbiome acts right and it is also</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.930" end="02:00:52.940" style="s2">saying oh evolution actually kind of</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.460" end="02:00:56.780" style="s2">makes sense okay or fecal implants from</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.940" end="02:00:58.820" style="s2">clean you know they&#39;re clean source so</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.780" end="02:01:00.110" style="s2">to speak so we have a chunk of which in</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.820" end="02:01:03.920" style="s2">like robotics were working on right now</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.110" end="02:01:05.420" style="s2">there oh I&#39;m we&#39;re not that close yet</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.920" end="02:01:08.330" style="s2">cuz that&#39;s what we want to do but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.420" end="02:01:12.530" style="s2">excited about it cool awesome man okay</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.330" end="02:01:15.080" style="s2">so yeah I will say obviously we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.530" end="02:01:18.950" style="s2">get into psychedelics and entheogens no</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.080" end="02:01:21.190" style="s2">I have a whole section on that yeah and</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.950" end="02:01:23.570" style="s2">we didn&#39;t get into any of the</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.190" end="02:01:25.970" style="s2">psycho-emotional psycho-spiritual worker</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.570" end="02:01:27.800" style="s2">all right but on the jist evolutionary</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.970" end="02:01:30.650" style="s2">environment I will make a thought and</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.800" end="02:01:32.690" style="s2">closing is just like a statin is</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.650" end="02:01:34.460" style="s2">optimizing for one thing right lower</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.690" end="02:01:35.989" style="s2">your cholesterol without looking at hey</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.460" end="02:01:37.610" style="s2">is the cholesterol maybe protecting the</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.989" end="02:01:39.470" style="s2">arterial system from oxidative damage</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.610" end="02:01:42.260" style="s2">and that&#39;s not a good idea or what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.470" end="02:01:44.810" style="s2">whole rest of the story going on when we</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.260" end="02:01:45.950" style="s2">optimize for something that is affecting</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.810" end="02:01:47.989" style="s2">a lot of other things we&#39;re not paying</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.950" end="02:01:51.860" style="s2">attention we get externality rate which</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.989" end="02:01:54.950" style="s2">is also a cold side effect we built the</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.860" end="02:01:56.750" style="s2">entire world the human built world for a</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.950" end="02:01:58.190" style="s2">few purposes and ways that affected a</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.750" end="02:02:01.640" style="s2">lot of other things so we build a house</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.190" end="02:02:04.489" style="s2">to protect us from the elements and give</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.640" end="02:02:06.440" style="s2">us a you know a safe place to be and</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.489" end="02:02:08.000" style="s2">then maybe for a certain aspects of</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.440" end="02:02:10.550" style="s2">aesthetics but we didn&#39;t pay attention</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.000" end="02:02:12.500" style="s2">to oh well there&#39;s actually chemistry</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.550" end="02:02:14.750" style="s2">that&#39;s in the paint that is affecting us</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.500" end="02:02:17.720" style="s2">and oh you have the fungicides that are</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.750" end="02:02:19.970" style="s2">in there that are making fungicide</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.720" end="02:02:21.140" style="s2">resistant funguses that are why we have</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.970" end="02:02:22.790" style="s2">an issue with mold we never did before</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.140" end="02:02:26.030" style="s2">oh that that actually it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.790" end="02:02:27.590" style="s2">thing like in the drywall paints out in</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.030" end="02:02:30.410" style="s2">the paint in the 70s started having</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.590" end="02:02:33.830" style="s2">fungicides added resist mold and then</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.410" end="02:02:36.080" style="s2">the mold became super MRSA mold oh god</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.830" end="02:02:38.040" style="s2">that&#39;s so the reason everyone has mold</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.080" end="02:02:39.240" style="s2">issues when we lived with mold forever</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.040" end="02:02:43.590" style="s2">we&#39;re in an environment that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.240" end="02:02:47.310" style="s2">this is me anymore oh my god so but even</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.590" end="02:02:49.050" style="s2">Suns like you know the color and angle</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.310" end="02:02:50.580" style="s2">right all of these end up affecting the</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.050" end="02:02:53.010" style="s2">the psyche this field of environmental</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.580" end="02:02:54.270" style="s2">cycling right if you&#39;re in an if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.010" end="02:02:58.140" style="s2">in an area where there&#39;s graffiti and</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.270" end="02:02:59.700" style="s2">trash on the ground and the walls this</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.140" end="02:03:01.770" style="s2">kind of environmental psych studies been</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.700" end="02:03:03.180" style="s2">done many times if if you just paint</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.770" end="02:03:04.950" style="s2">over the graffiti and clean up the trash</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.180" end="02:03:05.580" style="s2">violent crime drops like thirty to fifty</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.950" end="02:03:07.680" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.580" end="02:03:09.960" style="s2">Wow and it&#39;s because you think about</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.680" end="02:03:13.230" style="s2">what the environments transmitting from</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.960" end="02:03:15.870" style="s2">your there is one this is a wasteland</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.230" end="02:03:17.010" style="s2">and I&#39;m in survival mode and to this is</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.870" end="02:03:19.410" style="s2">a place where law doesn&#39;t operate</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.010" end="02:03:21.660" style="s2">mmm-hmm right cuz yeah a bit broken and</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.410" end="02:03:22.800" style="s2">they&#39;re not right rectified right and</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.660" end="02:03:25.320" style="s2">right as soon as you fix those things</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.800" end="02:03:27.270" style="s2">how violent human beings are is being</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.320" end="02:03:29.760" style="s2">changed at the like fifty percent level</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.270" end="02:03:33.000" style="s2">by an environmental psych right I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.760" end="02:03:35.220" style="s2">heard David Hawkins talk about that he</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.000" end="02:03:37.230" style="s2">called it the broken window theory you</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.220" end="02:03:39.090" style="s2">know you have the building in the ghetto</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.230" end="02:03:40.560" style="s2">and it gets ignored and then someone</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.090" end="02:03:41.910" style="s2">breaks the window and then someone comes</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.560" end="02:03:43.380" style="s2">along breaks another window then comes</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.910" end="02:03:44.700" style="s2">the graffiti then the drug dealers on</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.380" end="02:03:47.040" style="s2">the corner and Everett I never thought</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.700" end="02:03:49.350" style="s2">about the kind of mechanics of it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.040" end="02:03:50.840" style="s2">very interesting it&#39;s I guess the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.350" end="02:03:53.070" style="s2">like the level of consciousness of</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.840" end="02:03:56.640" style="s2">anything could you say would you frame</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.070" end="02:03:58.740" style="s2">it in that way I would say that&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.640" end="02:04:02.730" style="s2">of reducing the complexity of it right</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.740" end="02:04:04.620" style="s2">um which is kind of my thing I interview</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.730" end="02:04:07.500" style="s2">people like you and go to squish that</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.620" end="02:04:09.360" style="s2">down into a bite-sized thought but I</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.500" end="02:04:13.440" style="s2">mean so if you go into a cathedral</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.360" end="02:04:17.550" style="s2">they&#39;re doing environmental psych and so</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.440" end="02:04:19.890" style="s2">the sound and the smell and the visual</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.550" end="02:04:22.200" style="s2">and every aspect of the sensory process</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.890" end="02:04:24.480" style="s2">is designed to uplift and exulting but</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.200" end="02:04:27.030" style="s2">then specifically that it&#39;s narrow and</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.480" end="02:04:29.190" style="s2">very high has a certain effect that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.030" end="02:04:31.440" style="s2">different than if it was wide and high</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.190" end="02:04:33.630" style="s2">or if it was not high right which is</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.440" end="02:04:36.480" style="s2">you&#39;re very focused on up</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.630" end="02:04:38.640" style="s2">and so then you feel very small and you</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.480" end="02:04:40.290" style="s2">can both have a sense of feeling you</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.640" end="02:04:42.330" style="s2">know and then the priest is halfway</p>
<p begin="02:04:40.290" end="02:04:43.200" style="s2">between you and where Jesus is up there</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.330" end="02:04:45.630" style="s2">right and where God is</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.200" end="02:04:47.400" style="s2">and so both if you want to look at the</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.630" end="02:04:49.280" style="s2">cynical side of the this is how you make</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.400" end="02:04:51.260" style="s2">a good authority rien</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.280" end="02:04:52.730" style="s2">dynamic where everybody feels small an</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.260" end="02:04:54.440" style="s2">authority up there but also the</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.730" end="02:04:56.090" style="s2">beautiful the mystical side of people</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.440" end="02:04:58.730" style="s2">feeling a sense of all an exaltation</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.090" end="02:05:00.230" style="s2">right the environmental psychology of</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.730" end="02:05:02.059" style="s2">how those buildings are done induced</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.230" end="02:05:03.770" style="s2">state right just like Burning Man</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.059" end="02:05:07.670" style="s2">induces state because of the environment</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.770" end="02:05:09.530" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t period so what we are</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.670" end="02:05:11.750" style="s2">realizing is that we have built a world</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.530" end="02:05:13.369" style="s2">that we are not well adapted to all</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.750" end="02:05:14.539" style="s2">right and it&#39;s affecting us in a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.369" end="02:05:17.500" style="s2">ways that we didn&#39;t pay attention to</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.539" end="02:05:20.329" style="s2">that are mostly not good for us and so</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.500" end="02:05:22.400" style="s2">there is this task that you and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.329" end="02:05:24.500" style="s2">good for the planet right and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.400" end="02:05:26.989" style="s2">good for us so there&#39;s this task of how</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.500" end="02:05:28.940" style="s2">do we rebuild the entire physical built</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.989" end="02:05:32.570" style="s2">world in a way where the goal the</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.940" end="02:05:36.800" style="s2">primary goal is not in you know it being</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.570" end="02:05:38.179" style="s2">an expensive or fast or aesthetically</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.800" end="02:05:39.380" style="s2">beautiful those are all partial goals</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.179" end="02:05:41.210" style="s2">the primary goal is that it is</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.380" end="02:05:44.090" style="s2">enlightening the humans that are</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.210" end="02:05:45.679" style="s2">inhabiting it how do you create a built</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.090" end="02:05:47.480" style="s2">world that makes the healthiest most</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.679" end="02:05:48.800" style="s2">enlightened most pro-social human beings</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.480" end="02:05:50.449" style="s2">that are inhabiting it and how do we</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.800" end="02:05:53.809" style="s2">rebuild the entire world of that in mind</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.449" end="02:05:56.630" style="s2">in in relationship to you know harmony</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.809" end="02:05:58.400" style="s2">with the ecosystem so that&#39;s the biohack</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.630" end="02:06:00.800" style="s2">that is most interesting to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.400" end="02:06:05.020" style="s2">amazing dude I love that really good way</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.800" end="02:06:07.489" style="s2">to sum it up alright so closing question</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.020" end="02:06:09.619" style="s2">who have been three teachers or</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.489" end="02:06:13.719" style="s2">teachings that have influenced your work</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.619" end="02:06:16.460" style="s2">where we might be able to go find more</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.719" end="02:06:17.900" style="s2">from them like who have you learned from</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.460" end="02:06:20.900" style="s2">that we might go up and learn from as</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.900" end="02:06:22.280" style="s2">well specifically more related to</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.900" end="02:06:24.710" style="s2">individual health or just anything</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.280" end="02:06:29.389" style="s2">anything totally broad could be a book</p>

<p begin="02:06:29.389" end="02:06:32.510" style="s2">preferably something that one could go</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.130" end="02:06:35.119" style="s2">look up or we can put in the show notes</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.510" end="02:06:37.099" style="s2">you know meister fuller whatever</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.119" end="02:06:40.340" style="s2">you know but mr. fuller would definitely</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.099" end="02:06:42.110" style="s2">be at the top of the list and either</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.340" end="02:06:43.190" style="s2">operating manual for spaceship earth or</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.110" end="02:06:47.320" style="s2">critical path being the most</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.190" end="02:06:49.670" style="s2">approachable books on understanding</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.320" end="02:06:53.960" style="s2">state of the world and how to think and</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.670" end="02:06:56.690" style="s2">how to design so that would be very high</p>
<p begin="02:06:53.960" end="02:06:58.730" style="s2">on the list and then i ordering three is</p>
