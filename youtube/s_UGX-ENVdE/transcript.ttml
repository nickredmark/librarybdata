<p begin="00:00:04.620" end="00:00:11.340" style="s2">figure out my slavery footprint and my</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.340" end="00:00:14.059" style="s2">carbon footprint and it turns out under</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.340" end="00:00:20.600" style="s2">rough estimation I have 33 slaves and</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.059" end="00:00:23.609" style="s2">ten tons of carbon in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.600" end="00:00:26.070" style="s2">ethical to not be using more than my</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.609" end="00:00:28.439" style="s2">share to not be I need that number to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.070" end="00:00:30.660" style="s2">at zero slaves clearly zero is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.439" end="00:00:32.130" style="s2">number we need to reach for and from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.660" end="00:00:34.500" style="s2">person who posted the calculator is</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.130" end="00:00:37.350" style="s2">three tons of carbon per person so if</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.500" end="00:00:38.700" style="s2">you&#39;re above that you should be bringing</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.350" end="00:00:39.930" style="s2">it down if you&#39;re below it you should I</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.700" end="00:00:42.930" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you should be bringing it</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.930" end="00:00:48.660" style="s2">up but like you&#39;re allowed to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.930" end="00:00:52.379" style="s2">up to be fair the issue is when I took</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.660" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">the quiz I don&#39;t I don&#39;t fly I fly less</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.379" end="00:00:58.350" style="s2">than once a year I Drive a car because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:01:01.620" style="s2">have to for my health condition and also</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.350" end="00:01:03.870" style="s2">poverty because I don&#39;t have the money</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.620" end="00:01:05.610" style="s2">to pay for bus fare on one-off basis</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.870" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">when I&#39;m already paying for insurance on</p>

<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:12.030" style="s2">cheaper to drive than it is to pay for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:13.320" style="s2">bus so my finances have to come into</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.030" end="00:01:17.119" style="s2">play all the time and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.320" end="00:01:19.740" style="s2">times where I cannot take the bus so</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.119" end="00:01:21.750" style="s2">food you know I don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.740" end="00:01:23.670" style="s2">organic food I can&#39;t allow me to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.750" end="00:01:26.430" style="s2">access to it you notice I&#39;m at closing</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.670" end="00:01:30.150" style="s2">and stuff but it&#39;s not in my price point</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.430" end="00:01:32.100" style="s2">I can&#39;t buy Fairtrade clothing I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.150" end="00:01:34.049" style="s2">do the things that would make it so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.100" end="00:01:36.030" style="s2">I have less slaves I can&#39;t do the things</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.049" end="00:01:40.229" style="s2">that make it so I have less carbon</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.030" end="00:01:41.939" style="s2">output or can offset the carbon I could</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.229" end="00:01:44.070" style="s2">probably be doing more than I am but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.939" end="00:01:47.790" style="s2">cannot tackle those two numbers on my</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.070" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">own what we can do together is look at</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.790" end="00:01:53.310" style="s2">where those numbers came from how do i</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">transport myself in a way that works for</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.310" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">me and my conditions without offsetting</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:04.890" style="s2">those externalities onto other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:06.659" style="s2">especially slavery and it&#39;s the only way</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.890" end="00:02:08.429" style="s2">is to do it is together how do we tackle</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.659" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">the food system how do we tackle having</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.429" end="00:02:12.330" style="s2">clothes to wear</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:13.160" style="s2">and transportation and heating my home I</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.330" end="00:02:15.260" style="s2">live in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.160" end="00:02:17.780" style="s2">you know in parts of our country it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.260" end="00:02:22.130" style="s2">negative 40 negative 34 large parts of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.780" end="00:02:23.810" style="s2">the year and below that up north like so</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.130" end="00:02:25.340" style="s2">even if we move to everyone to our</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.810" end="00:02:28.250" style="s2">southern border where they kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.340" end="00:02:29.810" style="s2">live already it&#39;s still cold for large</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.250" end="00:02:32.030" style="s2">parts of the year we still have to heat</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.810" end="00:02:34.250" style="s2">our home so instead of making it</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.030" end="00:02:37.340" style="s2">individual consumers who have to solve</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.250" end="00:02:39.770" style="s2">this problem the eye and without needing</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.340" end="00:02:41.390" style="s2">it to be the them the big carbon offsets</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.770" end="00:02:43.190" style="s2">the government needs to change the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.390" end="00:02:46.070" style="s2">corporations need to stop doing it</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.190" end="00:02:48.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a space in between where we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.070" end="00:02:50.540" style="s2">solve it together we can figure out</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.200" end="00:02:53.410" style="s2">modes of transportation we can figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.540" end="00:02:55.640" style="s2">out a food system that does not require</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.410" end="00:02:58.720" style="s2">literally feeding off of other humans</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.640" end="00:03:01.720" style="s2">labor treating them as commodity and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.720" end="00:03:05.030" style="s2">benefiting from it out of ignorance and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.720" end="00:03:07.460" style="s2">the same with the planet in carbon but</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.030" end="00:03:10.820" style="s2">nor can we ask everyone to wake up to</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.460" end="00:03:15.410" style="s2">that fact when we don&#39;t have anywhere to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.820" end="00:03:18.770" style="s2">lead them this is poor against poor sick</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.410" end="00:03:21.800" style="s2">against sick I don&#39;t have an option to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.770" end="00:03:22.940" style="s2">not have those things to not have I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.800" end="00:03:24.530" style="s2">I might be able to bring my slavery</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.940" end="00:03:26.990" style="s2">number down to 15 if I was really</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.530" end="00:03:28.910" style="s2">conscious and and and capable there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.990" end="00:03:31.640" style="s2">nowhere to buy electronic cuz it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.910" end="00:03:33.890" style="s2">include slavery the food system and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.640" end="00:03:37.700" style="s2">clothing systems that are ethical aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.890" end="00:03:40.490" style="s2">accessible to me and so these are things</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.700" end="00:03:42.200" style="s2">we have to tackle together we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.490" end="00:03:44.990" style="s2">able to look at what is our actual</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.200" end="00:03:46.459" style="s2">footprint and how do we we get would</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.990" end="00:03:47.810" style="s2">make it better but if all we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.459" end="00:03:52.040" style="s2">telling people with their footprint is</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.810" end="00:03:53.420" style="s2">so they can feel bad in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.040" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">that leads to chronic illness and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.420" end="00:03:55.820" style="s2">don&#39;t want the world to be chronically</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:58.100" style="s2">ill because that&#39;s just more of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.820" end="00:04:00.740" style="s2">snowball more stuff to have to put on</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.100" end="00:04:01.970" style="s2">you and deal with we need solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.740" end="00:04:04.370" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to come from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.970" end="00:04:06.820" style="s2">marketplace because the marketplace is</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.370" end="00:04:08.930" style="s2">what kind of created these problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.820" end="00:04:12.980" style="s2">together we can create things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.930" end="00:04:15.380" style="s2">out-compete the marketplace and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.980" end="00:04:17.000" style="s2">create the crap that they are creating</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.380" end="00:04:18.770" style="s2">we don&#39;t we do not design them to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.000" end="00:04:20.810" style="s2">out-compete the marketplace we designed</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.770" end="00:04:23.450" style="s2">them to be natural attractors to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.810" end="00:04:25.970" style="s2">invitation we design solutions that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.450" end="00:04:26.540" style="s2">so amazing maybe they start a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.970" end="00:04:28.040" style="s2">less amazing</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.540" end="00:04:30.710" style="s2">but they&#39;re so amazing that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.040" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">naturally attract people in and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.710" end="00:04:37.580" style="s2">continually improving them so I have 33</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:39.350" style="s2">slaves and 10 tons of carbon and I need</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.580" end="00:04:41.450" style="s2">your help I need your help to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.350" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">that and I will like both of those</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.450" end="00:04:45.260" style="s2">calculators in the comments if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:49.100" style="s2">happen to want to find out what your</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.260" end="00:04:52.580" style="s2">footprint is and if we can create a way</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.100" end="00:04:57.770" style="s2">to collectively bring our numbers down</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.580" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">until we get to zero slaves and three</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.770" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">tons of carbon thank you</p>
