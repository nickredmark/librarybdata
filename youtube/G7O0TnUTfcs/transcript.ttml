<p begin="00:00:02.939" end="00:00:07.160" style="s2">showing a bread so welcome to our 12th</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.430" end="00:00:09.000" style="s2">together tech board meeting otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.160" end="00:00:11.130" style="s2">affectionately called fix our roll</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.000" end="00:00:12.900" style="s2">Friday&#39;s carry thought I started a new</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.130" end="00:00:15.929" style="s2">fire now this is one of the first ones</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.900" end="00:00:18.240" style="s2">that I started so today we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.929" end="00:00:19.980" style="s2">much on the agenda the same thing we</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.240" end="00:00:23.460" style="s2">were talking about in process raising</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.980" end="00:00:26.430" style="s2">which is this collective open collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.460" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">and it&#39;s a quick couple minute video so</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.430" end="00:00:29.849" style="s2">we can launch that if we want and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:31.380" style="s2">what you guys discussed before I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.849" end="00:00:33.930" style="s2">coming in is the only other thing on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.380" end="00:00:35.790" style="s2">agenda which was Kerry wanted access to</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.930" end="00:00:38.700" style="s2">the knack tool and so maybe if you just</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.790" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">want to update people um as to why that</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.700" end="00:00:42.649" style="s2">is or isn&#39;t working and what what that</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">looks like and then we can watch this</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.649" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">open collective video and discuss maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:51.390" style="s2">how we can use it the other tech or our</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:52.680" style="s2">individual projects I mean it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.390" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go into the nitty gritty but</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.680" end="00:01:00.870" style="s2">it&#39;s a good video to show what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">trying to do so the first part is you</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.870" end="00:01:06.900" style="s2">guys with the back the thing you guys</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">just discussed yeah I don&#39;t know alright</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.900" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">so what we were talking about prior was</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:14.850" style="s2">uh we had the neck tool set up as sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:16.259" style="s2">of a like a project list so that people</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.850" end="00:01:17.610" style="s2">could sign up for accounts and manage</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.259" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">their own project so that we could have</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.610" end="00:01:21.900" style="s2">a public-facing list to show here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">other projects that we&#39;re doing and to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.900" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">start actually fulfilling some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">things that we&#39;ve been talking about but</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:29.850" style="s2">that was designed around the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">people actually sort of signing up and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.850" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">then managing their own projects and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:36.329" style="s2">couple people had signed up I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:37.950" style="s2">you know to to if your people had like</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:41.009" style="s2">sort of added to their project so there</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.950" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">are a few on there but for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.009" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">I didn&#39;t gain a lot of traction and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:46.920" style="s2">sounds like what Kerry wants to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:48.180" style="s2">sort of have her actually manage a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.920" end="00:01:49.950" style="s2">of the lists and go and do the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.180" end="00:01:52.820" style="s2">interviews so that we know she can</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.950" end="00:01:56.219" style="s2">figure out who&#39;s on what to sort of have</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.820" end="00:01:58.350" style="s2">one person owning that and the knack</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.219" end="00:02:00.930" style="s2">tool wasn&#39;t really designed for that so</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.350" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">it&#39;s theoretically possible if we really</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.930" end="00:02:03.990" style="s2">wanted to do it that we could do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:08.670" style="s2">but at that point it&#39;s a full redesign</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.990" end="00:02:10.739" style="s2">so if she&#39;s already going ahead with CRM</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.670" end="00:02:13.640" style="s2">then I think it makes more sense for her</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.739" end="00:02:15.680" style="s2">to just go straight to this this here</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.640" end="00:02:18.590" style="s2">route and then if there&#39;s any issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:20.930" style="s2">then then we can revisit the neck tool</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.590" end="00:02:25.280" style="s2">but for now I think it makes more sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.930" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">to just skip a knack and then when the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.280" end="00:02:29.480" style="s2">serum is available we can do an export I</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:31.820" style="s2">grabbed the data that&#39;s in that tool to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.480" end="00:02:32.990" style="s2">push it over and I&#39;m sure that she</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.820" end="00:02:35.810" style="s2">probably has her own spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.990" end="00:02:37.580" style="s2">somewhere of the projects that she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.810" end="00:02:40.670" style="s2">been doing interviews with people in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.580" end="00:02:42.200" style="s2">it can be a projects group so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.670" end="00:02:43.820" style="s2">where things are at I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.200" end="00:02:47.330" style="s2">Kerry wants to chime in with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.820" end="00:02:49.400" style="s2">update on the CRM stuff yeah well like I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.330" end="00:02:52.340" style="s2">said I&#39;ve just they&#39;re just about to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.400" end="00:02:55.010" style="s2">install Drupal and that uninstalled see</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.340" end="00:02:58.090" style="s2">Odom&#39;s and basically it was it was just</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.010" end="00:03:01.280" style="s2">to get a kind of died actually going and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.090" end="00:03:04.100" style="s2">as I said because I wanted to see where</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.280" end="00:03:05.720" style="s2">you were with the nak stuff and maybe to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.100" end="00:03:09.350" style="s2">like update or laughs obviously if</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.720" end="00:03:12.050" style="s2">that&#39;s the way to be built I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.350" end="00:03:14.540" style="s2">probably I&#39;ll just waste and if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.050" end="00:03:18.820" style="s2">I know you withdrew probably can have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.540" end="00:03:20.060" style="s2">media where he but the security is them</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.820" end="00:03:22.280" style="s2">desert</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.060" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">security and advice notice on it from</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.280" end="00:03:27.350" style="s2">Drupal saying some of it might not be so</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:28.820" style="s2">secure but I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.350" end="00:03:30.650" style="s2">something that could be just tweaked</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.820" end="00:03:32.360" style="s2">with the module but there&#39;s a module</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.650" end="00:03:35.330" style="s2">there that you know actually attached to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.360" end="00:03:37.130" style="s2">it that as its own wiki which would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.330" end="00:03:39.470" style="s2">quite good but yeah I think at night</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.130" end="00:03:41.180" style="s2">after II of everyone who&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.470" end="00:03:42.980" style="s2">project group and what they&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.180" end="00:03:44.780" style="s2">because it&#39;s not really easy to see</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.980" end="00:03:47.360" style="s2">unless anybody you know they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.780" end="00:03:49.010" style="s2">introduced themselves and you know if</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.360" end="00:03:51.800" style="s2">someone comes along and I know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.010" end="00:03:53.630" style="s2">people have joined and he said they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.800" end="00:03:55.970" style="s2">looking to collaborate on projects so</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.630" end="00:03:57.980" style="s2">because for them to see who&#39;s doing what</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.970" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">where they are and what they&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.980" end="00:04:04.130" style="s2">for and I&#39;ll do that but as I said</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">someone got their own projects and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.130" end="00:04:08.660" style="s2">looking for collaborators so I think if</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:11.180" style="s2">we have something the kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.660" end="00:04:14.060" style="s2">people can go to a glance and then see</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.180" end="00:04:16.850" style="s2">what&#39;s what and then plus a list of so</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.060" end="00:04:20.600" style="s2">they may be possible projects that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.850" end="00:04:22.700" style="s2">brewing and you know ideas and stuff as</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.600" end="00:04:24.770" style="s2">well that&#39;d be really good as well so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.700" end="00:04:27.500" style="s2">think that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got to say on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.770" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">bomb hopefully I was also like her</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.500" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">it&#39;s done by the end of next week and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:34.700" style="s2">then that way um you can come and have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:36.830" style="s2">play in it and because as I said you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.700" end="00:04:38.900" style="s2">just have modules as you go and rather</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.830" end="00:04:41.390" style="s2">than what I did last time was just sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.900" end="00:04:43.820" style="s2">of like piled high with modules that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.390" end="00:04:45.620" style="s2">I didn&#39;t even probably use you know I</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.820" end="00:04:47.980" style="s2">mean so and I think that&#39;s about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.620" end="00:04:47.980" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.700" end="00:04:56.840" style="s2">all right so like I said I&#39;ll actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.590" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">just gonna put the agenda in the um I</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.840" end="00:05:02.210" style="s2">believe me you guys commit it in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:04.520" style="s2">private chat so you can hello there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.210" end="00:05:06.260" style="s2">literally in case um wants to add</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.520" end="00:05:08.540" style="s2">something through it there it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.260" end="00:05:10.990" style="s2">the other thing was just this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.540" end="00:05:14.120" style="s2">something we&#39;re talking about using for</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.990" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">process raising and solution raising and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.120" end="00:05:17.030" style="s2">possibly carries ones it looks like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a cool project this is all I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.030" end="00:05:20.870" style="s2">done is looked at it so I haven&#39;t looked</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:22.790" style="s2">at the website yet but the video itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.870" end="00:05:25.660" style="s2">sinkholes it can talk about after we</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.790" end="00:05:25.660" style="s2">watch it it&#39;s a couple minutes</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.970" end="00:05:45.890" style="s2">something you&#39;re not okay dude do we</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.910" end="00:05:48.830" style="s2">know if streamer can share audio when</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.890" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">you&#39;re sharing yeah okay stop screaming</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.830" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">sure screen I think I just needed to i</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:56.780" style="s2">had it all ready to go so he wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:58.220" style="s2">have to do this but share audio there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.780" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">a little clicking button you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.220" end="00:06:02.300" style="s2">take it in order to share it and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:05.990" style="s2">share will go right here</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.300" end="00:06:07.460" style="s2">alright happened making it easy for</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.990" end="00:06:10.220" style="s2">people to collaborate between them</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.460" end="00:06:12.650" style="s2">outside triangles as open community is</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.220" end="00:06:14.930" style="s2">working for our common goal call them</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.650" end="00:06:17.480" style="s2">circles collectives of people working</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.930" end="00:06:19.670" style="s2">together on software community projects</p>

<p begin="00:07:46.020" end="00:07:50.669" style="s2">into it but it did seem like a perfect I</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.300" end="00:07:52.379" style="s2">really hope the tools there may it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.669" end="00:07:53.610" style="s2">blockchain thing like I think there even</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.610" end="00:07:58.139" style="s2">looking to make it so no no because like</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.339" end="00:08:00.089" style="s2">though I want them to work together like</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.139" end="00:08:02.339" style="s2">Commons when it comes out to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.089" end="00:08:03.839" style="s2">have something that I can sign on and be</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.339" end="00:08:05.909" style="s2">part of all of these things and I want</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.839" end="00:08:08.189" style="s2">to end as a SERP as someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.909" end="00:08:11.309" style="s2">starting many a circle I want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.189" end="00:08:12.629" style="s2">to to create something like this field</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.309" end="00:08:15.300" style="s2">to bring people on board but maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.629" end="00:08:16.770" style="s2">does do what Commons does as well or</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.300" end="00:08:18.300" style="s2">come in whatever the one other one is</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.770" end="00:08:22.830" style="s2">that was supposed to come out in June</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.300" end="00:08:26.879" style="s2">and has not yet like come on right well</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.830" end="00:08:29.550" style="s2">I deserve I&#39;d opened coop info on</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.879" end="00:08:31.499" style="s2">YouTube and they&#39;ve got a full video of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.550" end="00:08:34.469" style="s2">them talking about it and actually going</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.499" end="00:08:35.880" style="s2">in and showing you how it works because</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.469" end="00:08:38.550" style="s2">you don&#39;t really get that from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.880" end="00:08:40.740" style="s2">website when you go onto it so it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.550" end="00:08:43.110" style="s2">a bit of a deep dive into it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.740" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">basically you don&#39;t even have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.110" end="00:08:48.449" style="s2">bank account you can just Church what</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:50.910" style="s2">you need is a fiscal house someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.449" end="00:08:52.649" style="s2">a legal identity legal entity ie</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.910" end="00:08:56.459" style="s2">business doesn&#39;t matter what business</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.649" end="00:09:00.329" style="s2">the arts the legal entity and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.459" end="00:09:02.190" style="s2">got you needs an admin person and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.329" end="00:09:05.069" style="s2">think and you need a stripe account and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.190" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">you need to PayPal account so those are</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.069" end="00:09:09.300" style="s2">the main things that you need for it but</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">what I liked about it most of all is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.300" end="00:09:13.380" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t have to turn yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:14.940" style="s2">into a business and you didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.380" end="00:09:18.569" style="s2">go through all that so there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.940" end="00:09:22.319" style="s2">three ways so if you&#39;ve got no no bank</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.569" end="00:09:24.480" style="s2">account whatsoever and just you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.319" end="00:09:27.329" style="s2">people on there who are fiscal host will</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.480" end="00:09:29.850" style="s2">do that for you and if you&#39;re I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.329" end="00:09:32.910" style="s2">bank account they&#39;ll be able to there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.850" end="00:09:34.680" style="s2">there&#39;s plans that they&#39;ve got you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.910" end="00:09:40.860" style="s2">have two to five projects I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.680" end="00:09:43.230" style="s2">$25 and 1/2 plus 5% and handling fees</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.860" end="00:09:45.690" style="s2">for stripe and stuff like that as well</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.230" end="00:09:47.610" style="s2">so III think it&#39;s really brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.690" end="00:09:49.920" style="s2">because I&#39;ve said you know if you want</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.610" end="00:09:52.440" style="s2">to try and do something and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.920" end="00:09:54.120" style="s2">wake or like we said provide</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.440" end="00:09:56.460" style="s2">for the company but you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.120" end="00:09:58.800" style="s2">turn yourself into an entity it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.460" end="00:10:01.410" style="s2">good and everything&#39;s transparent so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:03.780" style="s2">can see what&#39;s going going in you set</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.410" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">the if you&#39;ve got donations and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.780" end="00:10:08.340" style="s2">memberships whatever you want you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:12.060" style="s2">actually set that yourself you know and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.340" end="00:10:14.790" style="s2">the only thing is cuz I know they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.060" end="00:10:16.170" style="s2">fiscal hosts on there but my kid gets</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.790" end="00:10:18.660" style="s2">with a fiscal house I Drive it up</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.170" end="00:10:20.010" style="s2">somebody do if there&#39;s a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.660" end="00:10:22.230" style="s2">and there&#39;s some trusts they&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.010" end="00:10:25.470" style="s2">you just go into a physical host because</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.230" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">they think they charge extra on top of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.470" end="00:10:29.070" style="s2">that and as I said if you&#39;ve got no</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:31.260" style="s2">relationship with them you might not</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.070" end="00:10:33.150" style="s2">want to have you don there so I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.260" end="00:10:35.370" style="s2">going to ask my friends if you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.150" end="00:10:37.380" style="s2">interested in being a physical host so</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.370" end="00:10:40.050" style="s2">we got started and I think maybe take</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.380" end="00:10:43.260" style="s2">the two to five package on and then see</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.050" end="00:10:46.440" style="s2">you know if he would do that cuz I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.260" end="00:10:48.960" style="s2">know the relationships in there maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.440" end="00:10:50.550" style="s2">can take it over and then off as many</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.960" end="00:10:53.520" style="s2">projects as you like and start</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.550" end="00:10:56.450" style="s2">collectives under that you know as time</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.520" end="00:10:58.680" style="s2">goes on but III think it&#39;s amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.450" end="00:11:00.720" style="s2">because as I said just the thought of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.680" end="00:11:03.270" style="s2">having to go down the business route or</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.720" end="00:11:04.470" style="s2">turn yourself into a charity or a social</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.270" end="00:11:05.970" style="s2">enterprise or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.470" end="00:11:08.220" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t have to turn yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.970" end="00:11:09.390" style="s2">anything you know I mean if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.220" end="00:11:12.390" style="s2">do stuff you should you shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.390" end="00:11:14.790" style="s2">able to do it and but that&#39;s them yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.390" end="00:11:17.360" style="s2">love it I can&#39;t wait from you mate to</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.790" end="00:11:17.360" style="s2">say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.880" end="00:11:25.330" style="s2">like I said I just watched that video</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.170" end="00:11:26.200" style="s2">and you got excited for the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.330" end="00:11:27.760" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do that because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.200" end="00:11:29.020" style="s2">someone who wants to start fires and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.760" end="00:11:30.670" style="s2">don&#39;t even want to start my own YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.020" end="00:11:31.930" style="s2">channel for the new fires like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.670" end="00:11:33.250" style="s2">okay well let&#39;s see if it goes anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.930" end="00:11:34.960" style="s2">before that happens the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.250" end="00:11:38.080" style="s2">incorporating something and then anytime</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.960" end="00:11:39.070" style="s2">you want to crowdfund you have to of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.080" end="00:11:41.800" style="s2">course you need to have your own bank</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.070" end="00:11:43.870" style="s2">account your corporation to accept money</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.800" end="00:11:45.940" style="s2">and I do wonder how open collective</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.870" end="00:11:47.650" style="s2">works with crowdfunding like if you had</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.940" end="00:11:50.410" style="s2">a Kickstarter account or something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.650" end="00:11:53.080" style="s2">could go into your open collective I</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.410" end="00:11:56.080" style="s2">don&#39;t or you know like your your fiscal</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.080" end="00:11:58.750" style="s2">sponsor and then that&#39;s more of I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.080" end="00:12:00.760" style="s2">look into it it&#39;s like you to answer</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.750" end="00:12:03.220" style="s2">that but I would love if you um were</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.760" end="00:12:04.660" style="s2">able to send Carrie be the other video</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.220" end="00:12:06.310" style="s2">that you watched I thought this was the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.660" end="00:12:08.530" style="s2">one that you were talking about but if</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.310" end="00:12:10.300" style="s2">you I know that we won&#39;t watch it now</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.530" end="00:12:12.160" style="s2">but if I would love to watch it and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.300" end="00:12:16.060" style="s2">can add it to the UM to the chat so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:19.870" style="s2">people can see what it is as well if</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.060" end="00:12:23.260" style="s2">you&#39;re able to find it I&#39;m curious how</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.870" end="00:12:26.050" style="s2">international is it I mean accounting</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.260" end="00:12:30.550" style="s2">okay but under which jurisdiction</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.050" end="00:12:34.780" style="s2">exactly because if I want to get money</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.550" end="00:12:39.670" style="s2">from say us the way I used to do it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.780" end="00:12:44.740" style="s2">I got paid in crypto and I had my own</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.670" end="00:12:48.120" style="s2">business which is second UK term a</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.120" end="00:12:53.490" style="s2">but I was essentially on my own just</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:12:58.630" style="s2">visible to the system as this company</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.380" end="00:13:06.280" style="s2">something like this so I paid my taxes</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.630" end="00:13:10.980" style="s2">and social insurance but um like in</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.280" end="00:13:14.920" style="s2">Polish institutions and if they offer</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.980" end="00:13:17.350" style="s2">accounting my question is is it the best</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.920" end="00:13:20.410" style="s2">thing or is it like accounting in</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.350" end="00:13:23.050" style="s2">general and then something else needs to</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.410" end="00:13:27.550" style="s2">happen before you can get money if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.050" end="00:13:31.750" style="s2">are if you happen to be not from us so</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.550" end="00:13:32.770" style="s2">I&#39;m sure on the video that I&#39;m gonna put</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.780" end="00:13:41.470" style="s2">Belgium they&#39;re all over the place you</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.940" end="00:13:43.260" style="s2">know that you know probably the best</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.470" end="00:13:45.790" style="s2">thing to do would get a fiscal host</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.260" end="00:13:47.230" style="s2">using your based in your country and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.790" end="00:13:50.350" style="s2">know there&#39;s loads of this called hosts</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.230" end="00:13:53.350" style="s2">I think and but as I search it doesn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.350" end="00:13:56.050" style="s2">know the I think the main one is set in</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.350" end="00:13:58.770" style="s2">the US but I know there&#39;s the social</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.050" end="00:14:01.900" style="s2">change agency that you&#39;re in the UK and</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.770" end="00:14:04.570" style="s2">another from the open copy road the guy</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.900" end="00:14:06.160" style="s2">and it was on it talking about it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.570" end="00:14:09.730" style="s2">showing it was saying that they had in</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:13.420" style="s2">Belgium so they&#39;ll probably M be someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.730" end="00:14:15.670" style="s2">who could act as a fiscal host in in</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.420" end="00:14:18.340" style="s2">Poland or even if you knew somebody</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.670" end="00:14:21.370" style="s2">who&#39;s got a business in Poland you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.340" end="00:14:23.080" style="s2">willing to do that em for you and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.370" end="00:14:25.390" style="s2">you could maybe set it up that way and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.080" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">but yeah there&#39;s pretty international</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.390" end="00:14:29.470" style="s2">but I I just have one look at that air</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.760" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">link for you so you can go watch it</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.470" end="00:14:35.650" style="s2">later I mean I&#39;m all set</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:38.800" style="s2">it&#39;s just I actually spent time on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.650" end="00:14:45.520" style="s2">earth wondering and making sure I am</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.800" end="00:14:48.610" style="s2">illegal and yeah if someone else wanted</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.520" end="00:14:50.850" style="s2">to do the same and without actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.610" end="00:14:56.710" style="s2">going to the institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.850" end="00:15:01.330" style="s2">registering as whatever I mean would it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.710" end="00:15:05.140" style="s2">be possible to just apply mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.330" end="00:15:08.170" style="s2">register with open collective and never</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.140" end="00:15:09.730" style="s2">have to worry about and if you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.170" end="00:15:15.820" style="s2">an open question are you check for</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.730" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">myself later seemed like a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.820" end="00:15:19.930" style="s2">important because that&#39;s I mean part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:21.490" style="s2">the attraction to me is that you do have</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.930" end="00:15:23.230" style="s2">members all over the world you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.490" end="00:15:24.700" style="s2">necessarily need to worry that someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.230" end="00:15:26.580" style="s2">from Australia and they&#39;re paying you</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.700" end="00:15:29.320" style="s2">and doing that but the company itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.580" end="00:15:30.520" style="s2">needs to be in one jurisdiction and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.320" end="00:15:32.530" style="s2">looks like that&#39;s part of what open</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.520" end="00:15:35.170" style="s2">collective does is remove that but how</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.530" end="00:15:37.420" style="s2">could they you think they can&#39;t you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.170" end="00:15:40.600" style="s2">to be doing taxes and accounting in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.420" end="00:15:43.660" style="s2">jurisdiction exactly the problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.600" end="00:15:46.300" style="s2">each and every financial jurisdiction in</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.660" end="00:15:49.029" style="s2">the world wishes to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.300" end="00:15:53.879" style="s2">keep the businesses to themselves so if</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.029" end="00:15:58.240" style="s2">I always the problem when I worked in</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.879" end="00:16:01.240" style="s2">virtually in u.s. or in UK but</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.240" end="00:16:07.959" style="s2">physically being presents not there just</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.240" end="00:16:10.509" style="s2">in in Poland of course I was I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.959" end="00:16:12.459" style="s2">have any choice about it I needed to pay</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.509" end="00:16:17.490" style="s2">taxes in Poland because this is where</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.459" end="00:16:20.290" style="s2">I&#39;m physically at the moment so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.490" end="00:16:27.850" style="s2">really curious how they solved it if</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.290" end="00:16:30.309" style="s2">they did solve it yeah have you got the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.850" end="00:16:31.329" style="s2">link for the forums and Matus because I</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.309" end="00:16:34.179" style="s2">was reading through all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.329" end="00:16:44.949" style="s2">documentation about that I&#39;ve been sent</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.179" end="00:16:45.610" style="s2">you the link if you want stuff as it</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.949" end="00:16:48.759" style="s2">came</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.610" end="00:16:53.350" style="s2">vot write the taxes I think they pay</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.759" end="00:16:54.670" style="s2">would be regards to any money right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.350" end="00:16:56.949" style="s2">I think they are collected because</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.670" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">they&#39;re the fiscal host charges Europe</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.949" end="00:17:02.259" style="s2">so we charge you for the plan so I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:04.569" style="s2">what they do is take care of the taxes</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.259" end="00:17:09.069" style="s2">of the money they get from you but as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.569" end="00:17:11.470" style="s2">self autonomous collective I think any</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.069" end="00:17:13.539" style="s2">taxes that you know like as I know in</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.470" end="00:17:15.579" style="s2">the UK if you&#39;re an individual and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.539" end="00:17:17.649" style="s2">want to do something like a sides also</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.579" end="00:17:19.750" style="s2">and that I think it allowed to end up to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.649" end="00:17:22.299" style="s2">a thousand pounds before you you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.750" end="00:17:24.970" style="s2">you consider for any tax but as part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.299" end="00:17:27.370" style="s2">that collective you responsible for that</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.970" end="00:17:29.710" style="s2">in your country but I think as I said I</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.370" end="00:17:33.700" style="s2">think there when they say taxes they</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.710" end="00:17:36.010" style="s2">take care of the taxes and they might</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.700" end="00:17:38.649" style="s2">have a penis and you would do all four</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.010" end="00:17:40.330" style="s2">laughs or yeah but then they charge you</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.649" end="00:17:42.279" style="s2">to Christ but if you take care of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.330" end="00:17:44.380" style="s2">yourself I think I think as I said I</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.279" end="00:17:46.330" style="s2">think the taxes they take care of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.380" end="00:17:48.970" style="s2">just that the money they get off you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.330" end="00:17:51.820" style="s2">obviously the the fees and stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.970" end="00:17:54.190" style="s2">maybe their the interest that gets paid</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.820" end="00:17:56.529" style="s2">towards them I think they take care of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.190" end="00:17:59.350" style="s2">that side of things but you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.529" end="00:18:00.430" style="s2">care of the the other stuff yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.350" end="00:18:03.910" style="s2">which is all</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.430" end="00:18:06.400" style="s2">you know me but what you know and if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.910" end="00:18:07.960" style="s2">freelance because I think you can do as</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.400" end="00:18:10.210" style="s2">an individual as well sort of your</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.960" end="00:18:13.570" style="s2">freelance as I said you&#39;d be taking care</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.210" end="00:18:15.120" style="s2">of you know things anyway but as I said</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.570" end="00:18:17.920" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a friend who just bookkeeping</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:20.050" style="s2">accountancy and stuff so I&#39;ve spoke to</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.920" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">her about it so that&#39;s why I was what</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.050" end="00:18:24.910" style="s2">animator to do do a four-dose because</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:26.920" style="s2">I&#39;m does the three will stand in you</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.910" end="00:18:29.590" style="s2">could do things and then hopefully do</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.920" end="00:18:31.900" style="s2">bookkeeping an admin for other</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.590" end="00:18:33.820" style="s2">collectives as well you know I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.900" end="00:18:35.260" style="s2">keep them straight but yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.820" end="00:18:37.990" style="s2">that I think when we talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.260" end="00:18:40.540" style="s2">taxes is that the taxes that they pay on</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.990" end="00:18:42.550" style="s2">on what you pay them you know me so you</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.540" end="00:18:45.280" style="s2">don&#39;t have to worry about any of that as</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.550" end="00:18:47.260" style="s2">I said as I said it took to you to run a</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.280" end="00:18:49.990" style="s2">collective as you as you see fit</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.260" end="00:18:52.150" style="s2">obviously all the laws in each different</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.990" end="00:18:57.720" style="s2">country applied differently so you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.150" end="00:19:00.850" style="s2">to do that you know I mean so just</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.720" end="00:19:03.550" style="s2">imagine you know like the taxman coming</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.850" end="00:19:10.120" style="s2">to my door and asking okay so you live</p>

<p begin="00:22:40.639" end="00:22:44.940" style="s2">if you could send me that another look</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.019" end="00:22:47.039" style="s2">because as I said them because of the</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.369" end="00:23:02.990" style="s2">put a card right there</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.530" end="00:23:39.870" style="s2">I had a moment of doubt yesterday when I</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.770" end="00:23:44.730" style="s2">looked at the structure you started to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.870" end="00:23:48.260" style="s2">create in in in my project and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.730" end="00:23:51.990" style="s2">realized how much is missing in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.260" end="00:23:55.040" style="s2">the user interface it&#39;s not that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.990" end="00:23:59.640" style="s2">functionality is not that it&#39;s just I</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.040" end="00:24:03.240" style="s2">might not have thought deeply enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.640" end="00:24:07.860" style="s2">about how to make it to look when there</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.240" end="00:24:11.910" style="s2">is actually data in it so because I</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.860" end="00:24:13.890" style="s2">think as I said like I said you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.910" end="00:24:16.680" style="s2">it all in unit so you know if you think</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.890" end="00:24:18.840" style="s2">a so when you get so like me coming</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.680" end="00:24:21.270" style="s2">along who&#39;s going ooh what&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.840" end="00:24:23.250" style="s2">what&#39;s that you know I mean so I already</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.270" end="00:24:28.460" style="s2">deleted this navigation system by</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.250" end="00:24:36.830" style="s2">accident no problem with the codes which</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.460" end="00:24:39.750" style="s2">I think I fixed but it was not so I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.830" end="00:24:42.750" style="s2">for the past 24 hours I was thinking how</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.750" end="00:24:46.170" style="s2">to make it look a bit better</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.750" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">mmm and I think I mean I have some ideas</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.170" end="00:24:56.700" style="s2">so I&#39;ll be working on it tonight and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:25:03.120" style="s2">next few days I think but in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.700" end="00:25:05.790" style="s2">meantime I improved the accounts I seen</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.120" end="00:25:10.380" style="s2">what you see and you are now able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.790" end="00:25:12.060" style="s2">edit details about yourself basically so</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.380" end="00:25:15.960" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s nothing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.060" end="00:25:21.000" style="s2">in the in the notes in the window so</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.960" end="00:25:25.350" style="s2">that looks better and I&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.000" end="00:25:28.250" style="s2">improve connections between notes so it</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.350" end="00:25:31.460" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look like a spaghetti thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.250" end="00:25:37.399" style="s2">which is very undercooked spaghetti</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.460" end="00:25:42.980" style="s2">red license so yeah improve that and yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.399" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">I still don&#39;t know when is the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.980" end="00:25:48.169" style="s2">moment to share it more publicly</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:52.100" style="s2">publicly instead of just talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.169" end="00:25:54.200" style="s2">individually to people I&#39;ve got a few</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.100" end="00:25:56.960" style="s2">odd ideas about that but I says I love a</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.890" end="00:26:16.130" style="s2">framework but we&#39;ll be adding on</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.809" end="00:26:21.620" style="s2">features to get it to where it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.130" end="00:26:24.169" style="s2">be so it&#39;s going good okay so we can go</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.620" end="00:26:25.510" style="s2">a lot then if you want yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.169" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">there&#39;s not much to look at yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.510" end="00:26:32.330" style="s2">very early days framework but that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:34.510" style="s2">sort of like as I said just the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.330" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">framework to sort of bolt stuff onto so</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.510" end="00:26:40.429" style="s2">we&#39;ve got it to where like the very</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:42.799" style="s2">first sort of draft specs were it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.429" end="00:26:44.929" style="s2">useful yet but that&#39;s because my initial</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.799" end="00:26:45.799" style="s2">specs weren&#39;t useful like it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.929" end="00:26:48.169" style="s2">meant to be there yet</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.799" end="00:26:49.640" style="s2">but yeah you can go there and view it</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.169" end="00:26:53.510" style="s2">and technically you can create an</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.640" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">account and that type of thing okay what</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.510" end="00:26:58.789" style="s2">have you think sorry what are the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:27:00.860" style="s2">things I&#39;ve just remembered what you</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.789" end="00:27:03.049" style="s2">know that I am blockchain hollow chain</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.860" end="00:27:05.750" style="s2">and crypto currencies and hermit you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.049" end="00:27:09.559" style="s2">said you want set up for kind of me and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.750" end="00:27:11.179" style="s2">and that and maybe I&#39;m a chart and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.559" end="00:27:13.460" style="s2">said because I don&#39;t have I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.179" end="00:27:15.559" style="s2">clue about any of it so I&#39;m just taking</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.460" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">a deep dive into everything just now so</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.559" end="00:27:18.919" style="s2">have we said everything to look out</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:20.720" style="s2">right I don&#39;t know what that is so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.919" end="00:27:22.460" style="s2">gonna have to go look so that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:28.490" style="s2">take me we were to get me around or a</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.460" end="00:27:33.980" style="s2">lot I suggest in the meeting because in</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.490" end="00:27:39.250" style="s2">the past few days I I&#39;m not sure why but</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.980" end="00:27:42.870" style="s2">I not noticed in a few different places</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.250" end="00:27:45.450" style="s2">that people were thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.870" end="00:27:49.710" style="s2">the blockchain and how useful it is for</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.450" end="00:27:52.410" style="s2">everything and in the past I had a few</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.710" end="00:27:58.820" style="s2">discussions precisely about about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.410" end="00:28:04.200" style="s2">so the meeting would be more about an</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.820" end="00:28:06.780" style="s2">overview what this and why it is not a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.200" end="00:28:09.570" style="s2">silver bullet for everything that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.780" end="00:28:13.580" style="s2">wrong because what I also noticed</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.570" end="00:28:19.170" style="s2">especially in the crypto community is</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.580" end="00:28:22.890" style="s2">and especially initially two three years</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.170" end="00:28:24.900" style="s2">ago when the boom started the crypto was</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.890" end="00:28:26.520" style="s2">going to solve everything and it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.900" end="00:28:28.260" style="s2">like this it is precisely what we need</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.520" end="00:28:30.870" style="s2">what was missing from the world and now</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.260" end="00:28:34.350" style="s2">it is here and now when we start using</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.870" end="00:28:37.890" style="s2">it we will be will be able to fix</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.350" end="00:28:41.060" style="s2">everything like kill all the corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.890" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">banking system remove the politicians</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.060" end="00:28:48.030" style="s2">the even like the law that was going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.840" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">be covered in crypto there was something</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.030" end="00:28:56.640" style="s2">like that as well and blockchain is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.520" end="00:29:00.780" style="s2">wonderful and amazing technology for</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.640" end="00:29:03.210" style="s2">sure it&#39;s just it&#39;s not quite going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.780" end="00:29:10.830" style="s2">solve everything like in one go</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.210" end="00:29:16.350" style="s2">so so what we do right now to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.830" end="00:29:19.230" style="s2">we don&#39;t need blockchain as much as some</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.350" end="00:29:21.150" style="s2">people might think so in theory</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.230" end="00:29:22.800" style="s2">everything that you can do on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.150" end="00:29:25.020" style="s2">blockchain you can do in other</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.800" end="00:29:30.110" style="s2">technologies it&#39;s just for some users</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.020" end="00:29:30.110" style="s2">blocking as the right tool to use and</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.190" end="00:29:37.500" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s the basic description and</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.830" end="00:29:39.990" style="s2">hello chain is not quite a blockchain so</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.500" end="00:29:45.390" style="s2">use of coaching is slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.990" end="00:29:51.450" style="s2">and yeah for that I prefer someone who</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.390" end="00:29:54.960" style="s2">knows Oh Jane better than then I to</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.450" end="00:29:58.500" style="s2">speak about it but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.960" end="00:30:03.330" style="s2">coaching is even more amazing technology</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.500" end="00:30:05.940" style="s2">then the lock chambers and it it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.330" end="00:30:12.030" style="s2">to as far as I understand is going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.940" end="00:30:20.130" style="s2">have more users and it&#39;s it it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.030" end="00:30:24.780" style="s2">in terms of well one of the things it</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.130" end="00:30:30.150" style="s2">does not burn as much coal as Bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.780" end="00:30:33.480" style="s2">for example so you know it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.150" end="00:30:36.330" style="s2">famous how we kind and other pure lock</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.480" end="00:30:42.480" style="s2">chain technologies they use energy like</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.330" end="00:30:45.330" style="s2">crazy right so it&#39;s not not very good in</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:47.370" style="s2">that respect is there a nature of block</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.330" end="00:30:49.860" style="s2">trainers at a nature of trying to mine</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.370" end="00:30:53.220" style="s2">for the unique IDs that you need for</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.860" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">stuff like Bitcoin the point is you need</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.220" end="00:31:00.150" style="s2">all nodes in the network to agree on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:01.410" style="s2">next node to be added that&#39;s also just a</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.150" end="00:31:02.810" style="s2">crazy amount of traffic to keep</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.410" end="00:31:05.730" style="s2">everything in sync</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.810" end="00:31:08.130" style="s2">not even traffic it&#39;s the crazy amount</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.730" end="00:31:10.560" style="s2">of computations down separately on each</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.130" end="00:31:14.220" style="s2">node in the in the network something</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.560" end="00:31:19.020" style="s2">like this so that&#39;s that&#39;s why it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.220" end="00:31:23.100" style="s2">very energy efficient yeah I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.020" end="00:31:29.450" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the very short</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.100" end="00:31:34.190" style="s2">story about I know there&#39;s work down on</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.450" end="00:31:37.080" style="s2">making it more energy efficient there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.190" end="00:31:39.930" style="s2">like plenty when you read about I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.080" end="00:31:43.290" style="s2">if you know other projects they do</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.930" end="00:31:46.440" style="s2">wonderful work to make it faster make it</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.290" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">more efficient make it more robust I</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.440" end="00:32:00.030" style="s2">think but yeah my point was blocking has</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:32:04.500" style="s2">specific uses and right now in game B in</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.030" end="00:32:07.940" style="s2">general the use for it is it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.500" end="00:32:07.940" style="s2">foundation for everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.679" end="00:32:19.080" style="s2">I&#39;ve just remembered what I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.940" end="00:32:20.940" style="s2">say before so you know that I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.080" end="00:32:22.950" style="s2">project&#39;s about sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.940" end="00:32:25.760" style="s2">different types of economies like</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.950" end="00:32:28.830" style="s2">capitalism socialism and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.760" end="00:32:30.539" style="s2">would wick elections be a place you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.830" end="00:32:32.940" style="s2">when you were saying there how to find</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.539" end="00:32:34.650" style="s2">the collect information so when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.940" end="00:32:36.570" style="s2">researching information into all these</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.650" end="00:32:39.510" style="s2">things about what&#39;s what&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.570" end="00:32:41.700" style="s2">what&#39;s false I just wondered whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.510" end="00:32:45.690" style="s2">with elections I&#39;d be able to use that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.700" end="00:32:49.559" style="s2">in terms of knowing outer or to get all</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.690" end="00:32:52.169" style="s2">that information once it finds it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.559" end="00:32:54.659" style="s2">one of sort of the later stage goals is</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.169" end="00:32:56.549" style="s2">to have a lot of information about like</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.659" end="00:32:58.260" style="s2">just the systems of government sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.549" end="00:32:59.880" style="s2">the theoretical ones and then the actual</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.260" end="00:33:01.940" style="s2">like how countries operate individually</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.880" end="00:33:04.610" style="s2">have what the actual rules are in place</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.940" end="00:33:06.450" style="s2">mostly the real world applications</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.610" end="00:33:08.789" style="s2">because you know if you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.450" end="00:33:10.289" style="s2">socialism well that means a million</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.789" end="00:33:11.850" style="s2">different things right like are we</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.289" end="00:33:13.980" style="s2">talking about Sweden are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.850" end="00:33:17.010" style="s2">about Mao was China like what do we mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.980" end="00:33:18.510" style="s2">when we say socialism and technically</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.010" end="00:33:24.360" style="s2">they&#39;re all correct but they&#39;re also all</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.510" end="00:33:26.429" style="s2">wrong so it yeah it&#39;s the goal is mainly</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.360" end="00:33:29.490" style="s2">just to provide information just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.429" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">help people decide how to vote and a</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.490" end="00:33:32.520" style="s2">part of that is you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:34.890" style="s2">voting for president or you&#39;re voting</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.520" end="00:33:36.779" style="s2">for mayor okay but what does that person</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.890" end="00:33:38.610" style="s2">do what are their rights and their</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.779" end="00:33:40.710" style="s2">responsibilities and all that so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.610" end="00:33:44.179" style="s2">you know what you&#39;re actually voting for</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.710" end="00:33:46.740" style="s2">and then like okay if they have these</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.179" end="00:33:48.210" style="s2">responsibilities here&#39;s what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.740" end="00:33:50.370" style="s2">skill set that person should probably</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.210" end="00:33:52.289" style="s2">have whoever&#39;s in that role should you</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.370" end="00:33:54.740" style="s2">know know about these sort of things</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.289" end="00:33:58.500" style="s2">because they&#39;re gonna have these four</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.740" end="00:34:00.210" style="s2">responsibilities just any sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.500" end="00:34:01.860" style="s2">yeah that makes sense because as I said</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.210" end="00:34:05.789" style="s2">I was just thinking of sort of like ways</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.860" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2">of them other sort of information out</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.789" end="00:34:09.349" style="s2">there and and half the time you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:11.280" style="s2">know whether it&#39;s true or not and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.349" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">digging through the research shows me</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.280" end="00:34:16.260" style="s2">may was to get all the research turn</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:19.109" style="s2">into all them areas then with James</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.260" end="00:34:21.270" style="s2">imasu she was like develop that and to</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.109" end="00:34:21.869" style="s2">kind of like muffin you know all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.270" end="00:34:25.349" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.869" end="00:34:27.889" style="s2">the world of that but from now I had you</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.349" end="00:34:31.259" style="s2">know as I said least linmark truth Adam</p>

<p begin="00:35:54.029" end="00:35:59.400" style="s2">socialism you know it&#39;s wonderful and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.730" end="00:36:01.109" style="s2">that I&#39;m the same with communism and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.400" end="00:36:03.809" style="s2">thought when we do this or like trauma</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.109" end="00:36:06.749" style="s2">counselor at their you know humanity</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.809" end="00:36:08.940" style="s2">this you know communism enough and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.749" end="00:36:11.549" style="s2">know there&#39;s a lot of good bits in each</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.940" end="00:36:13.529" style="s2">of the economic systems there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.549" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">good stuff in in each and every one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.529" end="00:36:17.910" style="s2">them but it&#39;s the horrors that get</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:19.589" style="s2">caused that people don&#39;t seem to know</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.910" end="00:36:22.019" style="s2">about and as I said if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.589" end="00:36:23.999" style="s2">interested in history they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.019" end="00:36:26.579" style="s2">for him but then you just need to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.999" end="00:36:28.200" style="s2">aware of what you know but core so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.579" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">think if you do that in a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.880" end="00:36:51.690" style="s2">what was about a place where I can start</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.280" end="00:36:54.420" style="s2">gathering the research and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.690" end="00:36:55.380" style="s2">everybody can chip in and as and when</p>

<p begin="00:39:13.370" end="00:39:16.670" style="s2">planet is attributed to capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.930" end="00:39:18.620" style="s2">people starving to death people who have</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.670" end="00:39:20.810" style="s2">either not enough to eat or way too much</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.620" end="00:39:23.960" style="s2">to eat a lot of it is designed like it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:39:31.760" end="00:39:35.450" style="s2">was first talking abut I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.500" end="00:39:37.070" style="s2">picturing like a skit that was almost</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.450" end="00:39:38.930" style="s2">like a couples counseling where one</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.070" end="00:39:40.730" style="s2">person is you know socialism communism</p>

<p begin="00:39:42.110" end="00:39:46.940" style="s2">this and you did that and then the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.520" end="00:39:48.770" style="s2">person trying to figure out what that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.940" end="00:39:50.810" style="s2">think that one could be you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.770" end="00:39:58.420" style="s2">probably a good combination of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.810" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">entertaining and educational actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.420" end="00:40:03.740" style="s2">this isn&#39;t just be chanted to meme some</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:07.010" style="s2">isms and that&#39;s all we all know</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.740" end="00:40:10.760" style="s2">so a me speech you chew cuticle means</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.010" end="00:40:12.800" style="s2">and isms that&#39;s what a truthful isms you</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.760" end="00:40:14.420" style="s2">know the truth about all these as I said</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.800" end="00:40:17.690" style="s2">that thing that gets tainted to an ism</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.420" end="00:40:18.700" style="s2">when I said individualism is getting</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.690" end="00:40:21.650" style="s2">frowned upon</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.700" end="00:40:24.080" style="s2">collectivism this and that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.650" end="00:40:26.330" style="s2">never did everything as I said this good</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.080" end="00:40:27.710" style="s2">fits in all of it for him I said you</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.330" end="00:40:29.900" style="s2">don&#39;t get to know the truth and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.710" end="00:40:34.460" style="s2">nobody out there who can&#39;t even tell you</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.900" end="00:40:36.650" style="s2">that what the problem with this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.460" end="00:40:40.730" style="s2">exactly the same program as we&#39;ve any</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.650" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">other big subject I once upon a time I</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.730" end="00:40:48.320" style="s2">used to discuss like religious stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:50.390" style="s2">with especially about cathodic Church</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.320" end="00:40:54.830" style="s2">because that&#39;s the most popular one in</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.390" end="00:40:58.790" style="s2">Poland like 90 percents assumed to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.830" end="00:41:01.790" style="s2">Catholics and we it&#39;s like we all know</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.790" end="00:41:02.289" style="s2">what problem with culture is right more</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.790" end="00:41:06.519" style="s2">or less</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.289" end="00:41:10.539" style="s2">but to talk about it exclusively in</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.519" end="00:41:11.349" style="s2">terms of how bad it is it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.539" end="00:41:13.479" style="s2">missing the point</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.349" end="00:41:16.390" style="s2">it&#39;s the subject is way too big to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.479" end="00:41:19.439" style="s2">categorized only on one side of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.390" end="00:41:26.529" style="s2">equation and that good bits and about</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.439" end="00:41:29.019" style="s2">bits and pieces about about this and to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.529" end="00:41:30.910" style="s2">talk about all of them I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.019" end="00:41:32.589" style="s2">that&#39;s again possible because there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.910" end="00:41:34.900" style="s2">always going to be a counter argument</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.589" end="00:41:38.949" style="s2">and okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.900" end="00:41:41.109" style="s2">this was built good this was bad and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.949" end="00:41:45.269" style="s2">can continue and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.109" end="00:41:52.900" style="s2">totally productive use of time and</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.269" end="00:41:56.650" style="s2">seeming out I well I I&#39;ve seen it in</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.900" end="00:42:02.559" style="s2">action so I&#39;m totally biased against and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.650" end="00:42:06.459" style="s2">I understand it as an idea that is very</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.559" end="00:42:09.279" style="s2">good as an idea but once it&#39;s built into</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.459" end="00:42:12.519" style="s2">production it ends badly and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.279" end="00:42:15.729" style="s2">inevitable it&#39;s just there is no single</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.519" end="00:42:21.519" style="s2">example of it&#39;s going right I&#39;m afraid</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.729" end="00:42:23.199" style="s2">so it&#39;s just up at the full picture just</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.519" end="00:42:26.529" style="s2">be able to have the full picture of</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.199" end="00:42:28.150" style="s2">everything you know I mean and then make</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.529" end="00:42:30.489" style="s2">up your mind what side you want to join</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.150" end="00:42:35.709" style="s2">but it&#39;s just some way to have the full</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.489" end="00:42:38.289" style="s2">picture of everything you know but what</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.709" end="00:42:39.549" style="s2">I&#39;m afraid of is the big picture is too</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.289" end="00:42:42.969" style="s2">big for anyone&#39;s head</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.549" end="00:42:46.659" style="s2">that&#39;s what dr. Berger says that right</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.969" end="00:42:49.869" style="s2">now those subjects are too big for any</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.659" end="00:42:55.239" style="s2">single individual to be able to keep in</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.869" end="00:43:04.239" style="s2">in like in one mind it&#39;s just yeah too</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.239" end="00:43:07.119" style="s2">big so it&#39;s necessary for us to like see</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.239" end="00:43:12.579" style="s2">what we can see from any system and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.119" end="00:43:14.289" style="s2">that&#39;s what people do they prefer to see</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.579" end="00:43:17.380" style="s2">the bright side or the bath</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.289" end="00:43:21.279" style="s2">and then stick to it and then it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.380" end="00:43:24.249" style="s2">easier and it&#39;s not you oh it might not</p>

<p begin="00:43:24.249" end="00:43:34.029" style="s2">only way possible sometimes but myself I</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.869" end="00:43:40.419" style="s2">am doing as I tried to always remember</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.029" end="00:43:45.160" style="s2">to argue about specific points and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.419" end="00:43:46.509" style="s2">always a disclaimer that and I do argue</p>

<p begin="00:46:04.500" end="00:46:09.760" style="s2">but as I said it&#39;s just a trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.690" end="00:46:11.380" style="s2">the right balance of trying to get them</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.760" end="00:46:13.690" style="s2">so they say well look this is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.380" end="00:46:15.220" style="s2">project that I&#39;m on trust now and this</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.690" end="00:46:17.950" style="s2">is what so I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.220" end="00:46:19.720" style="s2">just a case of its Facebook and although</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.950" end="00:46:21.970" style="s2">they&#39;re not a stage they&#39;re ready to</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.720" end="00:46:24.579" style="s2">post the project yeah but it&#39;d just be</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.970" end="00:46:26.890" style="s2">nice to get some sort of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.579" end="00:46:28.990" style="s2">going about different things but because</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.890" end="00:46:29.800" style="s2">as I said I haven&#39;t spoken to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.990" end="00:46:32.050" style="s2">people yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.800" end="00:46:34.690" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know what their interest is</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.050" end="00:46:37.059" style="s2">and I know be posted because I said some</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.690" end="00:46:39.010" style="s2">people just post at the intro and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.059" end="00:46:40.869" style="s2">you never get to hear from them again so</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.010" end="00:46:44.920" style="s2">I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s a time issue</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.869" end="00:46:46.660" style="s2">or so I&#39;m a bit struggling as if or</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.920" end="00:46:51.910" style="s2">whether they just think I&#39;m a bit scary</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.660" end="00:46:53.829" style="s2">as I go so no I mean what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.910" end="00:46:55.780" style="s2">is definitely a step up to what we were</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.829" end="00:46:57.309" style="s2">doing so don&#39;t feel like it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.780" end="00:46:57.940" style="s2">all of the like you don&#39;t need to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.309" end="00:47:02.079" style="s2">an entry</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.940" end="00:47:03.670" style="s2">um interview with every single person if</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.079" end="00:47:06.099" style="s2">that&#39;s overwhelming for you that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.670" end="00:47:09.760" style="s2">of what what you then there is going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.099" end="00:47:11.589" style="s2">be a difference in participation but</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.760" end="00:47:13.420" style="s2">also some of the people might be BOTS</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.589" end="00:47:14.890" style="s2">right and if they&#39;re not responding to</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.420" end="00:47:16.930" style="s2">anything and they&#39;re not answering the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.890" end="00:47:19.240" style="s2">questions answering the questions and</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.930" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">having at least a voice conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.240" end="00:47:24.960" style="s2">a good way to know that there&#39;s a human</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:27.700" style="s2">being somewhere in there hopefully but</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.960" end="00:47:29.410" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t overwhelm me because I love</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.700" end="00:47:30.790" style="s2">doing this I love talking to people and</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.410" end="00:47:32.829" style="s2">finding out what they&#39;re up to and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.790" end="00:47:34.869" style="s2">because then you see what what&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.829" end="00:47:36.400" style="s2">there as I said after about all is not</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.869" end="00:47:38.770" style="s2">knowing what&#39;s out there and when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.400" end="00:47:40.869" style="s2">got projects going on and you may be</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.770" end="00:47:42.790" style="s2">thinking of something if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.869" end="00:47:44.740" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.790" end="00:47:46.360" style="s2">you know because I said you might get</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.740" end="00:47:48.130" style="s2">started in some way down the line you</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.360" end="00:47:52.120" style="s2">think oh my god was about twenty people</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.130" end="00:47:53.980" style="s2">doing that you know yeah no there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.120" end="00:47:56.020" style="s2">somebody came into the Facebook he was</p>

<p begin="00:47:56.020" end="00:48:05.740" style="s2">source Facebook I&#39;m like yeah you get on</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.670" end="00:48:12.460" style="s2">that that&#39;s your project but what else</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.740" end="00:48:16.060" style="s2">do you do every other Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.460" end="00:48:18.940" style="s2">which is people join because the name</p>

<p begin="00:48:18.940" end="00:48:24.220" style="s2">may want to join this so they click</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.680" end="00:48:25.720" style="s2">automatically and they don&#39;t bother with</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.220" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">questions because they are not</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.720" end="00:48:30.910" style="s2">interested in the thing but they clicked</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:35.260" style="s2">because that&#39;s what people do they click</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.910" end="00:48:37.540" style="s2">and the end result is out of every</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.260" end="00:48:41.850" style="s2">hundred people 90 of them is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.540" end="00:48:44.470" style="s2">silent and they&#39;re not going to leave</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.850" end="00:48:51.250" style="s2">because people never leave Facebook</p>
