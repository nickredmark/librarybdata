<p begin="00:00:30.570" end="00:00:35.309" style="s2">we lead okay and then I and I and I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.780" end="00:00:36.719" style="s2">to try and lay as many of our cards on</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.309" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">the table now so that everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.719" end="00:00:42.540" style="s2">transparent and you can triangulate for</p>

<p begin="00:00:47.160" end="00:00:51.329" style="s2">authoring versus socially defined</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:52.949" style="s2">behaviors that comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.329" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">developmental psychology many of you are</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.949" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">probably already familiar with that but</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">socially defined is I&#39;m following</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:59.100" style="s2">scripts the first ones that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:01.320" style="s2">comes up with is you know what I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.100" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">born and raised in to get a job get a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.320" end="00:01:05.040" style="s2">car get a degree you know marry they get</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:07.799" style="s2">the nice one your wife or husband the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.040" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">house the car etc many of us then break</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.799" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">out of that socially defined script and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:12.450" style="s2">then we just go straight into another</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:13.530" style="s2">one you know and now it&#39;s groovy country</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.450" end="00:01:14.760" style="s2">culture and I was trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.530" end="00:01:16.350" style="s2">enlightened and use our whisper talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.760" end="00:01:17.580" style="s2">voices and make uncomfortably long eye</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.350" end="00:01:19.799" style="s2">contact whatever it would be it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.580" end="00:01:21.299" style="s2">socially defined I&#39;m even though we</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.799" end="00:01:23.549" style="s2">think it&#39;s liberated even Punk&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.299" end="00:01:26.210" style="s2">remarkably conformist right so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.549" end="00:01:29.329" style="s2">question is that how do we support</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.210" end="00:01:33.180" style="s2">constructivist action learning in</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.329" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">service of self authoring behavior which</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.180" end="00:01:37.290" style="s2">basically means and the russian</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:38.549" style="s2">educational theorist Vygotsky hadn&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.290" end="00:01:40.860" style="s2">it has a great concept known as</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.549" end="00:01:42.869" style="s2">scaffolding and scaffolding are those</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.860" end="00:01:45.409" style="s2">tools or training wheels that help</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.869" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">support and guide and enhance our</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.409" end="00:01:49.979" style="s2">intelligence and one of our colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">at Harvard Zac Stein has done some</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.979" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">fascinating work on that basically</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:56.009" style="s2">saying intelligence is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">plastic there&#39;s not a fixed thing and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.009" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">depends entirely on the scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:02.549" style="s2">right so for instance you can have</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:05.399" style="s2">somebody take an intelligence test and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.549" end="00:02:07.649" style="s2">they&#39;ll score a 3 out of 5 but then you</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.399" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">introduce the notion of a mind map and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.649" end="00:02:11.489" style="s2">you&#39;re like hey draw and scribble for</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">half an hour organize your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.489" end="00:02:15.240" style="s2">understand you know linear and non</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:18.510" style="s2">linear connections between them test</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.240" end="00:02:21.480" style="s2">again they can score a 5 a dyslexic</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.510" end="00:02:23.430" style="s2">would spell check on their MacBook right</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.480" end="00:02:25.800" style="s2">presents as an entirely different level</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.430" end="00:02:27.480" style="s2">of social intelligence so all we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.800" end="00:02:31.170" style="s2">gonna be trying to do is share some</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.480" end="00:02:32.250" style="s2">scaffolding right that helps okay and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.170" end="00:02:37.620" style="s2">then finally the other thing is we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.250" end="00:02:39.480" style="s2">say we do take a stand Oliver Wendell</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.620" end="00:02:41.730" style="s2">Holmes the US Supreme Court justice way</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.480" end="00:02:44.250" style="s2">back when had a great phrase he said I</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.730" end="00:02:46.770" style="s2">don&#39;t give a fig for the simplicity on</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.250" end="00:02:50.040" style="s2">this side of complexity but I would give</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.770" end="00:02:52.920" style="s2">my life for the simplicity on the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.040" end="00:02:54.810" style="s2">side of complexity so what we would</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.920" end="00:02:58.020" style="s2">advocate is that the spectrum of where</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.810" end="00:02:59.700" style="s2">we all come down on what&#39;s to be done</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.020" end="00:03:01.860" style="s2">you know where are we what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.700" end="00:03:04.350" style="s2">and what&#39;s to be done is entirely our</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.860" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">sovereign choice but we would absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.350" end="00:03:10.620" style="s2">advocate that a more considered position</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:14.700" style="s2">is better than a less considered</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.620" end="00:03:16.530" style="s2">position cool all right so with that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.700" end="00:03:18.930" style="s2">said now can you guys even see this this</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.530" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">is pretty done washed out but basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.930" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">this was a this is a line from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:25.410" style="s2">Talking Heads will probably trot out the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:26.489" style="s2">song at some point nothing but flowers</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.410" end="00:03:27.870" style="s2">out and if you guys have to remember</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.489" end="00:03:29.640" style="s2">that but I do remember back in college</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.870" end="00:03:31.530" style="s2">being baked as listening this line</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.640" end="00:03:34.140" style="s2">and and you know Don see little diddy</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.530" end="00:03:37.980" style="s2">and sit and as things fell apart nobody</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.140" end="00:03:41.610" style="s2">paid much attention and that really rang</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.980" end="00:03:44.040" style="s2">true then it seemingly has been true for</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.610" end="00:03:46.170" style="s2">quite some time something might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.040" end="00:03:48.300" style="s2">changing lately and it feels like more</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.170" end="00:03:50.270" style="s2">of us are starting to pay attention and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.300" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">notice that so the question is is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.270" end="00:03:56.790" style="s2">mapping and modeling how do we take a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">look at things so I I think I opened our</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:04:00.420" style="s2">talk on Thursday night with this same</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">quote from Buckminster Fuller because</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.420" end="00:04:04.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it gets us to the point where he</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:07.650" style="s2">says quite clearly our task is</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.680" end="00:04:10.709" style="s2">predominantly metaphysical but it is how</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.650" end="00:04:14.010" style="s2">to get all of humanity to educate itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.709" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">swiftly enough to generate spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.010" end="00:04:19.859" style="s2">social behaviors that will avoid</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">extinction now he read that half a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.859" end="00:04:25.570" style="s2">century ago sure what he was on time</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:28.300" style="s2">all right there were many many things he</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.570" end="00:04:32.110" style="s2">was well ahead of the curve on so this</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.300" end="00:04:33.730" style="s2">is not to say New Age escapism right we</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.110" end="00:04:35.710" style="s2">just get to all keep going to our there</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.730" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">passing the retreats and hope that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.710" end="00:04:42.550" style="s2">will sort it but it is to say hey wish</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">it we&#39;re in a shared project here of how</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.550" end="00:04:47.760" style="s2">do we get this done</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:50.320" style="s2">so I&#39;m just gonna share some potential</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.760" end="00:04:53.170" style="s2">sessions I want to make very clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.320" end="00:04:56.680" style="s2">that&#39;s all they are you are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.170" end="00:04:58.990" style="s2">free to agree disagree challenge refine</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.680" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">iterate okay but this is just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.990" end="00:05:08.610" style="s2">again to the laying the cards the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.600" end="00:05:12.820" style="s2">is that things are likely to destabilize</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.610" end="00:05:14.620" style="s2">before they Rico here I&#39;m not sure many</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.820" end="00:05:17.170" style="s2">of us are following the science and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.620" end="00:05:19.930" style="s2">research but there are certain cats that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.170" end="00:05:22.420" style="s2">have squarely out of the bag and we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.930" end="00:05:25.780" style="s2">not getting them back before there will</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.420" end="00:05:27.610" style="s2">be some degradation and conditions which</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.780" end="00:05:29.860" style="s2">is important when we start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.610" end="00:05:33.060" style="s2">about potential solutions because if a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.860" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">solution is lies above the level of</p>

<p begin="00:09:15.779" end="00:09:21.399" style="s2">we ought to be thinking of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:25.260" style="s2">culturally as well right because right</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.399" end="00:09:29.589" style="s2">now the seeds of culture that are best</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.260" end="00:09:32.740" style="s2">best positioned to persist are not that</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.170" end="00:09:55.779" style="s2">folks that are taking this far more</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.680" end="00:10:00.300" style="s2">proactively and tactically than almost</p>

<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:21.250" style="s2">others so my assumption I&#39;m going to try</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.850" end="00:10:23.769" style="s2">and make everything explicit anytime we</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.250" end="00:10:26.199" style="s2">are not just sort of stating a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.769" end="00:10:28.089" style="s2">fact so my assumption is that you</p>

<p begin="00:10:30.940" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">one of the challenges in most of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.889" end="00:10:36.399" style="s2">lives is then how do I communicate and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:37.080" style="s2">enroll people around me without freaking</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.399" end="00:10:39.209" style="s2">them the</p>

<p begin="00:10:39.209" end="00:10:45.899" style="s2">so what skillful means right in building</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.899" end="00:10:50.970" style="s2">next right so the first one just to give</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.129" end="00:15:32.939" style="s2">think I spoke a little bit about a</p>

<p begin="00:15:32.939" end="00:15:36.509" style="s2">is a sort of rapture ideology the idea</p>

<p begin="00:15:40.970" end="00:15:44.609" style="s2">therefore we just need to fingers</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.899" end="00:15:45.899" style="s2">crossed and squint our eyes and get to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.609" end="00:15:49.410" style="s2">the inflection point and then we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.899" end="00:15:51.749" style="s2">saved from any of the creative linear</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.410" end="00:15:54.899" style="s2">challenges we face we just get to skip</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.749" end="00:15:58.109" style="s2">that somehow and whether the skip comes</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.899" end="00:16:00.720" style="s2">from you know interdimensional contact</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.109" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">and benevolent alien saving us whether</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.720" end="00:16:05.489" style="s2">it comes from an asymptotic blossoming</p>

<p begin="00:16:05.489" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">whether it comes from blockchain</p>

<p begin="00:16:11.519" end="00:16:15.899" style="s2">late-stage capitalism whether it comes</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.889" end="00:16:17.939" style="s2">from everybody getting to do MDMA and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.899" end="00:16:20.220" style="s2">healing their hearts all right and I</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.529" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">whether it comes from any of those</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.939" end="00:16:34.499" style="s2">things right the answer is probably not</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:36.329" style="s2">probably not and you know my graduate</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.499" end="00:16:38.459" style="s2">studies were very much you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.329" end="00:16:40.289" style="s2">going through basically environmental</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.459" end="00:16:41.639" style="s2">ecological studies like this stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.289" end="00:16:43.379" style="s2">came to a lot of these conclusions a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.639" end="00:16:45.660" style="s2">long time ago based on structural things</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.379" end="00:16:47.910" style="s2">like even just hydraulic societies like</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.660" end="00:16:49.439" style="s2">if you rely on irrigation you go the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.910" end="00:16:51.569" style="s2">of the Egyptians you go the way of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.439" end="00:16:53.850" style="s2">Anasazi this is how it&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.569" end="00:16:55.980" style="s2">okay and if you look at the American</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.850" end="00:16:57.629" style="s2">West from Denver all the way out to Los</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.980" end="00:17:00.480" style="s2">Angeles you&#39;re like they&#39;re sticking</p>

<p begin="00:17:00.480" end="00:17:03.629" style="s2">millions of years to charge they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.069" end="00:17:04.889" style="s2">sucking out all the water they&#39;re puking</p>

<p begin="00:17:10.659" end="00:17:15.019" style="s2">doesn&#39;t pencil out we&#39;re consuming it</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.639" end="00:17:17.869" style="s2">faster than we&#39;re restoring it that</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.019" end="00:17:20.419" style="s2">isn&#39;t that is a terminal condition that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.869" end="00:17:24.730" style="s2">was that was twenty years ago now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.419" end="00:17:28.399" style="s2">looking at a whole additional level of</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.730" end="00:17:30.919" style="s2">ways we think it might be saved when the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.399" end="00:17:33.559" style="s2">classic is the Steven Pinker version of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.919" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">the techno utopianism like actually hey</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.559" end="00:17:38.419" style="s2">all you naysayers right we&#39;ve acted the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:39.889" style="s2">news cycle if it bleeds it leads that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.419" end="00:17:41.749" style="s2">telling us all the doom and gloom it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.889" end="00:17:43.669" style="s2">bad thing actually things are getting</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.749" end="00:17:48.049" style="s2">better and they are things are getting</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.669" end="00:17:51.320" style="s2">exponentially better right childhood</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.049" end="00:17:52.970" style="s2">mortality literacy right decrease in</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.320" end="00:17:54.710" style="s2">wars despite what we see in our news</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.970" end="00:17:56.509" style="s2">feeds right there&#39;s all those beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.710" end="00:18:00.019" style="s2">trends and that is the promise of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.509" end="00:18:02.690" style="s2">Enlightenment right the trick is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.019" end="00:18:05.119" style="s2">there have been massive externalities to</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.690" end="00:18:05.749" style="s2">that progress and the tragedy of the</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.749" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">and so even if you take for an example</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.879" end="00:18:11.179" style="s2">of things like ocean acidification and</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:14.029" style="s2">warming right the ocean has been</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.179" end="00:18:15.559" style="s2">absorbing all the excess heat of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.029" end="00:18:17.659" style="s2">entire industrial revolution and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.559" end="00:18:19.999" style="s2">burning of hydrocarbons for over a</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.659" end="00:18:22.460" style="s2">century it did it way better than we</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.999" end="00:18:24.980" style="s2">thought it possibly could but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.460" end="00:18:28.220" style="s2">actually and now in the last two years</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.980" end="00:18:30.679" style="s2">realizing holy there was way more</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.220" end="00:18:33.590" style="s2">latent energy stored than we knew it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.679" end="00:18:36.039" style="s2">doing it was a buffer alright and now it</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.590" end="00:18:38.480" style="s2">is actually very very close to capacity</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.039" end="00:18:39.769" style="s2">so when we try and wrestle with things</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:42.139" style="s2">are getting exponentially better but</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.769" end="00:18:46.070" style="s2">they are also getting exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.139" end="00:18:47.690" style="s2">worse and to try and map those trends in</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.070" end="00:18:50.359" style="s2">the intersection between them in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.690" end="00:18:53.869" style="s2">complex chaotic system beggars the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.359" end="00:18:55.549" style="s2">imagination just anybody ever felt that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.869" end="00:18:57.320" style="s2">pillar to post kind of thing in your</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.549" end="00:18:59.629" style="s2">social feed like someone will be coming</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.320" end="00:19:01.909" style="s2">from one camp and then yeah oh my gosh I</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.629" end="00:19:04.580" style="s2">can relax thank God and the Hans Rosling</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.909" end="00:19:06.379" style="s2">and his TED Talks or Steven Pinker like</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.580" end="00:19:08.149" style="s2">those those guys you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.379" end="00:19:09.289" style="s2">someone comes in pisses on the parade</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.149" end="00:19:11.179" style="s2">and it&#39;s like yeah but what about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.289" end="00:19:13.779" style="s2">other yeah sack of that stuff again</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.179" end="00:19:13.779" style="s2">dolphins</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.330" end="00:19:19.320" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s crazy making and then how</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.910" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">about anybody in a psychedelic or</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.320" end="00:19:22.410" style="s2">contemplative experience and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:24.930" style="s2">actually no this is this is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.410" end="00:19:28.230" style="s2">okay this is unfolding as it must</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.930" end="00:19:29.580" style="s2">this is this - as part of the plan has</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.230" end="00:19:32.040" style="s2">anybody had that experience of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.580" end="00:19:36.060" style="s2">you know non-dual transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.040" end="00:19:38.750" style="s2">equanimity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.060" end="00:19:42.860" style="s2">and how on earth do we hold all that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.750" end="00:19:42.860" style="s2">right how long have to be hold of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.890" end="00:19:47.250" style="s2">so yeah I mean we&#39;ve been we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.240" end="00:19:50.040" style="s2">riffing on some of these things I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.250" end="00:19:53.820" style="s2">think we need to go deeply into it other</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.040" end="00:19:55.560" style="s2">than we&#39;ve talked about I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.820" end="00:19:57.420" style="s2">want to repeat the conversation we had</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.560" end="00:19:59.880" style="s2">on Thursday night which was about belief</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.420" end="00:20:01.740" style="s2">systems and those notions of rapture</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.880" end="00:20:04.290" style="s2">ideologies I think one of the other</p>

<p begin="00:35:47.660" end="00:35:51.619" style="s2">sash society and they were kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.820" end="00:35:54.430" style="s2">ballers around can right that was like</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.619" end="00:35:57.050" style="s2">the baddest-ass warrior club to be in</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.430" end="00:35:59.599" style="s2">and they had their sash for a reason</p>

<p begin="00:36:07.369" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">their lawns and they would spike the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.849" end="00:36:16.280" style="s2">Lance into the ground and they would</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.180" end="00:36:59.720" style="s2">right we don&#39;t need to fumble blindly</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.460" end="00:37:02.340" style="s2">into the future all right we&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="00:37:31.400" end="00:37:35.160" style="s2">and how might we do that and well you</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.750" end="00:37:40.470" style="s2">know we can talk about that a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.160" end="00:37:42.090" style="s2">this afternoon so let me just talk</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:51.570" style="s2">just do an emotional conceptual pulse</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.730" end="00:37:54.600" style="s2">check okay is this okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.570" end="00:38:04.020" style="s2">I mean this is so much in the realm of</p>

<p begin="00:38:04.020" end="00:38:08.130" style="s2">to do because obviously it&#39;s not-it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.670" end="00:38:10.680" style="s2">not helpful just to scare the out</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.130" end="00:38:17.400" style="s2">of people and leave them fibrillating</p>

<p begin="00:42:23.570" end="00:42:26.830" style="s2">gonna be freaked out or they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.010" end="00:42:29.980" style="s2">direct you know dismissive or derisive</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.830" end="00:42:32.420" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be fun I promise that</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.980" end="00:42:34.339" style="s2">no one&#39;s gonna say thank you so much</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.420" end="00:42:40.190" style="s2">really glad that was a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.339" end="00:42:41.540" style="s2">inspiration I think I&#39;ll do the same you</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.190" end="00:42:44.750" style="s2">know and in the New Testament it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.540" end="00:42:46.640" style="s2">story of the Nazarene going to the Sea</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.750" end="00:42:48.230" style="s2">of Galilee and I think I don&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.640" end="00:42:50.300" style="s2">wear those classical mouthfuls it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.230" end="00:42:51.530" style="s2">James and John and Peter called Zebedee</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.300" end="00:42:53.330" style="s2">or something you know like one of those</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.530" end="00:42:54.859" style="s2">but it&#39;s like through for three or four</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.330" end="00:42:56.150" style="s2">dudes and they&#39;ve just bought two new</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.859" end="00:42:57.619" style="s2">fishing boats and they&#39;re out in the Sea</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.150" end="00:42:59.750" style="s2">of Galilee they&#39;ve got new Nets the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.619" end="00:43:01.070" style="s2">whole bit and Jesus like yeah no no I</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.750" end="00:43:02.420" style="s2">said they&#39;re like look at us we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.070" end="00:43:05.210" style="s2">it we&#39;re kicking ass we&#39;re finally gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.420" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">make it there&#39;s like not when are you</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.210" end="00:43:14.390" style="s2">gonna put down your nets and come and be</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:16.880" style="s2">fishers of men so for all of us the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.390" end="00:43:18.250" style="s2">answer to that question right is</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.880" end="00:43:22.470" style="s2">uniquely personal</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.250" end="00:43:23.970" style="s2">but weirdly it&#39;s getting transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.470" end="00:43:26.200" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.970" end="00:43:27.790" style="s2">marshall mcluhan famously said the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.200" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">personal is political that became the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.790" end="00:43:35.050" style="s2">rallying cry of the sixties but the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:40.330" style="s2">transpersonal right is political even</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.050" end="00:43:42.430" style="s2">more so and how do we answer this</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.330" end="00:43:44.680" style="s2">question I know for myself I&#39;ve had that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.430" end="00:43:46.900" style="s2">one on the corner of my eye back in my</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.680" end="00:43:51.609" style="s2">vision I&#39;ve been dodging it for as long</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.900" end="00:43:54.160" style="s2">as I possibly can let me just make this</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.609" end="00:43:55.780" style="s2">amount of money to make sure my kids can</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.160" end="00:43:57.490" style="s2">go to college make sure they have a safe</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.780" end="00:43:59.320" style="s2">place to be to make sure everything can</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.490" end="00:44:02.470" style="s2">sort and then if I have to then okay I</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.320" end="00:44:05.290" style="s2">will but please let me tie up all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.470" end="00:44:07.780" style="s2">loose ends please make sure that if I</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.290" end="00:44:10.440" style="s2">have to do something hairy or scary that</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.780" end="00:44:12.970" style="s2">it won&#39;t affect anybody else I love and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.440" end="00:44:15.010" style="s2">while that sounds noble and beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.970" end="00:44:18.400" style="s2">when it&#39;s again back to evolutionary bio</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.010" end="00:44:21.240" style="s2">it&#39;s hard encoded in all of us if I</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.400" end="00:44:24.339" style="s2">really sat in front of the burning bush</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.240" end="00:44:28.599" style="s2">would the answer not be that - there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.339" end="00:44:31.270" style="s2">an attachment of your ego that - there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.599" end="00:44:35.770" style="s2">a false presumption that you control far</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.270" end="00:44:37.210" style="s2">more than you ever could and what is</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.770" end="00:44:42.250" style="s2">truly surrendering into all of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.210" end="00:44:48.010" style="s2">actually looking to you like it&#39;s scary</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.250" end="00:44:49.420" style="s2">super scary feedback I often get in</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.010" end="00:44:50.859" style="s2">conversations like this and a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.420" end="00:44:52.960" style="s2">less in the last year or so cuz I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.859" end="00:44:55.000" style="s2">just been I&#39;m sort of officially out of</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.960" end="00:44:57.700" style="s2">ice I actually went was it actually a</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.000" end="00:45:00.040" style="s2">specific workshop trauma thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.700" end="00:45:03.010" style="s2">went through and I&#39;m like okay I accept</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.040" end="00:45:05.170" style="s2">my yoke like so there was a legit pivot</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.010" end="00:45:08.460" style="s2">point for me in this last year but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.170" end="00:45:12.130" style="s2">not done you know it was that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.460" end="00:45:15.640" style="s2">connecting ahead and hot because we</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.130" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">actually do both together then it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.640" end="00:45:25.230" style="s2">a gray huh we invoke the archetype we</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:27.540" style="s2">take our stand and dear God none that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.230" end="00:45:31.850" style="s2">really really hot</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.540" end="00:45:38.700" style="s2">and really uncertain and scary until</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.850" end="00:45:43.460" style="s2">right until we did this until we walk</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.700" end="00:45:46.920" style="s2">each other home and then then it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.460" end="00:45:48.540" style="s2">like a roving dance party right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.920" end="00:45:49.800" style="s2">we sort of like I&#39;ve been down so god</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.540" end="00:45:51.780" style="s2">damn lot like going down the road</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.800" end="00:45:54.420" style="s2">feeling bad don&#39;t want to be treated</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.780" end="00:45:56.430" style="s2">this way but someone&#39;s singing it</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.420" end="00:46:02.270" style="s2">someone&#39;s dancing it and like oh</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.430" end="00:46:09.120" style="s2">yes this this right the redemption songs</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.270" end="00:46:11.540" style="s2">that lifts us up again and again what</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.120" end="00:46:16.650" style="s2">does I want to know that was that okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.540" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">so the next thing this is tactical but</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.650" end="00:46:23.070" style="s2">the intention of this bit is to advocate</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:24.900" style="s2">moving beyond the binaries because the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.070" end="00:46:27.540" style="s2">binary I&#39;ve experienced and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.900" end="00:46:30.240" style="s2">know maybe nod or whatever if others if</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.540" end="00:46:34.950" style="s2">you have is is the pot the pillar to</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.240" end="00:46:37.980" style="s2">post of is this or go blind</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.950" end="00:46:40.980" style="s2">territory right in which case I should</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.980" end="00:46:43.350" style="s2">change everything in my life I should</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.980" end="00:46:47.460" style="s2">reorganize all of my priorities</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.350" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">effective yesterday or if that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.460" end="00:46:50.430" style="s2">much to wrap my head around</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:52.520" style="s2">there&#39;s too much uncertainty there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.430" end="00:46:56.130" style="s2">much it&#39;s just it&#39;s I&#39;m not there yet</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.520" end="00:46:58.170" style="s2">back to I guess I&#39;m not going to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.130" end="00:47:01.560" style="s2">anything and I&#39;m gonna keep kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.170" end="00:47:04.110" style="s2">going the way yesterday was and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.560" end="00:47:08.280" style="s2">sort of fibrillation and exhaustion and</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.110" end="00:47:09.780" style="s2">confusion defaulting back to the norm is</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.280" end="00:47:11.430" style="s2">where it feels like an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.780" end="00:47:14.010" style="s2">well-intentioned folks are but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.430" end="00:47:15.360" style="s2">free right because every time we do that</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.010" end="00:47:17.610" style="s2">we&#39;re juice to the gills and of</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.360" end="00:47:19.470" style="s2">hyper-vigilance response we have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.610" end="00:47:21.150" style="s2">of urgency we have cortisol we have all</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.470" end="00:47:22.830" style="s2">kinds of things leading us alive and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.150" end="00:47:24.720" style="s2">priming us for the moment and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.830" end="00:47:28.530" style="s2">like stand down but part of us isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.720" end="00:47:29.820" style="s2">really standing down and the algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.530" end="00:47:31.110" style="s2">help they looked on what we&#39;ve clicked</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.820" end="00:47:32.910" style="s2">on they looked on what we double clicked</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.110" end="00:47:35.220" style="s2">in red they just keep saving more</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.910" end="00:47:37.950" style="s2">up that&#39;s all the same right we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.220" end="00:47:41.750" style="s2">get away from it so what I would</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.950" end="00:47:44.510" style="s2">absolutely advocate is the Pareto split</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.750" end="00:47:47.990" style="s2">on taking the next steps it&#39;s too soon</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.510" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">to go all-in on anything right now and</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.990" end="00:47:52.790" style="s2">probably misguided but what we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:56.210" style="s2">absolutely encourage to say do the 20%</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.790" end="00:47:59.500" style="s2">of the things you think you might now</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.210" end="00:48:02.150" style="s2">that will save or protect or preserve</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.500" end="00:48:05.170" style="s2">80% of the things you care about in</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.150" end="00:48:05.170" style="s2">value next</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:11.870" style="s2">that gives us agency that gives us</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.930" end="00:48:14.840" style="s2">forward motion that gives us a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.870" end="00:48:19.190" style="s2">things to do so what might that look</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.840" end="00:48:22.040" style="s2">like and people might say you know back</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.190" end="00:48:23.660" style="s2">to the spiritual sect it&#39;s like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.040" end="00:48:27.200" style="s2">don&#39;t want to bring that kind of fear</p>

<p begin="00:49:43.220" end="00:49:47.500" style="s2">objectives are trashed and you&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.560" end="00:49:50.060" style="s2">to you now how do we get back to</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.500" end="00:49:52.510" style="s2">refilling one of those things as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.060" end="00:49:52.510" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.700" end="00:49:57.869" style="s2">so this is presumably a gathering of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.440" end="00:50:01.710" style="s2">leaders right and one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.869" end="00:50:04.950" style="s2">profound lessons I ever got was from an</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.710" end="00:50:06.270" style="s2">Everest MD so you know base camp dealing</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.950" end="00:50:08.549" style="s2">with all that kind of stuff and he was</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.270" end="00:50:09.420" style="s2">training us as wilderness EMTs which</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.549" end="00:50:11.160" style="s2">said I don&#39;t know what that</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.420" end="00:50:13.950" style="s2">classifications are in the UK but sort</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.160" end="00:50:16.049" style="s2">of a paramedic II kind of thing but also</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.950" end="00:50:17.400" style="s2">for the for the backcountry so not</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.049" end="00:50:19.559" style="s2">dialing 911</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.400" end="00:50:21.359" style="s2">triggering emergency services but you</p>

<p begin="00:50:21.359" end="00:50:25.079" style="s2">out of skis and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.490" end="00:50:26.730" style="s2">and he said and you know it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.079" end="00:50:28.920" style="s2">empowering stuff and I&#39;ll make a case</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.730" end="00:50:31.440" style="s2">for that you know for everyone in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.920" end="00:50:33.000" style="s2">moment but the natural thing is you</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.440" end="00:50:34.020" style="s2">start if you&#39;re practicing your training</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.000" end="00:50:35.700" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of going through real</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.020" end="00:50:37.290" style="s2">scenarios and you&#39;re fishing yeah doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.700" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">doing drills on the mountains or in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.290" end="00:50:41.339" style="s2">river and fishing people out and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.640" end="00:50:43.020" style="s2">feels great like wow I&#39;m beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.339" end="00:50:46.440" style="s2">feel competent right and I&#39;m beginning</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.020" end="00:50:51.299" style="s2">to feel like I can be part of solutions</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.440" end="00:50:53.450" style="s2">and he&#39;s like not so fast not so fast he</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.299" end="00:51:01.319" style="s2">said when you have these skills</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.450" end="00:51:06.920" style="s2">it&#39;s me first me second me third my</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.319" end="00:51:06.920" style="s2">partner&#39;s fourth the victim fifth I</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.980" end="00:51:13.230" style="s2">don&#39;t know what that sounds in</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.230" end="00:51:14.760" style="s2">constantly selfish no I want to go help</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.230" end="00:51:17.579" style="s2">and he&#39;s like now look if you go over</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.760" end="00:51:19.770" style="s2">8,000 Avalanche and you go running in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.579" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">notch I came to see if there&#39;s about to</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.770" end="00:51:22.890" style="s2">be another one that&#39;s coming down on top</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:25.440" style="s2">of that all right</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.890" end="00:51:27.630" style="s2">you have now put yourself in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.440" end="00:51:29.790" style="s2">danger you&#39;re right they&#39;re about to</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.630" end="00:51:31.770" style="s2">become another victim and who has to</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.790" end="00:51:33.900" style="s2">look after that other victim your</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.770" end="00:51:36.930" style="s2">partner&#39;s what happened to all that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.900" end="00:51:40.049" style="s2">knowledge that you had and the victims</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.930" end="00:51:41.549" style="s2">didn&#39;t have gone right if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.049" end="00:51:42.750" style="s2">fireman and you go into a burning</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.549" end="00:51:44.220" style="s2">buildings you haven&#39;t decided you</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.750" end="00:51:45.540" style="s2">haven&#39;t asserted whether the structure</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.220" end="00:51:48.290" style="s2">is stable and isn&#39;t gonna collapse on</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.540" end="00:51:54.540" style="s2">you you are creating additional hazard</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.290" end="00:51:56.069" style="s2">so lose the Cape right and the other the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.540" end="00:51:58.589" style="s2">other just embodied one that came up</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.069" end="00:52:00.180" style="s2">with that is if you&#39;re the most informed</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.589" end="00:52:02.210" style="s2">person in the situation and obviously if</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.180" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">you know somebody&#39;s broke and they fall</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.210" end="00:52:05.990" style="s2">a car accident or a tree or or a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:07.550" style="s2">mountain or whatever you know the one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.990" end="00:52:09.830" style="s2">the first things you do is stabilize the</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.550" end="00:52:12.109" style="s2">head right in case there&#39;s a you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.830" end="00:52:13.550" style="s2">spinal injury so you get there and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.109" end="00:52:16.280" style="s2">stabilize the head the only trouble is</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.550" end="00:52:18.080" style="s2">is that once you&#39;re on the head you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.280" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">never let go until there&#39;s actually on</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.080" end="00:52:22.339" style="s2">the backboard fully strapped down which</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:24.859" style="s2">is often you know an hour or more away</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.339" end="00:52:26.900" style="s2">so if you&#39;re the most experienced person</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.859" end="00:52:29.510" style="s2">you come rushing in and you do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.900" end="00:52:30.800" style="s2">that it&#39;s needed to be done next you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.510" end="00:52:32.270" style="s2">out of the game and you&#39;re down at</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.800" end="00:52:35.240" style="s2">ground level you&#39;ve got no perspective</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.270" end="00:52:39.730" style="s2">and you kind of actually help manage the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.240" end="00:52:43.820" style="s2">incident from the elevation you need to</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.730" end="00:52:47.450" style="s2">so for us right rather than thinking I</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.820" end="00:52:49.400" style="s2">will be a gardener in the war all right</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.450" end="00:52:50.750" style="s2">I think it&#39;s really critical for us to</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.400" end="00:52:53.060" style="s2">take the steps and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.750" end="00:52:59.030" style="s2">literally very simply you know look into</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.060" end="00:53:02.540" style="s2">solar power look into having a well look</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.030" end="00:53:04.220" style="s2">into basic wilderness medical training</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.540" end="00:53:05.630" style="s2">and that&#39;s not because you necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.220" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">plan on living in a bunker in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.630" end="00:53:12.170" style="s2">mountains is to say when emergency</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:14.150" style="s2">medical services go down right we are</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.170" end="00:53:16.310" style="s2">needed and by the way there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.150" end="00:53:19.940" style="s2">single one of these recommendations that</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.310" end="00:53:23.599" style="s2">I&#39;m making now that I didn&#39;t make to our</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.940" end="00:53:26.930" style="s2">students 20 years ago because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.599" end="00:53:30.800" style="s2">simple grown-ass human and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.930" end="00:53:31.099" style="s2">profoundly empowering a ton of fun all</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.800" end="00:53:33.380" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.099" end="00:53:35.240" style="s2">and you can&#39;t lose having done it so</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.380" end="00:53:37.790" style="s2">like what happens if I do the 20% of</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.240" end="00:53:41.900" style="s2">prep and the world just keeps trucking</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.790" end="00:53:44.960" style="s2">on awesome my lights out powered by coal</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.900" end="00:53:47.060" style="s2">fire or nuclear plants right julie has</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.960" end="00:53:49.520" style="s2">saved us thousands of dollars in plastic</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.060" end="00:53:51.589" style="s2">surgery pills and stitches because she</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.520" end="00:53:54.740" style="s2">knows how to patch up her kids in her</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.589" end="00:53:56.630" style="s2">fan and me and herself by you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.740" end="00:53:58.790" style="s2">without going to the doctor the number</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.630" end="00:54:00.560" style="s2">of times that she has helped friends of</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.790" end="00:54:01.730" style="s2">ours or us and then we finally gone to</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.560" end="00:54:03.380" style="s2">the doctor because something was gnarly</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.730" end="00:54:07.010" style="s2">and nothing they&#39;re like oh yeah I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.380" end="00:54:09.950" style="s2">doing that that&#39;s perfect right so just</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.010" end="00:54:11.360" style="s2">and we would have prefect sin a boarding</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.950" end="00:54:12.530" style="s2">school that we used to teach that take</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.360" end="00:54:14.810" style="s2">the wilderness medical training because</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.530" end="00:54:16.960" style="s2">it was the single most psychoactive tool</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.810" end="00:54:20.060" style="s2">to advocate situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.960" end="00:54:21.410" style="s2">antifragility and leadership skills so</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.060" end="00:54:25.460" style="s2">never mind</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.410" end="00:54:27.620" style="s2">using the tools right you have kids</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.460" end="00:54:28.910" style="s2">right how beautiful is it to say I mean</p>

<p begin="00:54:34.190" end="00:54:37.930" style="s2">anything that gives them like a little</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.960" end="00:54:40.970" style="s2">bit more experience in life in the world</p>

<p begin="00:54:47.450" end="00:54:53.890" style="s2">the worst case is you have fresh herbs</p>
