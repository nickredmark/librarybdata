<p begin="00:02:44.019" end="00:02:52.680" style="s2">so we then saw that a theory has to use</p>

<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:51.129" style="s2">mentioned right relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.950" end="00:03:53.049" style="s2">processes have to be multiscale later</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.699" end="00:04:20.680" style="s2">grounded in the participatory but we hit</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.489" end="00:04:25.780" style="s2">a roadblock when I want to now zero in</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.680" end="00:04:27.550" style="s2">on I had been treating them as identical</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.780" end="00:04:29.110" style="s2">but I&#39;m going to then make a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.550" end="00:04:30.669" style="s2">important theoretical distinction</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.110" end="00:04:34.030" style="s2">between a theory of relevance and a</p>

<p begin="00:04:34.030" end="00:04:40.010" style="s2">what I want to argue is that there</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.510" end="00:04:42.140" style="s2">cannot be a theory</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.010" end="00:04:43.820" style="s2">of relevance at least a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.140" end="00:04:45.380" style="s2">theory of relevance and since we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.820" end="00:04:47.870" style="s2">playing in the arena of science</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.380" end="00:04:49.880" style="s2">scientific explanations I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.870" end="00:04:51.890" style="s2">keep doing that qualification I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.880" end="00:04:53.920" style="s2">going to say there cannot be a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.890" end="00:04:59.390" style="s2">relevance scientific theory of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.920" end="00:05:01.640" style="s2">why not well this has to do with an</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.390" end="00:05:04.340" style="s2">issue that was originally brought up by</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.640" end="00:05:06.520" style="s2">chappie and Kukla in an article a</p>

<p begin="00:05:06.520" end="00:05:11.420" style="s2">in Dan Chevy and I have published work</p>

<p begin="00:05:11.420" end="00:05:17.690" style="s2">on a work on telepresence I recommend</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.460" end="00:05:22.490" style="s2">you to take a look at the work of Dan</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.690" end="00:05:26.750" style="s2">Jaffe but they made a point and I think</p>

<p begin="00:05:26.750" end="00:05:32.990" style="s2">a point that goes back to Jas mill but</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.830" end="00:05:34.970" style="s2">you can also see an updated version of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.990" end="00:05:38.050" style="s2">it in the work of the important</p>

<p begin="00:05:38.050" end="00:05:47.480" style="s2">wilfred Quine so this has to do with how</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.330" end="00:05:50.090" style="s2">science works now of course the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.480" end="00:05:51.500" style="s2">philosophy of science tackles all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.090" end="00:05:53.420" style="s2">of controversial claims about what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.500" end="00:05:57.560" style="s2">science and how science works but I take</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.420" end="00:05:59.360" style="s2">it that one thing that is agreed upon in</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.560" end="00:06:04.070" style="s2">science is that science works through</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.360" end="00:06:09.110" style="s2">inductive generalization or it tries to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.070" end="00:06:11.990" style="s2">generate inductive generalizations what</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.110" end="00:06:14.680" style="s2">I mean by that science you study a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.990" end="00:06:17.390" style="s2">of things here and then you make</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.680" end="00:06:20.210" style="s2">predictions and claims that that will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.390" end="00:06:25.520" style="s2">the case for all of that type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.210" end="00:06:28.100" style="s2">so you know here I study a bunch of you</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.520" end="00:06:30.050" style="s2">know he&#39;s a hunk of gold here&#39;s a hunk</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.100" end="00:06:32.420" style="s2">of gold here&#39;s a hunk of gold I come up</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.050" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">with a write a set of features or</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.420" end="00:06:37.490" style="s2">properties does that generalize to all</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:39.320" style="s2">the instances of gold and if it does</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.490" end="00:06:41.000" style="s2">then I come up with an inductive</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.320" end="00:06:44.150" style="s2">generalization I want to get the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.000" end="00:06:48.500" style="s2">broadest possible inductive</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.150" end="00:06:51.130" style="s2">generalizations that I can if that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.500" end="00:06:53.180" style="s2">science works it&#39;s trying to give us a</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.590" end="00:07:01.580" style="s2">trying to give us a way of explaining</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.360" end="00:07:03.979" style="s2">the world I&#39;m not claiming this is I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.580" end="00:07:06.530" style="s2">tried to make it clear this is not meant</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.979" end="00:07:08.509" style="s2">to be an exhaustive account of science</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.530" end="00:07:10.250" style="s2">it&#39;s meant to point to a central</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.509" end="00:07:11.960" style="s2">practice within science but a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.250" end="00:07:13.699" style="s2">constitutive practice nevertheless if</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.960" end="00:07:15.740" style="s2">you can&#39;t generate inductive</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.740" end="00:07:19.190" style="s2">endeavor then you don&#39;t have a science</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.630" end="00:07:21.560" style="s2">this is why pseudoscience is like</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.190" end="00:07:27.190" style="s2">astrology fail but cisely because they</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.560" end="00:07:29.770" style="s2">cannot do inductive generalizations okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.190" end="00:07:32.990" style="s2">you say okay great</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.770" end="00:07:36.199" style="s2">so what jeaious know pointed out is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.990" end="00:07:38.870" style="s2">means that we need what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.199" end="00:07:41.199" style="s2">systemic import and this is so relevant</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.870" end="00:07:43.970" style="s2">to what we were talking about last time</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.199" end="00:07:48.410" style="s2">in fact even using the word import is is</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.970" end="00:07:52.880" style="s2">really relevant what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.410" end="00:07:54.380" style="s2">science has to form categories because</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.880" end="00:07:55.970" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.380" end="00:07:57.080" style="s2">gathering a bunch of things and saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.970" end="00:07:59.510" style="s2">they belong</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.080" end="00:08:02.120" style="s2">they&#39;re the same type of thing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.510" end="00:08:05.110" style="s2">all instances of gold they all belong to</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.120" end="00:08:11.300" style="s2">the category of gold science has to form</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.110" end="00:08:13.520" style="s2">categories that support powerful meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.300" end="00:08:21.949" style="s2">as broad as possible inductive</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.520" end="00:08:27.050" style="s2">generalizations to be able to do that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.949" end="00:08:28.880" style="s2">to have systematic import now what does</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.050" end="00:08:31.060" style="s2">what do I need think about reverse</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.880" end="00:08:34.070" style="s2">engineering this in order if you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.060" end="00:08:36.140" style="s2">reliable you know that&#39;s what powerful</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.070" end="00:08:38.089" style="s2">means reliable and broad inductive</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.140" end="00:08:40.579" style="s2">generalizations in order to have those</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.089" end="00:08:43.339" style="s2">what do I need to be the case here</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.579" end="00:08:48.440" style="s2">well I need I neither to be important</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.339" end="00:08:51.350" style="s2">properties for the that category one</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.440" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">thing is I need the categories to be the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.350" end="00:08:56.260" style="s2">category members to importantly be</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:56.260" style="s2">homogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.560" end="00:09:09.029" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which all the members</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.350" end="00:09:11.230" style="s2">of the category have to share properties</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.029" end="00:09:14.050" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s me indicating they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.230" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">sharing properties all right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.050" end="00:09:19.149" style="s2">because they share properties that I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:22.600" style="s2">make the inductive generalization that</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.149" end="00:09:28.209" style="s2">other instances will also have those</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.600" end="00:09:30.519" style="s2">important properties that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.209" end="00:09:32.589" style="s2">I need because if the members are</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.519" end="00:09:34.600" style="s2">heterogeneous there&#39;s no set of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.589" end="00:09:36.970" style="s2">properties I can then expand in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.600" end="00:09:39.459" style="s2">generalization they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.970" end="00:09:42.279" style="s2">homogeneous now this gets us towards</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.459" end="00:09:44.649" style="s2">something very important right this gets</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.279" end="00:09:46.089" style="s2">us towards a bad idea from Quine because</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.649" end="00:09:49.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of discussion of about</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.089" end="00:09:54.189" style="s2">this word right now in the culture and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.930" end="00:10:00.309" style="s2">think the discussion sort of is too</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.189" end="00:10:03.069" style="s2">polarized and this has to go again with</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.309" end="00:10:07.620" style="s2">an issue made by Vic and Stein but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.069" end="00:10:12.370" style="s2">want to put Vic and Stein and Quine</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.620" end="00:10:15.220" style="s2">together on this very important modern</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.370" end="00:10:17.079" style="s2">philosopher because Vic and Stein and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.220" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">this is what some of the critics of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.079" end="00:10:21.910" style="s2">sense say right because if you remember</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:23.170" style="s2">according to Aristotle and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.910" end="00:10:25.809" style="s2">about this when we talked about eros</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.170" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">tall an essence is a set of necessary</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.809" end="00:10:31.990" style="s2">and sufficient conditions and what Vic</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:33.579" style="s2">and Stein pointed out and remember we</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.990" end="00:10:35.649" style="s2">did this with the example of again that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.579" end="00:10:38.829" style="s2">many of many of our categories don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.649" end="00:10:40.600" style="s2">have essences there is no set of</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.550" end="00:10:52.089" style="s2">only tables so many of our categories</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.500" end="00:10:53.860" style="s2">don&#39;t have essences that was the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.089" end="00:10:56.199" style="s2">constraints point now Vic and Fenton I</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.860" end="00:10:58.720" style="s2">don&#39;t think you could ever pin him to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.199" end="00:11:00.730" style="s2">the claim that no categories have</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:02.920" style="s2">essences and that&#39;s what some people I</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.730" end="00:11:05.259" style="s2">think have concluded that no categories</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.920" end="00:11:10.290" style="s2">have essence essences everything is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.259" end="00:11:12.260" style="s2">nominal description but that&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.290" end="00:11:13.810" style="s2">because of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.260" end="00:11:16.190" style="s2">non-controversial II for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.810" end="00:11:18.860" style="s2">triangles have essences that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.190" end="00:11:20.900" style="s2">Aristotle thought many things did right</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.860" end="00:11:24.770" style="s2">you know if it has three straight sides</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.900" end="00:11:26.810" style="s2">right three angles it&#39;s enclosed it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.770" end="00:11:27.470" style="s2">triangle those that&#39;s an essence to a</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.470" end="00:11:34.130" style="s2">now that&#39;s mathematical here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.010" end="00:11:36.070" style="s2">Quine argued at least I think this is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.130" end="00:11:39.470" style="s2">interpretation of coin that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.070" end="00:11:41.180" style="s2">philosophically defensible science these</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.470" end="00:11:43.430" style="s2">are the things like triangle these are</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.180" end="00:11:46.100" style="s2">deductive essences these are the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.430" end="00:11:48.730" style="s2">essences that we can deduce but what</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.100" end="00:11:50.660" style="s2">science discovers are inductive</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.730" end="00:11:53.810" style="s2">generalizations and if they&#39;re powerful</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.660" end="00:11:57.080" style="s2">enough science gives us the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.810" end="00:12:01.940" style="s2">something the essence of gold is the set</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.080" end="00:12:06.050" style="s2">of properties that will apply to all</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.940" end="00:12:14.030" style="s2">instances of gold all in only instances</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.050" end="00:12:17.810" style="s2">of gold that homogeneous set that can</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.030" end="00:12:23.660" style="s2">generalize is what an inductive essence</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.810" end="00:12:25.520" style="s2">is now what that means is we shouldn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.660" end="00:12:27.620" style="s2">couple of ways of talking in the media</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.520" end="00:12:30.500" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t or the general culture should</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.620" end="00:12:35.540" style="s2">should not be so uncritically accepted</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.500" end="00:12:39.520" style="s2">right essentialism isn&#39;t bad for things</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.540" end="00:12:43.190" style="s2">that have essences why would it be</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.520" end="00:12:46.100" style="s2">essentialism is the is the mistake of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.190" end="00:12:50.480" style="s2">treating a category as as if it has an</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.100" end="00:12:55.400" style="s2">essence it is a mistake for things like</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.480" end="00:12:57.950" style="s2">games and tables precisely because they</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.400" end="00:13:04.190" style="s2">don&#39;t have an essence it is not a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.950" end="00:13:06.860" style="s2">mistake for things like gold because</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.190" end="00:13:08.930" style="s2">gold has an essence inductively or</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.860" end="00:13:11.030" style="s2">triangle because triangles have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.930" end="00:13:14.180" style="s2">deductive essence that trick it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.030" end="00:13:16.040" style="s2">too simplistic to say everything has an</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.180" end="00:13:19.190" style="s2">essence or everything doesn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.040" end="00:13:21.890" style="s2">essence now it cuts both ways it cuts</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.190" end="00:13:23.750" style="s2">both ways right there are many things</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.890" end="00:13:25.720" style="s2">that don&#39;t have essences that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:45.670" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">means it is possible to do a science</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.870" end="00:13:54.580" style="s2">when we do what when we categorize</p>

<p begin="00:13:54.580" end="00:14:05.170" style="s2">because if we get this then we have the</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.580" end="00:15:35.470" style="s2">thing okay what do I learn about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.190" end="00:15:38.830" style="s2">other than own nothing other than its</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.470" end="00:15:42.070" style="s2">white is there any other important</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.830" end="00:15:43.900" style="s2">No Wow no uh-uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.070" end="00:15:47.320" style="s2">well you they&#39;re both flat but this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.900" end="00:15:55.170" style="s2">vertical this is horizontal you see it</p>

<p begin="00:15:55.650" end="00:16:03.940" style="s2">so it is correct to say that there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.010" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">many categories that we form for which</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.940" end="00:16:07.570" style="s2">we could not generate a scientific</p>

<p begin="00:16:07.570" end="00:16:13.090" style="s2">precisely because those categories are</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.630" end="00:16:14.500" style="s2">not homogeneous they don&#39;t have in</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.090" end="00:16:16.570" style="s2">essence now notice what that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.500" end="00:16:18.670" style="s2">mean the fact that I can&#39;t have a</p>

<p begin="00:16:18.670" end="00:16:23.500" style="s2">that white things are made out of ghosts</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.290" end="00:16:27.010" style="s2">or dead elves or ectoplasmic goo it</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.500" end="00:16:31.120" style="s2">licenses no metaphysical weirdness it</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.010" end="00:16:33.160" style="s2">just says that category functions in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.120" end="00:16:35.110" style="s2">sense that I can make true statements</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.160" end="00:16:39.760" style="s2">about its membership but it does not</p>

<p begin="00:16:47.640" end="00:16:55.350" style="s2">well let&#39;s compare right the white</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.590" end="00:18:02.460" style="s2">this to be a pun I need the category</p>

<p begin="00:18:53.789" end="00:18:59.730" style="s2">now we use that term to describe a</p>

<p begin="00:19:20.960" end="00:19:29.670" style="s2">we need the properties of the objects to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.010" end="00:19:34.200" style="s2">in some sense be intrinsic or at least</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.670" end="00:19:39.240" style="s2">internal inherent this also comes from</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.200" end="00:19:42.900" style="s2">an argument by John Searle many objects</p>

<p begin="00:19:56.970" end="00:20:03.060" style="s2">being money now here&#39;s again is money</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.060" end="00:20:07.220" style="s2">around money so in that sense it seems</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.160" end="00:20:09.660" style="s2">to be real but does anything</p>

<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:47.310" style="s2">you have to remember is that many things</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:50.360" style="s2">that we think are intrinsic are actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.310" end="00:20:54.030" style="s2">attributed this being a bottle is</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.770" end="00:23:23.789" style="s2">yes can I do a science of events that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.279" end="00:23:28.529" style="s2">happen on Tuesday no I can&#39;t because it</p>

<p begin="00:23:28.529" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">mean that Tuesday is made out of right</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.659" end="00:23:40.600" style="s2">ectoplasmic goo tuesday events actually</p>

<p begin="00:23:57.940" end="00:24:03.850" style="s2">is what we learn from Vic and Stein have</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.720" end="00:24:24.309" style="s2">show you is that relevance does not have</p>

<p begin="00:25:07.950" end="00:25:14.139" style="s2">what about stable so when I find</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.279" end="00:25:16.120" style="s2">something relevant do I always find it</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.139" end="00:25:18.370" style="s2">relevant this is relevant to me now will</p>

<p begin="00:25:27.700" end="00:25:38.919" style="s2">there&#39;s things that are always relevant</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.929" end="00:25:41.350" style="s2">to you always alright don&#39;t know very</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.919" end="00:25:45.159" style="s2">hard to find them</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.350" end="00:25:51.100" style="s2">and it&#39;s what if maybe maybe oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.159" end="00:25:54.130" style="s2">maybe but that&#39;s only relevant to me if</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.100" end="00:25:58.000" style="s2">I want to keep living a person who</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.130" end="00:26:00.070" style="s2">commits suicide and some people commit</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.070" end="00:26:11.049" style="s2">themselves to death because that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.120" end="00:26:14.139" style="s2">more important to them than oxygen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.049" end="00:26:16.360" style="s2">not stable it&#39;s relevant and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.139" end="00:26:17.620" style="s2">where I think we&#39;ll get into some</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.620" end="00:26:22.659" style="s2">but it&#39;s relevant like internal or</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.990" end="00:26:25.179" style="s2">intrinsic to the object is there a way</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.659" end="00:26:28.659" style="s2">of like oh like if there never been</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.179" end="00:26:33.220" style="s2">human beings or sentient beings it would</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.659" end="00:26:36.129" style="s2">it could this have relevance doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.220" end="00:26:40.090" style="s2">seem that that&#39;s at all a plausible</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.129" end="00:26:45.120" style="s2">intuition relevance always seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.090" end="00:26:47.169" style="s2">relevant to some one or some thing and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.120" end="00:26:48.909" style="s2">that of course I think is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.169" end="00:26:53.370" style="s2">bound up that relevance ultimately has</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.909" end="00:26:56.649" style="s2">to be relevant to and autopoietic thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.370" end="00:26:59.139" style="s2">only things that have needs only things</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.649" end="00:27:00.460" style="s2">that are self organized because so that</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.139" end="00:27:01.899" style="s2">they have the constitutive goal of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.460" end="00:27:04.659" style="s2">preserving their self organization</p>

<p begin="00:27:04.659" end="00:27:08.950" style="s2">because I am self organized to preserve</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.149" end="00:27:13.379" style="s2">my own self organization which means I</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.379" end="00:27:20.590" style="s2">literally matters to me it&#39;s hard to see</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.309" end="00:27:22.899" style="s2">how things could be relevant unless they</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.590" end="00:27:29.409" style="s2">were in relationship to an autopoietic</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.899" end="00:27:33.610" style="s2">thing relevance is not something for</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.409" end="00:27:35.769" style="s2">which we can have a scientific theory I</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.610" end="00:27:38.950" style="s2">want you to notice what&#39;s come along the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.769" end="00:27:44.860" style="s2">way relevance is not intrinsic to</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.950" end="00:27:46.830" style="s2">something there can be no essence to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.860" end="00:27:52.139" style="s2">relevance</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.830" end="00:27:52.139" style="s2">nothing is essentially relevant</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.230" end="00:28:04.869" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole point about talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.330" end="00:28:08.769" style="s2">about the problem of essentialism and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.869" end="00:28:18.730" style="s2">relevance is not stable it&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.769" end="00:28:22.119" style="s2">changing ok so what do we do well first</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.730" end="00:28:24.009" style="s2">of all we add to our theory so a set of</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.119" end="00:28:28.450" style="s2">criteria we need for a good theory our</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.009" end="00:28:31.359" style="s2">theory of relevance realization can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.450" end="00:28:34.419" style="s2">a theory of relevance detection I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.359" end="00:28:37.330" style="s2">given you a sustained argument for that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.419" end="00:28:39.759" style="s2">it is not this is not how relevance</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.330" end="00:28:42.220" style="s2">works relevance realizes it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.759" end="00:28:48.580" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it&#39;s not this has</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.220" end="00:28:49.749" style="s2">relevance and I detect its relevance now</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.580" end="00:28:53.200" style="s2">you might say well maybe relevance</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.749" end="00:28:54.999" style="s2">realization is just projective I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.200" end="00:29:00.279" style="s2">reply to that too I think that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.999" end="00:29:01.690" style="s2">inadequate in order to see how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.279" end="00:29:04.779" style="s2">inadequate and in order to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.690" end="00:29:07.570" style="s2">the bind we seem to be getting in I want</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.779" end="00:29:09.399" style="s2">to open up the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.570" end="00:29:10.869" style="s2">relevant a theory of relevance and a</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.399" end="00:29:14.619" style="s2">theory relevance realization with an</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.869" end="00:29:21.609" style="s2">analogy and it&#39;s going to turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.619" end="00:29:23.259" style="s2">a very I hope helpful analogy and this</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.609" end="00:29:25.029" style="s2">will also I think to help us to see why</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.259" end="00:29:28.480" style="s2">relevance is not something we merely</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.029" end="00:29:30.159" style="s2">project on the world this is why I have</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.480" end="00:29:32.440" style="s2">a sustained criticism against both the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.159" end="00:29:36.429" style="s2">empiricist we just detect it and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.440" end="00:29:37.090" style="s2">Romantics we just project it so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.429" end="00:29:40.139" style="s2">get into that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.090" end="00:29:43.029" style="s2">what&#39;s the analogy that will help</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.139" end="00:29:44.980" style="s2">develop me a develop an argument to show</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.029" end="00:29:47.289" style="s2">why we needed to merely detect it</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.980" end="00:29:48.820" style="s2">morally merely project it and get us out</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.289" end="00:29:53.859" style="s2">of the barn that we can&#39;t have a theory</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.820" end="00:29:56.529" style="s2">of relevance okay notice a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.859" end="00:29:59.830" style="s2">important and I think this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.529" end="00:30:00.940" style="s2">central insights of Darwin right and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.830" end="00:30:04.290" style="s2">talked about Darwin when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.940" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">Aristotle and dynamical systems so</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.290" end="00:30:08.070" style="s2">if you need to please go back and look</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:09.330" style="s2">again at video six like I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.070" end="00:30:09.990" style="s2">repeat all those arguments right now we</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.330" end="00:30:14.340" style="s2">built them</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.990" end="00:30:16.740" style="s2">so that we can use them now see before</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.340" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">Darwin&#39;s time the people studying the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.740" end="00:30:19.980" style="s2">natural world were often clergymen</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.240" end="00:30:24.990" style="s2">Darwin himself was thinking about going</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.980" end="00:30:27.450" style="s2">into clergy and that&#39;s because people</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.990" end="00:30:31.080" style="s2">thought if they studied the natural</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.450" end="00:30:34.520" style="s2">world they could understand right the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.080" end="00:30:36.960" style="s2">essence of how things were designed</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.520" end="00:30:38.670" style="s2">because if we could get at the essence</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.960" end="00:30:43.670" style="s2">of how things were designed how things</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.670" end="00:30:43.670" style="s2">were sort of fitted to their environment</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.120" end="00:30:50.130" style="s2">then of course that would give us some</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.790" end="00:30:52.260" style="s2">deep insight into the mind of God that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.130" end="00:31:00.840" style="s2">why clergymen are you know collecting</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.260" end="00:31:02.340" style="s2">species and doing all this but I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.840" end="00:31:06.570" style="s2">one of the insights and it&#39;s not given</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.340" end="00:31:08.310" style="s2">enough attention in the analysis of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.570" end="00:31:12.180" style="s2">brilliance of Darwin&#39;s theory is to</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.310" end="00:31:16.110" style="s2">realize that things don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.180" end="00:31:23.550" style="s2">essential design there is no essential</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.110" end="00:31:26.070" style="s2">design so consider the notion of</p>

<p begin="00:31:26.070" end="00:31:29.190" style="s2">problem there&#39;s there&#39;s a technical</p>

<p begin="00:31:42.510" end="00:31:47.700" style="s2">to to propagate and and exist so if we</p>

<p begin="00:31:47.700" end="00:31:52.950" style="s2">fitness then I need or I&#39;ll be talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.250" end="00:31:55.080" style="s2">about fitness and what I mean by fitted</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.950" end="00:31:56.880" style="s2">missus what is it about the organism</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.080" end="00:31:58.890" style="s2">that makes it fit what is it about the</p>

<p begin="00:34:54.440" end="00:35:04.820" style="s2">a feedback cycle in reproduction there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.540" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">and again even when I say that you have</p>

<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:05.300" style="s2">key means is there was no fitted miss</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.560" end="00:36:07.250" style="s2">and then there was evolution and it</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.300" end="00:36:09.260" style="s2">resulted in fitness that is not what</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.590" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">tells us something that we need first of</p>

<p begin="00:41:26.539" end="00:41:36.779" style="s2">well what kind of properties are we</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.109" end="00:41:40.020" style="s2">talking about then well we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.779" end="00:41:43.079" style="s2">about and this again is too deeply</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.020" end="00:41:47.359" style="s2">analogous to the Darwinian picture we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.079" end="00:41:47.359" style="s2">talking about bio economical properties</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.910" end="00:41:57.529" style="s2">and what do I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:42:00.329" style="s2">think again of your biology as economic</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.529" end="00:42:04.319" style="s2">this is again part of Darwin&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.329" end="00:42:06.059" style="s2">insight now you know don&#39;t be confused</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.319" end="00:42:09.299" style="s2">here when a lot of times when people</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.059" end="00:42:12.240" style="s2">hear economic they hear financial</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.299" end="00:42:15.000" style="s2">economy that&#39;s not what an economy is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:17.819" style="s2">economy is a self-organization a</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.000" end="00:42:21.900" style="s2">self-organizing system that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.819" end="00:42:26.549" style="s2">constantly dealing with the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.900" end="00:42:30.420" style="s2">of goods and services the the allocation</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.549" end="00:42:32.760" style="s2">and use of resources often in order to</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.420" end="00:42:35.970" style="s2">further maintain and develop that</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.760" end="00:42:39.079" style="s2">economy so your body is a bio economy</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.970" end="00:42:44.369" style="s2">you have valuable resources of time</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.079" end="00:42:46.200" style="s2">metabolic energy processing power think</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.369" end="00:42:52.650" style="s2">about how we say we pay attention by the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.200" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">way processing power and you write what</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.650" end="00:42:59.750" style="s2">what what you do as an auto poetic thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:43:05.039" style="s2">is you are organized such that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.750" end="00:43:06.569" style="s2">distribution of those resources so</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.039" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">the constitutive gold it will serve</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.569" end="00:43:11.069" style="s2">other goals of course but it serves the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:13.140" style="s2">constitutive goal of preserving the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.069" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">Bioeconomy itself and the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.140" end="00:43:19.109" style="s2">economies right of course is their self</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:21.569" style="s2">organizing economic properties are right</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.109" end="00:43:24.349" style="s2">your bio they&#39;re part of they come out</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.569" end="00:43:27.569" style="s2">of their biology right they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.349" end="00:43:29.669" style="s2">semantic or syntactic properties now we</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.569" end="00:43:31.109" style="s2">use semantic and syntactic terms to talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.669" end="00:43:34.349" style="s2">about them blah blah blah let&#39;s not keep</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.109" end="00:43:37.949" style="s2">making the confusion okay they are multi</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.349" end="00:43:40.229" style="s2">scale C economies work locally and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.949" end="00:43:45.689" style="s2">globally simultaneously bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.229" end="00:43:47.249" style="s2">top-down so Bonnell economic properties</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.689" end="00:43:49.109" style="s2">are great and that&#39;s good because that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.249" end="00:43:51.299" style="s2">that comports well with the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.109" end="00:43:55.499" style="s2">because Darwin&#39;s theory is ultimately a</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.299" end="00:43:59.759" style="s2">bio economic theory so can we think</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.499" end="00:44:05.489" style="s2">about what kind of norms are at work in</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.759" end="00:44:07.919" style="s2">a bio economy okay so here right where</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.489" end="00:44:13.559" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with norms ultimately of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.919" end="00:44:15.269" style="s2">truth right here we&#39;re dealing probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.559" end="00:44:17.549" style="s2">with norms of validity at least formal</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.269" end="00:44:20.159" style="s2">validity in some way when we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.549" end="00:44:25.049" style="s2">we&#39;re not dealing with these kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:44:25.049" end="00:44:33.509" style="s2">governed by logistical norms or at least</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.959" end="00:44:35.369" style="s2">regulated by logistical norms I want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.509" end="00:44:37.880" style="s2">try and use the word governing for</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.289" end="00:44:45.239" style="s2">sometimes flip economies are regulated</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.779" end="00:44:48.809" style="s2">by logistical norms Logistics is the</p>

<p begin="00:44:48.809" end="00:44:52.679" style="s2">of your resources so if you&#39;re doing a</p>

<p begin="00:44:52.679" end="00:44:57.239" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to figure out I have my</p>

<p begin="00:44:57.239" end="00:45:03.630" style="s2">ammo and personnel and time and space</p>

<p begin="00:45:03.630" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">goals I need to achieve so what are</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.150" end="00:45:13.819" style="s2">logistical norms well logistical norms</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.640" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">are things like efficiency right and</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.819" end="00:45:19.470" style="s2">resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:21.630" style="s2">efficiency and resiliency now resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.470" end="00:45:24.090" style="s2">it will we&#39;ll talk about more in each</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.630" end="00:45:28.530" style="s2">detail a way of thinking about these is</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.090" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">resiliency is basically long term</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.530" end="00:45:34.740" style="s2">broadly applying efficiency but instead</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:36.060" style="s2">of using efficiency and efficiency which</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.740" end="00:45:42.390" style="s2">is confusing we&#39;ll talk about efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.060" end="00:45:45.300" style="s2">and resiliency so what if that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.390" end="00:45:50.180" style="s2">let&#39;s go step by step is very right</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.300" end="00:45:53.310" style="s2">what if relevance realization is this</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.180" end="00:45:55.800" style="s2">ongoing evolution of our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.310" end="00:45:59.880" style="s2">interactional fitted Ness that there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.800" end="00:46:01.500" style="s2">some virtual engine that is regulating</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.880" end="00:46:04.590" style="s2">the sensory motor loop and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.500" end="00:46:07.050" style="s2">regulating it by regulating the</p>

<p begin="00:46:09.510" end="00:46:15.830" style="s2">like efficiency and resilience okay now</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.170" end="00:46:18.540" style="s2">all of this of course right can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.830" end="00:46:21.150" style="s2">described scientifically mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.540" end="00:46:23.730" style="s2">etc because of course darwin&#39;s theory is</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.150" end="00:46:28.260" style="s2">a scientific theory right we we can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.730" end="00:46:31.020" style="s2">calculations on these things etc one</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.260" end="00:46:33.330" style="s2">more time the fact that I use science to</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.020" end="00:46:36.660" style="s2">talk about it does not mean that it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.330" end="00:46:38.640" style="s2">that it exemplifies propositional</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.660" end="00:46:40.140" style="s2">properties my properties of my theory</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.640" end="00:46:45.030" style="s2">and the properties that my theory is</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.140" end="00:46:46.320" style="s2">about are not the same thing what kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.030" end="00:46:47.850" style="s2">of relationship how do we put this</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.320" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">notion of self-organization in this</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.850" end="00:46:55.320" style="s2">notion of the logistical norms governing</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.680" end="00:46:59.670" style="s2">the Bioeconomy together okay so one way</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.320" end="00:47:02.880" style="s2">of doing this is to think about a multi</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.670" end="00:47:06.060" style="s2">scalar way in which your bio economy is</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.880" end="00:47:08.460" style="s2">organized to function a multi scalar way</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.060" end="00:47:11.490" style="s2">many scales of analysis there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.460" end="00:47:19.020" style="s2">which your bio economy is organized to</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.490" end="00:47:22.590" style="s2">function ok let&#39;s take your autonomic</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.020" end="00:47:24.990" style="s2">nervous system as an example this is not</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.590" end="00:47:29.400" style="s2">exhaustive in fact my point is you will</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.990" end="00:47:30.640" style="s2">find this strategy this design at many</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.400" end="00:47:32.710" style="s2">levels of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:38.829" style="s2">in your biology I&#39;m only using this as</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.710" end="00:47:40.630" style="s2">an example so your autonomous nervous</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.829" end="00:47:41.859" style="s2">system okay so this is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.630" end="00:47:43.930" style="s2">nervous this is your part of your</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.859" end="00:47:47.710" style="s2">nervous system that is responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.930" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">your level of arousal right that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.710" end="00:47:52.089" style="s2">mean sexual arousal the Ruhr also means</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:54.549" style="s2">how and notice how this is logistical</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.089" end="00:47:56.650" style="s2">how much your metabolic resources are</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.549" end="00:47:59.859" style="s2">being converted into the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.650" end="00:48:01.299" style="s2">action interaction so you have a very</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.859" end="00:48:02.500" style="s2">low level of arousal when you&#39;re falling</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.299" end="00:48:04.569" style="s2">asleep you have a very high level</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.500" end="00:48:11.650" style="s2">overall so when you&#39;re running away from</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.569" end="00:48:14.289" style="s2">a tiger okay now think about this you</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.650" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">need your level of a ramp there is no</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.289" end="00:48:19.829" style="s2">final perfect design on your level of</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">arousal there is nothing you should</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.829" end="00:48:24.940" style="s2">there&#39;s there isn&#39;t a level that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.200" end="00:48:27.220" style="s2">should always shoot for you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.940" end="00:48:30.220" style="s2">maximize your level of arousal but</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.220" end="00:48:32.740" style="s2">always ah that&#39;s not good I&#39;m never</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.220" end="00:48:35.019" style="s2">gonna sleep I&#39;m never gonna heal right</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.740" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">if I&#39;m just like always okay that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.019" end="00:48:40.269" style="s2">going to sleep that&#39;s not good and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:42.940" style="s2">Canadian solution well I&#39;ll always have</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.269" end="00:48:44.380" style="s2">a middling level of arousal that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.940" end="00:48:47.650" style="s2">good either because I can&#39;t fall asleep</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.380" end="00:48:51.220" style="s2">and I can&#39;t run away from the tiger so</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.650" end="00:48:55.240" style="s2">what what is your autonomic nervous</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.220" end="00:48:57.789" style="s2">system - well your autonomic nervous</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.240" end="00:49:03.549" style="s2">system is divided into two components</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.789" end="00:49:06.000" style="s2">right there is your sympathetic and your</p>

<p begin="00:49:09.340" end="00:49:17.830" style="s2">so yes your sympathetic system is right</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.030" end="00:49:20.230" style="s2">it&#39;s designed it&#39;s really biased it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.830" end="00:49:23.770" style="s2">designed towards interpreting the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.230" end="00:49:25.450" style="s2">in a way it&#39;s biased notice what I said</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.770" end="00:49:27.100" style="s2">remember the things that make us</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.450" end="00:49:30.010" style="s2">adaptive also make us susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.100" end="00:49:33.220" style="s2">self-deception it&#39;s biased all right</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.010" end="00:49:35.620" style="s2">because right you can&#39;t can look at all</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.220" end="00:49:38.290" style="s2">of the evidence it&#39;s biased into looking</p>

<p begin="00:50:35.160" end="00:50:40.020" style="s2">system is always trying to arouse you</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.500" end="00:50:42.300" style="s2">this is this hand pulling up and that</p>

<p begin="00:50:56.250" end="00:51:01.440" style="s2">you have opponent processing the</p>

<p begin="00:51:22.530" end="00:51:27.540" style="s2">this before opponent processing is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.450" end="00:51:29.160" style="s2">powerful way to get optimization and</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.540" end="00:51:30.930" style="s2">when we talked about optimization when</p>

<p begin="00:51:52.740" end="00:52:04.410" style="s2">would argue is by thinking about how the</p>

<p begin="00:52:58.430" end="00:53:02.210" style="s2">is it makes everything sound like an</p>

<p begin="00:53:05.660" end="00:53:11.089" style="s2">course that&#39;s not the case so bear with</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.720" end="00:53:12.650" style="s2">me about this all right I have to speak</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.089" end="00:53:16.720" style="s2">anthropomorphic leave just because</p>

<p begin="00:53:17.289" end="00:53:28.730" style="s2">but right let&#39;s use a financial analogy</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:31.549" style="s2">to understand the trade-off relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.730" end="00:53:34.789" style="s2">between efficiency and resiliency not</p>

<p begin="00:53:43.369" end="00:53:49.099" style="s2">using a financial analogy or at least a</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.930" end="00:53:49.849" style="s2">commercial analogy perhaps as a better</p>

<p begin="00:53:49.849" end="00:53:55.760" style="s2">in order to try and get some</p>

<p begin="00:53:55.760" end="00:54:04.490" style="s2">tradeoff relationship so you have you</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.369" end="00:54:05.900" style="s2">have a business one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.490" end="00:54:08.900" style="s2">might do is you might try to make your</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.900" end="00:54:11.270" style="s2">business more efficient because ceteris</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.900" end="00:54:13.460" style="s2">paribus if your business is more</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.270" end="00:54:15.260" style="s2">efficient than that person&#39;s business</p>

<p begin="00:54:16.849" end="00:54:23.119" style="s2">die off obviously the analogy to</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.579" end="00:54:28.420" style="s2">evolution so what do I do what I do is I</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.119" end="00:54:33.349" style="s2">try to maximize the ratio between right</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.420" end="00:54:36.140" style="s2">profit and expenditure cost how do I do</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.349" end="00:54:37.549" style="s2">that well we did it we keep thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.140" end="00:54:38.960" style="s2">it as the magical solution but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.549" end="00:54:41.420" style="s2">been doing it since Ronald Reagan at</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.960" end="00:54:43.670" style="s2">least we do massive downsizing we fire</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.420" end="00:54:45.460" style="s2">as many people as we can in our business</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.670" end="00:54:50.560" style="s2">and that way well</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.460" end="00:54:53.349" style="s2">we have right is we have the most profit</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.560" end="00:54:57.430" style="s2">for the least labor cost that&#39;s surely</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.349" end="00:54:58.420" style="s2">the answer right so notice what</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.430" end="00:55:00.820" style="s2">efficiency is doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.420" end="00:55:07.300" style="s2">notice how efficiency is a selective</p>
