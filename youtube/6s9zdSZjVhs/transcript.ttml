<p begin="00:00:05.460" end="00:00:10.110" style="s2">so much for making time to for us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.919" end="00:00:12.570" style="s2">speak we&#39;ve known each other for quite</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.110" end="00:00:15.089" style="s2">some time now but it&#39;s it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.570" end="00:00:16.770" style="s2">opportunity to have this conversation on</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.089" end="00:00:21.330" style="s2">the occasion of your wonderful book</p>

<p begin="00:00:29.279" end="00:00:33.630" style="s2">on climate change has just ended and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.500" end="00:00:37.980" style="s2">think we&#39;re all desperately disappointed</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.630" end="00:00:39.390" style="s2">that not very much has happened and in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.980" end="00:00:41.399" style="s2">way it&#39;s surprising because we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.390" end="00:00:45.090" style="s2">be disappointed with it anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.399" end="00:00:47.309" style="s2">after 25 years of nothing happening one</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.090" end="00:00:50.850" style="s2">would expect exactly that but I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.309" end="00:00:52.289" style="s2">love you your view on tomate extent</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.850" end="00:00:55.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve been following what&#39;s been going</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.289" end="00:00:58.910" style="s2">on and and how you see where we got to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.800" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">at the end of this 25th conference</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.910" end="00:01:06.990" style="s2">well I&#39;m I&#39;ve been saying for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:09.810" style="s2">while that if we don&#39;t help people to</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.990" end="00:01:10.350" style="s2">focus on the necessity for economic</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.810" end="00:01:14.280" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.350" end="00:01:16.830" style="s2">I think we&#39;re doomed I am talking to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.280" end="00:01:20.490" style="s2">leaders in the business world and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.830" end="00:01:25.049" style="s2">government who believe that they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.490" end="00:01:28.020" style="s2">growing the economy for the voter when</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:32.250" style="s2">they&#39;re actually growing it for a global</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.020" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">casino economy and most people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.250" end="00:01:37.380" style="s2">actually becoming poorer in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">that they&#39;re actually having to work</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.380" end="00:01:44.939" style="s2">harder and longer just to stay in place</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">and as people feel squeezed economically</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.939" end="00:01:51.090" style="s2">and increasingly insecure about their</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:55.369" style="s2">identity about the future about their</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.090" end="00:01:57.869" style="s2">pension about their children&#39;s future</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.369" end="00:02:01.619" style="s2">unfortunately many people are voting for</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.869" end="00:02:03.390" style="s2">the leaders that stand up and say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.619" end="00:02:06.360" style="s2">going to grow the economy</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:08.069" style="s2">forget about climate forget about this</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.360" end="00:02:09.629" style="s2">forget about the poor we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.069" end="00:02:12.140" style="s2">grow their time that we&#39;re going to grow</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.629" end="00:02:16.550" style="s2">the economy make your nation</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.140" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">make you rich so I&#39;m seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.550" end="00:02:24.200" style="s2">frightening swing to the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:26.690" style="s2">worldwide I&#39;m seeing leaders who as I</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.200" end="00:02:29.600" style="s2">say actually believe that they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.690" end="00:02:31.910" style="s2">pressured by the voter to grow the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.600" end="00:02:34.850" style="s2">economy as I see it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.910" end="00:02:38.360" style="s2">both governments and the average citizen</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.850" end="00:02:42.380" style="s2">are being pressured by deregulated</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.360" end="00:02:46.550" style="s2">capital a deregulated casino economy</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.380" end="00:02:49.520" style="s2">that is pushing more and more and with</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.550" end="00:02:53.810" style="s2">bigger and bigger sums of money in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.520" end="00:02:57.860" style="s2">direction of highly energy intensive</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.810" end="00:03:00.860" style="s2">resource intensive growth so to me you</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.860" end="00:03:03.410" style="s2">know it&#39;s about waking up to the need</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.860" end="00:03:05.540" style="s2">for a new economy movement and waking up</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.410" end="00:03:08.060" style="s2">to the fact that it is happening there</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.540" end="00:03:12.440" style="s2">is a new economy movement emerging which</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.060" end="00:03:14.989" style="s2">I feel extremely hopeful about and very</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.440" end="00:03:18.829" style="s2">happy to be a part of and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.989" end="00:03:20.810" style="s2">I&#39;m encouraging people to engage at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.829" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">local level to strengthen local</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.810" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">economies particularly around basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:27.410" style="s2">needs and that&#39;s also a phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:30.590" style="s2">that&#39;s growing very rapidly so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.410" end="00:03:33.560" style="s2">feel as depressed and unhappy about</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.590" end="00:03:36.920" style="s2">Madrid as as other people do I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.560" end="00:03:40.579" style="s2">you&#39;ve been one of the early voices to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.920" end="00:03:43.310" style="s2">say let&#39;s not get distracted</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.579" end="00:03:46.070" style="s2">with all the other issues if we have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.310" end="00:03:49.190" style="s2">structurally dysfunctional economic</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.070" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">system that is set up in a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.190" end="00:03:56.269" style="s2">will transfer money from most of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:04:00.310" style="s2">humanity to an ever-smaller ever richer</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.269" end="00:04:03.290" style="s2">group of very few and is structurally</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.310" end="00:04:05.570" style="s2">designed in such a way that it needs</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.290" end="00:04:09.890" style="s2">losers in order to generate these very</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.570" end="00:04:11.720" style="s2">few winners we we are making a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.890" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">and we&#39;re getting distracted if we look</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.720" end="00:04:16.190" style="s2">at all the symptomatic outcomes like</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:19.669" style="s2">climate change ecosystems collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.190" end="00:04:22.610" style="s2">so social inequality rise of right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.669" end="00:04:25.190" style="s2">extremism all of that are ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.610" end="00:04:25.560" style="s2">symptoms of an underlying disease which</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.190" end="00:04:29.070" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.560" end="00:04:31.560" style="s2">a dysfunctional economic system and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.070" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">certainly for me 20 years ago you were</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.560" end="00:04:35.580" style="s2">one of the first voices with whom I</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:37.050" style="s2">could have not just read the books but</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.580" end="00:04:40.500" style="s2">have a wonderful conversation when I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.050" end="00:04:43.860" style="s2">a Jew maha um but what what I sense is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.500" end="00:04:46.050" style="s2">that that conversation is much more</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.860" end="00:04:48.300" style="s2">mainstream now than it was 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.050" end="00:04:50.730" style="s2">and even in a much more mainstream than</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.300" end="00:04:53.070" style="s2">it was only five years ago like when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.730" end="00:04:54.630" style="s2">when I read like you&#39;re also involved</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.070" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">with Gaia education in the global eco</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.630" end="00:05:00.030" style="s2">village Network and when the education</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:05:02.840" style="s2">first put out the online curriculum and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.030" end="00:05:05.700" style="s2">you you helped to write some of it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.840" end="00:05:07.590" style="s2">that was really radical people like to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.700" end="00:05:09.300" style="s2">say we have a dysfunctional economic</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.590" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">system and really it&#39;s all this growth</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.300" end="00:05:13.650" style="s2">imperative that is underlying all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">problems we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.650" end="00:05:19.229" style="s2">um people were saying that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:23.010" style="s2">bit of an extremist curriculum but but</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.229" end="00:05:25.410" style="s2">now I hear people even in the IMF under</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.010" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">saying that the economic system is</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.410" end="00:05:29.430" style="s2">disrupt even the the founder of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:32.490" style="s2">World Economic Forum says we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.430" end="00:05:36.479" style="s2">fundamentally redesign capitalism and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.490" end="00:05:38.760" style="s2">how do you see that Square out there on</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.479" end="00:05:40.500" style="s2">the one hand yes you get some countries</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.760" end="00:05:43.919" style="s2">like the current American leadership</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.500" end="00:05:45.600" style="s2">still driving for unbridled economic</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.919" end="00:05:47.190" style="s2">growth but I feel more and more</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.600" end="00:05:50.640" style="s2">countries are starting to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.190" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">different language well I feel there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.640" end="00:05:55.229" style="s2">definitely more leaders and just</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:59.130" style="s2">recently also from Iceland Scotland and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.229" end="00:06:02.160" style="s2">New Zealand them so there is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.130" end="00:06:04.740" style="s2">absolutely at every level from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:08.220" style="s2">environmental movement social movements</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.740" end="00:06:11.580" style="s2">to government level and at the business</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.220" end="00:06:14.370" style="s2">level a recognition something has to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.580" end="00:06:16.440" style="s2">change I think there is still at the top</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.370" end="00:06:19.710" style="s2">the higher of people the power ladder</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.440" end="00:06:22.639" style="s2">and the bigger and fatter salaries that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.710" end="00:06:26.940" style="s2">people have the more power they have</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">they are not only hampered by what many</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.940" end="00:06:33.690" style="s2">people will think of almost as some kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:35.400" style="s2">of you know psychopathic tendencies and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.690" end="00:06:38.030" style="s2">that that&#39;s how they got into place I</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.400" end="00:06:40.640" style="s2">don&#39;t see that at all but what I say is</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.030" end="00:06:43.780" style="s2">that as you go up the power ladder you</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.640" end="00:06:46.960" style="s2">become more and more dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.780" end="00:06:50.390" style="s2">secondhand third-hand quantified</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:54.050" style="s2">information you see in the world through</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.390" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">a grid of numbers and within the culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.050" end="00:06:58.280" style="s2">of power</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:07:00.170" style="s2">the assumption is we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.280" end="00:07:03.140" style="s2">continue more or less in the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.170" end="00:07:07.690" style="s2">direction and and there is very little</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.140" end="00:07:10.190" style="s2">information that is reaching them that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.690" end="00:07:12.740" style="s2">really spells out the need actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.190" end="00:07:17.270" style="s2">could decentralization or localization</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.740" end="00:07:19.910" style="s2">so that is anathema at that high level</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.270" end="00:07:23.210" style="s2">and what I do see is a lot of language</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.910" end="00:07:27.470" style="s2">about biodiversity but ecosystems about</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.210" end="00:07:30.260" style="s2">rethinking and I&#39;ve seen enormous shift</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.260" end="00:07:37.820" style="s2">of power in the last 30 years but in</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.800" end="00:07:40.730" style="s2">actual fact I see a continuation and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.820" end="00:07:44.510" style="s2">commitment to continuing fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.730" end="00:07:46.580" style="s2">in the same direction so for me what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.510" end="00:07:48.290" style="s2">what&#39;s very interesting is yes you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.580" end="00:07:51.470" style="s2">I got invited to speak at the Brussels</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.290" end="00:07:53.240" style="s2">Economic Forum this year but is speaking</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.470" end="00:07:56.750" style="s2">on the same panel with the head and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.240" end="00:07:58.520" style="s2">finance and economics in the EU and on</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.750" end="00:08:03.410" style="s2">the same kind of lis you know someone</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.520" end="00:08:05.240" style="s2">from Unilever and you know discussions</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.410" end="00:08:07.910" style="s2">with the head of the IMF and so on</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.240" end="00:08:11.480" style="s2">lastly I was invited to debate the chief</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.910" end="00:08:14.060" style="s2">economist of the WTO and I have Joseph</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.060" end="00:08:20.600" style="s2">also so I had a lot of discussions with</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.890" end="00:08:22.880" style="s2">the very you know people who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.600" end="00:08:26.180" style="s2">definitely willing to rethink a bit but</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.880" end="00:08:28.570" style="s2">I see a certain fundamentalism in their</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.180" end="00:08:31.960" style="s2">thinking about what creates growth and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.570" end="00:08:36.470" style="s2">part of that is the conviction that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.960" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">technology creates jobs the conviction</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.470" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">that growth is essential up to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:46.660" style="s2">point so far too little concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:49.610" style="s2">what&#39;s happened in India and China where</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.660" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">yes people have been lifted out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.610" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">poverty according to those</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">Germans so we look at the reality of how</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:09:00.920" style="s2">they&#39;re living in slum like conditions</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:03.560" style="s2">often very very unhealthy</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.920" end="00:09:05.570" style="s2">I mean unhealthy just because of the air</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.560" end="00:09:08.690" style="s2">pollution but also the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.570" end="00:09:12.020" style="s2">water the quality of life has plummeted</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.690" end="00:09:14.510" style="s2">compared to most of the villages that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.020" end="00:09:18.200" style="s2">people lived in there were no paradise</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.510" end="00:09:22.450" style="s2">but moving into the big cities and being</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.200" end="00:09:26.149" style="s2">paid some kind of salary small or even</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.450" end="00:09:28.310" style="s2">semi large you&#39;re still seeing a huge</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.149" end="00:09:30.500" style="s2">reduction in the quality of life and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.310" end="00:09:33.560" style="s2">nothing that you could really talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.500" end="00:09:35.570" style="s2">as genuine improvement and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.560" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">something that very few people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.570" end="00:09:40.820" style="s2">actually looking at until now well this</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:43.820" style="s2">is this is the other thing that that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.820" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">conversation around GDP being a</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.820" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">desperately inadequate measure of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:52.070" style="s2">performance of an economy or augs</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:53.750" style="s2">certainly of success or progress we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.070" end="00:09:55.700" style="s2">go into a whole nother conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.750" end="00:09:58.220" style="s2">around this whole progress mindset</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.700" end="00:10:01.400" style="s2">anyway but but you mentioned two things</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.220" end="00:10:03.320" style="s2">you mentioned that the higher level</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.400" end="00:10:05.089" style="s2">political leaders basically get these</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.320" end="00:10:10.130" style="s2">summaries that are all focused on</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.089" end="00:10:12.860" style="s2">quantitative data that M and M also you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.130" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">mentioned that the while the figures</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.860" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">might indicate that people come out of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:20.600" style="s2">poverty the quality of their lives so</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:23.720" style="s2">the qualitative aspect doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.600" end="00:10:28.130" style="s2">change positively and and so for me this</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.720" end="00:10:31.010" style="s2">is so central to this shift that we need</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.130" end="00:10:33.290" style="s2">to make now and that we&#39;re so stuck on</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.010" end="00:10:36.709" style="s2">this adage what gets measured gets</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.290" end="00:10:39.260" style="s2">managed and as things get tighter and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.709" end="00:10:42.380" style="s2">more problematic people want to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.260" end="00:10:44.779" style="s2">quicker impact at scale and so all these</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.380" end="00:10:46.730" style="s2">knee-jerk responses like how do we scale</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.779" end="00:10:49.220" style="s2">it up and how do we measure it and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.730" end="00:10:51.740" style="s2">are the impact indicators it to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.220" end="00:10:54.020" style="s2">that&#39;s driving us all back into a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.740" end="00:10:57.320" style="s2">mindset that only looks at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.020" end="00:10:59.390" style="s2">quantifiable when real quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.320" end="00:11:01.640" style="s2">how we live our lives how we relate to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.390" end="00:11:04.100" style="s2">each other in our communities how do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.640" end="00:11:05.660" style="s2">relate and heal our local ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.100" end="00:11:08.840" style="s2">they are all about</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.660" end="00:11:11.540" style="s2">Changez and if we if we try to capture</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.840" end="00:11:15.650" style="s2">those qualitative changes in quantities</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.540" end="00:11:17.630" style="s2">we lose a lot but again oh no I think I</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.650" end="00:11:21.580" style="s2">think Daniel one thing to keep in mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.630" end="00:11:25.160" style="s2">to be honest is that there would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.580" end="00:11:28.430" style="s2">quantifiable aspects that one could look</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.160" end="00:11:31.640" style="s2">at for instance the degree of pollution</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.430" end="00:11:35.570" style="s2">in the air the degree of pollution in</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.640" end="00:11:38.600" style="s2">the water the actual you know quality of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.570" end="00:11:41.600" style="s2">the as I say the air pollution the water</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.600" end="00:11:43.880" style="s2">pollution how much green they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.600" end="00:11:47.870" style="s2">around them you know so that there would</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.880" end="00:11:51.260" style="s2">be quantifiable elements that I think we</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.870" end="00:11:55.370" style="s2">should also be sure to mention and to</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.260" end="00:11:57.770" style="s2">insist on it&#39;s a very selective focus in</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.370" end="00:12:02.380" style="s2">terms of quantification and don&#39;t forget</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.770" end="00:12:05.450" style="s2">the whole thing is run on a system that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.380" end="00:12:08.120" style="s2">commercializes every aspect of life so</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.450" end="00:12:11.660" style="s2">their various interconnected webs of</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.120" end="00:12:15.050" style="s2">life being intervened in at every stage</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.660" end="00:12:20.180" style="s2">to create you know a profit or</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.050" end="00:12:22.430" style="s2">extractive capitalism and so it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.180" end="00:12:24.830" style="s2">of an insanity in a way that any of us</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.430" end="00:12:29.330" style="s2">are actually allowing GDP as a measure</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.830" end="00:12:32.360" style="s2">to continue once you understood that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.330" end="00:12:34.130" style="s2">really does increase with pollution with</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.360" end="00:12:36.380" style="s2">ill health by the way that would be</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.130" end="00:12:39.950" style="s2">another indicator that not be used this</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.380" end="00:12:42.950" style="s2">is actually health including looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.950" end="00:12:45.740" style="s2">honestly at obesity and it&#39;s linked to</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.260" end="00:13:04.760" style="s2">see this dreadful reality that around</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.720" end="00:13:29.240" style="s2">have experienced the shift at least in</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.059" end="00:13:32.059" style="s2">the conversation over the last 10 15 20</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.240" end="00:13:34.279" style="s2">years both were with regard to the need</p>

<p begin="00:13:34.279" end="00:13:40.309" style="s2">with the critique on GDP it&#39;s it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.980" end="00:13:42.860" style="s2">very popular now to admit that it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:16:48.560" end="00:16:53.779" style="s2">where those that produce the most energy</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.650" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">you pollute the most of most resource</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.779" end="00:16:59.839" style="s2">intensive and it actually overall employ</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.839" end="00:17:07.040" style="s2">grown in power and worldwide as I said</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.589" end="00:17:10.429" style="s2">earlier we see in reality a situation</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.040" end="00:17:13.730" style="s2">that even during periods of growth from</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.429" end="00:17:14.990" style="s2">national GDP increasing the majority</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.730" end="00:17:18.199" style="s2">people are getting poorer</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.990" end="00:17:20.829" style="s2">so I believe that once this sort of</p>

<p begin="00:17:20.829" end="00:17:28.550" style="s2">there could be a huge AHA experience for</p>

<p begin="00:17:38.210" end="00:17:44.530" style="s2">clear way in a compassionate way it</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.270" end="00:17:48.750" style="s2">really is primarily about blind</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.530" end="00:17:52.330" style="s2">we&#39;re allowing many many leaders to</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.750" end="00:17:55.030" style="s2">comfortably remain blind but you know we</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.330" end="00:17:56.890" style="s2">I would say at the level of you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.030" end="00:17:58.720" style="s2">social and environmental rules really</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.890" end="00:18:01.030" style="s2">haven&#39;t done the job because we&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.720" end="00:18:03.880" style="s2">been looking globally enough there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.030" end="00:18:08.410" style="s2">been very little awareness of how</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.880" end="00:18:11.350" style="s2">enormous and fundamentally important</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.410" end="00:18:14.429" style="s2">this trajectory has been in over the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.350" end="00:18:18.309" style="s2">last thirty years not only taking us</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.429" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">into a world of four greater increases</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.309" end="00:18:24.220" style="s2">in pollution and co2 emission but also a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:26.860" style="s2">situation where most people now have</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.220" end="00:18:30.030" style="s2">lost all faith and democracy you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.860" end="00:18:32.710" style="s2">this basically seeing their governments</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.030" end="00:18:35.410" style="s2">promised to they&#39;re blue in the face as</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.710" end="00:18:37.900" style="s2">they seek election to look after their</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.410" end="00:18:42.460" style="s2">citizens and once in power they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.900" end="00:18:44.170" style="s2">looking after global billionaires so we</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.460" end="00:18:47.050" style="s2">have a big job to do to get this</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.170" end="00:18:49.870" style="s2">holistic message out and without Tim and</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.050" end="00:18:52.150" style="s2">I saying without assuming that either</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.870" end="00:18:54.190" style="s2">any individual corporation is to play</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.150" end="00:18:57.309" style="s2">any more any in particularly individuals</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.190" end="00:18:59.470" style="s2">I really do feel that this should be</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.309" end="00:19:03.190" style="s2">done with a great deal of compassion and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.470" end="00:19:04.360" style="s2">understanding that as long as the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.190" end="00:19:07.240" style="s2">is blind</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.360" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">well this casino economy will continue</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.240" end="00:19:13.420" style="s2">and we don&#39;t we really need to urgently</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:17.770" style="s2">get on with this task to expose the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.420" end="00:19:20.380" style="s2">realities of it so how would you like</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.770" end="00:19:23.920" style="s2">because we I think we&#39;re both very much</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.380" end="00:19:26.200" style="s2">aligned with this need for working</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.920" end="00:19:28.870" style="s2">locally in the sense of that that really</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.200" end="00:19:30.850" style="s2">it is all about real ocol izing and re</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.870" end="00:19:32.559" style="s2">regionalizing but in order to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.850" end="00:19:36.510" style="s2">that we need increased global</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.559" end="00:19:39.340" style="s2">collaboration among all the actors to</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.510" end="00:19:42.570" style="s2">clear the playing field too because as</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.340" end="00:19:45.580" style="s2">you as you alluded to it right now</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.570" end="00:19:48.730" style="s2">anybody like my example here on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.580" end="00:19:53.710" style="s2">island of Majorca M if even if we all</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.730" end="00:19:57.290" style="s2">agreed and try to build a example of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.710" end="00:19:59.630" style="s2">regional economy at island scale to in</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.290" end="00:20:02.120" style="s2">trees local food production local food</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.630" end="00:20:04.460" style="s2">sovereignty to manage our water here on</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.120" end="00:20:06.740" style="s2">the island in a way that is sensible and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.460" end="00:20:09.680" style="s2">and that people have ownership over to</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.740" end="00:20:11.420" style="s2">produce decentralized renewable energy</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.680" end="00:20:14.030" style="s2">and create a transport system that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.420" end="00:20:17.870" style="s2">based on public transport and non non</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.030" end="00:20:20.750" style="s2">polluting all of those shifts would</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.870" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">actually run against global regulations</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.750" end="00:20:27.560" style="s2">and would compete in an unfair market</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:30.380" style="s2">with cheap imports from afar so so where</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.560" end="00:20:32.750" style="s2">do you see the key entry points like if</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.380" end="00:20:35.240" style="s2">you you said talked to Joseph Stiglitz</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.750" end="00:20:38.420" style="s2">and people at the IMF and the WTO what</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.240" end="00:20:41.450" style="s2">would be your message to them of saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.420" end="00:20:43.430" style="s2">these are the four or five key leverage</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.450" end="00:20:46.070" style="s2">points in terms of externalities and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.430" end="00:20:48.500" style="s2">subsidies where we could really shift</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.070" end="00:20:51.880" style="s2">the system and enable people to have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.500" end="00:20:55.250" style="s2">more regional eyes real oak alized</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.880" end="00:20:58.010" style="s2">likelihood again you know talking into</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.250" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">those in power I would be looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.010" end="00:21:03.490" style="s2">urgent need to renegotiate trade</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:06.050" style="s2">treaties to start a process of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.490" end="00:21:09.620" style="s2">re-regulation at the global level and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.050" end="00:21:12.230" style="s2">this will happen once governments really</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.620" end="00:21:15.020" style="s2">are held to account by their citizens</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.230" end="00:21:16.520" style="s2">you know because as individuals in</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.020" end="00:21:18.770" style="s2">government you know you often have this</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.520" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">revolving door where they were you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.770" end="00:21:26.420" style="s2">as an empty later on become CEO</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.480" end="00:21:28.190" style="s2">corporation so in a personal level a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.420" end="00:21:31.520" style="s2">certain lesson interest in just</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.190" end="00:21:34.550" style="s2">continuing business as usual but at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.520" end="00:21:37.670" style="s2">national level and you know the level of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.550" end="00:21:40.160" style="s2">civic society we really must insist on a</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.670" end="00:21:42.230" style="s2">process of really regulate inand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.160" end="00:21:44.600" style="s2">not something that&#39;s going to suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.230" end="00:21:47.980" style="s2">overnight close down every multinational</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.600" end="00:21:50.540" style="s2">company but the end goal would be that</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.980" end="00:21:53.150" style="s2">society shapes business rather than</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.540" end="00:21:56.660" style="s2">business as it is currently doing now</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.150" end="00:21:58.820" style="s2">shaping society and shaping a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.660" end="00:22:02.360" style="s2">democracy which is not democracy at all</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.820" end="00:22:05.270" style="s2">when you have global media having such</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.360" end="00:22:07.640" style="s2">influence in national debates even even</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.270" end="00:22:10.669" style="s2">forgetting about their lobbying and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.640" end="00:22:13.279" style="s2">funds that are directly you</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.669" end="00:22:15.980" style="s2">to manipulate the government process the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.279" end="00:22:18.549" style="s2">lack of control of media and so on is</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.980" end="00:22:23.419" style="s2">also fundamental part of it and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.549" end="00:22:25.309" style="s2">again we as Civic Society members we</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.419" end="00:22:27.529" style="s2">don&#39;t want to leave that control</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.309" end="00:22:30.919" style="s2">entirely to centralized governments we</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.529" end="00:22:33.499" style="s2">want to see civic society at the table</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.919" end="00:22:38.210" style="s2">and part of the process of shaping the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.499" end="00:22:40.220" style="s2">new agenda so the hope would but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.210" end="00:22:43.009" style="s2">with four people in power you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.220" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">need to start really regulating the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.009" end="00:22:47.779" style="s2">banks and corporations it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:50.350" style="s2">like yeah we can give them a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.779" end="00:22:53.049" style="s2">evidence as to why that is necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.350" end="00:22:57.379" style="s2">equally important is to look at</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.049" end="00:22:59.749" style="s2">systematically deregulating at the local</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.379" end="00:23:02.059" style="s2">and national level of course selectively</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.749" end="00:23:04.690" style="s2">not across the board we want absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.059" end="00:23:07.730" style="s2">one certain genuine environmental</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.690" end="00:23:10.279" style="s2">protection we want genuine concern for</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.730" end="00:23:12.529" style="s2">public health and safety but what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.279" end="00:23:15.409" style="s2">have found in working across the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.529" end="00:23:17.899" style="s2">in the local trying to build up local</p>

<p begin="00:25:56.340" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">hard work and there was this vision of</p>

<p begin="00:26:16.950" end="00:26:26.279" style="s2">but once we start looking holistically</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.700" end="00:26:28.769" style="s2">and we understand the reality of small</p>

<p begin="00:29:31.510" end="00:29:36.280" style="s2">Bhutan you know in these ancient</p>

<p begin="00:30:00.790" end="00:30:06.550" style="s2">opened my eyes to it I go back to Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.280" end="00:30:09.580" style="s2">and I find that at that time in the 70s</p>

<p begin="00:33:27.909" end="00:33:34.539" style="s2">very clear that so many benefits would</p>

<p begin="00:34:04.960" end="00:34:10.240" style="s2">the middleman we have many examples</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.820" end="00:34:12.220" style="s2">where local farmers selling to a local</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.240" end="00:34:12.879" style="s2">shop that in turn sells to local</p>

<p begin="00:34:12.879" end="00:34:18.549" style="s2">consumers can work extremely well and we</p>

<p begin="00:34:21.639" end="00:34:28.270" style="s2">there are now more and more projects</p>

<p begin="00:34:28.270" end="00:34:35.260" style="s2">helped to catalyze these initiatives in</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.750" end="00:34:38.099" style="s2">so many countries we are just amazed and</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.260" end="00:34:40.359" style="s2">thrilled to see that they are</p>

<p begin="00:34:52.030" end="00:34:59.680" style="s2">in Madrid I would urge them to also look</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.809" end="00:35:01.930" style="s2">at our website as well as my book to see</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.680" end="00:35:06.099" style="s2">examples of this sort of initiatives</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.930" end="00:35:08.589" style="s2">that they can maybe join or start once</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.099" end="00:35:10.750" style="s2">you get a different set of lenses on and</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.589" end="00:35:14.369" style="s2">you realise the importance of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.750" end="00:35:16.540" style="s2">shortening of distances as a</p>

<p begin="00:35:18.549" end="00:35:22.150" style="s2">once you stop putting those lenses on</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.859" end="00:35:23.650" style="s2">you&#39;ll see there is so much more</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.150" end="00:35:28.589" style="s2">happening than you would have thought</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.650" end="00:35:29.800" style="s2">and I hope you&#39;ll join me in feeling</p>

<p begin="00:39:17.010" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">need to have civic society at the table</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.020" end="00:39:53.400" style="s2">and you know particularly up there at</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.570" end="00:39:56.520" style="s2">the local level they are very</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.400" end="00:39:58.950" style="s2">interesting political</p>

<p begin="00:40:17.910" end="00:40:25.830" style="s2">a very limited budget so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.230" end="00:40:27.870" style="s2">essentially really capture democracy</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.830" end="00:40:31.020" style="s2">it&#39;s not just about lobbying government</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.870" end="00:40:33.600" style="s2">and the first step is to create more</p>

<p begin="00:41:18.810" end="00:41:22.740" style="s2">mentioned extinction rebellion and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.460" end="00:41:25.800" style="s2">mean that&#39;s one of the the big hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.740" end="00:41:28.620" style="s2">shifts of the last even really the last</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.800" end="00:41:30.360" style="s2">year or 14 months and with the</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.360" end="00:41:38.310" style="s2">future somehow activating a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.830" end="00:41:41.670" style="s2">people into this discourse and at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.310" end="00:41:43.560" style="s2">same time and it is very focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.670" end="00:41:46.080" style="s2">climate change issue and it is very</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.560" end="00:41:47.880" style="s2">focused on I kind of enough we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.080" end="00:41:50.430" style="s2">want any more of this we have a right to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.880" end="00:41:54.120" style="s2">a future em to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.430" end="00:41:55.950" style="s2">it I don&#39;t I haven&#39;t seen enough yet the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.120" end="00:41:59.390" style="s2">shift of these the people who have now</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.950" end="00:42:02.970" style="s2">been activated into the hopeful local</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.390" end="00:42:05.550" style="s2">regional movements of saying let&#39;s begin</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.970" end="00:42:09.119" style="s2">to build the new system that makes the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.550" end="00:42:11.339" style="s2">old obsolete let&#39;s claim our right</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.119" end="00:42:14.460" style="s2">to civic participation in government</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.339" end="00:42:17.809" style="s2">governance and in politics at the local</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.460" end="00:42:20.509" style="s2">level and and then link up globally to</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.809" end="00:42:23.849" style="s2">also claim it at the global level but</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.509" end="00:42:26.999" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s this shitty from being</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.849" end="00:42:29.039" style="s2">against something to a concerted</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.999" end="00:42:32.700" style="s2">strategy of putting something new into</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.039" end="00:42:36.170" style="s2">place that yeah you talk but I would say</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.700" end="00:42:38.999" style="s2">that actually you know where I slightly</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.170" end="00:42:41.430" style="s2">differ with you I I worry a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.999" end="00:42:43.769" style="s2">about the idea that many people now have</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.430" end="00:42:45.900" style="s2">as they get interested in localization</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.769" end="00:42:48.569" style="s2">and so then they think y&#39;all its first</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.900" end="00:42:50.279" style="s2">build up the local and then let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.569" end="00:42:53.339" style="s2">at linking up and changing the bidding</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.279" end="00:42:56.609" style="s2">system I am trying to urge people to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.339" end="00:42:58.049" style="s2">both not every person necessarily but</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.609" end="00:43:00.779" style="s2">you know we&#39;re trying to urge people to</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.049" end="00:43:03.660" style="s2">get together in local groups and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.779" end="00:43:06.390" style="s2">are jointly look at what can we do as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.660" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">community initiative and also how can we</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.390" end="00:43:13.049" style="s2">contribute to getting the word out about</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:15.720" style="s2">the reality of lots of local examples</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.049" end="00:43:18.450" style="s2">that show that we must go local for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.720" end="00:43:21.150" style="s2">future the parity has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.450" end="00:43:23.369" style="s2">biodiversity there&#39;s an imperative there</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.150" end="00:43:26.430" style="s2">that we just can&#39;t escape it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.369" end="00:43:28.410" style="s2">what actually can be life enhancing and</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.430" end="00:43:31.259" style="s2">how that relates to local knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.410" end="00:43:34.349" style="s2">systems it relates to experiential</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.259" end="00:43:36.150" style="s2">knowledge you know there&#39;s some multiple</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.349" end="00:43:38.670" style="s2">reasons where we&#39;re going to have to go</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.150" end="00:43:42.119" style="s2">local we may end up doing that just</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.670" end="00:43:43.619" style="s2">through crises but thank goodness there</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.119" end="00:43:48.690" style="s2">are a lot of initiatives that are</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.619" end="00:43:50.239" style="s2">happening access it ii but i but i am</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.690" end="00:43:54.150" style="s2">trying to encourage people to</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.239" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">simultaneously at least as a group or at</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.150" end="00:43:58.880" style="s2">least be linked to groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:02.309" style="s2">trying to get the word out about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.880" end="00:44:05.849" style="s2">localizing path as a strategy for a</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.309" end="00:44:09.630" style="s2">political shift and so it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.849" end="00:44:12.029" style="s2">like you know many spiritual movements</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.630" end="00:44:14.940" style="s2">thought first we have to have placed on</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.029" end="00:44:17.549" style="s2">the inside and then we can create a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.940" end="00:44:19.259" style="s2">peace movement what i&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.549" end="00:44:21.660" style="s2">saying is the inner and the outer are</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.259" end="00:44:23.069" style="s2">completely connected will then be much</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.660" end="00:44:26.400" style="s2">better off lupus parted</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.069" end="00:44:29.339" style="s2">both ends hmm and for instance in terms</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.400" end="00:44:32.969" style="s2">of inner transformation I love to use</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.339" end="00:44:35.699" style="s2">this prism project near us in Devon</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.969" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">where you know prisoners who have their</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.699" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">whole lives have been hardened and only</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:46.529" style="s2">known competitive culture helped to</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:49.199" style="s2">basically build a sense of connection</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.529" end="00:44:52.529" style="s2">and community to sit down and have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.199" end="00:44:54.209" style="s2">conversation over a meal in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.529" end="00:44:56.809" style="s2">they&#39;ve never done you know a prisoner</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.209" end="00:44:59.519" style="s2">will say I&#39;ve never in my life</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.809" end="00:45:01.349" style="s2">experienced people actually talking to</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.519" end="00:45:03.869" style="s2">me being interested in what I was</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.349" end="00:45:07.229" style="s2">feeling or thinking and these same</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.869" end="00:45:10.650" style="s2">prisoners have gained that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.229" end="00:45:12.900" style="s2">community also to growing food and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.650" end="00:45:15.449" style="s2">learning that skill and learning the joy</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.900" end="00:45:19.140" style="s2">of being really productive and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.449" end="00:45:21.269" style="s2">the result in a deep ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.140" end="00:45:24.989" style="s2">spiritual connection to the living world</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.269" end="00:45:27.749" style="s2">so things like that can transform people</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.989" end="00:45:31.529" style="s2">on the inside but it starts with as it</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.749" end="00:45:35.779" style="s2">were an external localization project so</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.529" end="00:45:39.150" style="s2">I feel you know I I also feel that with</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.779" end="00:45:42.989" style="s2">with extinction rebellion that they are</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.150" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">beginning now to change and I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.989" end="00:45:46.920" style="s2">you it should be in two directions one</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.880" end="00:45:49.410" style="s2">of them is to understand and embrace the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.920" end="00:45:53.039" style="s2">localization movement the other one is</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.410" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">to put out a message to people that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.039" end="00:45:58.380" style="s2">beyond just climate that is saying we</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:46:02.789" style="s2">are not just about climate alia we are</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.380" end="00:46:06.199" style="s2">about an economic transformation that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.789" end="00:46:09.059" style="s2">about your livelihood this is not</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.199" end="00:46:11.609" style="s2">something that&#39;s separate from you so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.059" end="00:46:14.099" style="s2">think that message of the new economy</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.609" end="00:46:17.309" style="s2">moment and the potential through</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.099" end="00:46:20.999" style="s2">localization the potential particularly</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.309" end="00:46:26.130" style="s2">with policy change how really quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.999" end="00:46:28.349" style="s2">rapidly we could see huge benefits if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.130" end="00:46:30.989" style="s2">were able to get more support from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.349" end="00:46:33.150" style="s2">dominant system so we are seeing some</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.989" end="00:46:36.120" style="s2">local governments and some regional</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.150" end="00:46:38.490" style="s2">governments now you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.120" end="00:46:40.350" style="s2">beginning to change and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.490" end="00:46:42.510" style="s2">interesting because it&#39;s so clearly was</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.350" end="00:46:44.490" style="s2">there pressured there closer to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.510" end="00:46:46.740" style="s2">ground they&#39;re often more aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.490" end="00:46:49.770" style="s2">environmental impact they&#39;re more aware</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.740" end="00:46:52.020" style="s2">the social impact of what they do and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.770" end="00:46:55.980" style="s2">they are responding earlier than</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.020" end="00:46:59.160" style="s2">national governments I I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.980" end="00:47:01.530" style="s2">convinced that if we have time that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.160" end="00:47:04.080" style="s2">will ultimately move in the right</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.530" end="00:47:07.740" style="s2">direction what worries me is that this</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.080" end="00:47:10.980" style="s2">is juggernaut them you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.740" end="00:47:14.100" style="s2">fake capital capital created through</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.980" end="00:47:16.290" style="s2">debt and just out of thin air not a link</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.100" end="00:47:18.270" style="s2">to any resources not been to any real</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.290" end="00:47:20.400" style="s2">wealth but just because we&#39;ve allowed</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.270" end="00:47:23.900" style="s2">the banks to become so powerful the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.400" end="00:47:26.520" style="s2">global that they&#39;re able to create</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.900" end="00:47:29.640" style="s2">masses of money which is used almost</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.520" end="00:47:32.790" style="s2">like bonds you know landing in local and</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.640" end="00:47:35.430" style="s2">national economies pushing everything in</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.790" end="00:47:40.910" style="s2">the direction of exploitation pollution</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.430" end="00:47:43.800" style="s2">etc so that creates an urgency that</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.910" end="00:47:46.410" style="s2">needs I think we need to try to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.800" end="00:47:49.110" style="s2">there what I call the big picture out as</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.410" end="00:47:51.930" style="s2">soon as possible well let me just</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.110" end="00:47:53.640" style="s2">briefly get back to like I wasn&#39;t in any</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.930" end="00:47:56.100" style="s2">way suggesting we need to first do this</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.640" end="00:47:58.140" style="s2">and then do the other and and also like</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.100" end="00:48:01.650" style="s2">everything he just said I&#39;ve also been</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.140" end="00:48:03.990" style="s2">working on for 20 years and that that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.650" end="00:48:08.670" style="s2">need to work on on both ends at the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.990" end="00:48:11.220" style="s2">time and but then for me the the issue</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.670" end="00:48:15.290" style="s2">with like you mentioned diversity is one</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.220" end="00:48:17.070" style="s2">of the key measures of a healthy system</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.290" end="00:48:19.140" style="s2">one thing that I was slightly</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.070" end="00:48:20.760" style="s2">disappointed with regard to extinction</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.140" end="00:48:23.460" style="s2">rebellion is you know they have these</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.760" end="00:48:26.250" style="s2">ten principles and one of the principles</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.460" end="00:48:27.960" style="s2">is regenerative culture and we need a</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.250" end="00:48:30.840" style="s2">regenerative culture and then that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.960" end="00:48:33.480" style="s2">sub line says creating cultures that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.840" end="00:48:37.320" style="s2">healthy resilient and adaptable in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.480" end="00:48:39.120" style="s2">sub line M proves to me that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.320" end="00:48:42.140" style="s2">actually taken this from for my book</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.120" end="00:48:44.910" style="s2">because it&#39;s exactly those three</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.140" end="00:48:47.550" style="s2">adjectives in that I use in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.910" end="00:48:49.900" style="s2">sequence but what they didn&#39;t do and</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.550" end="00:48:51.550" style="s2">this is like I&#39;m excited and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.900" end="00:48:53.590" style="s2">not about kindness and some author</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.550" end="00:48:55.870" style="s2">having some sort of quibbles that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.590" end="00:48:58.060" style="s2">didn&#39;t quote me and but I&#39;m a little I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.870" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">excited that they picked it up but what</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.060" end="00:49:04.750" style="s2">I&#39;m worried about is that they turned</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.400" end="00:49:07.990" style="s2">the plural of regenerative cultures into</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.750" end="00:49:09.850" style="s2">a single because this is this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.990" end="00:49:11.740" style="s2">these issues that slightly because it</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.850" end="00:49:13.450" style="s2">came out of the UK and there&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.740" end="00:49:15.100" style="s2">people involved and I am so glad</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.450" end="00:49:18.640" style="s2">extinction rebellion exists and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.100" end="00:49:22.420" style="s2">fully supportive of them and there is an</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.640" end="00:49:24.550" style="s2">yet again by using the singular where we</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.420" end="00:49:26.800" style="s2">have it again not decolonial izing the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.550" end="00:49:29.320" style="s2">mind enough and were pretending that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.800" end="00:49:31.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a bunch of the English activists</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.320" end="00:49:33.040" style="s2">who&#39;ve created the new thing that now</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.000" end="00:49:36.160" style="s2">everybody has to take on instead of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.040" end="00:49:38.860" style="s2">saying no regeneration and coming back</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.160" end="00:49:41.020" style="s2">to this this wealth and the potential of</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.860" end="00:49:44.320" style="s2">local community and local ecosystems to</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.020" end="00:49:47.530" style="s2">provide for nature and us as part of</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.320" end="00:49:50.100" style="s2">magic is all about the bio cultural</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.530" end="00:49:52.510" style="s2">uniqueness of place it&#39;s all about these</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.100" end="00:49:55.870" style="s2">regenerative cultures in all their</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.510" end="00:49:59.020" style="s2">diversity giving expression to a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.870" end="00:50:01.290" style="s2">system and in it if we ever managed just</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.020" end="00:50:05.920" style="s2">let me little bit more of that random</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.290" end="00:50:09.370" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s also about this that when</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.920" end="00:50:11.800" style="s2">we understand that it is about creating</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.370" end="00:50:15.010" style="s2">many of these diverse regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.800" end="00:50:17.830" style="s2">cultures in place then we can also see</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.010" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">that in all our diversity of faiths of</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.830" end="00:50:22.960" style="s2">religious beliefs of niggas we we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:25.360" style="s2">have enough time to get to a point where</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.960" end="00:50:29.490" style="s2">all of humanity agrees on what to do we</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.360" end="00:50:32.650" style="s2">will begin to read treasure our</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.490" end="00:50:35.350" style="s2">diversity of opinion also as part of</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.650" end="00:50:38.500" style="s2">life&#39;s diversity of adaptability and yet</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.350" end="00:50:41.020" style="s2">find that higher ground of working in</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.500" end="00:50:42.580" style="s2">the same direction to heal the planet</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.020" end="00:50:45.310" style="s2">and heal our relationship with each</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.580" end="00:50:48.250" style="s2">other and the planet and I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.310" end="00:50:50.920" style="s2">just hear your perspective on that well</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.250" end="00:50:52.600" style="s2">I love the fact that you say that plural</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.920" end="00:50:55.180" style="s2">and I have to tell you there are very</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.600" end="00:50:57.280" style="s2">few Westerners who understand that so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.180" end="00:51:00.730" style="s2">felt in that you know but I&#39;ve been at</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.280" end="00:51:02.680" style="s2">it for 45 years and that&#39;s been it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.730" end="00:51:03.220" style="s2">big big problem particularly in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.680" end="00:51:06.760" style="s2">angular</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.220" end="00:51:09.430" style="s2">always lack of awareness but even</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.760" end="00:51:12.340" style="s2">generally in Europe too little</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.430" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">understanding of the need for plural</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.340" end="00:51:17.470" style="s2">therefore the diversity of cultures and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:20.560" style="s2">particularly that deep connection</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.470" end="00:51:22.780" style="s2">between people and the place the natural</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.560" end="00:51:25.780" style="s2">place that they know where they live and</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.780" end="00:51:27.550" style="s2">with it that they emanate from so and</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.780" end="00:51:30.010" style="s2">that&#39;s of course fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.550" end="00:51:32.349" style="s2">localization that&#39;s why localization is</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.010" end="00:51:35.080" style="s2">so fundamental and why your knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.349" end="00:51:36.700" style="s2">systems need to be decentralized and</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.080" end="00:51:40.240" style="s2">then you get into a whole discussion</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.700" end="00:51:44.020" style="s2">about the role of science today and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.240" end="00:51:46.119" style="s2">again why their latest techno systems</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.020" end="00:51:50.830" style="s2">have to be questioned because they tend</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.119" end="00:51:53.500" style="s2">to suit global centralized power</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.830" end="00:51:55.450" style="s2">structures and and that&#39;s another whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.500" end="00:51:57.190" style="s2">discussion we don&#39;t want to get into now</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.450" end="00:51:58.960" style="s2">but it is certainly something we need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.190" end="00:52:05.530" style="s2">be discussing and people need to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.960" end="00:52:08.260" style="s2">thinking about and I feel to me it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.530" end="00:52:12.599" style="s2">much about awareness of this bigger</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.260" end="00:52:18.040" style="s2">picture you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.599" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">wake-up that can be helped when people</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.040" end="00:52:23.140" style="s2">like us try to put up this bigger</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.839" end="00:52:27.880" style="s2">picture when I see there&#39;s some you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.140" end="00:52:30.369" style="s2">as people quite intuitively react to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.880" end="00:52:33.369" style="s2">problems of the toxic monarch on to the</p>

<p begin="00:52:33.369" end="00:52:38.080" style="s2">are returning to place they&#39;re returning</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.609" end="00:52:40.089" style="s2">it happens in many different ways but</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.080" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">you know even it&#39;s starting to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.089" end="00:52:44.470" style="s2">their bodies they start listening more</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:46.690" style="s2">to their bodies and me as you know they</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.470" end="00:52:50.800" style="s2">often know much better than they over</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.690" end="00:52:53.140" style="s2">intellectualized mind so there is a way</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.800" end="00:52:56.080" style="s2">in which I think that humankind would</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.140" end="00:52:58.780" style="s2">come back to diversity in place and</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.080" end="00:53:02.650" style="s2">indeed wisdom and a deep and a joyous</p>

<p begin="00:53:51.640" end="00:53:55.450" style="s2">because there&#39;s one you we mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.010" end="00:53:59.200" style="s2">there&#39;s two more things that I would</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.450" end="00:54:03.820" style="s2">like to address before we wrap up one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.200" end="00:54:10.650" style="s2">them is the the danger that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.820" end="00:54:13.180" style="s2">observed in recent years that was become</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.650" end="00:54:14.920" style="s2">possible now is that you&#39;ve like I</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.180" end="00:54:16.900" style="s2">certainly have found myself in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.920" end="00:54:19.630" style="s2">conversation at a local level with</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.900" end="00:54:21.670" style="s2">people that all seem to initially agree</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.630" end="00:54:24.990" style="s2">yes we need to build food sovereignty we</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.670" end="00:54:27.880" style="s2">need to meet most of our communities</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.990" end="00:54:30.220" style="s2">essential needs closer to home we need</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.880" end="00:54:31.869" style="s2">to value our local ecosystems in our</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.220" end="00:54:33.940" style="s2">local culture more all stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.869" end="00:54:37.750" style="s2">would immediately sign on the dotted</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.940" end="00:54:39.819" style="s2">line for and then suddenly other little</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.750" end="00:54:41.640" style="s2">bits of the discourse come in and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.819" end="00:54:45.339" style="s2">realize you&#39;re actually talking to</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.640" end="00:54:47.859" style="s2">relatively right-wing real localization</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.339" end="00:54:50.349" style="s2">groups that that are coming at a similar</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.859" end="00:54:52.750" style="s2">agenda but from a very very different</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.349" end="00:54:55.740" style="s2">angle that is kind of against another</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.750" end="00:55:00.190" style="s2">and is actually quite xenophobic and</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.740" end="00:55:02.380" style="s2">like you could find right-wing German</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.190" end="00:55:05.760" style="s2">Nazis supporting a real localization</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.380" end="00:55:08.500" style="s2">agenda you can find an extremist Catalan</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.760" end="00:55:10.630" style="s2">independence movement people that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.500" end="00:55:14.140" style="s2">doing wonderful work but by doing it as</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.630" end="00:55:17.230" style="s2">an opposition to another em jump on that</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.140" end="00:55:19.930" style="s2">on that bandwagon have you have you come</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.230" end="00:55:23.349" style="s2">across this tension yourself and how do</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.930" end="00:55:25.660" style="s2">we work with that well I have I mean but</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.349" end="00:55:29.220" style="s2">I must say what I&#39;ve come across much</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.660" end="00:55:32.520" style="s2">more is people on the left is</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.220" end="00:55:33.060" style="s2">zooming that localization looks like</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.520" end="00:55:36.540" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.060" end="00:55:39.240" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to think if I&#39;ve known any</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.540" end="00:55:42.260" style="s2">people who are really truly on a</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.240" end="00:55:44.310" style="s2">localization agenda and I remember</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.260" end="00:55:47.040" style="s2">particularly around who we are talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.310" end="00:55:49.740" style="s2">about becoming self-reliant we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.040" end="00:55:51.599" style="s2">talking about having a nice farmers</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.740" end="00:55:54.810" style="s2">market to add to everything else that</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.599" end="00:55:59.750" style="s2">you&#39;ve been important so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.810" end="00:56:03.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually met you know right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.750" end="00:56:05.369" style="s2">people who were actually truly on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.390" end="00:56:07.530" style="s2">localization agendas I say they might</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.369" end="00:56:10.950" style="s2">have liked the addition of a nice</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.530" end="00:56:14.400" style="s2">farmers market in something so and and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.950" end="00:56:19.260" style="s2">think the fear on the left is very much</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.400" end="00:56:21.869" style="s2">a fear of attack that the assumption is</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.260" end="00:56:25.320" style="s2">that if you care about the local that</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.869" end="00:56:29.190" style="s2">you then you know probably ante the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.320" end="00:56:33.619" style="s2">outside where I think we have a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.190" end="00:56:37.020" style="s2">talk about is the role of tourism and</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.619" end="00:56:40.800" style="s2">even to some extent immigration in</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.020" end="00:56:43.830" style="s2">threatening local communities and their</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.800" end="00:56:45.930" style="s2">ability to look after themselves so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.830" end="00:56:50.040" style="s2">tried for years to explain that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.930" end="00:56:52.380" style="s2">seen Irish curious at Americans who were</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.040" end="00:56:56.130" style="s2">coming in in large numbers and buying up</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.380" end="00:56:58.470" style="s2">their villages that&#39;s in Swedes you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.130" end="00:57:01.050" style="s2">angry at the Germans I&#39;ve seen Welsh</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.470" end="00:57:04.020" style="s2">people burning the houses of Londoners</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.050" end="00:57:08.760" style="s2">that we&#39;re moving in to their into Wales</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.020" end="00:57:11.810" style="s2">and buying a houses so I think we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.760" end="00:57:14.220" style="s2">to look there at the need for</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.810" end="00:57:18.030" style="s2">communities everywhere to have more</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.220" end="00:57:21.390" style="s2">control over their lives and at probably</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.030" end="00:57:23.190" style="s2">quite a natural reaction when local</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.390" end="00:57:26.580" style="s2">communities feel overwhelmed and</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.190" end="00:57:30.180" style="s2">marginalized by outside forces now when</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.580" end="00:57:34.950" style="s2">it comes to immigrants and so much of</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.180" end="00:57:38.609" style="s2">that is exacerbated by again media and</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.950" end="00:57:40.920" style="s2">other outside interests in saying that</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.609" end="00:57:42.750" style="s2">your problem is due to them to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.920" end="00:57:45.150" style="s2">immigrants and</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.750" end="00:57:48.000" style="s2">and people then assume that their</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.150" end="00:57:52.020" style="s2">hardship is due to that&#39;s it for me the</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.000" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">clarity about why most communities are</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.020" end="00:57:57.870" style="s2">feeling disempowered and marginalized</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:59.520" style="s2">the clarity about even with tourism you</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.870" end="00:58:01.470" style="s2">know now in Venice I think they have</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.520" end="00:58:03.780" style="s2">something like 50 million tourists a</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.470" end="00:58:06.990" style="s2">year and there have been anti tourist</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.780" end="00:58:09.710" style="s2">demonstration well this is a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.990" end="00:58:12.000" style="s2">again in this economic system that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.710" end="00:58:15.350" style="s2">extracting wealth out of every local</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.000" end="00:58:19.500" style="s2">community so from my point of view</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.350" end="00:58:24.750" style="s2">having a vision of localization which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.500" end="00:58:28.020" style="s2">completely about the the message of this</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.750" end="00:58:30.540" style="s2">human race should have the right to feed</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.020" end="00:58:32.280" style="s2">itself you know local communities should</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.540" end="00:58:36.650" style="s2">have the right to provide food for</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.280" end="00:58:40.950" style="s2">themselves first and not be forced into</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.650" end="00:58:44.220" style="s2">this trade relationship which started</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.950" end="00:58:46.740" style="s2">with slavery slavery certainly</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.220" end="00:58:50.010" style="s2">colonialism will be created with nearly</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.740" end="00:58:53.370" style="s2">imbalances that this system has fed off</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.010" end="00:58:58.530" style="s2">and through that created a lot of anger</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.370" end="00:59:01.050" style="s2">and inequality god not of localization</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.530" end="00:59:03.690" style="s2">as a problem but of globalization as the</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.050" end="00:59:06.200" style="s2">problem you gave a really good key word</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.690" end="00:59:08.880" style="s2">that word slavery because in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.200" end="00:59:12.270" style="s2">economic globalization has been a second</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.880" end="00:59:14.460" style="s2">round of colonialization and of putting</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.270" end="00:59:16.110" style="s2">the system in place I mean I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.460" end="00:59:18.420" style="s2">if you just I just recently saw this</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.110" end="00:59:21.090" style="s2">movie the spider&#39;s web that that looked</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.420" end="00:59:24.590" style="s2">at the the British if you haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.090" end="00:59:26.790" style="s2">it I highly recommend it it looks at how</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.590" end="00:59:29.400" style="s2">basically after the fall of the British</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.790" end="00:59:31.920" style="s2">Empire the City of London with its</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.400" end="00:59:34.920" style="s2">peculiar strange historic that goes back</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.920" end="00:59:39.420" style="s2">to 1066 or 1067 where the City of London</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.920" end="00:59:41.490" style="s2">bought this new likelike special deal of</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.420" end="00:59:43.530" style="s2">being separate from the rest of the UK -</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.490" end="00:59:47.430" style="s2">with regard to certain levels of</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.530" end="00:59:49.860" style="s2">regulations and but but really very much</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.430" end="00:59:53.040" style="s2">since the fall of the British Empire em</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.860" end="00:59:56.250" style="s2">after the first second world war there</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.040" end="00:59:58.740" style="s2">was an active move by the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.250" end="01:00:02.040" style="s2">the power elites in the UK to create a</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.740" end="01:00:07.230" style="s2">new system of control that was based on</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.040" end="01:00:09.900" style="s2">the financial markets and and when you</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.230" end="01:00:13.020" style="s2">when you mentioned migration my mind</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.900" end="01:00:15.210" style="s2">also went to we need to in this global</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.020" end="01:00:18.030" style="s2">awareness raising and we need to also</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.210" end="01:00:21.380" style="s2">understand that most of these migrations</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.030" end="01:00:24.060" style="s2">we now observe are really triggered by</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.380" end="01:00:26.220" style="s2">colonialism and that the second wave of</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.060" end="01:00:28.110" style="s2">colonialism lydian either they</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.220" end="01:00:30.060" style="s2">environmentally driven migrations or</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.110" end="01:00:35.370" style="s2">there&#39;s social even the economically</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.060" end="01:00:37.230" style="s2">driven migrations are all really the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.370" end="01:00:39.420" style="s2">imbalance that we&#39;ve created between the</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.230" end="01:00:43.170" style="s2">global north and the global south and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.420" end="01:00:46.110" style="s2">either we address our historical debt</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.170" end="01:00:48.990" style="s2">and we cancel the debt of the global</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.110" end="01:00:51.240" style="s2">self and we stop this conversation of</p>

<p begin="01:05:54.609" end="01:06:02.619" style="s2">brainwashed a large part of humanity</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.480" end="01:06:07.900" style="s2">into believing this growth imperative in</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.619" end="01:06:10.859" style="s2">this progress story and have inoculated</p>

<p begin="01:06:15.460" end="01:06:21.940" style="s2">actually get to a point of saying no we</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.220" end="01:06:24.519" style="s2">all should have more of a say and hear</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.940" end="01:06:29.180" style="s2">everybody&#39;s voice the voices you hear</p>

<p begin="01:06:29.180" end="01:06:35.440" style="s2">pretty bad media work and education work</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.760" end="01:06:38.980" style="s2">of 3040 years so when you then do these</p>

<p begin="01:06:38.980" end="01:06:45.220" style="s2">collaborations you actually hearing a</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.109" end="01:06:48.589" style="s2">lot of misinformation in the room and</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.220" end="01:06:53.569" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a like when you look</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.589" end="01:06:55.970" style="s2">at the history of kind of referendums</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.569" end="01:06:57.770" style="s2">and in participatory democracy very</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.970" end="01:07:01.579" style="s2">often demagogues have got into power</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.770" end="01:07:05.450" style="s2">because of that and so it&#39;s this for me</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.579" end="01:07:08.059" style="s2">there&#39;s a big big tension of I not</p>

<p begin="01:07:20.630" end="01:07:26.059" style="s2">I very quickly got frustrated with the</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.900" end="01:07:28.510" style="s2">amount of ignorance in the room that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.059" end="01:07:30.980" style="s2">based on this mediatic and bad education</p>

<p begin="01:07:35.960" end="01:07:39.799" style="s2">try to build a better well I mean one</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.089" end="01:07:42.589" style="s2">thing I think that we need to be very</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.799" end="01:07:46.760" style="s2">clear about is that again through very</p>

<p begin="01:07:46.760" end="01:07:54.890" style="s2">of dollars our the pressure on the</p>

<p begin="01:08:09.940" end="01:08:16.429" style="s2">inside a system that is pressuring us</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.430" end="01:08:18.319" style="s2">every day to just survive to pay the</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.429" end="01:08:21.159" style="s2">mortgage to pay rent so we&#39;re in a</p>

<p begin="01:08:42.469" end="01:08:49.630" style="s2">learn from indigenous cultures as as I</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.769" end="01:08:53.599" style="s2">did in in Ladakh of Bhutan and there</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.630" end="01:08:56.839" style="s2">there was very very clean clear waste</p>

<p begin="01:09:06.499" end="01:09:11.210" style="s2">for generations so for most things there</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.049" end="01:09:14.029" style="s2">wasn&#39;t even a need for a discussion and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.210" end="01:09:16.279" style="s2">when there was you know there were</p>

<p begin="01:09:16.279" end="01:09:25.249" style="s2">so let&#39;s be able to care careful here</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.819" end="01:09:28.940" style="s2">and let&#39;s try to to realize that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.249" end="01:09:31.849" style="s2">cannot create the change we need to see</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.940" end="01:09:34.579" style="s2">by trying to be as I say well this</p>

<p begin="01:09:42.829" end="01:09:48.710" style="s2">the of course we want to move in a much</p>

<p begin="01:09:48.710" end="01:09:55.719" style="s2">trying to create these new models and</p>

<p begin="01:10:04.449" end="01:10:10.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve actually succeeded in finding a</p>

<p begin="01:10:20.080" end="01:10:26.410" style="s2">like farmers market I started using the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.260" end="01:10:29.410" style="s2">conventional currency very often the</p>

<p begin="01:10:36.250" end="01:10:41.710" style="s2">culture in many cases when they started</p>

<p begin="01:10:41.710" end="01:10:47.350" style="s2">because they were struggling so badly</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.660" end="01:10:49.719" style="s2">and someone had the idea let&#39;s try to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.350" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">a local market and I&#39;ve had the great</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.719" end="01:10:54.790" style="s2">joy of seeing how they suddenly find</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:56.710" style="s2">themselves in this new structure where</p>

<p begin="01:11:02.230" end="01:11:09.190" style="s2">exactly the same size so they say there</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.860" end="01:11:12.400" style="s2">is this sudden newly formed relationship</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.190" end="01:11:15.070" style="s2">and dialogue between more dreamy lefty</p>

<p begin="01:11:25.239" end="01:11:32.440" style="s2">extent as I say has been imposed on us</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.370" end="01:11:34.210" style="s2">by vested interests so and to wrap up I</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.440" end="01:11:37.989" style="s2">just want to bring attention back to</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.210" end="01:11:40.840" style="s2">your book and and well do you wanna just</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.989" end="01:11:42.310" style="s2">briefly like one thing that I would love</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.840" end="01:11:44.920" style="s2">to hear is at the very end the last</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.310" end="01:11:48.400" style="s2">chapter of the book is is a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.920" end="01:11:51.610" style="s2">you just had not so long ago with one of</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.400" end="01:11:55.960" style="s2">the the great elders of the movement and</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.610" end="01:11:58.540" style="s2">and particularly the the need to come</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.960" end="01:12:00.910" style="s2">back to the land and to re-engage with</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.540" end="01:12:04.550" style="s2">agriculture in a way that allows us to</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.910" end="01:12:07.880" style="s2">really put humanity back into</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.550" end="01:12:11.270" style="s2">nature as gardeners of landscape as</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.880" end="01:12:13.310" style="s2">protectors of landscape so can you just</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.270" end="01:12:15.290" style="s2">often memory maybe pull out a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.310" end="01:12:17.450" style="s2">highlights of that conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.290" end="01:12:19.220" style="s2">wendell berry and if there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.450" end="01:12:21.020" style="s2">else you want to say about the book and</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.220" end="01:12:23.150" style="s2">how to engage with your work</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.020" end="01:12:26.180" style="s2">more deeply it would be useful to share</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.150" end="01:12:28.430" style="s2">that with listeners well I&#39;ve known</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.180" end="01:12:31.610" style="s2">Wendell for a very long time he&#39;s on our</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.430" end="01:12:36.140" style="s2">advisory board and he&#39;s been one of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.610" end="01:12:39.380" style="s2">soul mates you know one thing I think in</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.140" end="01:12:41.420" style="s2">our conversation even now where we</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.380" end="01:12:44.840" style="s2">differ a little bit is that he hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.420" end="01:12:46.940" style="s2">been involved globally you know the way</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.840" end="01:12:49.310" style="s2">I have and so I used to slightly argue</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.940" end="01:12:52.100" style="s2">with him because he would say no only</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.310" end="01:12:53.810" style="s2">think locally and act locally you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.100" end="01:12:56.240" style="s2">saying but on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.810" end="01:12:57.860" style="s2">world I&#39;m seeing people who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.240" end="01:12:59.930" style="s2">anything about what&#39;s happening here</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.860" end="01:13:02.150" style="s2">being very misled about what we&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.930" end="01:13:06.980" style="s2">and and the other way around and this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.150" end="01:13:11.210" style="s2">feeding into this normal system so so</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.980" end="01:13:13.490" style="s2">that&#39;s partly death so that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.210" end="01:13:17.150" style="s2">have a slightly different point of view</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.490" end="01:13:20.840" style="s2">but he is of course one of the you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.150" end="01:13:23.060" style="s2">one of the absolute sort of pioneers and</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.840" end="01:13:26.000" style="s2">leaders of the localisation movement and</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.060" end="01:13:29.180" style="s2">it&#39;s just so thrilling to know that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.000" end="01:13:33.800" style="s2">still healthily and happily actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.180" end="01:13:36.320" style="s2">farming at his age and he&#39;s has got a</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.800" end="01:13:39.350" style="s2">great sense of humor and he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.320" end="01:13:42.620" style="s2">excellent writer so I really recommend</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.350" end="01:13:45.590" style="s2">if people haven&#39;t read his essays and</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.620" end="01:13:48.710" style="s2">books a wonderful writer and so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.590" end="01:13:50.330" style="s2">been a huge gift to the movement and</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.710" end="01:13:53.540" style="s2">it&#39;s thrilling to see a he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.330" end="01:13:58.160" style="s2">respected in thoughtful workers in</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.540" end="01:14:00.290" style="s2">America but very very wonderful and in</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.160" end="01:14:02.750" style="s2">terms of the book in general yeah it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.290" end="01:14:06.080" style="s2">different in that way and it&#39;s in my my</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.750" end="01:14:09.680" style="s2">sort of you know problem is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.080" end="01:14:12.140" style="s2">trying to to say something and to do</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.680" end="01:14:14.630" style="s2">something that it&#39;s extremely unusual I</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.140" end="01:14:17.090" style="s2">mean I would say unique I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.630" end="01:14:19.280" style="s2">anyone any any other voice</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.090" end="01:14:22.670" style="s2">another organization that has been</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.280" end="01:14:25.340" style="s2">promoting localization from a global</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.670" end="01:14:29.570" style="s2">perspective from global experience and</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.340" end="01:14:32.060" style="s2">for a global movement and and this has</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.570" end="01:14:35.599" style="s2">also led to what some people might think</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.060" end="01:14:39.080" style="s2">of as hypocrisy that we end up in my</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.599" end="01:14:42.349" style="s2">tiny organization organizing conferences</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.080" end="01:14:45.020" style="s2">and several different countries and</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.349" end="01:14:47.989" style="s2">several different continents and that we</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.020" end="01:14:50.060" style="s2">actually believe that people who want to</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.989" end="01:14:51.590" style="s2">try to understand what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.060" end="01:14:53.869" style="s2">the world and want to really do</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.590" end="01:14:56.239" style="s2">something to contribute we would</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.869" end="01:14:59.300" style="s2">actually urge them if possible to spend</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.239" end="01:15:00.469" style="s2">some time in both the least developed</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.300" end="01:15:02.960" style="s2">parts of the world and the most</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.469" end="01:15:06.020" style="s2">developed because that&#39;s I think where</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.960" end="01:15:09.889" style="s2">you get sort of clarity about the system</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.020" end="01:15:13.010" style="s2">at work in terms of yeah I feel like I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:18:49.080" end="01:18:53.520" style="s2">many people around the world waking up</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.760" end="01:18:55.590" style="s2">to that message and and there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.520" end="01:18:57.420" style="s2">like I like to call it the regeneration</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.590" end="01:18:59.520" style="s2">rising like playing with the the</p>

<p begin="01:18:59.520" end="01:19:03.840" style="s2">regenerates and and it&#39;s it&#39;s a call</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.980" end="01:19:07.170" style="s2">that people really are resonating with</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.840" end="01:19:09.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a brilliant who just made a</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.170" end="01:19:15.870" style="s2">documentary called 2040 that has the</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.870" end="01:19:18.239" style="s2">subtitle join the regeneration and at</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.870" end="01:19:21.630" style="s2">the conference in you do that so you</p>

<p begin="01:19:21.630" end="01:19:26.460" style="s2">I said earlier you know so you create</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.850" end="01:19:28.560" style="s2">that in the dominant narrative people</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.460" end="01:19:30.840" style="s2">who are not in any way connected to this</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.560" end="01:19:32.429" style="s2">movement they&#39;re being told the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.840" end="01:19:35.850" style="s2">and they feel it they&#39;re saying this</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.429" end="01:19:37.949" style="s2">human race is like a cancer I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.850" end="01:19:41.040" style="s2">know we decide to extinguish ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.949" end="01:19:44.489" style="s2">and the fact that we actually need</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.040" end="01:19:46.949" style="s2">people on the land and I on this crowded</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.489" end="01:19:50.010" style="s2">planet where so much damage has been</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.949" end="01:19:52.620" style="s2">inflicted by the system we actually need</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.010" end="01:19:54.449" style="s2">more people to care for every tree for</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.620" end="01:19:58.410" style="s2">every earth one foot for that</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.449" end="01:20:00.510" style="s2">regeneration and so once people connect</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.410" end="01:20:04.380" style="s2">to that and not part of some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.510" end="01:20:08.280" style="s2">productive meaningful activity and that</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.380" end="01:20:10.410" style="s2">it is yeah and every level deeply joyful</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.280" end="01:20:12.750" style="s2">and I&#39;m so glad that you are a colleague</p>

<p begin="01:20:31.560" end="01:20:35.460" style="s2">much longer than many and and and often</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.080" end="01:20:37.739" style="s2">not with getting enough of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.460" end="01:20:39.840" style="s2">recognition I still believe that there</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.739" end="01:20:43.560" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be in every Tesco in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.840" end="01:20:46.050" style="s2">country of the UK there wouldn&#39;t be food</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.560" end="01:20:48.630" style="s2">mileage stickers if you and Isaac hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.050" end="01:20:51.030" style="s2">started conversations about the power of</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.630" end="01:20:53.179" style="s2">local food and in distinguishing that</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.030" end="01:20:56.599" style="s2">actually local can be even more</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.179" end="01:20:59.269" style="s2">important than certified organic and</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.599" end="01:21:00.679" style="s2">those kind of conversations I personally</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.269" end="01:21:02.869" style="s2">believe that you&#39;ve been very</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.679" end="01:21:06.199" style="s2">influential in and taking that out to a</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.869" end="01:21:08.090" style="s2">lot of people who now use that language</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.199" end="01:21:11.599" style="s2">but have no idea that it came from</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.090" end="01:21:14.329" style="s2">impulses organization saying thank you</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.599" end="01:21:16.070" style="s2">so much because we haven&#39;t we also</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.329" end="01:21:20.959" style="s2">haven&#39;t done very much to promote</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.070" end="01:21:23.840" style="s2">ourselves it&#39;s been an absolute pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.959" end="01:21:30.050" style="s2">and maybe the one final question would</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.840" end="01:21:33.110" style="s2">be M despite everything would you say</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.050" end="01:21:34.459" style="s2">you still hopeful for because the last</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.110" end="01:21:36.320" style="s2">year has brought this particularly</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.459" end="01:21:39.229" style="s2">around climate change a kind of strange</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.320" end="01:21:42.019" style="s2">shift from arguing whether climate</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.229" end="01:21:46.070" style="s2">change was as important as some people</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.019" end="01:21:48.550" style="s2">or we all believe it is to suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.070" end="01:21:52.269" style="s2">people saying well it&#39;s all too late and</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.550" end="01:21:56.059" style="s2">doom and gloom and extinction and</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.269" end="01:21:58.939" style="s2">collapse is near all that and where it</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.059" end="01:22:01.789" style="s2">is positioning yourself in this dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.939" end="01:22:03.860" style="s2">where we can embrace collapse of a</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.789" end="01:22:06.289" style="s2">system that no longer serves but still</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.860" end="01:22:09.170" style="s2">happy hopeful that that we can turn the</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.289" end="01:22:11.059" style="s2">corner of becoming healers again and and</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.170" end="01:22:14.679" style="s2">building a future for all of life and</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.059" end="01:22:18.229" style="s2">for Humanity yes no I mean I definitely</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.679" end="01:22:20.900" style="s2">feel there is hope I am as I say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.229" end="01:22:23.030" style="s2">worried that this dominant system can</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.900" end="01:22:24.979" style="s2">continue to escalate and create a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.030" end="01:22:27.249" style="s2">damage so I see a certain sense of</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.979" end="01:22:30.889" style="s2">urgency in getting the word out and</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.249" end="01:22:34.130" style="s2">helping people make that transition into</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.889" end="01:22:36.709" style="s2">being part of this new movement which</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.130" end="01:22:38.179" style="s2">which I do see as a global movement in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.709" end="01:22:40.389" style="s2">way even though it consists of a</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.179" end="01:22:46.519" style="s2">multitude of different cultures and</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.389" end="01:22:50.179" style="s2">people&#39;s so I think that it&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.519" end="01:22:53.479" style="s2">to know that what we can do right now</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.179" end="01:22:56.420" style="s2">that will make our lives happier and</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.479" end="01:22:59.689" style="s2">healthier is what we need to do for the</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.420" end="01:23:02.179" style="s2">long-term and let&#39;s not dwell too much</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.689" end="01:23:05.479" style="s2">in the distant future or even in</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.179" end="01:23:06.920" style="s2">tomorrow because we&#39;ve all well because</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.479" end="01:23:10.070" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned that</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.920" end="01:23:13.010" style="s2">really living in the present and and</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.070" end="01:23:15.050" style="s2">doing what we know is right is what we</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.010" end="01:23:19.610" style="s2">what makes us happy and what will make</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.050" end="01:23:21.530" style="s2">us below so once we learn those deeper</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.610" end="01:23:23.710" style="s2">spiritual essence of being in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.530" end="01:23:27.949" style="s2">present and doing what we know is right</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.710" end="01:23:28.670" style="s2">we&#39;re on a part that you think is a</p>

<p begin="01:23:28.670" end="01:23:34.880" style="s2">however we look at it absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.969" end="01:23:37.790" style="s2">it&#39;s the the doing will change as we</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.880" end="01:23:40.360" style="s2">change the being coming back into the</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.790" end="01:23:42.830" style="s2">present that is the presence and</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.360" end="01:23:47.360" style="s2">enacting from that joy of connecting</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.830" end="01:23:50.540" style="s2">with people in place I come back to that</p>
