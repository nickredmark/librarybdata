<p begin="00:00:06.160" end="00:00:09.599" style="s2">all right everybody</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.040" end="00:00:11.280" style="s2">welcome back i&#39;ve got a very exciting</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:13.440" style="s2">episode in store for you today i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:15.759" style="s2">sitting here with dr john verveiki</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.440" end="00:00:18.640" style="s2">john thank you so much for being here</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.759" end="00:00:22.000" style="s2">thank you eric for inviting me</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.640" end="00:00:24.720" style="s2">so you have been on my radar for a while</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.000" end="00:00:26.720" style="s2">after i was introduced through twitter</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.720" end="00:00:27.439" style="s2">to the awakening from the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.720" end="00:00:30.560" style="s2">series</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.439" end="00:00:32.960" style="s2">and subsequently inhaled all of that at</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.560" end="00:00:37.040" style="s2">a very rapid pace</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.960" end="00:00:40.239" style="s2">because it was a synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.040" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">of quite frankly a so much but b</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.239" end="00:00:45.440" style="s2">synthesized so well and so clearly that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">you know i really feel it should be</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.440" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">somewhere in the high school curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">to look at</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.680" end="00:00:56.239" style="s2">you know with with that i think</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.879" end="00:00:58.160" style="s2">part of the reason i really wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.239" end="00:00:59.600" style="s2">have this conversation today is a just</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.160" end="00:01:02.559" style="s2">introduce more people</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.600" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">to you to your ideas into your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.559" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">because it gives</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:08.000" style="s2">i think most importantly it gives mental</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:10.960" style="s2">frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.000" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">and it gives shared language so you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.960" end="00:01:13.520" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">digging in instead of just saying i</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.520" end="00:01:15.759" style="s2">notice a lot of people in this space</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:17.680" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.759" end="00:01:19.600" style="s2">you know things are things are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.680" end="00:01:21.520" style="s2">either inside or outside and i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.600" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know why but i know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.520" end="00:01:26.720" style="s2">i know it&#39;s off a little bit and having</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:31.040" style="s2">this language now just gives you</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.720" end="00:01:34.240" style="s2">such strong tools uh to approach it</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.040" end="00:01:34.640" style="s2">um so before we dive in because we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.240" end="00:01:37.520" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.640" end="00:01:39.040" style="s2">we have a fair list to cover um can you</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.520" end="00:01:40.960" style="s2">just give a bit of your background</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:42.320" style="s2">how you got to doing what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.960" end="00:01:44.799" style="s2">today</p>

<p begin="00:01:51.439" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">i i aspire to truly mean what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">about to say which is uh above and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.920" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">beyond</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:02.799" style="s2">being right about any particular claim</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">or any particular theory</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.799" end="00:02:08.080" style="s2">providing people with you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:09.759" style="s2">conceptual vocabulary and a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.080" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">grammar so that they can articulate and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.759" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">express</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">and reflect and communicate that is my</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:18.319" style="s2">primary goal in everything i&#39;m doing in</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:19.360" style="s2">everything i&#39;m doing so thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:22.959" style="s2">saying that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.360" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">it&#39;s much appreciated uh about me</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.959" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know where would be the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">appropriate thing to begin</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:34.840" style="s2">i was brought up in a religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">framework fundamentalist christianity</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.840" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">uh with only over a period of about 25</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">years have i come into what i consider</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">a properly ambivalent uh attitude</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">towards it um</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.840" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">in that initially of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:53.599" style="s2">um my attitude was because it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.000" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">traumatizing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">religious framework my attitude towards</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">it was a very antagonistic aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">atheistic rejection because of course it</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">had um</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">hurt me but um</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">your mother religion is like your mother</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">tongue uh you&#39;ll never</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">you may learn another language but you</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">you won&#39;t live in it the way you live</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">in your mother tongue right it&#39;s woven</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:19.599" style="s2">into the very fabric of your coming into</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.599" end="00:03:26.239" style="s2">and so that left</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:27.440" style="s2">in me especially in the in the figure of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:30.840" style="s2">jesus of nazareth</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.440" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">it left in me a kind of hunger</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.840" end="00:03:37.040" style="s2">for the depth</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">or at least what i perceived to be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.040" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">depth of life</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">and a depth of connectivity and a depth</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">that i didn&#39;t i would probably say i</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:48.159" style="s2">didn&#39;t experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">in that religion but that had been</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.159" end="00:03:53.200" style="s2">portended for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">and so i carried that hunger around</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">and i um</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">i it sort of led me to as i said to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:03.360" style="s2">atheism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">a deep kind of nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.360" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">which is where in my sort of uh early</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">adulthood i encountered um</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">in a very inarticulate way and i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:14.319" style="s2">lots of people have this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">encounter</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.319" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">perhaps that&#39;s some of their resonance</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">with my work but</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">i encountered what you might call the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">individually in a very intense but</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">co-hate and searing but</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">almost inexpressible manner um</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">and so i i was wrestling with that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">um you know i was reading some young um</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">i would have been just introduced to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:46.320" style="s2">young by uh the fiction of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">uh robertson davies and i was reading</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">some permanent hessa</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">i&#39;ve been introduced to uh buddhism uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:57.120" style="s2">and then i got into university and i met</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">uh plato and the figure of socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:02.000" style="s2">this had just</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">a titanic effect on me because</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.000" end="00:05:08.720" style="s2">it gave me the sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">of a a palpable</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.720" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">sense of uh of moving towards that kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">of connection</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">and meaning that i had felt portended</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">in my religious heritage but had</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:23.600" style="s2">actually not met and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">and i i saw him figure in the figure of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.600" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">an individual that of course i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">associate with that trauma because it</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:32.960" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">he was a new figure for me so i</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.960" end="00:05:36.479" style="s2">immediately took up this project of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.479" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">of wisdom you know in the sloppy way you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">when you&#39;re an undergraduate um and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:45.440" style="s2">that and that&#39;s not a criticism that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">how it should be done</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.440" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s how it&#39;s inevitably done um</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">but what happened to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">is very quickly that the figure of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">socrates the aspiration to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:58.560" style="s2">transcendence and to depth of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">and the cultivation of wisdom fall off</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.560" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">the academic table</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">and you don&#39;t talk about that anymore</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">you get all worried about epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">and skepticism and all this</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">very technical and argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:12.720" style="s2">i come to i came to value academic</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:15.199" style="s2">philosophy for its own sake because i</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.720" end="00:06:15.919" style="s2">i i found the tools it was affording me</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.199" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.919" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">and the stance of you know the meta</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.680" end="00:06:20.960" style="s2">scientific critique and the metacultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">critique and the meta-historical</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.960" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">boutique i found that all very valuable</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:26.880" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">because of the way i got into it i also</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">was deeply dissatisfied</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:36.880" style="s2">and so i undertook uh to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">try and find um</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.880" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">another avenue for the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:46.800" style="s2">and deep connection and deep meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:48.960" style="s2">so i took up a bunch of i you know i</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.800" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">guess sort of inspired by herman hesse</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.960" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">you know i got involved with um eastern</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:56.800" style="s2">wisdom practices and i was very</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">fortunate to be taught an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.800" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">practices i was taught</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:03.120" style="s2">the past meditation medic contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">tai chi chuan chi kung</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.120" end="00:07:07.599" style="s2">as this integrated ecology that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">the that&#39;s the birthplace of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.599" end="00:07:12.240" style="s2">of an ecology of practices and i i just</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:14.800" style="s2">found the dynamics of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.240" end="00:07:15.759" style="s2">powerful and transformative uh and in</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.800" end="00:07:18.319" style="s2">ways i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.759" end="00:07:20.000" style="s2">wasn&#39;t recognizing it i had i had</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.319" end="00:07:21.840" style="s2">powerful moments where other people were</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.000" end="00:07:24.479" style="s2">recognizing changes in me</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.840" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">before i recognized that and i saw this</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.479" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.680" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">and so two sort of streams were then</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:34.720" style="s2">going on in my life this academic stream</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:36.160" style="s2">uh and right and i got i finished my ma</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">in philosophy and i was just</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:43.120" style="s2">the dissatisfaction just got too great</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">and by that time a new discipline that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.120" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">opened up that incorporated philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:48.800" style="s2">but also did</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">lots of psychology and artificial</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">intelligence and linguistics and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:52.960" style="s2">anthropology and that was cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:54.720" style="s2">science so i went back</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.960" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">and did a specialist degree in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.720" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">science to get into that</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">while continuing on in in all of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:05.520" style="s2">you know uh embodiment practices that</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:07.599" style="s2">within the ecology of practices and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.520" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">what about the time i was done</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.599" end="00:08:11.919" style="s2">uh my cognitive science degree i started</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">teaching now because i had already done</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.919" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">philosophy i didn&#39;t have to do any</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">philosophy for my cog sci degree</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">so i ended up doing more psychology than</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:22.319" style="s2">people do for their psychology degree</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:23.280" style="s2">it was i was fully trained for doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.319" end="00:08:24.560" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.280" end="00:08:26.400" style="s2">as well so i started teaching some</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.560" end="00:08:28.879" style="s2">psychology courses and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.400" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">an introductory cog sci course and at</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.879" end="00:08:32.560" style="s2">about that time</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:33.760" style="s2">cog sci had come to a place in</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.560" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.760" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">where you could start talking about some</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">of the things</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">that were right like wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">and mindfulness and self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">and mystical experience and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">these two things that have been separate</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">came together uh for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">and then a a good friend and colleague</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">of mine</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">and somebody whose work i highly</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">recommend uh evan thompson was supposed</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">to teach a course on</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">buddhism and cogside that he couldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">it and so he recommended me</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">to teach it and i saw that i could bring</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">these two streams together to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">because that&#39;s what the course was about</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">buddhism and cogside bringing</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:15.279" style="s2">you know these two streams together and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:17.360" style="s2">then i thought</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.279" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">i could bring those together to address</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.360" end="00:09:21.600" style="s2">this problem that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve been wrestling on personally this</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.600" end="00:09:26.959" style="s2">meaning crisis and so i did the course</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">and then that eventually evolved over</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.959" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">time into the series</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:32.720" style="s2">and so this ongoing dialogue between</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.720" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">three figures within my psyche um</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:41.120" style="s2">socrates and ultimately the way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">dialogues which hopefully we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.120" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">about a bit today</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:47.279" style="s2">the buddha and the way of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.519" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">you know mystical experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.279" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">self transcendence and then i i was able</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">through them to return back to jesus</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:58.399" style="s2">and also the importance of dear logos</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">because he has</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.399" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">he had he is also a midwife of others</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">and there again the return to agape as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">way of life and that i could see that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">because i could understand it from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:13.920" style="s2">buddhist notion of compassion</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:16.320" style="s2">and so all these things uh came together</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.920" end="00:10:17.519" style="s2">with me with this new emerging and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.320" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.519" end="00:10:22.959" style="s2">powerful form of cognitive science um</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">and so that&#39;s how i got where i am</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.959" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">that&#39;s how i</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">am the the person i am</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">and that is why i&#39;m engaged in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">project that i&#39;m engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">wow so if that wasn&#39;t enough of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:37.279" style="s2">trailer to start watching the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">crisis i don&#39;t know what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.279" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">because that is fantastic i was actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:45.600" style="s2">talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:48.560" style="s2">someone last week who</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.600" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">came into kind of eastern philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">from physics and it seems that there</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:56.480" style="s2">seems to be a natural</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">gravity gravity there whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.480" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">studying</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">psychology in the mind or physics and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:02.800" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">there there always seems to be this</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">drift in those who study it deeply</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">buddhism and eastern philosophy again</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">there&#39;s something just about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:16.480" style="s2">understanding and right relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.480" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">fully that that just seems to happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:22.640" style="s2">quite naturally</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">and to have yeah to have to have you</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.640" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">articulate</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">some of those some of those concepts was</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:29.680" style="s2">just beautiful and it&#39;s actually i think</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:31.200" style="s2">one of the places we&#39;re going to start</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.680" end="00:11:33.519" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.200" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">we spoke earlier about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.519" end="00:11:35.839" style="s2">when i was thinking of what i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:38.959" style="s2">give people</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.839" end="00:11:40.160" style="s2">with this it was mostly three things one</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.959" end="00:11:41.600" style="s2">i wanted to give them something they</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.160" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">could walk</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.600" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">out with right after listening this</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">basically changed</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">or something they could put into</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">practice or at least</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">see differently the second was</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">some increased language a new vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:11:58.320" style="s2">that they can</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">orient themselves with and the third is</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.320" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">that i really want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">elucidate and dig into the religion</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion here</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">the stealing the culture and what what</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">moving forward with that actually looks</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">like in practice but</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">to give to give an example one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">things this was a strange</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:18.240" style="s2">this is actually something you speak</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">about in in the series where there are</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.240" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">some things that come</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:24.320" style="s2">into your life that just jump out at you</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">they shine differently that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.320" end="00:12:28.399" style="s2">for me for me this was almost like an</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:30.320" style="s2">alarm like it was like this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.399" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">this is extremely important dig into</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.320" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">this more and it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:39.279" style="s2">one of your lectures on dukkha</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">the buddhist concept of dukkha and how</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.279" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:44.399" style="s2">leads into uh what is known as</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.399" end="00:12:50.800" style="s2">um that is that is i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:52.720" style="s2">those two concepts um i think is one</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.800" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">thing we could give people</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.720" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">that would shift their life dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.760" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you need much more of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.399" end="00:13:02.800" style="s2">foundation than that but could we start</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:05.360" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.800" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">a talking about what that is and what</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.360" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">narrowing implies sure um what do you</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">want me to talk a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">the general background of dukkha and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:17.839" style="s2">then use that as a way of articulating</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">because i see reciprocal narrowing as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.839" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">component of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:22.560" style="s2">dukkha maybe if i gave that framework</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:25.440" style="s2">that would be</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.560" end="00:13:25.839" style="s2">helpful overall yeah it would be ideal</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.440" end="00:13:30.000" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.839" end="00:13:32.839" style="s2">great thank you uh so the buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.000" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">notion of dukkha is often translated as</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.839" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">and we tend to hear this incorrectly we</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:42.720" style="s2">tend to hear this almost</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">as a synonym for pain</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s similar to the way the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:47.680" style="s2">word mad now for us has become a synonym</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">for angry</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.680" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">whereas of course mad means insanity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">one of the things that can make you</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">insane</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">right it&#39;s anger right um yeah so in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">similar way we should see suffering</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">uh and and the way you can know this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">the case by the way it&#39;s by paying</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">to the metaphors that the buddha uses to</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">describe</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">they&#39;re largely metaphors of</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.360" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">imprisonment</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">entrapment not being able to move a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:17.199" style="s2">forward stackedness and so you should</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">see suffering more as a loss of agency</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">rather than simply pain now pain can rob</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">you of agency</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">but many other things can rob you of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:25.199" style="s2">agency and so you have to really broaden</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.880" end="00:14:27.199" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">your notion of dukkha and what we want</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.199" end="00:14:31.120" style="s2">to ask is what well what are the general</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:34.160" style="s2">principles by which people lose</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.120" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">agency buddha the buddha said is no</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">matter where</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">you get you said like the ocean no</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">matter where you dip into it</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">you&#39;ll taste salt no matter where you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">dip into his teaching you&#39;ll taste</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">freedom which is the restoration of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.440" end="00:14:47.680" style="s2">agency</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:49.120" style="s2">so how do we lose agency well the idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.680" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">of dukkha is</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.120" end="00:14:54.079" style="s2">uh i for me what what the buddha is</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">doing is he&#39;s articulating a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.079" end="00:14:57.920" style="s2">perennial problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">that human beings fall prey to which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">the very machinery that makes us</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">intelligently adaptive makes us</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">perpetually susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:08.000" style="s2">self-deceptive self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">and as a cognitive scientist i study</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.000" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">this deeply and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">and so i i&#39;m deeply convinced of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:16.000" style="s2">truth of this fundamental claim</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">that that&#39;s dukkha isn&#39;t sort of like an</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.000" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">external thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">like a devil that sort of sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">corrupts you it&#39;s that the very</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:23.920" style="s2">machinery</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:25.600" style="s2">that you depend upon for your agency is</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.920" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">also the same machinery</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.600" end="00:15:30.720" style="s2">that can subject you to a loss of agency</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">through self-deceptive self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.720" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:39.199" style="s2">and so what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:43.279" style="s2">dukkha it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.199" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">um that the adaptive machinery see</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.279" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">you have to understand that this</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:50.079" style="s2">adaptive machinery works</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">in a a dynamical fashion it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.079" end="00:15:54.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not like so when you&#39;re coming into</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">a scene your attention is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.320" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:15:59.680" style="s2">right you you&#39;re you can zoom into</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:00.560" style="s2">details you can zoom out to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.680" end="00:16:03.040" style="s2">picture</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.560" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">you can step back into your own mind you</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.040" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">can move forward to try and get to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">depths of my mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.839" end="00:16:09.040" style="s2">and you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is tweaking that because</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.040" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">it&#39;s largely a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:15.360" style="s2">self-organizing process</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:18.440" style="s2">right now what that</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.360" end="00:16:20.320" style="s2">means is the the the that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.440" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">self-organizational nature</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.320" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">the way your cognition dynamically feeds</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">by itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">also means that you can get into what i</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:32.560" style="s2">call uh parasitic processing</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:34.800" style="s2">in which some some event happens to you</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.560" end="00:16:36.079" style="s2">and then that self-organizing process</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.800" end="00:16:37.680" style="s2">you people don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.079" end="00:16:39.040" style="s2">immediately what i&#39;m talking about we</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">even have this language we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.040" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">i get into an anxiety spiral right the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:47.600" style="s2">self-worth i start to ruminate or my</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.199" end="00:16:48.480" style="s2">mind starts to race or i find that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.600" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">getting right</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.480" end="00:16:51.600" style="s2">and so your mind this parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.600" end="00:16:58.240" style="s2">the the self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">nature of your adaptive cognition</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.240" end="00:17:03.120" style="s2">can also capture you like a parasite</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:04.799" style="s2">and the fact that it&#39;s adaptive means</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard for you to try and get</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.799" end="00:17:07.439" style="s2">rid of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">because as you try and intervene and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">stop</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">when you&#39;re ruminating well i shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">be thinking that way that doesn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:17.360" style="s2">anything because it just reorganizes</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:19.439" style="s2">yeah okay so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.360" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">that i&#39;m going to try and put three</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.439" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">pieces together</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:24.240" style="s2">so please be patient with me so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">got this parasitic processing</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.240" end="00:17:27.679" style="s2">the other thing people can do is they</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:30.799" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.679" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">sort of deeply confused about</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.799" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">that dynamic relationship between them</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:36.640" style="s2">and the environment</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:39.039" style="s2">right so what do i mean by that this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:42.320" style="s2">a notion from eric from</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.039" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">this is the notion that we um we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:45.600" style="s2">existential modes i mean that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.919" end="00:17:47.360" style="s2">broader notion from existentialism</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.600" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">that means whenever i come into any</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.360" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">and this is a part of that adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">machinery i was just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:17:55.280" style="s2">right that self-organizing adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:57.039" style="s2">machinery i</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.280" end="00:17:59.039" style="s2">i in a dynamical fashion when i come</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.039" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">into any situation i assume</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">a particular identity and i assign a</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:06.559" style="s2">bunch of identities so right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:08.320" style="s2">i am the professor and you are</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">right the interviewer which of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.320" end="00:18:11.840" style="s2">you&#39;re much more than that and i hope</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:13.679" style="s2">i&#39;m much more than just a professor</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:14.880" style="s2">but i&#39;m assuming an identity i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">assigning an identity</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.880" end="00:18:18.720" style="s2">and i&#39;m doing that to sculpt the space</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:22.320" style="s2">that i&#39;m working in</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.720" end="00:18:24.320" style="s2">is that okay does that make sense okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:25.520" style="s2">now what from talked about is when we do</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.320" end="00:18:28.720" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.520" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">process of co-identification we can do</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.720" end="00:18:30.559" style="s2">it in</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:32.160" style="s2">we can do it around different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.559" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">needs we can order</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.160" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">we can organize that mode around the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.720" end="00:18:37.120" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:39.039" style="s2">needs these are needs that are met by</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.120" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">having things like having water having</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.039" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">oxygen having food</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">and what i want there is i want to i</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:46.000" style="s2">want to assign i want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.760" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">assume the role of a manipulator and a</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.000" end="00:18:50.080" style="s2">controller because i need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:51.760" style="s2">control to manipulate water or i&#39;m dead</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">and i need to assign categorical</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.760" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">identities oh that&#39;s water oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">also water</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.320" end="00:18:57.760" style="s2">right and so things have their</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">categorical identity</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.760" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">so that i can easily manipulate them i</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">can easily replace them</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:04.880" style="s2">i can&#39;t use that water all that water</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:06.480" style="s2">over there will do right</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:08.559" style="s2">and so the having mode is great it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.480" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">this control and manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.559" end="00:19:11.679" style="s2">in terms of things categorical identity</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.640" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">uber calls it an</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.679" end="00:19:15.360" style="s2">i it relationship and again there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:17.200" style="s2">nothing wrong with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.360" end="00:19:18.880" style="s2">but you also have needs that are met not</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.200" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">by having and controlling</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.880" end="00:19:23.840" style="s2">these are net needs that are met by</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:25.440" style="s2">becoming by developing</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.840" end="00:19:27.200" style="s2">prime calls when they&#39;re your being</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.440" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">needs because they&#39;re met by you being a</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.200" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">certain way</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.840" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">like i need to be mature i need to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">wiser</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">i need to be in love and there</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">i&#39;m not trying to control and manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">things and i&#39;m trying to do something</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">else i&#39;m trying to enter into right</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">relationship with things</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">right relationship and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:49.840" style="s2">when i am with this woman who i&#39;m deeply</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">in love with</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.840" end="00:19:53.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t relate to her categorically in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:55.039" style="s2">manipulative fashion</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:56.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t say i&#39;m with you because you</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.039" end="00:19:58.559" style="s2">remind me of all other women and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.720" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">therefore you&#39;re easily replaceable if i</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.559" end="00:20:01.360" style="s2">need to replace you</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:02.640" style="s2">and i can control and manipulate you and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.360" end="00:20:04.799" style="s2">consume you as i will</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.640" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">now that&#39;s a disaster and i&#39;m never</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.799" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">going to be in love</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">to be in love means to not approach this</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:13.679" style="s2">i yet but approach them i thought now</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:16.400" style="s2">what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">is we can get modally confused we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.400" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">get morally confused in</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:24.960" style="s2">what i mean by that we can try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">satisfy our being needs but within the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.960" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">having modes</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">so instead of being mature we have a car</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:33.760" style="s2">instead of being in love we have sex</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">right instead of being wise we have lots</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.760" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">nifty propositions we can assert</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">and that modal confusion will keep us</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">spiritually hungry we will be frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">because we&#39;re not meeting the being</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">needs okay so let&#39;s say we&#39;re modelly</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">confused</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:53.200" style="s2">and then within and notice how that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.640" end="00:20:56.200" style="s2">form</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.200" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">of parasitic processing it&#39;s adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.200" end="00:21:00.240" style="s2">self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:01.039" style="s2">that&#39;s coupling me to the world in a in</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.240" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">a way</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.039" end="00:21:04.640" style="s2">that is deeply self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:07.200" style="s2">self-destruction but i&#39;m not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.640" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">so i&#39;m caught up in this that leads me</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.200" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">to the third component</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:19.360" style="s2">right the parasitic processing and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">modal confusion</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.360" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">i&#39;m assigning and assuming identities in</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.480" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">a way that the following thing is</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">occurring</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">and this is a notion taken from mark</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">lewis&#39;s ideas of what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:32.000" style="s2">addiction</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">so let&#39;s talk about addiction first</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:35.919" style="s2">let&#39;s say i take the alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:37.679" style="s2">the alcohol removes some of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.919" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">suffering and distress</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.679" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s it&#39;s temporarily</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.240" end="00:21:43.840" style="s2">alleviate</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:45.760" style="s2">alleviating but it&#39;s actually it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.840" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a very self-deceptive thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.760" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">because it actually is impairing me</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:51.200" style="s2">right and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.880" end="00:21:52.960" style="s2">my cognitive flexibility goes down i</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.200" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">can&#39;t solve as many problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">and so the options for me in the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:58.000" style="s2">goes down the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:22:00.400" style="s2">narrows and then that&#39;s more threatening</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">to me right notice my freedom is going</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.400" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">away notice my freedom is going away</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:06.240" style="s2">the world is threatening to me and oh no</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:07.120" style="s2">so now i&#39;m distressed so i rely on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.240" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.120" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">a little bit more and i get narrowed a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">right and and that&#39;s alleviating because</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.120" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t notice</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.159" end="00:22:17.280" style="s2">oh but now the world is narrower and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:19.760" style="s2">see what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.280" end="00:22:21.520" style="s2">the world and my agency are reciprocally</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.760" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">narrowing until eventually</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.520" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">the world can be no other than it is and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">i can be no other than</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">i am and that is addiction and that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:33.679" style="s2">the complete</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:36.640" style="s2">loss of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.679" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">so if you have right parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.640" end="00:22:41.039" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:43.120" style="s2">working within modal confusion that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.039" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">brings about a reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.120" end="00:22:46.799" style="s2">that sucks away and robs all of your</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:49.600" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.799" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">that&#39;s dukkha and this is not because of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">some strange or bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">influence it&#39;s because your cognition is</p>

<p begin="00:23:00.880" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">self-deception they are subjecting you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:06.320" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:08.320" style="s2">modal confusion and they are subjecting</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.320" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">you to reciprocal narrowing and you get</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.320" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">locked in to do good</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.679" end="00:23:13.600" style="s2">but here&#39;s the point and i said this to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">mark</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.600" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">in person because he&#39;s a friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">good friend actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:20.559" style="s2">good colleague if reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:24.000" style="s2">is possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">then so is reciprocal opening and if i</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.000" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">can be morally confused i can be morally</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">awake</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:34.000" style="s2">i can wake up and remember how to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">in the bn mode as i reciprocally open</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.000" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">my identity and the identity of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:41.200" style="s2">world and as i do</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">that i can become more and more aware</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.200" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">of my parasitic processing i can i can</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">interactive dynamical system that can</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">counteract</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.880" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">all of that machinery and reorient it</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.960" end="00:23:57.919" style="s2">a more like a more life enhancing way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.919" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">that&#39;s wisdom and that&#39;s the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:07.840" style="s2">practices i was talking about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">and so wisdom and a deeper connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:12.799" style="s2">to oneself</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">and the world and each other it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:15.679" style="s2">possible and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:17.760" style="s2">that wisdom could be comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.679" end="00:24:20.799" style="s2">enough that one was</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.760" end="00:24:23.840" style="s2">reliably no longer totally confused</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.799" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">reliably capable of dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.840" end="00:24:28.080" style="s2">parasitic processing</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2">reliably capable of getting into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.080" end="00:24:32.720" style="s2">flowing connection</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">with the world and other people</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:36.640" style="s2">that would be enlightenment i would</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:38.559" style="s2">argue at least that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:41.520" style="s2">understanding enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.559" end="00:24:43.120" style="s2">yeah yeah i&#39;ve also actually recently i</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:46.640" style="s2">just heard you use um</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.120" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">basically extended flow state also as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">as a label you could use for reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">opening yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">yeah that is just it&#39;s so extremely</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:56.400" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">because for a few things there are a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.400" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">number of ways that&#39;s extremely powerful</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">one is that it seems like in common</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:05.039" style="s2">culture we most</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:07.120" style="s2">people know the term downward spiral</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">if you said it to them and almost</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.120" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">some sort of addict in their head when</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:15.120" style="s2">they hear that</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">but if you then you know propose upward</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.120" end="00:25:19.520" style="s2">spiral</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:21.679" style="s2">that that term is very</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.520" end="00:25:23.520" style="s2">very rarely spoken and it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">one implies the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.520" end="00:25:26.960" style="s2">if it&#39;s possible to get stuck on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">roller coaster going down it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.960" end="00:25:33.120" style="s2">to get stuck on one going up as well</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:34.880" style="s2">very much and the thing is our culture</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.120" end="00:25:36.159" style="s2">i mean i agree with arthur versus lewis</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.880" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">whose work i recommend</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.159" end="00:25:40.880" style="s2">you know that the um the the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">grammar of spirituality in the west is</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.880" end="00:25:45.279" style="s2">neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.400" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">and neoplatonism took had a term for</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.279" end="00:25:47.679" style="s2">this which it took from plato which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:49.279" style="s2">anagage</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.679" end="00:25:52.400" style="s2">right and this is the ascent out of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.279" end="00:25:56.159" style="s2">cave and this was a pervasive notion</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.400" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">within our wisdom tradition um</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.159" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">you know at the the journey of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">to god and saint bonaventure the neople</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">neoplatonic christianity had it as well</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">but with the loss of that tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:10.640" style="s2">i am not</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">doing some sort of you know crypto</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.640" end="00:26:13.679" style="s2">proselytizing for christianity here that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:14.799" style="s2">is not what i am doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.679" end="00:26:16.960" style="s2">i&#39;m going to say that again that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.799" end="00:26:20.159" style="s2">what i&#39;m doing i&#39;m also not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.960" end="00:26:22.400" style="s2">dismiss christianity i i hope that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.159" end="00:26:23.679" style="s2">i&#39;m dialogically in right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">with people who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.679" end="00:26:27.200" style="s2">cultivating wisdom and enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:29.679" style="s2">christianity i want to throw no</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">obstacle in their way but i am not doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.679" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">that but what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:36.480" style="s2">when we lost that when we lost that</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:39.600" style="s2">tradition that wisdom tradition</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.480" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">and those wisdom institutions we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.600" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">carry around in our mind</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">the model of the monk the way as you</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">said we carry around the model of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.520" end="00:26:48.279" style="s2">adam</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">and our culture doesn&#39;t give us that</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.279" end="00:26:54.480" style="s2">acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:57.200" style="s2">literature right so there you go</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.480" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.200" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">again just having these frames</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:02.240" style="s2">can shift can shift so much and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.600" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">also why</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.240" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">you know i think a very unfair criticism</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">brought up for addicts is there&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:11.679" style="s2">this offhand like oh yeah well why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:13.440" style="s2">they just do it differently</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.679" end="00:27:14.720" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s like it&#39;s not that simple</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.440" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">to your point it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.720" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">static it&#39;s not this like bug in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">system it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">as much as you can work against it it</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">can work against you</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:27.039" style="s2">and that becomes the hardest literally</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:29.360" style="s2">like the hardest thing to do like</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.039" end="00:27:31.200" style="s2">you see this in in some movies or</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.360" end="00:27:33.919" style="s2">cartoons where the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.200" end="00:27:34.880" style="s2">the hero has to face the dark duplicate</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.919" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.880" end="00:27:38.080" style="s2">who is matched in all the skills it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">basically like that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.080" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2">yeah strong as strong as you are it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2">against you</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not as simple as like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:48.799" style="s2">well you should just snap your fingers</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">and again even even that frame i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.799" end="00:27:53.120" style="s2">if we could take that culturally and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">approach that to individuals with mental</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.120" end="00:27:55.200" style="s2">illness or addiction or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:27:57.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.200" end="00:27:58.880" style="s2">even that shifts the momentum in such a</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.840" end="00:28:01.760" style="s2">way that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">makes it extremely that&#39;s why i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.760" end="00:28:05.440" style="s2">mark&#39;s work is so important</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">so i think mark&#39;s work is so important</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.440" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">the way he&#39;s reframing the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:11.440" style="s2">addiction</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.320" end="00:28:12.080" style="s2">not as a disease but as an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.440" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">embedded</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.080" end="00:28:17.279" style="s2">inactive cycle of learning</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">that is i think really centrally</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:20.080" style="s2">important i can&#39;t remember i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:22.720" style="s2">recommend his work enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.080" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">um i think that&#39;s really important i</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.720" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">mean mark has done so much good work</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">but if he&#39;s remembered for anything and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:30.080" style="s2">this happens at the culmination of his</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">career so that&#39;s good for him</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.080" end="00:28:33.440" style="s2">um but um if he&#39;s remembered for</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">anything i hope</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">i hope people uh remember him for that</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">and that and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">take note of that here&#39;s the thing i</p>

<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">people like socrates and the buddha are</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.919" end="00:28:47.039" style="s2">saying to us</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:49.840" style="s2">is the difference between us and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.039" end="00:28:53.600" style="s2">addict is only one of degree not a kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.840" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">we are also entrapped in multiple ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.600" end="00:28:57.360" style="s2">and i&#39;m including myself i have no</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:59.039" style="s2">privileged position here we are also</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.360" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">entrapped in ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.039" end="00:29:03.840" style="s2">uh that we are not aware of only we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:05.600" style="s2">only indirectly aware of them</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.840" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">in how we suffer and this will allow me</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.600" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">to circle back that pervasive sense you</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:13.520" style="s2">the in the meaning crisis the things</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:16.640" style="s2">something is just not right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.520" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">gnawing away at everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.640" end="00:29:20.720" style="s2">that&#39;s your indication that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:24.159" style="s2">something deeply analogous</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.720" end="00:29:25.600" style="s2">to like the the world the reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:28.799" style="s2">self-world narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.600" end="00:29:30.480" style="s2">of the atoms yeah and then you know this</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.799" end="00:29:32.799" style="s2">is why the first noble truth is</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.480" end="00:29:34.799" style="s2">all life is suffering right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.799" end="00:29:37.919" style="s2">you are constantly threatened</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.799" end="00:29:38.640" style="s2">by this it it lurks it lurks in each</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.919" end="00:29:41.360" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.640" end="00:29:42.159" style="s2">waiting for the cascade to begin and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:44.559" style="s2">glad</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.159" end="00:29:46.640" style="s2">i&#39;m glad yeah go ahead i just want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.559" end="00:29:48.159" style="s2">say one thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.640" end="00:29:49.520" style="s2">the comprehensiveness of this that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.159" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">put your finger on is really important i</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.520" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">just want to flag this for people</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">because there is a tendency in our</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:57.039" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:29:57.679" style="s2">to try to respond to this in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.039" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">seems</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.679" end="00:30:00.880" style="s2">correct it seems and it seems even</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">spiritual to people</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.880" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s deeply misleading right and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:08.399" style="s2">this is the idea that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:09.039" style="s2">aspect of their psyche that is the safe</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.399" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.039" end="00:30:15.200" style="s2">from dukkha oh wow but my gut</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.080" end="00:30:15.840" style="s2">or my intuition no no my heart no no my</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.200" end="00:30:19.039" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.840" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">no no my my intellect no no my ex</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.039" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">and if you right any attempt to deify</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.120" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">any aspect of the psyche as the place</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.919" end="00:30:30.559" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">the safe harbor from all of the tempest</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.559" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">of dukkha</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:35.279" style="s2">is a fundamental mistake right it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.399" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.279" end="00:30:39.200" style="s2">that&#39;s why the eightfold path is offered</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">or where you get all of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.200" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">the whole project around socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">the neoplatonic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">you have to that&#39;s why and this is to</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">give you</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">uh a a foreshadowing segue</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s why you need something as</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">comprehensive as a religion</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">uh to deal with this yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">that was a what would you call it that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:02.320" style="s2">was an underhand pitch</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.399" end="00:31:04.000" style="s2">that was a setup right there and we we</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">are certainly building up to</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.000" end="00:31:10.320" style="s2">uh to knock that out of the park um</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:12.640" style="s2">but there there are some other</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.320" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">foundations i want to lay as we lead up</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:15.679" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:16.799" style="s2">because again i think we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">make the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.799" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">i&#39;m just going off camera for a sec</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:22.480" style="s2">because i realize that my power is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">plugged in</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.480" end="00:31:28.240" style="s2">good catch there we go this leads</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:29.279" style="s2">quite leads quite nicely into the next</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.240" end="00:31:30.880" style="s2">the next um</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.279" end="00:31:32.559" style="s2">kind of term i wanted to bring up for</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:35.120" style="s2">people because it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.559" end="00:31:36.799" style="s2">dukkha is one of these which is you use</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.120" end="00:31:40.320" style="s2">the term perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.799" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">that humans face a lot and i noticed</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.320" end="00:31:42.720" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">in my own life where you know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.720" end="00:31:47.279" style="s2">my friends and i will talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.720" end="00:31:48.640" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s just like well and</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.279" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">we&#39;ll give an answer to a problem that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.640" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">someone&#39;s facing and it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.120" end="00:31:55.120" style="s2">why are we just discovering this now you</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">know why did it take me</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.120" end="00:31:58.159" style="s2">into my late 20s to figure this out and</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like well it</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.159" end="00:32:02.000" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have people wrote this down a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.000" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve just lost the we&#39;ve just lost the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:08.159" style="s2">practices we&#39;ve lost the ideas we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:10.559" style="s2">lost the scripture that actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.159" end="00:32:11.679" style="s2">afforded those answers much earlier but</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.559" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">so can we give a</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.679" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">can we give an overview of um and i</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.320" end="00:32:16.320" style="s2">would argue maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:17.760" style="s2">maybe you would say something</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:18.880" style="s2">differently that that dukkha and</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.760" end="00:32:21.600" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.880" end="00:32:21.919" style="s2">are one of the perennial problems faced</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.600" end="00:32:24.480" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.919" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">humanity are there any uh can you list</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.480" end="00:32:28.880" style="s2">some others or just</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">yeah and i think you&#39;re the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.880" end="00:32:35.519" style="s2">the scriptures i mean one way</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.120" end="00:32:38.080" style="s2">of um re-capturing</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:39.279" style="s2">i mean and jordan peterson brought uh i</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.080" end="00:32:41.840" style="s2">mean i have like</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.279" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">i have i have a very complex relation</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.840" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">with jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.799" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">he&#39;s a colleague and a friendly</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">colleague and he supports my work</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2">and i think there&#39;s a lot of insight in</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:50.080" style="s2">him but i also have criticisms of his</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:52.240" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.080" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">but i do think one of the things he did</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.240" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">that was of great value was to reawaken</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:32:59.679" style="s2">via jung you should have also done</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:02.240" style="s2">corban as well but</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:03.519" style="s2">bayern young to the importance of myth</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.240" end="00:33:04.399" style="s2">because i think one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.519" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">myth does</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.399" end="00:33:08.799" style="s2">for us is it gives us a dramatic and for</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:10.960" style="s2">reasons we&#39;ll talk about later</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.799" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">we need a dramatic and not a merely</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.960" end="00:33:14.480" style="s2">propositional</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:15.840" style="s2">presentation of these perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.480" end="00:33:18.320" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">and so for example for every good hero</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.320" end="00:33:21.039" style="s2">myth</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:23.120" style="s2">which you know is the perennial problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.039" end="00:33:26.399" style="s2">of you know self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.120" end="00:33:26.960" style="s2">and going through uh having to face very</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.399" end="00:33:29.120" style="s2">serious</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.960" end="00:33:30.399" style="s2">frame breaking and loss in order to</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.120" end="00:33:32.240" style="s2">afford that kind of growth</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.399" end="00:33:33.519" style="s2">there&#39;s also a counterbalancing myth of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.240" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">hubris and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.519" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">what weight remember that you&#39;re mortal</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.360" end="00:33:38.880" style="s2">you&#39;ll never be a god</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:40.159" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t mean that you you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.880" end="00:33:41.760" style="s2">you&#39;ll keep progressing towards it no</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.159" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">you&#39;ll always be in your very bones</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.760" end="00:33:43.840" style="s2">immortal</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">you&#39;ll always be threatened by dukkha</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.840" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">etc so i think myth is an important</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:52.880" style="s2">uh to remember so</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">if you look at myth and you look at your</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.880" end="00:33:56.399" style="s2">sacred scriptures you can see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:59.679" style="s2">perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.399" end="00:34:02.559" style="s2">uh that come up a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.679" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">and so let&#39;s take let&#39;s take a myth that</p>

<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">myth but it is and it&#39;s myth in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.159" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">sense i&#39;m using it shakespeare&#39;s hamlet</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.240" end="00:34:13.839" style="s2">like why why do people keep reading</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.000" end="00:34:16.800" style="s2">about this danish guy</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.839" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">right from from like you know the 17th</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.800" end="00:34:20.399" style="s2">century like who</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:21.679" style="s2">who cares well because this is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.399" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">perennial problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.679" end="00:34:24.960" style="s2">human beings are beset with their</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:28.159" style="s2">they&#39;re gifted by</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.960" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">and beset by being self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.159" end="00:34:32.800" style="s2">and that means we right if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.280" end="00:34:34.800" style="s2">hamlet</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:36.639" style="s2">he towers above the people around him</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.800" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">and shakespeare is using him</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.639" end="00:34:39.679" style="s2">as an exemplar of this human capacity</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:42.079" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.679" end="00:34:43.599" style="s2">we can rise above our impulses unlike</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.079" end="00:34:46.000" style="s2">many other animals</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.599" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">we are not merely what frankfurt calls</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.000" end="00:34:49.760" style="s2">wantons</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:51.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t just like because i just give</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.760" end="00:34:52.800" style="s2">in to every impulse my impulses are</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.440" end="00:34:54.960" style="s2">contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.800" end="00:34:56.720" style="s2">right they are they&#39;re they undermine</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.960" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">each other right i want it i want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.720" end="00:35:00.400" style="s2">look good and be sexually attractive but</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">i want the chocolate cake and oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.400" end="00:35:03.440" style="s2">right and all that sort of impulsivity</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.440" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">and so we can and this is bellman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:10.480" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:11.839" style="s2">i can i have this capacity of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.480" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s the capacity that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.839" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">mindfulness trains right i can step back</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:18.400" style="s2">and look at my own perspective</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">and we&#39;ll talk about later why that</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.400" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">require notice how that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:22.960" style="s2">another kind of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">perspectival knowing and we&#39;ll come into</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.960" end="00:35:26.640" style="s2">that i hope but i can step back and look</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">at my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.640" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">and you could say well i</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">this has to do with the logistics of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">psyche i won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:41.040" style="s2">give much of my resources and my energy</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:43.119" style="s2">to this impulse right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.040" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">and i&#39;ll try and redirect towards this</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.119" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">impulse and we can do all that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:48.720" style="s2">and and you know thank god we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:50.400" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.720" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">we would be sort of monstrous if we</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.400" end="00:35:53.320" style="s2">could but the problem with that with</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.320" end="00:35:57.599" style="s2">self-consciousness that ability to step</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">back and reflect</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.599" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">is it disconnects us uh from that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">machinery</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">because like when i&#39;m thirsty and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.599" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">seriously kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:10.079" style="s2">impulsively i don&#39;t i&#39;m not aware of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:11.520" style="s2">thirst</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.079" end="00:36:13.680" style="s2">i&#39;m aware through my thirst of</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.520" end="00:36:15.839" style="s2">everything right</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.680" end="00:36:17.280" style="s2">things i&#39;m seeing the world thirstily</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.839" end="00:36:17.839" style="s2">but when i step back and look at my</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:19.599" style="s2">thirst</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.839" end="00:36:21.359" style="s2">the perspective from which i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.599" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">at my thirst is not one of thirst</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.359" end="00:36:24.720" style="s2">it&#39;s perhaps one of curiosity or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">one of frustration</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.720" end="00:36:28.480" style="s2">right but it&#39;s a different motivation</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:30.480" style="s2">and so i&#39;m now actually disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.480" end="00:36:32.240" style="s2">from the motivational energy of thirst</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.480" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2">i&#39;m no longer seeking for water</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.240" end="00:36:35.280" style="s2">but you know what i can do with that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">curiosity i can step back and look at</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:37.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">and now i&#39;m no longer curious about my</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.440" end="00:36:43.599" style="s2">thirst right and i can</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:46.400" style="s2">right and so i i can get caught up</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.599" end="00:36:48.320" style="s2">right in this perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">completely disconnects me</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.320" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">from my motivational machinery so</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:59.119" style="s2">this and this is hamlet&#39;s tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:37:01.680" style="s2">right he keeps thinking and reflecting</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.119" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">and reflecting on his reflecting and</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.680" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">acting about</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:05.920" style="s2">and people are dying around him and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">going insane around him and</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.920" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">there&#39;s this tragedy building around him</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">right and so our self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">and there&#39;s a perennial problem of</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">how do we deal with that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:23.359" style="s2">and that interacts with other like i</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">mentioned it</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.359" end="00:37:26.480" style="s2">you know we are self we are subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:28.800" style="s2">of our death</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.480" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">in our mortality in a way that other</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:34.400" style="s2">how do we deal with that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">perennial problems around absurdity my</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.400" end="00:37:39.920" style="s2">ability to self transcend</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:41.920" style="s2">means i can</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.920" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">rise above myself to i get to this</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.920" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">cosmic perspective and now it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:49.440" style="s2">from that cosmic perspective all of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">minutia of my own motivation and</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.440" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">concerns seems so insignificant</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:56.240" style="s2">so trivial life seems absurd</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">and this of course is something</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.240" end="00:37:59.839" style="s2">developed very well</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.839" end="00:38:01.839" style="s2">um in the work of camus i&#39;m reading the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.839" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">plague right now because of covet</p>

<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:17.880" style="s2">we reflect because we are perspectival</p>

<p begin="00:38:41.760" end="00:38:45.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a family of problems loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.560" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">or culture</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.359" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">shock or future shock in which we feel</p>

<p begin="00:39:14.160" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">is a place to look like hamlet for where</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:29.760" style="s2">the way the way it&#39;s come up for me is</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.560" end="00:39:32.240" style="s2">uh due to your human nature due to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.760" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">fact that you are a self-aware human</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.240" end="00:39:36.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a host and when when you just</p>

<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:02.560" style="s2">is why it loops back to myth and this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.560" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">why i think jordan peterson has grown a</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">little bit which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:09.040" style="s2">that is for the most part outside of the</p>

<p begin="00:40:09.040" end="00:40:14.400" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter that i know you exist</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.720" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">that tells me nothing about how i should</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.400" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">relate to you</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">and whether i should feel threatened</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">should i feel happy like all that</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">and when that&#39;s taken when that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">confusion of how to relate to something</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:27.359" style="s2">applies to</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.280" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">yourself other people and everything</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">you end up in no man&#39;s land</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">you end up in just this void of</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.640" end="00:40:40.880" style="s2">what the fuck is going on like and</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:41.200" style="s2">it creates this that&#39;s why i think you</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.880" end="00:40:43.520" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.200" end="00:40:45.760" style="s2">things like the rise in mental health</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.520" end="00:40:47.280" style="s2">crisis you get the rise in nihilism you</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.760" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">just get this</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.280" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">what on earth and i think to the crux of</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">some of your work is</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:54.400" style="s2">when these perennial problems reach a</p>

<p begin="00:40:54.400" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">because we&#39;re we&#39;ve lost the the ways of</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:02.560" style="s2">the actual practices that address them</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:03.359" style="s2">we end up in something like the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.560" end="00:41:06.319" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.359" end="00:41:07.760" style="s2">yes exactly that was beautifully said</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.319" end="00:41:09.200" style="s2">you should have done some of my series</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.760" end="00:41:11.280" style="s2">that was really well</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.200" end="00:41:12.560" style="s2">um i mean what you just said eric is</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.280" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">exactly the case that</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">for for historical reasons</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">and and forces that are still at work uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:23.520" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2">we have lost um the practices the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.520" end="00:41:29.200" style="s2">ecology of practices the communities</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">um um for wisdom because that&#39;s the name</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.200" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">i would give to that</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:36.079" style="s2">that knowing how and knowing through a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:37.040" style="s2">transformation how to get into right</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.079" end="00:41:38.400" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.040" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">with yourself with each other in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.400" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">world we&#39;ve lost that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">in a profound way um</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.839" end="00:41:51.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:53.839" style="s2">means that we we don&#39;t even have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.599" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">a like well like you said we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.839" end="00:41:58.240" style="s2">where we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.880" end="00:42:01.200" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a world view that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.240" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">homes that pursuit of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:06.720" style="s2">legitimates it and valorizes it</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">and and justifies it to us and uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.720" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">inspires us to aspire to it we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:11.440" style="s2">have a worldview that does any of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:13.920" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.440" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">so when we are beset by the perennial</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.920" end="00:42:17.920" style="s2">problems and we turn for wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">we have nowhere to turn so when the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.920" end="00:42:22.079" style="s2">perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:23.760" style="s2">are basically unleashed because we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">no homing world view</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.760" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">that homes an ecology of practices that</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:32.400" style="s2">will allow us to deal with that monster</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">then that is the meeting crisis yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.400" end="00:42:37.280" style="s2">yeah and as as almost</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">responses or actually i would say</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.280" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">something like tools in your tool belt</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:43.119" style="s2">that you can use</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:44.960" style="s2">i think two things come up one is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.119" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">four ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:49.280" style="s2">right and one and the other is psycho</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:55.680" style="s2">can we touch on both of those yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:57.440" style="s2">part of the historical forgetting that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.680" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">has cut us off from wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.440" end="00:43:03.359" style="s2">is a is a is a historical</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">process in which our cultural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.359" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">grammar</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.560" end="00:43:07.520" style="s2">what i mean by that by a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">cognitive grammar are sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.520" end="00:43:11.359" style="s2">fundamental patterns by of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">intelligibility the fundamental sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.359" end="00:43:16.319" style="s2">the fundamental and uh both individually</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">and culturally habitual ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.319" end="00:43:19.280" style="s2">formulate</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:20.480" style="s2">our problems and think about things and</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.280" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">conceive of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.480" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">and try to remember that conceive</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:27.599" style="s2">originally meant to give birth</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.760" end="00:43:29.839" style="s2">um so um</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.599" end="00:43:30.640" style="s2">one of the fundamental forgettings that</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.839" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">has happened</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.640" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">is we have forgotten the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:38.000" style="s2">that make sense of which of this notion</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.000" end="00:43:43.119" style="s2">so the kind of knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">we have reduced knowing to what i call</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.119" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:50.079" style="s2">and this is the kind of knowing that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:52.560" style="s2">our grasping of facts</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.079" end="00:43:53.200" style="s2">um that we assert in propositions that</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.560" end="00:43:55.920" style="s2">we believe</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.200" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">like i know that cats are mammals there</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.920" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">we go</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a fact and i&#39;m asserting a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">belief</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">and then of course we&#39;ve developed and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m a scientist so i think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:08.560" style="s2">very very good thing by the way</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">we have developed uh of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.560" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">with how self-deception creeps into the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">inferential processes</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:15.760" style="s2">by which we manipulate propositions and</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:17.280" style="s2">generate good</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.760" end="00:44:19.280" style="s2">theory good belief that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">scientific and historical methods are</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.280" end="00:44:22.880" style="s2">and i have training in both mostly in</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">science but in some history as well</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.880" end="00:44:28.079" style="s2">right and so and so i believe</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:29.760" style="s2">in science in that sense i think that</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.079" end="00:44:32.240" style="s2">science is a great way</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.760" end="00:44:34.160" style="s2">of knowing propositionally but as you</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.240" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">alluded to earlier the problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.160" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">is that inferential propositional</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:41.920" style="s2">knowing is not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">identical with all of our ways of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.920" end="00:44:44.880" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:46.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s what&#39;s really significant is</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:48.640" style="s2">that propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.480" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">and we know this theoretically there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:51.599" style="s2">little bit of irony there we know this</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.160" end="00:44:52.640" style="s2">because of the ongoing science of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.599" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.640" end="00:44:56.319" style="s2">we know that those kinds of beliefs do</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.480" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">very very little to make your life</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.319" end="00:44:59.280" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:00.880" style="s2">right precisely because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.280" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">empower you to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.880" end="00:45:04.640" style="s2">these perennial problems and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.560" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">empower you well with</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.640" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">you know deepening the connections to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">yourself to each other in the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:12.079" style="s2">so let&#39;s go through the other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">knowing that actually have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.079" end="00:45:14.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:15.760" style="s2">so propositions are good when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.240" end="00:45:16.480" style="s2">true and that&#39;s great but notice what we</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.760" end="00:45:19.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.480" end="00:45:20.079" style="s2">power all the power well but power</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.200" end="00:45:21.920" style="s2">matters</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.079" end="00:45:23.680" style="s2">because you have another kind of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:27.040" style="s2">that isn&#39;t that doesn&#39;t come to</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.680" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">fruition in truth it comes its sense of</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.040" end="00:45:30.160" style="s2">realness is</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">power and this is knowing how this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.160" end="00:45:34.480" style="s2">your procedural knowing this is knowing</p>

<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:47:00.079" style="s2">and which skills to acquire well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:02.319" style="s2">well that&#39;s based on your situational</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">awareness well what kind of knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.319" end="00:47:05.200" style="s2">that well that&#39;s your perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:07.680" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.200" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s knowing that that&#39;s your salience</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.680" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">landscaping that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:12.000" style="s2">that&#39;s how things that you&#39;re knowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">through your particular state of</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.000" end="00:47:14.400" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:16.160" style="s2">this is the difference between knowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.400" end="00:47:17.359" style="s2">your room when you&#39;re drunk and knowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.160" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">your room when you&#39;re sober</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.359" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">or knowing your room when you&#39;re happy</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:22.559" style="s2">and knowing your room when you&#39;re sad</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.480" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">right it&#39;s what stands out for you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.559" end="00:47:25.280" style="s2">what&#39;s salient what&#39;s foregrounded</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">what&#39;s background</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:31.119" style="s2">it&#39;s your sense of here now here now</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:32.480" style="s2">here known as connectedness and so that</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.119" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come to fulfillment</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.480" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">in a sense of truth or a sense of power</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">it comes into fulfillment in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">presence that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.839" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">in video games</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:44.559" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:47.599" style="s2">presence because that means</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.559" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">right my my my perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.599" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">i i&#39;m i have i&#39;ve got i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:56.319" style="s2">that is allowing me to apply and acquire</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:58.640" style="s2">the skills i need</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.319" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">so you see how the propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.640" end="00:48:02.480" style="s2">depends on the procedural knowing</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:04.559" style="s2">all the propositions depend on me</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">knowing how to speak</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.559" end="00:48:08.079" style="s2">right but knowing how to speak and how</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:10.319" style="s2">to apply my other skills</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.079" end="00:48:11.760" style="s2">depends on my perspectival knowing my</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.319" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.760" end="00:48:16.079" style="s2">but what does that depend on well that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:19.040" style="s2">depends on</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.079" end="00:48:19.760" style="s2">my participatory knowing that depends on</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.040" end="00:48:22.800" style="s2">the fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.760" end="00:48:23.760" style="s2">that i&#39;m ultimately coupled to the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.800" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.760" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">that that i that agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:28.480" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">that i was talking about earlier in</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.480" end="00:48:31.839" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing and opening</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">that it is taking place that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.839" end="00:48:36.079" style="s2">something i can make</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:37.920" style="s2">think about it all right think about um</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.079" end="00:48:40.160" style="s2">loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.920" end="00:48:41.680" style="s2">when you&#39;re lonely well what i just i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.160" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2">just i&#39;m not going to be lonely now like</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.680" end="00:48:45.359" style="s2">you can kind of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2">but what&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s wrong there is</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.359" end="00:48:49.920" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t a proper</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.440" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">like mutual fittedness between you and</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.920" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2">because you need another person so</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">participatory knowing is well think</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:49:00.880" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:02.720" style="s2">it&#39;s about how your biology this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.880" end="00:49:04.640" style="s2">called niche construction in biology</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.720" end="00:49:06.559" style="s2">how your biological evolution has</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.640" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">co-shaped your environment</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.559" end="00:49:12.400" style="s2">and you so that there are these</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.400" end="00:49:13.599" style="s2">relationships of belonging they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.400" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">called affordances</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.599" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">in kansai and gibson um so but</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:20.800" style="s2">right um like you have a category i</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.240" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">assume</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.800" end="00:49:27.599" style="s2">food right so there&#39;s an apple and</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">it affords nourishment to you you see it</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:31.280" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:31.680" style="s2">food right because evolution has shaped</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.280" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.680" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">and that environment you you right you</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:38.480" style="s2">have niche construction</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:40.720" style="s2">and you can grasp the apple and eat it</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.480" end="00:49:41.680" style="s2">and so it&#39;s food for you does it is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.720" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.680" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">yeah also notice notice how culture has</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">shaped you</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.839" end="00:49:49.280" style="s2">and your environment you&#39;re in a nice</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">room and you&#39;re speaking english</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">did you make english did you make the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.160" end="00:49:56.400" style="s2">room you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">no how about the technology you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.400" end="00:50:01.839" style="s2">none of it okay so your biology shapes</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:03.760" style="s2">you to the world and the world to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.839" end="00:50:06.400" style="s2">your culture shapes you to the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.760" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">and you and and and write you the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.400" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">and now your brain your embodied brain</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:15.280" style="s2">in that dynamical coupling</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">right it&#39;s shaping the world and you to</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.280" end="00:50:18.079" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.680" end="00:50:19.280" style="s2">it&#39;s creating a particular configuring</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.079" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">of agency</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.280" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s calling out particular things</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">as relevant and important to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:26.480" style="s2">right this is what bickenstein meant</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">when he said that even if lions could</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.480" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">talk i wouldn&#39;t i couldn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:31.920" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.119" end="00:50:33.200" style="s2">because they have a different biology</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.920" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">they don&#39;t have culture</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:37.760" style="s2">they don&#39;t have language but right right</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:40.960" style="s2">so that&#39;s participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.760" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">the participatory knowing makes all the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.960" end="00:50:45.040" style="s2">niches</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.839" end="00:50:48.240" style="s2">makes all the affordances and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.040" end="00:50:50.640" style="s2">the perspectival knowing turns those</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.240" end="00:50:52.319" style="s2">affordances into a situation of which</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.640" end="00:50:55.359" style="s2">you are aware</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.319" end="00:50:57.200" style="s2">that situational awareness trains and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.359" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">affords you applying skills in your</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.200" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">procedural knowing</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:02.480" style="s2">so you are empowered and then finally in</p>

<p begin="00:51:02.480" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">you can utter particular propositions</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.720" end="00:51:11.040" style="s2">and undertake to justify and defend them</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:13.359" style="s2">in your propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.040" end="00:51:15.599" style="s2">but if you if you think that all of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.359" end="00:51:17.839" style="s2">what you are and all that you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.599" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">is your propositional knowing and that</p>

<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:23.920" style="s2">transform you is change your belief</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.520" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">which is the fundamental liability of</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.920" end="00:51:28.079" style="s2">ideology</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:29.760" style="s2">right and you are not only being lied to</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.079" end="00:51:31.599" style="s2">you are being cut off</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.760" end="00:51:34.160" style="s2">from all of this machinery and think</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.599" end="00:51:35.040" style="s2">about how that perspective procedural</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.160" end="00:51:37.359" style="s2">empowerment</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.040" end="00:51:38.960" style="s2">that perspectival presence and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.359" end="00:51:41.200" style="s2">participatory belonging</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.960" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">think about how belonging presence and</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.200" end="00:51:44.720" style="s2">power are</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">so central to your sense of meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.720" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">and if you&#39;re cut off from them you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:52.319" style="s2">cut off from the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">that affords that kind of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.319" end="00:51:57.359" style="s2">yeah and the wow hey there was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:59.760" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.359" end="00:52:01.040" style="s2">again this is why this is why i want i</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.760" end="00:52:04.559" style="s2">want this</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.040" end="00:52:08.559" style="s2">grammar introduce the world because it</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">orients you in such a beautiful way um</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.559" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">a we see this come up in a lot there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:14.960" style="s2">a lot of i feel like common cliches</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.040" end="00:52:17.359" style="s2">that address this at some level you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">the classic one like talk is cheap</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.359" end="00:52:20.960" style="s2">like dude i like all the armchair sports</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.160" end="00:52:22.640" style="s2">commentators</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.960" end="00:52:24.240" style="s2">oh i could do that i could do that</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.640" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">simply because i know that he needs to</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.240" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">dribble the ball and go up and dunk it</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:29.680" style="s2">that in no way means you you know it</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:31.520" style="s2">deeply enough to actually do it</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.680" end="00:52:33.119" style="s2">that&#39;s right it&#39;s a that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.520" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">disconnect</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.119" end="00:52:37.440" style="s2">there&#39;s also um it&#39;s the same reason why</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.000" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">you know you should eat healthy and</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.440" end="00:52:40.480" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:41.440" style="s2">right knowledge is in no way enough for</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.480" end="00:52:44.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:47.119" style="s2">um and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.559" end="00:52:49.839" style="s2">it it feels to me in a way and i may be</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.119" end="00:52:53.520" style="s2">incorrect on this but it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.839" end="00:52:54.079" style="s2">essentially the resurgence of perennial</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.520" end="00:52:57.359" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.079" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">the growing force of the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.359" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">is almost a natural result of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:03.440" style="s2">that you could say western material</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:06.960" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.440" end="00:53:09.760" style="s2">is so propositional it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.960" end="00:53:11.200" style="s2">almost solely abstract right and all</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.760" end="00:53:11.920" style="s2">these four ways of knowing are almost on</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.200" end="00:53:15.040" style="s2">a spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.920" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">of conceptual to fully embodied</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.040" end="00:53:18.720" style="s2">right and if you if your whole culture</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2">if your whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.720" end="00:53:23.119" style="s2">understanding and approach to the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">is entirely theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.119" end="00:53:27.119" style="s2">you&#39;re lost in a world of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">and you&#39;re disconnected from the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.119" end="00:53:31.359" style="s2">here and now and that&#39;s why even in in</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:32.319" style="s2">movies right when the the main character</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.359" end="00:53:33.920" style="s2">is going off</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.319" end="00:53:36.160" style="s2">what it takes is being slapped in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.920" end="00:53:38.640" style="s2">face right it&#39;s like right here</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.160" end="00:53:40.240" style="s2">like get back here and something i</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.640" end="00:53:42.720" style="s2">wanted to ask you about this</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.240" end="00:53:44.160" style="s2">because hey i don&#39;t even know if that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.720" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">that spectrum is fair</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.160" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">but it definitely feels that way that it</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">goes from conceptual to</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:52.800" style="s2">deeply embodied and it feels absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.880" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">fair i think that&#39;s absolutely fair</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.800" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">beautiful and yes they are they are all</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">essential i&#39;m not going to discount any</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:53:59.440" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.839" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">but what i want to bring up is it seems</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:03.119" style="s2">like it seems like eastern culture and</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">western culture</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.119" end="00:54:08.640" style="s2">have picked to set up camp at</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:10.079" style="s2">the opposing polls it seems like western</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.640" end="00:54:13.200" style="s2">culture is up in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.079" end="00:54:15.680" style="s2">propositional procedural</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.200" end="00:54:16.720" style="s2">and eastern philosophy has chosen to set</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.680" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">up camp almost</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.720" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">solely at perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:23.119" style="s2">the example coming up for me very</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:25.760" style="s2">directly is zen</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.119" end="00:54:26.480" style="s2">zen is almost mercilessly in the here</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.760" end="00:54:29.599" style="s2">and now</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.480" end="00:54:32.000" style="s2">like just stop conceptualizing stop</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.599" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">abstracting right here right now you</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.000" end="00:54:34.160" style="s2">know the wind is blowing through the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:37.280" style="s2">trees</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.160" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">and that is all you need to know</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.280" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">is that fair does that land i think</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:45.520" style="s2">that&#39;s fair i mean insofar</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">as i mean i i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.520" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">a prototypical representation of eastern</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.559" end="00:54:55.200" style="s2">i do not know how much asiatic and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:54:58.799" style="s2">south asiatic cultures are now oriented</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.200" end="00:54:58.799" style="s2">that way because of globalization</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.119" end="00:55:03.760" style="s2">what you just said um our the culture&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.559" end="00:55:06.319" style="s2">emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.760" end="00:55:08.000" style="s2">propositional knowing and a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.319" end="00:55:08.480" style="s2">kind of procedural knowing technological</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.000" end="00:55:11.119" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.480" end="00:55:12.400" style="s2">has greatly of course empowered the west</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.119" end="00:55:16.400" style="s2">whatever the west is</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.400" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">um and to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.400" end="00:55:22.160" style="s2">i mean a worldwide kind of imperialism</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:23.119" style="s2">and so whether or not that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.160" end="00:55:24.559" style="s2">the case because</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.119" end="00:55:25.920" style="s2">what and i&#39;m not trying to say this</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.559" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">because i&#39;m not trying to make a</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.920" end="00:55:29.040" style="s2">political point here</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.280" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">um or at least that&#39;s not my total</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.040" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">intent my intent is</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:34.160" style="s2">that i think versions of the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:36.720" style="s2">crisis are now</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.160" end="00:55:39.200" style="s2">uh are are now becoming important in</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.720" end="00:55:39.200" style="s2">japan</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.440" end="00:55:45.680" style="s2">china um etc um</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:47.680" style="s2">so um i i i doubt</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.680" end="00:55:50.480" style="s2">that any sort of comprehensive journey</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.680" end="00:55:52.079" style="s2">to the east for example like</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.480" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">i&#39;m not accusing you of being overly</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.079" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">romantic i&#39;m just i&#39;m just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:58.720" style="s2">um i think the meeting crisis is now</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:56:00.640" style="s2">becoming a global issue</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.720" end="00:56:02.799" style="s2">that being said so that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.640" end="00:56:04.079" style="s2">caveat i think your central insight is</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.799" end="00:56:06.480" style="s2">exactly correct</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.079" end="00:56:08.079" style="s2">so i was not trying to put it aside i</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.480" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">was trying to just situate it</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.079" end="00:56:11.440" style="s2">within a proper context of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:14.480" style="s2">i think the</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.440" end="00:56:15.599" style="s2">uh for historical reasons uh that have</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.480" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">to go back</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.599" end="00:56:19.520" style="s2">to changing the way we read and the rise</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:22.400" style="s2">of nominalism and a whole bunch of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.520" end="00:56:22.400" style="s2">i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.480" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">towards belief and ideology and</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.280" end="00:56:29.680" style="s2">assertion</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:31.359" style="s2">um and that the only all that really</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.680" end="00:56:33.599" style="s2">mattered was the competition</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.359" end="00:56:35.760" style="s2">uh you know the political competition</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.599" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">between ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.760" end="00:56:41.599" style="s2">and and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:43.359" style="s2">sort of the political competition</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.599" end="00:56:46.559" style="s2">between ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.359" end="00:56:49.440" style="s2">to see who got most access to the power</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.559" end="00:56:51.040" style="s2">that science and technology was putting</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.440" end="00:56:53.119" style="s2">in our hands</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.040" end="00:56:54.880" style="s2">and so i think yeah the west has gotten</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.119" end="00:56:57.280" style="s2">oriented that way</p>

<p begin="00:56:58.880" end="00:57:04.400" style="s2">emphasis on as you said</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.000" end="00:57:05.359" style="s2">transformation of the perspective of the</p>

<p begin="00:57:05.359" end="00:57:09.359" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing is a strangling of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:11.680" style="s2">participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.359" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">so that perspectival knowing loses all</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.680" end="00:57:16.960" style="s2">of its capacity for insight</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:21.400" style="s2">right so trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.960" end="00:57:24.839" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to give people that</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.400" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">non-ideological transformative</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.839" end="00:57:29.119" style="s2">capacity to perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:31.760" style="s2">participatory knowing was definitely</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.119" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">emphasized the price that was paid for</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.760" end="00:57:37.599" style="s2">that emphasis of course</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:42.480" style="s2">was that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.599" end="00:57:44.319" style="s2">the potential opening of the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.480" end="00:57:46.799" style="s2">that is provided by the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.319" end="00:57:51.200" style="s2">framework was also not afforded</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.799" end="00:57:53.599" style="s2">um so i you know i i love zen</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.200" end="00:57:55.200" style="s2">uh i i know people who practice it and</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.599" end="00:57:57.440" style="s2">in some ways on prototypicals that</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.200" end="00:57:58.480" style="s2">because in my life i integrate a taoist</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.440" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">tai chi with a</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.480" end="00:58:02.559" style="s2">with a you know teravated pasta which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:06.240" style="s2">sort of proto at least proto-chan</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.559" end="00:58:09.440" style="s2">right um but i also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.240" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">want to give up the way</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.440" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">uh you know what science has supported</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">us because</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:16.960" style="s2">look at what just happened and look look</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:18.799" style="s2">who the people were</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.960" end="00:58:20.079" style="s2">yeah the people who and i did it i</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.799" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">taught meditation</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.079" end="00:58:23.359" style="s2">i continued to do during coven and</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:26.240" style="s2">giving peace</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.359" end="00:58:26.559" style="s2">transformative ability right to deal</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.240" end="00:58:28.000" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.559" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">you know the perennial problems that are</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.000" end="00:58:31.200" style="s2">being exacerbated by the covid</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">crisis and the way it&#39;s making the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.200" end="00:58:35.599" style="s2">meaning crisis like</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:36.720" style="s2">definitely but who was also out there</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.599" end="00:58:39.680" style="s2">really making</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.720" end="00:58:41.680" style="s2">a huge difference it&#39;s the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.680" end="00:58:42.559" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re the people who are actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.680" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">giving us</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.559" end="00:58:46.079" style="s2">the tools that we need to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:48.640" style="s2">covet so</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.079" end="00:58:50.240" style="s2">again uh you weren&#39;t saying this and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.640" end="00:58:52.640" style="s2">not attributing it to it but i</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:54.400" style="s2">you know a kind of crypto orientalism in</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.640" end="00:58:57.680" style="s2">which the east is</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.400" end="00:59:00.319" style="s2">you know you know is is bright and pure</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.680" end="00:59:01.200" style="s2">and we are just you know a horrible the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.319" end="00:59:03.599" style="s2">horrible way</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.200" end="00:59:04.880" style="s2">i think that is we should give up we</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.599" end="00:59:06.559" style="s2">should give that up that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.880" end="00:59:09.280" style="s2">that&#39;s analogous to trying to find the</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.559" end="00:59:12.240" style="s2">one part of you that is free from dukkha</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.280" end="00:59:12.880" style="s2">right we need to we what we need and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.240" end="00:59:14.559" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.880" end="00:59:15.839" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to make a really central</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.559" end="00:59:16.480" style="s2">point for me and i don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.839" end="00:59:20.079" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.480" end="00:59:22.960" style="s2">we need something that properly</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.079" end="00:59:24.480" style="s2">and deeply integrates science and</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.960" end="00:59:26.160" style="s2">spirituality together</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.480" end="00:59:28.000" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m making this little speech</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.160" end="00:59:30.240" style="s2">right now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.000" end="00:59:32.480" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s definitely worth that that</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.240" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">level of underscore because it</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.480" end="00:59:38.400" style="s2">is far too common um</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:40.000" style="s2">far too common in some spaces right now</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.400" end="00:59:42.319" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.000" end="00:59:44.160" style="s2">yeah the the the easiest offhand like</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.319" end="00:59:47.440" style="s2">mantra that&#39;s come up for me is</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.160" end="00:59:49.599" style="s2">and this is by no means my creation um</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.440" end="00:59:50.480" style="s2">both and right if you&#39;re ever in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.599" end="00:59:52.319" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.480" end="00:59:54.160" style="s2">where you&#39;re viewing something as either</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.319" end="00:59:55.200" style="s2">or it&#39;s definitely not it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.160" end="00:59:57.119" style="s2">both and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="00:59:58.559" style="s2">like you need you need the compliments</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.119" end="01:00:00.640" style="s2">of both uh and</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.559" end="01:00:03.440" style="s2">science and spirituality is arguably one</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.640" end="01:00:03.440" style="s2">of the most</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.520" end="01:00:08.079" style="s2">powerful instances of that</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.720" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">thank you for saying that because i</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.079" end="01:00:12.480" style="s2">think the challenge facing us</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:14.160" style="s2">this is the way of sort of sharpening</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.480" end="01:00:17.680" style="s2">the issue of the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.160" end="01:00:20.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve said like together</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.680" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">and i appreciate your help on this you</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.240" end="01:00:25.440" style="s2">said you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:27.920" style="s2">historical forces have uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.440" end="01:00:30.640" style="s2">have disarmed us in our ability to</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.920" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">respond to perennial problems</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.640" end="01:00:33.760" style="s2">but any attempt to address the meeting</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:35.440" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.760" end="01:00:37.680" style="s2">has to do what we were also just talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">about i would argue it has to</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.680" end="01:00:42.319" style="s2">reintegrate science and spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:44.319" style="s2">together in order to give us</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.319" end="01:00:46.240" style="s2">what we need to respond to the meeting</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.319" end="01:00:48.720" style="s2">crisis no our deepest</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.240" end="01:00:51.119" style="s2">all of our knowings have to be put into</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.720" end="01:00:54.559" style="s2">right relationship with each other</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.119" end="01:00:55.440" style="s2">yeah yeah and like look like it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.559" end="01:00:57.920" style="s2">it&#39;s also just</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.440" end="01:00:58.799" style="s2">historically true that early</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.920" end="01:01:01.280" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.799" end="01:01:03.599" style="s2">was responsible for the dissemination</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.280" end="01:01:06.640" style="s2">and exploration of a lot of science</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.599" end="01:01:08.000" style="s2">right there&#39;s a this is again another</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.640" end="01:01:09.599" style="s2">kind of trope that</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.000" end="01:01:11.040" style="s2">misses the mark a little bit which is</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.599" end="01:01:11.920" style="s2">you know science is the process of</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.040" end="01:01:14.240" style="s2">cutting things up</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.920" end="01:01:15.920" style="s2">and kind of deadens the world and makes</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.240" end="01:01:19.040" style="s2">it all not as beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.920" end="01:01:20.799" style="s2">but actually it&#39;s not true at all like</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.040" end="01:01:23.119" style="s2">it makes it more beautiful the deeper</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.799" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">you this is what sports is a good</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.119" end="01:01:26.480" style="s2">example i guess</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">like it&#39;s great to watch professional</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.480" end="01:01:30.799" style="s2">athletes do their thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.640" end="01:01:33.200" style="s2">it&#39;s even better to have tried it</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.799" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">yourself to see how difficult and how</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.200" end="01:01:37.040" style="s2">nuanced it is and to know</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:38.799" style="s2">what moves they&#39;re actually doing and</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:39.599" style="s2">then to watch them do it with that level</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.799" end="01:01:42.240" style="s2">of grace</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.599" end="01:01:42.799" style="s2">it actually improves it and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.240" end="01:01:45.280" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.799" end="01:01:46.160" style="s2">that applies to all of this happening</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.280" end="01:01:47.920" style="s2">here as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.160" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">right like it doesn&#39;t get more beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.920" end="01:01:51.920" style="s2">knowing just how nuanced</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.079" end="01:01:53.599" style="s2">atoms and molecules and nonsense and</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.920" end="01:01:56.319" style="s2">quantum physics is it actually is</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.599" end="01:01:56.960" style="s2">more amazing it enchants the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.319" end="01:02:00.559" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.960" end="01:02:00.960" style="s2">uh i think thank you for saying that i</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.559" end="01:02:03.920" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:04.400" style="s2">the scientific worldview doesn&#39;t give us</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.920" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.400" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">the what we need for wisdom but it also</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:12.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do it like</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.119" end="01:02:12.720" style="s2">like what you said i i would i would</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.000" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">strengthen it</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.720" end="01:02:15.760" style="s2">and perhaps be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.000" end="01:02:17.359" style="s2">aggressive than you would which is huge</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.760" end="01:02:20.480" style="s2">unusual because i&#39;m usually</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.359" end="01:02:23.599" style="s2">not in that position i would say</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.480" end="01:02:25.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit it&#39;s unfair</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.599" end="01:02:27.280" style="s2">here let me use an analogy i think it</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.280" end="01:02:30.559" style="s2">would be unfair to</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.280" end="01:02:32.240" style="s2">criticize a particular religion if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.559" end="01:02:34.400" style="s2">and i think many people do criticize it</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.240" end="01:02:37.039" style="s2">unfairly if you didn&#39;t make some</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.400" end="01:02:39.119" style="s2">real good faith effort no pun intended</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.039" end="01:02:41.599" style="s2">to experience it from the inside</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.119" end="01:02:43.520" style="s2">like the way an anthropologist goes and</p>

<p begin="01:03:00.400" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">the outside is really unfair because you</p>

<p begin="01:03:14.240" end="01:03:20.160" style="s2">a typical in an in an analogous way</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.920" end="01:03:21.359" style="s2">people who criticize science and haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.160" end="01:03:23.920" style="s2">practiced it</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.359" end="01:03:25.839" style="s2">at least done some significant good</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.920" end="01:03:29.680" style="s2">faith participant observation in it</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.839" end="01:03:33.680" style="s2">and make all these pronouncements about</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.680" end="01:03:36.240" style="s2">unfair it&#39;s just fundamentally unfair</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.680" end="01:03:37.680" style="s2">i i practice science and i you&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.240" end="01:03:40.400" style="s2">me in our discussion</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.680" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">criticize its deep inadequacies but</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.400" end="01:03:43.599" style="s2">simply</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:45.359" style="s2">demonizing it i agree with you i think</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.599" end="01:03:49.200" style="s2">that is a fundamental mistake</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.359" end="01:03:50.880" style="s2">and so we need to we need to put</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.200" end="01:03:53.280" style="s2">science and spirituality into deep</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.880" end="01:03:54.720" style="s2">conversation but that goes that goes</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.280" end="01:03:56.559" style="s2">both ways you just said it</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.720" end="01:03:58.160" style="s2">you know we need to acknowledge how much</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.559" end="01:04:00.400" style="s2">of the scientific world</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.160" end="01:04:01.920" style="s2">is dependent not only the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.400" end="01:04:04.160" style="s2">world the secular world</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.920" end="01:04:05.920" style="s2">is dependent on christianity paul vander</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.160" end="01:04:07.920" style="s2">clay has done just a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.920" end="01:04:10.079" style="s2">video work you know building on the work</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.920" end="01:04:13.200" style="s2">of many other people tom hall and others</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.079" end="01:04:14.799" style="s2">trying to show you know how much</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.200" end="01:04:17.680" style="s2">of what we consider secular and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.799" end="01:04:21.039" style="s2">scientific was given birth conceived</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.680" end="01:04:23.599" style="s2">by christianity and so um</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.039" end="01:04:24.880" style="s2">we need to you know again a</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.599" end="01:04:28.000" style="s2">foreshadowing</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.880" end="01:04:31.920" style="s2">we need to have a deep dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.000" end="01:04:34.960" style="s2">between uh science and spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.920" end="01:04:38.079" style="s2">yeah yeah and so uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.960" end="01:04:39.520" style="s2">actually one point that came up was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.079" end="01:04:41.280" style="s2">almost hard to judge something</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.520" end="01:04:42.720" style="s2">unless you participate in the practices</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.280" end="01:04:46.400" style="s2">that came from it</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.720" end="01:04:48.160" style="s2">uh i think this is like a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.400" end="01:04:49.680" style="s2">criticize christianity but have you ever</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.160" end="01:04:51.680" style="s2">tried like</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.680" end="01:04:53.680" style="s2">real prayer like actually seeing what</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.680" end="01:04:55.760" style="s2">that does to your body and how you</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.680" end="01:04:57.119" style="s2">and how you feel and perhaps even how it</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.760" end="01:04:59.119" style="s2">ripples into your life</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.119" end="01:05:01.440" style="s2">same thing with uh you know meditation</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.119" end="01:05:03.760" style="s2">practice going to halls of worship like</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.440" end="01:05:05.359" style="s2">unless you&#39;ve done the practices that</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.760" end="01:05:08.559" style="s2">stem from these ideas</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.359" end="01:05:10.640" style="s2">like yeah the ground to criticize it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.559" end="01:05:12.960" style="s2">very weak and very frail</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.640" end="01:05:14.480" style="s2">yeah and and it it reverberates</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.960" end="01:05:17.680" style="s2">backwards too</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.480" end="01:05:17.680" style="s2">like i think</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.160" end="01:05:25.119" style="s2">like i i didn&#39;t really get</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.640" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">until i had been practicing tai chi for</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.119" end="01:05:29.520" style="s2">a very long time</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">yeah perfect example perfect example of</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.520" end="01:05:34.000" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:35.599" style="s2">um i&#39;m actually going to float this to</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.000" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.599" end="01:05:38.960" style="s2">there are two ways we can go right now</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:42.000" style="s2">um one is</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.960" end="01:05:43.280" style="s2">i i want to dig into the meat right both</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.000" end="01:05:44.640" style="s2">steal the culture and the religion</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.280" end="01:05:46.720" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.640" end="01:05:48.319" style="s2">do you feel that it&#39;s necessary to load</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.720" end="01:05:51.119" style="s2">in psychotex</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.319" end="01:05:53.520" style="s2">and the ecology of practices before we</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.119" end="01:05:53.520" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.079" end="01:05:57.839" style="s2">well i mean i could do a very quick riff</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.240" end="01:05:59.760" style="s2">because we i&#39;ve alluded to it</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.839" end="01:06:01.520" style="s2">many times on the ecology practices and</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.760" end="01:06:02.079" style="s2">psychotech doesn&#39;t won&#39;t take me that</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.520" end="01:06:04.799" style="s2">long</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.079" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">to try that okay so the ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.799" end="01:06:08.799" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.839" end="01:06:10.559" style="s2">um you&#39;ve heard me so let&#39;s go back and</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.799" end="01:06:11.839" style="s2">maybe do a bit of a narrative biography</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.559" end="01:06:12.400" style="s2">because that gives people an access</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.839" end="01:06:16.240" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.400" end="01:06:18.720" style="s2">i was taught in ecology of practices um</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.240" end="01:06:20.400" style="s2">and so i was taught i was taught a</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.720" end="01:06:22.160" style="s2">meditative practice</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.400" end="01:06:23.680" style="s2">and in meditation it&#39;s a mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.160" end="01:06:25.200" style="s2">practice in which you&#39;re stepping back</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.680" end="01:06:27.280" style="s2">and looking at your framing</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.200" end="01:06:28.480" style="s2">um i often use the example of like my</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.280" end="01:06:31.039" style="s2">glasses my glasses</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.480" end="01:06:32.720" style="s2">the way my glasses frame my vision i</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.039" end="01:06:35.119" style="s2">look through them in the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.720" end="01:06:36.799" style="s2">by means of them and beyond them uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.119" end="01:06:38.079" style="s2">right i also have a mental framing that</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.799" end="01:06:40.480" style="s2">i&#39;m always looking through</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.079" end="01:06:42.000" style="s2">and by means of and what i can do when</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.480" end="01:06:43.359" style="s2">my glasses are dirty is i can step back</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.000" end="01:06:44.799" style="s2">and look at them to see if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.359" end="01:06:46.000" style="s2">gunk on them that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.799" end="01:06:46.880" style="s2">meditation you&#39;re stepping back and</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.000" end="01:06:49.839" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.880" end="01:06:51.119" style="s2">the mental framing but if all i ever did</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.839" end="01:06:52.640" style="s2">think about it if all i ever did was</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.119" end="01:06:55.680" style="s2">step back and look at my glasses</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.640" end="01:06:57.280" style="s2">look at the gunk whoa look whoa well</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.680" end="01:06:59.119" style="s2">how do i know if i actually have</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.280" end="01:07:01.280" style="s2">corrected my glasses</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.119" end="01:07:03.200" style="s2">i have to put them on and then look out</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.280" end="01:07:03.520" style="s2">and see if i can see more deeply and</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.200" end="01:07:05.039" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.520" end="01:07:06.880" style="s2">clearly into the world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.039" end="01:07:08.640" style="s2">contemplation right</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.880" end="01:07:10.160" style="s2">that contemplation that the word the</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.640" end="01:07:12.240" style="s2">center of it is temple</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.160" end="01:07:13.680" style="s2">to look out to look into the heavens</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.240" end="01:07:16.400" style="s2">originally that&#39;s what i meant</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.680" end="01:07:18.480" style="s2">or uh it&#39;s it&#39;s contemplation is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.400" end="01:07:20.559" style="s2">latin word for the greek word peoria</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.480" end="01:07:22.400" style="s2">which means to look deeply into things</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.559" end="01:07:24.240" style="s2">not theory by the way</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.400" end="01:07:27.039" style="s2">that the word theory is a derivative</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.240" end="01:07:29.760" style="s2">from this more perspectival ability</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.039" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">right so notice how those are in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.760" end="01:07:35.119" style="s2">complementary relationship</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:37.599" style="s2">one gets me to step back and look at so</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.119" end="01:07:40.640" style="s2">that i can see distortion</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.599" end="01:07:42.000" style="s2">one gets me to right to step through and</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.640" end="01:07:44.160" style="s2">look beyond</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.000" end="01:07:45.760" style="s2">and that allows me to learn and to see</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.160" end="01:07:47.039" style="s2">what i couldn&#39;t see before and i need</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.760" end="01:07:48.480" style="s2">both for transformation</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.039" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">notice that we put these together</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.480" end="01:07:51.680" style="s2">without thinking of it in a word that</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:53.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve inherited from eckhart</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.680" end="01:07:56.640" style="s2">breakthrough</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.280" end="01:08:00.079" style="s2">i have to break the bad framing through</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.640" end="01:08:02.799" style="s2">into something beyond right breakthrough</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.079" end="01:08:03.839" style="s2">and so notice what i&#39;m trying to get in</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.799" end="01:08:06.240" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.839" end="01:08:07.200" style="s2">practices have respective strengths and</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.240" end="01:08:08.400" style="s2">weaknesses</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.200" end="01:08:11.119" style="s2">and they need to be put into a</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.400" end="01:08:13.280" style="s2">complementary relationship</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.119" end="01:08:14.559" style="s2">the problem with those two practices for</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.280" end="01:08:16.000" style="s2">example is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.559" end="01:08:17.679" style="s2">they&#39;re both very heavy practices</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.000" end="01:08:18.880" style="s2">they&#39;re taking place in your head as</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.679" end="01:08:20.319" style="s2">you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.880" end="01:08:22.400" style="s2">so you know what you need to complement</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.319" end="01:08:24.719" style="s2">them with a moving practice</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.400" end="01:08:25.839" style="s2">a mindfulness practice like tai chi</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.719" end="01:08:28.239" style="s2">chuan that also</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.839" end="01:08:30.319" style="s2">teaches you more about the flow state</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.239" end="01:08:33.279" style="s2">and see</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.319" end="01:08:35.199" style="s2">that practice though if i&#39;m just moving</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.279" end="01:08:35.440" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to develop mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.199" end="01:08:37.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.440" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">you see what i&#39;m trying to show you they</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.520" end="01:08:40.080" style="s2">have they have sets of strengths and</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:41.359" style="s2">weaknesses</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.080" end="01:08:42.880" style="s2">and what you want to do is like an</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.359" end="01:08:44.159" style="s2">ecology you want to put them into a</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.880" end="01:08:47.040" style="s2">dynamical system</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.159" end="01:08:48.239" style="s2">where they&#39;re constraining informing and</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.040" end="01:08:51.120" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.239" end="01:08:52.080" style="s2">affording each other in powerful ways</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.120" end="01:08:55.199" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.080" end="01:08:58.239" style="s2">you also need practices that</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.199" end="01:08:59.199" style="s2">bridge you right between different kinds</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.239" end="01:09:01.520" style="s2">of knowing</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.199" end="01:09:02.719" style="s2">so i teach lectio divina which is a way</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.520" end="01:09:05.040" style="s2">of reading</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.719" end="01:09:06.159" style="s2">sacred reading that helps you to bridge</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.040" end="01:09:09.040" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.159" end="01:09:10.400" style="s2">the propositional and the perspectival</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.040" end="01:09:12.960" style="s2">and the participatory</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.400" end="01:09:14.400" style="s2">or chanting which helps to bridge from</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.960" end="01:09:17.679" style="s2">the participatory</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.400" end="01:09:20.640" style="s2">right and the perspective into the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.679" end="01:09:22.560" style="s2">propositional right so you want you also</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.640" end="01:09:25.359" style="s2">want bridging practices</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.560" end="01:09:26.000" style="s2">you also layer practices on top of each</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.359" end="01:09:29.520" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.000" end="01:09:32.319" style="s2">so mata looking out</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.520" end="01:09:33.839" style="s2">and the pasta looking in can be layered</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.319" end="01:09:34.719" style="s2">on to each other the way my left and</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.839" end="01:09:36.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.719" end="01:09:38.239" style="s2">visual fields can be layered onto each</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.400" end="01:09:40.640" style="s2">other so i can see into depth</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.239" end="01:09:41.440" style="s2">and when i layer them onto each other i</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.640" end="01:09:44.080" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.440" end="01:09:46.159" style="s2">what can emerge as prajna this non-dual</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.080" end="01:09:47.520" style="s2">awareness that is simultaneously deeply</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.159" end="01:09:48.799" style="s2">out and deeply in</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.520" end="01:09:50.560" style="s2">so what i&#39;m trying to do is i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.799" end="01:09:51.279" style="s2">to put practices together into a</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.560" end="01:09:54.080" style="s2">complement</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.279" end="01:09:55.760" style="s2">relationships of complementarity</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.080" end="01:09:57.120" style="s2">relationships that link between the</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.760" end="01:09:58.719" style="s2">kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.120" end="01:10:00.560" style="s2">and relationships that layer the</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.719" end="01:10:00.960" style="s2">practices developmentally onto each</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.560" end="01:10:03.960" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.960" end="01:10:05.199" style="s2">so i have this self-correcting</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.960" end="01:10:07.360" style="s2">self-transforming</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.199" end="01:10:08.239" style="s2">ecology of practices that&#39;s an ecology</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.360" end="01:10:11.280" style="s2">of practices</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.239" end="01:10:13.040" style="s2">is that okay yeah and and just a quick</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.280" end="01:10:15.520" style="s2">bookmark you&#39;ll notice how the end</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.040" end="01:10:17.199" style="s2">description of that sounded exactly like</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.520" end="01:10:19.440" style="s2">dukkha and reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.199" end="01:10:21.440" style="s2">but in a good way right that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.440" end="01:10:23.760" style="s2">that&#39;s also a foreshadow there</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.440" end="01:10:25.040" style="s2">um yeah that was perfect and then i</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.760" end="01:10:28.800" style="s2">think if we can get</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.040" end="01:10:31.120" style="s2">uh psycho technologies so</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.800" end="01:10:33.280" style="s2">the idea is and this is uh this is i</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.120" end="01:10:33.280" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.440" end="01:10:37.360" style="s2">andy clark has said this profoundly</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.199" end="01:10:40.400" style="s2">angry park is an example of</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.360" end="01:10:43.199" style="s2">a really important cognitive scientist</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.400" end="01:10:45.360" style="s2">and somebody who&#39;s associated with what</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.199" end="01:10:47.600" style="s2">it&#39;s called 4e cognitive science</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.360" end="01:10:49.520" style="s2">um i i really respect his work i have</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.600" end="01:10:51.760" style="s2">criticisms of it as a scientist</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.520" end="01:10:53.440" style="s2">but um i recommend people reading his</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.760" end="01:10:54.719" style="s2">work but he has a book called natural</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.440" end="01:10:56.960" style="s2">born cyborgs</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.719" end="01:10:57.760" style="s2">that because we&#39;re inherently cultural</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.960" end="01:11:01.280" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.760" end="01:11:04.159" style="s2">we have evolved across species to</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.280" end="01:11:06.080" style="s2">fit the world to us and us to the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.159" end="01:11:08.320" style="s2">remember i was talking about that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.080" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">mutual fitness participatory night well</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.320" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">what&#39;s an example of fitting the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:13.280" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:15.760" style="s2">us and us to the world tools tools</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.280" end="01:11:17.280" style="s2">like my phone like my watch like this</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.760" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">mug like this glass</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.280" end="01:11:21.520" style="s2">it fits my hand right so that the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.000" end="01:11:24.640" style="s2">can better fit my hand</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.520" end="01:11:27.120" style="s2">water i can carry around the liquid so</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.640" end="01:11:29.440" style="s2">we have evolved our brains have evolved</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.120" end="01:11:30.080" style="s2">to merge with tools that&#39;s what a cyborg</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.440" end="01:11:32.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.080" end="01:11:34.719" style="s2">right now those the examples i gave were</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.960" end="01:11:38.320" style="s2">physical tools</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.719" end="01:11:41.840" style="s2">they are designed to fit our body</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.320" end="01:11:44.560" style="s2">and extend it into the world and also</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.840" end="01:11:45.440" style="s2">extend the world into the body to fit</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.560" end="01:11:47.040" style="s2">the world and</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.440" end="01:11:49.120" style="s2">the body better together but there are</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.040" end="01:11:51.679" style="s2">also psycho technologies that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.120" end="01:11:54.960" style="s2">designed to fit the way our minds work</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.679" end="01:11:56.880" style="s2">so that right we can extend our mind</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.960" end="01:11:58.000" style="s2">into the world and also extend the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.880" end="01:12:01.040" style="s2">into the mind</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.000" end="01:12:03.040" style="s2">a classic example of this is literacy</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.040" end="01:12:04.080" style="s2">so a psychotechnology isn&#39;t a skill</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.040" end="01:12:06.560" style="s2">because it is</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.080" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">socially creative if you didn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.560" end="01:12:11.520" style="s2">literacy i didn&#39;t make literacy</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:12.880" style="s2">right it is a socially standardized this</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.520" end="01:12:14.560" style="s2">is the importance of distributed</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.880" end="01:12:15.199" style="s2">cognition but most of our thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.560" end="01:12:18.400" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.199" end="01:12:22.239" style="s2">in concert with other people right</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.400" end="01:12:23.199" style="s2">so literacy is a socially standardized</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.239" end="01:12:27.280" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.199" end="01:12:29.120" style="s2">of formatting information processing</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.280" end="01:12:30.719" style="s2">the manipulation storage and</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.120" end="01:12:33.440" style="s2">transmission of information</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.719" end="01:12:35.520" style="s2">such that it fits my cognition well and</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.440" end="01:12:38.640" style="s2">compensates for it empowers it</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.520" end="01:12:41.199" style="s2">so with literacy i can now store</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.640" end="01:12:43.280" style="s2">information outside of my own memory</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.199" end="01:12:44.880" style="s2">i can reflect on my own cognition</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.280" end="01:12:47.280" style="s2">outside of my own consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.880" end="01:12:49.360" style="s2">i can link my mind to yours i can link</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.280" end="01:12:50.560" style="s2">my current mind to my future mind by</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.360" end="01:12:53.480" style="s2">writing things down</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.560" end="01:12:56.480" style="s2">i can massively empower myself so a</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.480" end="01:13:00.080" style="s2">psychotechnology is a socially generated</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.480" end="01:13:02.320" style="s2">standardized way of formatting</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.080" end="01:13:04.239" style="s2">communicating transmitting information</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.320" end="01:13:07.600" style="s2">that is the socially designed</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.239" end="01:13:09.600" style="s2">to fit cognition well fit it generally</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.600" end="01:13:11.040" style="s2">so that it&#39;s widely disseminable about</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.600" end="01:13:12.560" style="s2">amongst the population</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.040" end="01:13:14.480" style="s2">unlike these particular skills for</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.560" end="01:13:17.040" style="s2">example and afford</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.480" end="01:13:18.080" style="s2">a comprehensive and reliable empowerment</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.040" end="01:13:20.480" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.080" end="01:13:22.159" style="s2">in some way literacy is an example</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.480" end="01:13:25.280" style="s2">numeracy is an example</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.159" end="01:13:26.960" style="s2">graphing is an example mindfulness is an</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.280" end="01:13:29.679" style="s2">example by the way</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.960" end="01:13:30.080" style="s2">yeah so those are sacral technologies</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.679" end="01:13:33.360" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.080" end="01:13:34.640" style="s2">mindfulness and graph paper were the</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.360" end="01:13:36.320" style="s2">ones that just</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.640" end="01:13:38.400" style="s2">flipped the entire switch for me it was</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.320" end="01:13:40.800" style="s2">like oh this had to be invented</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.400" end="01:13:42.880" style="s2">like we actually created this it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.800" end="01:13:47.280" style="s2">just get pulled from the ether</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.880" end="01:13:49.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s right yeah so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.280" end="01:13:50.800" style="s2">i think we have built a very good</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.120" end="01:13:53.920" style="s2">foundation let&#39;s see where our</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.800" end="01:13:57.199" style="s2">arc has taken us right so we have</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.920" end="01:13:59.280" style="s2">as a human you have perennial problems</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.199" end="01:14:02.400" style="s2">that basically lurk under the surface</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.280" end="01:14:04.640" style="s2">like some beast in the ocean always</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.400" end="01:14:06.960" style="s2">threatening you</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.640" end="01:14:08.880" style="s2">i really like the analogy of the hydra</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.960" end="01:14:12.800" style="s2">because as you address one</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.880" end="01:14:16.000" style="s2">it it reorients new ones come up</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.800" end="01:14:17.679" style="s2">and when enough heads arise you get</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.000" end="01:14:20.719" style="s2">something like the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.679" end="01:14:21.280" style="s2">the meeting crisis left unattended can</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.719" end="01:14:24.000" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.280" end="01:14:24.560" style="s2">serve an existential threat for a tribe</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.000" end="01:14:27.280" style="s2">or for</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.560" end="01:14:29.040" style="s2">humanity at large right it could be</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.280" end="01:14:29.520" style="s2">people just offing themselves it could</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.040" end="01:14:32.320" style="s2">be war</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.520" end="01:14:34.800" style="s2">it could be anything right not good not</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.320" end="01:14:36.800" style="s2">good to let continue over time</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.800" end="01:14:38.480" style="s2">so people recognize this and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.800" end="01:14:39.360" style="s2">like okay we need to do something about</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.480" end="01:14:43.600" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.360" end="01:14:44.880" style="s2">um from that right we had the ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.600" end="01:14:46.880" style="s2">practices that grew</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.880" end="01:14:48.400" style="s2">and different communities would would</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.880" end="01:14:49.040" style="s2">develop different ecologies and</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.400" end="01:14:53.120" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.040" end="01:14:57.840" style="s2">they developed different psychotechs all</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.120" end="01:14:57.840" style="s2">all done to help</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.000" end="01:15:01.520" style="s2">would you would you call it make an</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.440" end="01:15:02.000" style="s2">agreement between the four ways of</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.520" end="01:15:04.000" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.000" end="01:15:06.159" style="s2">and how they show up in relationships to</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.000" end="01:15:08.400" style="s2">themselves to others and the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.159" end="01:15:09.280" style="s2">and through that and to your point about</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.400" end="01:15:11.280" style="s2">the ecology</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.280" end="01:15:13.760" style="s2">it was dynamic and self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.280" end="01:15:16.560" style="s2">enough and it had a feedback loop</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.760" end="01:15:18.320" style="s2">that as the threats dynamically</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.560" end="01:15:20.880" style="s2">reorganized it could</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.320" end="01:15:23.120" style="s2">dynamically reorganize in response to</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.880" end="01:15:23.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.199" end="01:15:26.880" style="s2">the first thing i want to say is notice</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.199" end="01:15:29.440" style="s2">how absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.880" end="01:15:30.400" style="s2">necessary that is for you as an</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.440" end="01:15:32.400" style="s2">individual and</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.400" end="01:15:33.679" style="s2">any community at large like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.400" end="01:15:35.840" style="s2">non-negotiable</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.679" end="01:15:37.040" style="s2">if you want to stay alive and stay sane</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.840" end="01:15:39.679" style="s2">while you&#39;re alive</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.040" end="01:15:40.719" style="s2">so it&#39;s absolutely necessary and so what</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.679" end="01:15:44.080" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.719" end="01:15:46.480" style="s2">when a group of people who have</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.080" end="01:15:47.440" style="s2">recognized the need for this are trying</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.480" end="01:15:50.320" style="s2">to carry it out</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.440" end="01:15:51.440" style="s2">come together you know a some people</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.320" end="01:15:53.760" style="s2">give some good answers</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.440" end="01:15:55.280" style="s2">some people share some good ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.760" end="01:15:56.400" style="s2">then some people are like hey that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.280" end="01:15:57.199" style="s2">really good idea you should write that</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.400" end="01:15:59.120" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.199" end="01:16:00.320" style="s2">or like do you want to meet next week to</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.120" end="01:16:02.400" style="s2">talk about this</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.320" end="01:16:05.120" style="s2">and you can see already that you have</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.400" end="01:16:06.640" style="s2">the basis of something that looks like</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.120" end="01:16:08.800" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.640" end="01:16:10.480" style="s2">you have an organized community carrying</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.800" end="01:16:11.120" style="s2">out a set of practices that help put</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.480" end="01:16:12.880" style="s2">them in</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.120" end="01:16:15.520" style="s2">relationship with themselves others in</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.880" end="01:16:18.080" style="s2">the world awesome</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.520" end="01:16:18.719" style="s2">right so and i i think i think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.080" end="01:16:21.199" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.719" end="01:16:22.719" style="s2">we&#39;ve both tipped a hat to i think this</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.199" end="01:16:24.960" style="s2">is something that jordan peterson has</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.719" end="01:16:27.679" style="s2">brought up to the surface quite well</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.960" end="01:16:28.320" style="s2">that there is that there is a need there</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.679" end="01:16:30.480" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.320" end="01:16:32.400" style="s2">individual psychological and a</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.480" end="01:16:34.880" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.400" end="01:16:36.239" style="s2">institutional need for something like a</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.880" end="01:16:38.239" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.239" end="01:16:40.640" style="s2">it might not have to be any of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.239" end="01:16:43.120" style="s2">current instantiations of it</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.640" end="01:16:44.239" style="s2">but you really don&#39;t want to go without</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.120" end="01:16:46.640" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.239" end="01:16:48.800" style="s2">because you can argue we live in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.640" end="01:16:50.000" style="s2">global world that is largely without it</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.800" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.000" end="01:16:53.920" style="s2">right we&#39;ve moved the nuns the the</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:56.800" style="s2">people who have</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.920" end="01:16:57.760" style="s2">no real religion are a i think the</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.800" end="01:17:01.040" style="s2">largest group</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.760" end="01:17:03.440" style="s2">and b the largest growing group</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.040" end="01:17:05.040" style="s2">and we are smack dab in the middle of a</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.440" end="01:17:07.360" style="s2">meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.040" end="01:17:08.960" style="s2">almost all of our crises jordan halls</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.360" end="01:17:12.000" style="s2">calls us the meta crisis right</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.960" end="01:17:14.000" style="s2">we just have a crisis of crises and</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.000" end="01:17:15.760" style="s2">we&#39;re bouncing around through it and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.000" end="01:17:17.679" style="s2">it&#39;s like we now</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.760" end="01:17:19.600" style="s2">we have a very visceral example of what</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.679" end="01:17:21.520" style="s2">happens when we move away from that</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.600" end="01:17:23.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s like okay that that experiment&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.520" end="01:17:26.719" style="s2">probably not great</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.600" end="01:17:29.440" style="s2">one thing i would would like to</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.719" end="01:17:30.080" style="s2">speak to a little bit here is so if we</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.440" end="01:17:33.360" style="s2">do have</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.080" end="01:17:34.560" style="s2">a need for something that looks like a</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.360" end="01:17:38.400" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.560" end="01:17:40.800" style="s2">um and actually maybe i&#39;ll bookmark this</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.400" end="01:17:42.480" style="s2">as separate from just an individual</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.800" end="01:17:46.640" style="s2">spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.480" end="01:17:48.000" style="s2">because you just you know you can learn</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.640" end="01:17:49.280" style="s2">you can learn from your elders way</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.000" end="01:17:51.199" style="s2">faster than you can make all the</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.280" end="01:17:53.120" style="s2">mistakes yourself</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.199" end="01:17:54.400" style="s2">so there there&#39;s a there&#39;s a place for</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.120" end="01:17:58.800" style="s2">religion why</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.400" end="01:17:59.440" style="s2">then are we looking to reinvent a new</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.800" end="01:18:02.080" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.440" end="01:18:02.800" style="s2">rather than what is wrong with the ones</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.080" end="01:18:05.520" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.800" end="01:18:07.280" style="s2">in existence that have sustained for</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.520" end="01:18:11.199" style="s2">several thousand years</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.280" end="01:18:14.560" style="s2">like why not why not religion 1.0 why</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.199" end="01:18:16.480" style="s2">why now is there a almost an inadequacy</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.560" end="01:18:19.440" style="s2">in them</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.480" end="01:18:20.239" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s really good so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.440" end="01:18:21.840" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.239" end="01:18:24.840" style="s2">that should be the culminating question</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.840" end="01:18:26.960" style="s2">because that&#39;s going to take a lot</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.840" end="01:18:29.600" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.960" end="01:18:31.199" style="s2">i mean i&#39;ve been exploring with my my</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.600" end="01:18:32.080" style="s2">dear friend and colleague who i should</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.199" end="01:18:33.920" style="s2">have mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.080" end="01:18:35.120" style="s2">uh christopher masterpiece he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.920" end="01:18:37.679" style="s2">much my partner</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.120" end="01:18:38.560" style="s2">and a lot of this i owe a lot of this to</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.679" end="01:18:41.679" style="s2">chris</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.560" end="01:18:42.560" style="s2">uh the work we do together um and also</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.679" end="01:18:43.920" style="s2">the work</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.560" end="01:18:46.159" style="s2">that i&#39;ve done with theo ferraro on</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.920" end="01:18:48.800" style="s2">wisdom so i just want to</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.159" end="01:18:50.320" style="s2">make sure that people are aware of that</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.800" end="01:18:53.440" style="s2">but chris and i are</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.320" end="01:18:54.480" style="s2">exploring uh with andrew sweeney um a</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.440" end="01:18:58.640" style="s2">notion i got</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.480" end="01:19:02.400" style="s2">from kerry in his book on augustine</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.640" end="01:19:04.320" style="s2">um this latin term inventio</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.400" end="01:19:05.920" style="s2">is becoming central to me sorry i&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.320" end="01:19:08.960" style="s2">the edge of sneezing that&#39;s why i got</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.920" end="01:19:08.960" style="s2">this off look at my face</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.480" end="01:19:13.520" style="s2">he wrote this book and he was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.080" end="01:19:16.159" style="s2">talk about how</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.520" end="01:19:18.400" style="s2">uh augustine afforded sort of the the</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.159" end="01:19:20.640" style="s2">current sense we have of an inner self</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.400" end="01:19:23.120" style="s2">um and augustine basically takes sort of</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.640" end="01:19:25.360" style="s2">platinus</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.120" end="01:19:26.480" style="s2">and does this really interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.360" end="01:19:28.960" style="s2">with his own</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.480" end="01:19:30.640" style="s2">personal sense of autobiography he makes</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.960" end="01:19:32.880" style="s2">the autobiographical inner self</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.640" end="01:19:33.679" style="s2">which we all now take to be natural but</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.880" end="01:19:35.440" style="s2">once again</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.679" end="01:19:36.719" style="s2">it&#39;s a historical phenomena but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.440" end="01:19:37.920" style="s2">the point i want to make</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.719" end="01:19:40.239" style="s2">because we&#39;re inherently cultural</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.920" end="01:19:42.960" style="s2">biological beings we need a term that</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.239" end="01:19:44.239" style="s2">that sits on on both of those so the</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.960" end="01:19:47.600" style="s2">word inventio</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.239" end="01:19:50.239" style="s2">means both to make</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.600" end="01:19:51.920" style="s2">and to discover it&#39;s both something</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.239" end="01:19:53.600" style="s2">you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.920" end="01:19:55.440" style="s2">and so the word invention is you just</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.600" end="01:19:57.199" style="s2">make it and the word is discovery you</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.440" end="01:19:58.400" style="s2">just find it but inventio is</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.199" end="01:20:00.239" style="s2">you&#39;re making it but you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.400" end="01:20:04.000" style="s2">discovering it</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.239" end="01:20:09.280" style="s2">uh and so in a sense what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.000" end="01:20:12.960" style="s2">trying to do is to re the reinventio of</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.280" end="01:20:14.320" style="s2">religion so that sense of connectedness</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.960" end="01:20:15.920" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.320" end="01:20:18.080" style="s2">throughout connectedness to yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.920" end="01:20:21.040" style="s2">each other to the world in depth</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.080" end="01:20:21.679" style="s2">i actually use a word religio to talk</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.040" end="01:20:23.600" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.679" end="01:20:25.280" style="s2">that is one of the one of i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.600" end="01:20:27.280" style="s2">the preferred</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.280" end="01:20:28.480" style="s2">potential etymological origins for the</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.280" end="01:20:32.239" style="s2">word religion itself</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.480" end="01:20:35.280" style="s2">the sense of binding and connectedness</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.239" end="01:20:36.800" style="s2">so i think</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.280" end="01:20:38.800" style="s2">and and this has been deeply influenced</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.800" end="01:20:40.560" style="s2">by the work of james carson others</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.800" end="01:20:42.000" style="s2">i think that the the function of</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.560" end="01:20:48.000" style="s2">religions and</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.000" end="01:20:49.920" style="s2">so i got to do this careful i i argue</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.000" end="01:20:52.000" style="s2">that the function of religion is to give</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.920" end="01:20:55.280" style="s2">us an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.000" end="01:20:58.239" style="s2">and wealth and well-vetted psychotech</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.280" end="01:21:00.000" style="s2">that will address the perennial problems</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.239" end="01:21:03.280" style="s2">and enhance religion</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.000" end="01:21:05.750" style="s2">yeah but notice that</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.280" end="01:21:07.520" style="s2">no religion actually says it that way</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.750" end="01:21:12.159" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.520" end="01:21:12.159" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.239" end="01:21:16.719" style="s2">instead and again i&#39;ve been careful to</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.280" end="01:21:17.840" style="s2">note that i don&#39;t use this word</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.719" end="01:21:19.520" style="s2">pejoratively</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.840" end="01:21:21.280" style="s2">religions have what i would call a</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.520" end="01:21:26.239" style="s2">mythological way</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.280" end="01:21:29.920" style="s2">of trying to activate that functionality</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.239" end="01:21:35.199" style="s2">right yeah and that mythos</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.920" end="01:21:38.560" style="s2">has it depends like all mythos</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.199" end="01:21:42.080" style="s2">on a world view that properly</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.560" end="01:21:44.639" style="s2">situates it and connects it to</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.080" end="01:21:46.719" style="s2">a wisdom tradition is that okay yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.639" end="01:21:49.840" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.719" end="01:21:53.760" style="s2">this a set of revolutions</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.840" end="01:21:56.960" style="s2">right in the past that i mean cultural</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.760" end="01:21:58.480" style="s2">cognitive cognitive revolutions not so</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.960" end="01:22:00.400" style="s2">much political revolutions</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.480" end="01:22:03.520" style="s2">you know like the renaissance the</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.400" end="01:22:06.639" style="s2">reformation the scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.520" end="01:22:08.480" style="s2">have sundered that mythos that we</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.639" end="01:22:10.880" style="s2">inherited from the axial age</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.480" end="01:22:13.040" style="s2">the mythos of the two worlds and this</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.880" end="01:22:16.159" style="s2">world being less real</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.040" end="01:22:18.400" style="s2">and the way that got solidified</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.159" end="01:22:19.440" style="s2">and i would even argue ossified in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.400" end="01:22:22.639" style="s2">west into</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.440" end="01:22:24.800" style="s2">this this categorical difference between</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.639" end="01:22:28.080" style="s2">the natural and the supernatural</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.800" end="01:22:29.920" style="s2">uh and between and a categorical a</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.080" end="01:22:33.679" style="s2">disconnect between them</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.920" end="01:22:36.000" style="s2">and a categorical disconnection between</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.679" end="01:22:37.360" style="s2">faith and spirituality and reason and</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.000" end="01:22:40.000" style="s2">science that&#39;s something that are</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.360" end="01:22:41.840" style="s2">deeply opposed to each other because one</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.000" end="01:22:44.960" style="s2">is the doorway to the supernatural the</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.840" end="01:22:47.199" style="s2">other is the doorway to the natural</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.960" end="01:22:48.880" style="s2">whether or not this is actually how all</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.199" end="01:22:51.120" style="s2">christians practice or believe</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.880" end="01:22:52.639" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a very open question i</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.120" end="01:22:56.000" style="s2">meet many christians</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.639" end="01:22:59.120" style="s2">paul vander clay jp marceau harry cohen</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.000" end="01:23:00.960" style="s2">uh jonathan pedro that are in some</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.120" end="01:23:04.560" style="s2">significant way trying to</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.960" end="01:23:08.320" style="s2">i think reformulate that grammar um</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.560" end="01:23:11.920" style="s2">in a powerful way but regardless</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.320" end="01:23:14.000" style="s2">that history of that mythos</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.920" end="01:23:15.520" style="s2">and its disconnect from the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.000" end="01:23:17.440" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.520" end="01:23:19.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s written into the grammar of</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.440" end="01:23:20.239" style="s2">that mythology is its disconnect and its</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.440" end="01:23:22.400" style="s2">opposition</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.239" end="01:23:24.400" style="s2">and the way science has developed a</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.400" end="01:23:26.560" style="s2">counteractive mythos</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.400" end="01:23:27.840" style="s2">right that&#39;s antagonistic towards</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.560" end="01:23:29.520" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.840" end="01:23:30.960" style="s2">you know it politically tolerates it</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.520" end="01:23:32.560" style="s2">because that&#39;s polite but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.960" end="01:23:36.000" style="s2">ultimately antagonistic</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.560" end="01:23:39.520" style="s2">right and so we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.000" end="01:23:41.360" style="s2">profoundly grotesquely stupid</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.520" end="01:23:42.480" style="s2">separation sorry i don&#39;t usually let</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.360" end="01:23:43.520" style="s2">this strong but this is the part that</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.480" end="01:23:47.120" style="s2">really bothers me</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.520" end="01:23:48.639" style="s2">between knowledge right and wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.120" end="01:23:51.120" style="s2">which is like the ancient greeks would</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.639" end="01:23:54.639" style="s2">go what what is going on there</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.120" end="01:23:58.159" style="s2">right i think that</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.639" end="01:24:00.800" style="s2">the existing religions are so bound up</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.159" end="01:24:01.280" style="s2">and especially christianity but i think</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.800" end="01:24:03.440" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.280" end="01:24:05.920" style="s2">buddhism especially western buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.440" end="01:24:07.760" style="s2">because it has a two world mythos</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.920" end="01:24:09.480" style="s2">and there are definitely versions of zen</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.760" end="01:24:12.159" style="s2">i encounter them that are</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.480" end="01:24:14.239" style="s2">anti-scientific anti-intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.159" end="01:24:18.080" style="s2">in a profound way as if that again is</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.239" end="01:24:18.080" style="s2">the way to liberation right</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.120" end="01:24:27.199" style="s2">i don&#39;t think the existing religions</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.280" end="01:24:30.639" style="s2">have the capacity to bridge between</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.199" end="01:24:33.600" style="s2">science and spirituality in a w</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.639" end="01:24:35.199" style="s2">within a pluralistic dynamically</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.600" end="01:24:37.199" style="s2">complexifying world</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.199" end="01:24:38.719" style="s2">in a way that isn&#39;t needed right now to</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.199" end="01:24:41.040" style="s2">address the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.719" end="01:24:42.480" style="s2">they were crafted in a different time</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.040" end="01:24:45.520" style="s2">within a different history</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.480" end="01:24:47.199" style="s2">within a different mythos like</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.520" end="01:24:49.360" style="s2">christianity did not grow up in</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.199" end="01:24:53.600" style="s2">pluralism it did not grow up</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.360" end="01:24:55.600" style="s2">right in in a in a scientific world view</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.600" end="01:24:58.560" style="s2">that is massively successful</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.600" end="01:24:59.840" style="s2">right i can go on and on and i do in</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.560" end="01:25:03.440" style="s2">this series</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.840" end="01:25:03.440" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to say is that</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.639" end="01:25:09.440" style="s2">the religions that we have and i have</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.960" end="01:25:12.480" style="s2">done participatory observation</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.440" end="01:25:15.679" style="s2">in at least three of them deeply</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.480" end="01:25:19.040" style="s2">christianity buddhism taoism</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.679" end="01:25:22.480" style="s2">and i they are like my family i owe</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.040" end="01:25:23.600" style="s2">much to them and i am respectful and i</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.480" end="01:25:26.800" style="s2">have a loving</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.600" end="01:25:29.600" style="s2">attitude towards them or even</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.800" end="01:25:30.080" style="s2">neoplatonism uh within the west same</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.600" end="01:25:33.199" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.080" end="01:25:36.400" style="s2">deeply family deeply in love with it but</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.199" end="01:25:40.080" style="s2">ultimately none of those</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.400" end="01:25:43.280" style="s2">are have the framework that is needed</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.080" end="01:25:44.719" style="s2">for bringing about the deep</p>

<p begin="01:25:52.000" end="01:25:55.040" style="s2">right we are facing not only complexity</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.719" end="01:25:57.520" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.040" end="01:25:58.800" style="s2">a accelerating complexification of</p>

<p begin="01:25:58.800" end="01:26:03.520" style="s2">right i don&#39;t think the existing</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.600" end="01:26:06.719" style="s2">religions</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.520" end="01:26:07.679" style="s2">have what it takes and i say that with</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.719" end="01:26:10.800" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.679" end="01:26:13.199" style="s2">and respect for them and i recommend</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.800" end="01:26:15.679" style="s2">that people</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.199" end="01:26:17.199" style="s2">and i have tried to reinvent you as much</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.679" end="01:26:17.600" style="s2">instead of salvage which i used to use</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.199" end="01:26:19.840" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.600" end="01:26:21.679" style="s2">sounds like they&#39;re broken in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.840" end="01:26:23.920" style="s2">but i try to reinvent you from the</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.679" end="01:26:26.000" style="s2">existing religions</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.920" end="01:26:27.280" style="s2">not just me myself but other all these</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.000" end="01:26:29.040" style="s2">people all these communities and</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.280" end="01:26:30.880" style="s2">practices like rave kelly and</p>

<p begin="01:26:30.880" end="01:26:33.600" style="s2">right and you&#39;ve alluded to all these</p>

<p begin="01:26:41.600" end="01:26:47.520" style="s2">that we can reinvent you</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.199" end="01:26:48.320" style="s2">a new ecology of practices new</p>

<p begin="01:26:48.320" end="01:26:52.320" style="s2">and new myth with us</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.560" end="01:26:57.360" style="s2">that&#39;s a more of an artistic project</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.760" end="01:27:00.320" style="s2">that will reintegrate science and</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.360" end="01:27:03.520" style="s2">spirituality within within a pluralistic</p>

<p begin="01:27:03.520" end="01:27:06.880" style="s2">such that we can now address the meeting</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.960" end="01:27:09.520" style="s2">process that&#39;s what i&#39;m holding up</p>

<p begin="01:27:09.520" end="01:27:14.000" style="s2">this and i say there&#39;s a dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.760" end="01:27:15.679" style="s2">with people of of the existing faiths</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.000" end="01:27:17.600" style="s2">that is not a foreclosure argument</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.679" end="01:27:19.199" style="s2">it&#39;s not a deductive argument that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:27:19.920" end="01:27:23.440" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like a pascalian wager with</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.840" end="01:27:26.000" style="s2">all due respect to pascal</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.440" end="01:27:26.960" style="s2">right it&#39;s possible that christianity or</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.000" end="01:27:28.159" style="s2">buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.960" end="01:27:30.320" style="s2">because they&#39;ve done it before could</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.159" end="01:27:32.000" style="s2">reorganize themselves like you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.320" end="01:27:33.120" style="s2">buddhism integrated with taoism to</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.000" end="01:27:34.719" style="s2">become chair</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.120" end="01:27:36.560" style="s2">right and then it integrated with shinko</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.719" end="01:27:38.400" style="s2">to become zen right</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.560" end="01:27:40.400" style="s2">and you know neoplatonism and</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.400" end="01:27:41.440" style="s2">christianity were able to integrate</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.400" end="01:27:43.840" style="s2">and it was able to integrate</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.440" end="01:27:45.760" style="s2">aristotelian science maybe christianity</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.840" end="01:27:47.360" style="s2">or maybe buddhism or maybe some</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.760" end="01:27:49.360" style="s2">right religion may be able to</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.360" end="01:27:51.440" style="s2">reformulate itself in such a way</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.360" end="01:27:53.280" style="s2">that it can do what i&#39;m proposing but i</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.440" end="01:27:55.520" style="s2">just don&#39;t see it happening</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.280" end="01:27:56.639" style="s2">collectively i see it happening in</p>

<p begin="01:27:56.639" end="01:28:00.320" style="s2">but i don&#39;t see it happening</p>

<p begin="01:28:02.719" end="01:28:05.600" style="s2">place my bet</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.760" end="01:28:07.520" style="s2">on the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.600" end="01:28:10.800" style="s2">meaning by that</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.520" end="01:28:13.920" style="s2">it is a religion that tries to</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.800" end="01:28:15.679" style="s2">be other than a religion based on a two</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.920" end="01:28:18.639" style="s2">worlds mythology</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.679" end="01:28:19.440" style="s2">and is committed to new ecologies and</p>

<p begin="01:28:19.440" end="01:28:23.280" style="s2">but also the reinvention of old</p>

<p begin="01:28:23.280" end="01:28:28.320" style="s2">better said the reinvention of ecologies</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.920" end="01:28:30.159" style="s2">and practices both the recovering of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.320" end="01:28:32.400" style="s2">old and the discovering of the new</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.159" end="01:28:32.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.600" end="01:28:37.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what i mean by the religion</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.000" end="01:28:39.920" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.280" end="01:28:40.880" style="s2">the reinvention of those ecology of</p>

<p begin="01:28:45.360" end="01:28:49.120" style="s2">from our scientific historic our</p>

<p begin="01:28:53.840" end="01:29:00.159" style="s2">wow that was a masterpiece</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.360" end="01:29:00.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot there&#39;s a lot there one</p>

<p begin="01:29:00.560" end="01:29:05.840" style="s2">one thing i want to also weave into this</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.199" end="01:29:08.480" style="s2">because i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.840" end="01:29:08.960" style="s2">i think it&#39;s necessary you know and this</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.480" end="01:29:11.360" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.960" end="01:29:13.280" style="s2">this is still formulating in me but the</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.360" end="01:29:13.760" style="s2">importance is becoming more and more</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.280" end="01:29:15.920" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.760" end="01:29:18.480" style="s2">as i was writing that article we spoke</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.920" end="01:29:22.239" style="s2">about and even preparing for this</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.480" end="01:29:24.000" style="s2">um actually in one ear it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.239" end="01:29:26.080" style="s2">this is necessary and you&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.000" end="01:29:28.159" style="s2">it several times in this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.080" end="01:29:31.520" style="s2">the profound</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.159" end="01:29:34.159" style="s2">importance culture has on</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.520" end="01:29:34.880" style="s2">the collective and on the individual and</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.159" end="01:29:38.000" style="s2">it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.880" end="01:29:39.600" style="s2">that you know culture is the</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.000" end="01:29:42.320" style="s2">culture is the technology that humans</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.600" end="01:29:45.679" style="s2">wield right it&#39;s this massive sword that</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.320" end="01:29:48.400" style="s2">the giant of humanity does stuff with</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.679" end="01:29:49.920" style="s2">so it is it is extreme i&#39;ve written that</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.400" end="01:29:51.199" style="s2">in a different article so that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.920" end="01:29:54.159" style="s2">off the cuff but</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.199" end="01:29:55.120" style="s2">yeah like it is a it&#39;s a tool basically</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.159" end="01:29:58.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a tool that</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.120" end="01:30:00.560" style="s2">the collective has and that whether we</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.800" end="01:30:02.800" style="s2">whether we recognize it or not we can</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.560" end="01:30:05.120" style="s2">actually wield it it&#39;s not just some</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.800" end="01:30:07.440" style="s2">snowball falling down a mountain like we</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.120" end="01:30:09.840" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a feedback loop</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.440" end="01:30:10.719" style="s2">um and so you know what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.840" end="01:30:14.639" style="s2">important here</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.719" end="01:30:17.840" style="s2">is that culture is being shaped and that</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.639" end="01:30:19.840" style="s2">and for a long time throughout history</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.840" end="01:30:22.639" style="s2">and arguably still now</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.840" end="01:30:24.719" style="s2">religion was a vehicle for the</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.639" end="01:30:27.920" style="s2">transformation of culture</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.719" end="01:30:29.280" style="s2">right all of them though yes i think</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.920" end="01:30:31.520" style="s2">what you&#39;ve just done is beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.280" end="01:30:33.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the means by</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.520" end="01:30:35.600" style="s2">which we can transform</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.600" end="01:30:37.040" style="s2">culture and the distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.600" end="01:30:40.159" style="s2">that culture runs on</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.040" end="01:30:41.920" style="s2">but also individual cognition but also</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.159" end="01:30:44.400" style="s2">you know individual character but also</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.920" end="01:30:46.639" style="s2">shared the shared communication between</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.400" end="01:30:48.000" style="s2">individuals and the group that affords</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.639" end="01:30:51.600" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.000" end="01:30:54.880" style="s2">like it transforms all of those like</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.600" end="01:30:56.320" style="s2">and and i don&#39;t know of any other as i</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.880" end="01:30:56.880" style="s2">sort of talked over and i apologize for</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.320" end="01:30:58.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.880" end="01:30:59.920" style="s2">i would call culture like a tool of</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.400" end="01:31:02.480" style="s2">tools um</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.920" end="01:31:04.719" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a meta tool yeah and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.480" end="01:31:05.520" style="s2">dynamically self-organizing adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.719" end="01:31:07.199" style="s2">meta tool</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.520" end="01:31:08.560" style="s2">that creates all the other tools by</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.199" end="01:31:10.719" style="s2">which we adapt uh</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.560" end="01:31:12.639" style="s2">chris and i make use of pierce&#39;s idea uh</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.719" end="01:31:16.159" style="s2">idea that culture is ultimately a</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.639" end="01:31:18.080" style="s2">like religion insofar as it wields</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.159" end="01:31:18.719" style="s2">culture is ultimately a meta-meeting</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.080" end="01:31:20.400" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.719" end="01:31:21.679" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that allows us to</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.400" end="01:31:23.440" style="s2">generate all the other individual</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.679" end="01:31:26.800" style="s2">meeting systems</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.440" end="01:31:29.120" style="s2">and so i don&#39;t see anything other than</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.800" end="01:31:30.320" style="s2">religion being and thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.120" end="01:31:32.000" style="s2">bringing this point up because it was a</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.320" end="01:31:34.080" style="s2">lacuna in my presentation</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.000" end="01:31:35.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s very astute of you to point to</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.080" end="01:31:37.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.040" end="01:31:38.639" style="s2">i i don&#39;t see anything other than</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.360" end="01:31:41.520" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.639" end="01:31:43.120" style="s2">giving us what we need in order to bring</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.520" end="01:31:45.360" style="s2">about the transformation</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.120" end="01:31:46.480" style="s2">that will be as comprehensive and as</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.360" end="01:31:48.159" style="s2">profound</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.480" end="01:31:50.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s needed to deal with the</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.159" end="01:31:50.800" style="s2">meaning crisis and how the meeting</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.000" end="01:31:53.120" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.800" end="01:31:54.000" style="s2">interacts and exacerbates the meta</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.120" end="01:31:56.719" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.000" end="01:31:57.360" style="s2">they&#39;re just we just we don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.719" end="01:32:00.639" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.360" end="01:32:01.040" style="s2">the tool of tools for doing that like i</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.639" end="01:32:04.239" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.040" end="01:32:06.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t think the even though</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.239" end="01:32:07.199" style="s2">i i really want to be complimentary even</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.159" end="01:32:09.199" style="s2">though i think a lot of the existing</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.199" end="01:32:10.719" style="s2">religions are very good tools</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.199" end="01:32:12.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t think they&#39;re the right tool for</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.719" end="01:32:14.239" style="s2">this job</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.320" end="01:32:15.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we need the religion</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.239" end="01:32:18.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.520" end="01:32:20.320" style="s2">that&#39;s why i often say i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.880" end="01:32:22.639" style="s2">i&#39;m not advocating for the french</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.320" end="01:32:24.000" style="s2">revolution i&#39;m not i&#39;m not advocating</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.639" end="01:32:27.120" style="s2">primarily for</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.000" end="01:32:29.440" style="s2">a political attempt to reorganize</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.120" end="01:32:31.679" style="s2">on the system of governance and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.440" end="01:32:33.600" style="s2">the distribution of goods within society</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.679" end="01:32:35.360" style="s2">i mean people can vary in what they mean</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.600" end="01:32:36.000" style="s2">by the word political that&#39;s what i take</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.360" end="01:32:38.400" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.000" end="01:32:40.159" style="s2">uh the meaning of a political revolution</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.400" end="01:32:42.239" style="s2">i know there are other people like uh</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.159" end="01:32:43.679" style="s2">that that people have a more profound</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.239" end="01:32:46.320" style="s2">reading of political</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.679" end="01:32:47.280" style="s2">but that&#39;s how i&#39;m using it i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.320" end="01:32:49.280" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.280" end="01:32:51.120" style="s2">the french revolution i want something</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.280" end="01:32:52.719" style="s2">like the axial revolution i want</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.120" end="01:32:54.480" style="s2">something like what we had when we had</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.719" end="01:32:55.760" style="s2">the three r&#39;s of the renaissance the</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.480" end="01:32:56.960" style="s2">reformation and the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.760" end="01:32:59.840" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.960" end="01:33:01.199" style="s2">that you know radically comprehensively</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.840" end="01:33:04.639" style="s2">transform</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.199" end="01:33:05.760" style="s2">um culture cognition character and</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.639" end="01:33:09.280" style="s2">community tasks</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.760" end="01:33:12.000" style="s2">in a deeply reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.280" end="01:33:12.719" style="s2">and profound way that&#39;s what we need</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.000" end="01:33:15.520" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.719" end="01:33:17.360" style="s2">something like that yeah and this</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.520" end="01:33:19.600" style="s2">actually leads into</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.360" end="01:33:21.360" style="s2">something i appreciate that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.600" end="01:33:22.960" style="s2">more and more out of both you and</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.360" end="01:33:25.280" style="s2">and jordan hall and some of the thinkers</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.960" end="01:33:26.400" style="s2">in this space the idea of stealing the</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.280" end="01:33:28.639" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.400" end="01:33:29.760" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s a very it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.639" end="01:33:31.600" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.760" end="01:33:33.199" style="s2">term because i think there are two</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.600" end="01:33:36.560" style="s2">things worth worth</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.199" end="01:33:39.760" style="s2">looping in here one is that</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.560" end="01:33:41.760" style="s2">a recognition that kind of global or</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.760" end="01:33:43.920" style="s2">western culture as it stands right now</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.760" end="01:33:45.679" style="s2">is not going in a good direction</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.920" end="01:33:46.639" style="s2">for two reasons one you should just</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.679" end="01:33:48.400" style="s2">listen to anything daniel</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.639" end="01:33:51.600" style="s2">schmachtenberger and jordan hall say</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.400" end="01:33:54.159" style="s2">about the meta crisis and how</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.600" end="01:33:55.520" style="s2">you know culture has downstreamed that</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.159" end="01:33:57.520" style="s2">to to come into being</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.520" end="01:33:58.560" style="s2">and also you know we spoke earlier that</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.520" end="01:34:01.679" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.560" end="01:34:02.880" style="s2">we are living in a meeting crisis that</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.679" end="01:34:05.120" style="s2">has come out of</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.880" end="01:34:06.400" style="s2">a culture this culture and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.120" end="01:34:09.520" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.400" end="01:34:11.440" style="s2">not ideal the other very sneaky thing</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.520" end="01:34:13.679" style="s2">is that all the perennial problems all</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.440" end="01:34:15.120" style="s2">the meaning crisis stuff</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.679" end="01:34:16.800" style="s2">it&#39;s hard enough to deal with by</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.120" end="01:34:19.360" style="s2">yourself and as a community</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.800" end="01:34:21.760" style="s2">but it can also be hijacked it can also</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.360" end="01:34:24.800" style="s2">be weaponized against you</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.760" end="01:34:25.360" style="s2">totally and that is happening in so many</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.800" end="01:34:27.920" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.360" end="01:34:28.639" style="s2">right all the hyper normal stimuli all</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.920" end="01:34:31.120" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.639" end="01:34:32.960" style="s2">kind of unsubstantiate unsubstantial</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.120" end="01:34:35.600" style="s2">food right and just</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.960" end="01:34:37.600" style="s2">like it can all those things difficult</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.600" end="01:34:39.280" style="s2">enough when you have a fighting chance</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.600" end="01:34:41.040" style="s2">extremely difficult when it gets</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.280" end="01:34:43.840" style="s2">weaponized against you for</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.040" end="01:34:46.239" style="s2">power and status games right and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.840" end="01:34:48.880" style="s2">there is this</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.239" end="01:34:50.400" style="s2">the current culture which and for many</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.880" end="01:34:53.440" style="s2">good reasons we can argue</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.400" end="01:34:56.239" style="s2">is inadequate to what we need to face</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.440" end="01:34:58.560" style="s2">also has a momentum carrying it forward</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.239" end="01:35:01.520" style="s2">and people who want to play that game</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.560" end="01:35:02.000" style="s2">to basically weaponize it against you</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.520" end="01:35:04.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.000" end="01:35:05.440" style="s2">the appropriate thing seems to become if</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.400" end="01:35:07.600" style="s2">anyone cares about</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.440" end="01:35:08.480" style="s2">self others and world and the betterment</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.600" end="01:35:10.480" style="s2">of all of them</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.480" end="01:35:11.600" style="s2">you actually have to steal the culture</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.480" end="01:35:14.080" style="s2">bottom up</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.600" end="01:35:16.239" style="s2">right you actually have to straight up</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.080" end="01:35:16.800" style="s2">just create a gravity towards you that</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.239" end="01:35:19.280" style="s2">is like</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.800" end="01:35:20.400" style="s2">this is approachable enough i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.280" end="01:35:22.560" style="s2">flourishing enough</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.400" end="01:35:25.119" style="s2">it others are flourishing enough we have</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.560" end="01:35:26.880" style="s2">community our world is getting better</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.119" end="01:35:28.800" style="s2">so much so that they&#39;re like i just like</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.880" end="01:35:32.320" style="s2">that more like i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.800" end="01:35:34.880" style="s2">i&#39;m going over there and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.320" end="01:35:36.480" style="s2">you know i&#39;m certainly in some some more</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.880" end="01:35:40.000" style="s2">spiritual circles now</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.480" end="01:35:43.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s always this hesitancy in</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.000" end="01:35:46.159" style="s2">in people in this space to</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.440" end="01:35:46.800" style="s2">basically accumulate status or power or</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.159" end="01:35:48.880" style="s2">wealth</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.800" end="01:35:50.159" style="s2">right they view them as inherently evil</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.880" end="01:35:52.719" style="s2">and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.159" end="01:35:53.520" style="s2">guys like you are the people that should</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.719" end="01:35:55.679" style="s2">have this</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.520" end="01:35:57.440" style="s2">right or not should but like i would</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.679" end="01:35:57.920" style="s2">like to give it more to you than anyone</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.440" end="01:35:59.360" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.920" end="01:36:01.840" style="s2">and yet you don&#39;t even want to enter the</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.360" end="01:36:03.600" style="s2">game at all but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.840" end="01:36:05.199" style="s2">and what i&#39;ve appreciated most i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.600" end="01:36:07.199" style="s2">actually seen it in you a lot</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.199" end="01:36:09.600" style="s2">jordan hall has always been kind of</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.199" end="01:36:10.560" style="s2">subversive but this this warrior energy</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.600" end="01:36:12.239" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.560" end="01:36:14.159" style="s2">yo we are about to do battle we are</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.239" end="01:36:15.280" style="s2">going to steal the culture we are going</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.159" end="01:36:18.560" style="s2">to rise up and do this</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.280" end="01:36:19.440" style="s2">because we need to i need to do it for</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.560" end="01:36:22.400" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.440" end="01:36:23.840" style="s2">my own just existential piece and i need</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.400" end="01:36:24.880" style="s2">to do it for the world because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.840" end="01:36:28.239" style="s2">what&#39;s being called</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.880" end="01:36:30.560" style="s2">so um uh actually if i can ramble</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.239" end="01:36:32.480" style="s2">one more second on that please this is</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.560" end="01:36:34.320" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.480" end="01:36:36.159" style="s2">i think something that doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.320" end="01:36:37.360" style="s2">spoken enough about as well is this</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.159" end="01:36:40.480" style="s2">angry activist</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.360" end="01:36:41.840" style="s2">archetype you know something</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.480" end="01:36:43.920" style="s2">something like the climate change</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.840" end="01:36:46.800" style="s2">activists are a good example</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.920" end="01:36:47.280" style="s2">with a lot of anger a lot of justified</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.800" end="01:36:48.880" style="s2">anger</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.280" end="01:36:50.880" style="s2">things are things are bad but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.880" end="01:36:52.960" style="s2">always a yelling at what you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.880" end="01:36:56.159" style="s2">the world to be like</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.960" end="01:36:59.520" style="s2">and if you only exist in a space of</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.159" end="01:37:00.560" style="s2">not this not this if you actually get</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.520" end="01:37:03.679" style="s2">your way</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.560" end="01:37:05.280" style="s2">you end up in a void because you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.679" end="01:37:08.560" style="s2">you haven&#39;t actually advocated</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.280" end="01:37:09.920" style="s2">for anything you&#39;re just advocating</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.560" end="01:37:11.920" style="s2">against stuff</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.920" end="01:37:13.520" style="s2">and so this also why i&#39;m so excited</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.920" end="01:37:13.840" style="s2">about the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.520" end="01:37:16.080" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.840" end="01:37:17.920" style="s2">you also call it the post-religious</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.080" end="01:37:20.159" style="s2">faith which i really like</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.920" end="01:37:20.960" style="s2">and this notion of steal the culture is</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.159" end="01:37:23.520" style="s2">that it&#39;s act</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.960" end="01:37:24.800" style="s2">it actually gives people an orient a way</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.520" end="01:37:27.840" style="s2">to orient where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.800" end="01:37:30.480" style="s2">for something yeah and they can actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.840" end="01:37:30.880" style="s2">bring that it&#39;s tangible it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.480" end="01:37:33.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.880" end="01:37:35.119" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it wrong you suck go away</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.520" end="01:37:37.520" style="s2">it&#39;s actually like well let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.119" end="01:37:39.679" style="s2">this and you can come up with points and</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.520" end="01:37:42.159" style="s2">frameworks and things and that seems</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.679" end="01:37:44.880" style="s2">that has by its very nature more ground</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.159" end="01:37:46.639" style="s2">to stand on it&#39;s actually substantial</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.880" end="01:37:47.600" style="s2">i think it has more ground to stand on</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.639" end="01:37:49.040" style="s2">thank you for what you just said i</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.600" end="01:37:49.440" style="s2">thought that was very well said by the</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.040" end="01:37:51.119" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.440" end="01:37:53.119" style="s2">i think it&#39;s actually also a better</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.119" end="01:37:56.880" style="s2">understanding of what freedom is</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.119" end="01:37:57.920" style="s2">which is you know again go back to dirk</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.880" end="01:38:00.480" style="s2">brook breakthrough</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.920" end="01:38:01.920" style="s2">you you know the advocate you write well</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.480" end="01:38:04.320" style="s2">at least a particular version of</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.920" end="01:38:06.560" style="s2">advocacy</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.320" end="01:38:08.400" style="s2">advocacy can degenerate and so i&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.560" end="01:38:10.719" style="s2">it a degenerative form</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.400" end="01:38:12.159" style="s2">where as you said the person who&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.719" end="01:38:13.040" style="s2">angry and what they want is they want</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.159" end="01:38:16.480" style="s2">freedom from</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.040" end="01:38:18.719" style="s2">acts and that&#39;s right but there is no</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.480" end="01:38:20.239" style="s2">freedom from without freedom too</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.719" end="01:38:22.080" style="s2">the reverse is also the case there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.239" end="01:38:23.760" style="s2">freedom too without freedom from</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.080" end="01:38:25.360" style="s2">right you have to you have to break the</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.760" end="01:38:26.159" style="s2">frame but you also have to make the new</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.360" end="01:38:29.840" style="s2">frame</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.159" end="01:38:33.520" style="s2">right um and so if people get locked</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.840" end="01:38:37.040" style="s2">into anger and if they get locked into</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.520" end="01:38:37.840" style="s2">outrage um they have to be careful about</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.040" end="01:38:39.840" style="s2">that because</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.840" end="01:38:40.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a lopsided understanding and</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.840" end="01:38:44.320" style="s2">appreciation</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.880" end="01:38:45.520" style="s2">of liberation it&#39;s only freedom from its</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.320" end="01:38:47.679" style="s2">own freedom too</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.520" end="01:38:49.040" style="s2">and secondly they have to be careful</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.679" end="01:38:50.880" style="s2">that although</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.040" end="01:38:52.480" style="s2">they&#39;re that they&#39;re getting locked into</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.880" end="01:38:54.239" style="s2">just the propositional they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.480" end="01:38:55.920" style="s2">locked into what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.239" end="01:38:57.280" style="s2">and not paying attention to how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.920" end="01:39:00.000" style="s2">saying it because</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.280" end="01:39:01.040" style="s2">they should understand that the way</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.000" end="01:39:03.840" style="s2">modal confusion</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.040" end="01:39:04.880" style="s2">is weaponized in our culture especially</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.840" end="01:39:07.840" style="s2">on the internet</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.880" end="01:39:09.360" style="s2">is by making people trying to create uh</p>

<p begin="01:39:13.600" end="01:39:17.440" style="s2">uh because if i can get people into</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.080" end="01:39:18.960" style="s2">deeply opposing groups where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.440" end="01:39:21.840" style="s2">deeply angry to each other</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.960" end="01:39:23.760" style="s2">that will make them salient like in a</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.840" end="01:39:26.480" style="s2">very superficial and fast way</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.760" end="01:39:27.760" style="s2">make them very click-baity uh and very</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.480" end="01:39:31.440" style="s2">sound bitey</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.760" end="01:39:34.400" style="s2">uh and so but you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.440" end="01:39:35.119" style="s2">a lot of social media the algorithms i</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.400" end="01:39:36.719" style="s2">don&#39;t think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.119" end="01:39:38.480" style="s2">i&#39;m not doing a conspiracy they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.719" end="01:39:39.119" style="s2">designed in this set there&#39;s not a</p>

<p begin="01:39:39.119" end="01:39:44.159" style="s2">there&#39;s not a cabal of people in the</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.040" end="01:39:46.159" style="s2">room smoking cigars planning things</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.159" end="01:39:47.679" style="s2">but they they they&#39;re they&#39;re designed</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.159" end="01:39:49.760" style="s2">to enhance sales</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.679" end="01:39:50.719" style="s2">uh by basically making people very</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.760" end="01:39:53.760" style="s2">impulsive</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.719" end="01:39:57.119" style="s2">and oppositional and very superficial</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.760" end="01:40:00.480" style="s2">in their appraisal so if i can make you</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.119" end="01:40:03.920" style="s2">like get you outraged that is a powerful</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.480" end="01:40:07.600" style="s2">machine to benefit um</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.920" end="01:40:10.159" style="s2">the way in which i can use you</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.600" end="01:40:11.600" style="s2">to sell my products and to use you to</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.159" end="01:40:14.800" style="s2">sell my ideas</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.600" end="01:40:17.679" style="s2">so one of the concerns i have i</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.800" end="01:40:18.880" style="s2">i share with you the concern that</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.679" end="01:40:22.159" style="s2">advocacy</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.880" end="01:40:24.239" style="s2">when it is reduced to anger</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.159" end="01:40:25.520" style="s2">uh is a lopsided understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.239" end="01:40:28.480" style="s2">liberation</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.520" end="01:40:28.800" style="s2">and it is also a truncated uh fixation</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.480" end="01:40:31.840" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.800" end="01:40:34.800" style="s2">what is being said rather than how</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.840" end="01:40:35.679" style="s2">it is being said and people can fail to</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.800" end="01:40:39.280" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.679" end="01:40:42.400" style="s2">that in the very the very speaking</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.280" end="01:40:44.159" style="s2">of uh of liberation they can actually be</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.400" end="01:40:46.159" style="s2">embodying processes</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.159" end="01:40:47.920" style="s2">that are entrapping them and ensnaring</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.159" end="01:40:50.239" style="s2">them um</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.920" end="01:40:51.760" style="s2">so to give you a concrete example people</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.239" end="01:40:55.119" style="s2">confuse</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.760" end="01:40:58.000" style="s2">speaking about a diversity of beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.119" end="01:40:58.719" style="s2">with having a belief in diversity right</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.000" end="01:41:02.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.719" end="01:41:02.960" style="s2">like you know saying that we should have</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.000" end="01:41:04.560" style="s2">diversity</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.960" end="01:41:06.080" style="s2">is not the same thing as enacting</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.560" end="01:41:08.400" style="s2">diversity right</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.080" end="01:41:08.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.600" end="01:41:13.040" style="s2">and so you have it like and you have to</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.760" end="01:41:14.880" style="s2">be careful because one doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.040" end="01:41:18.000" style="s2">automatically guarantee the other</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.880" end="01:41:20.000" style="s2">in fact one can actually subvert</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.000" end="01:41:21.280" style="s2">the other everybody&#39;s got to believe</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.000" end="01:41:24.560" style="s2">this it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.280" end="01:41:26.639" style="s2">but right um so</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.560" end="01:41:29.280" style="s2">again i&#39;m not talking i&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.639" end="01:41:30.960" style="s2">paint all of protest with the same brush</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.280" end="01:41:32.639" style="s2">or anything stupid like that</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.960" end="01:41:34.639" style="s2">trying to pick up on a particular</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.639" end="01:41:35.840" style="s2">criticism you made and i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.639" end="01:41:40.719" style="s2">it&#39;s an important one</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.840" end="01:41:43.440" style="s2">we need to bring back right freedom from</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.719" end="01:41:45.840" style="s2">something that is giving us a new frame</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.440" end="01:41:46.800" style="s2">as opposed to the one we want to break</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.840" end="01:41:49.679" style="s2">and we need to</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.800" end="01:41:51.280" style="s2">realize that anger is a very short-term</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.679" end="01:41:53.840" style="s2">response to</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.280" end="01:41:55.199" style="s2">violation but it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.840" end="01:41:56.719" style="s2">constructive</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.199" end="01:41:59.199" style="s2">you need you and i&#39;m sorry this will</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.719" end="01:42:01.600" style="s2">sound happy but you need love</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.199" end="01:42:02.560" style="s2">you need love you need love is the</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.600" end="01:42:04.639" style="s2">creative</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.560" end="01:42:06.239" style="s2">you need love because love is what is</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.639" end="01:42:07.760" style="s2">what refrigerants have to argue you need</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.239" end="01:42:10.480" style="s2">the positive emotions</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.760" end="01:42:11.360" style="s2">the negative emotions like anger and</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.480" end="01:42:13.840" style="s2">hate this is</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.360" end="01:42:16.000" style="s2">like this is some cock&#39;s side they</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.840" end="01:42:19.760" style="s2">engender reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.000" end="01:42:22.560" style="s2">they remove cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.760" end="01:42:25.280" style="s2">but love engenders insight and</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.560" end="01:42:29.119" style="s2">reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.280" end="01:42:34.880" style="s2">and if you only have this you only have</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.119" end="01:42:37.520" style="s2">a reciprocal narrowing of frame breaking</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.880" end="01:42:39.440" style="s2">and the having propositions you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.520" end="01:42:42.960" style="s2">going to get the reciprocal opening and</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.440" end="01:42:46.080" style="s2">the being free</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.960" end="01:42:50.080" style="s2">yeah and so i</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.080" end="01:42:53.360" style="s2">like i think</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.080" end="01:42:56.400" style="s2">we need something i</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.360" end="01:42:59.520" style="s2">my model is the model of early</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.400" end="01:43:02.560" style="s2">christianity and buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.520" end="01:43:04.400" style="s2">or stoicism three examples</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.560" end="01:43:06.000" style="s2">or neoplatonism there&#39;s four those are</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.400" end="01:43:07.840" style="s2">four i know of deeply</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.000" end="01:43:09.040" style="s2">right and what you have is think about</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.840" end="01:43:10.480" style="s2">christianity because people</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.040" end="01:43:12.480" style="s2">you know you have paul you have other</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.480" end="01:43:13.679" style="s2">and you you get all of these communities</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.480" end="01:43:14.719" style="s2">and what we have now all of these</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.679" end="01:43:16.560" style="s2">communities with</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.719" end="01:43:17.760" style="s2">qualities and practices and they start</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.560" end="01:43:20.000" style="s2">to network together</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.760" end="01:43:21.600" style="s2">and they create a new way of love agape</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.000" end="01:43:24.080" style="s2">and a new way and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.600" end="01:43:25.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just in the head they they</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.080" end="01:43:27.600" style="s2">go out and they create</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.600" end="01:43:29.440" style="s2">the first real welfare and the first</p>

<p begin="01:46:42.159" end="01:46:46.880" style="s2">came to do a meeting wave set for our uh</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.880" end="01:46:48.639" style="s2">we hosted a digital retreat right at the</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.880" end="01:46:49.520" style="s2">beginning of covid to kind of give some</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.639" end="01:46:52.320" style="s2">people some</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.520" end="01:46:54.639" style="s2">space and he came to to mix for us and</p>

<p begin="01:46:57.760" end="01:47:01.199" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.639" end="01:47:01.840" style="s2">from our man johnny v right here and it</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.199" end="01:47:05.440" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.840" end="01:47:08.480" style="s2">it is stunning it is stunning and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.440" end="01:47:11.360" style="s2">actually funny enough that was a perfect</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.480" end="01:47:12.880" style="s2">segue because i wanted to lead into the</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.360" end="01:47:14.320" style="s2">fact that</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.880" end="01:47:16.639" style="s2">you know this has been a pretty serious</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.320" end="01:47:18.560" style="s2">conversation right i think justifiably</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.639" end="01:47:20.480" style="s2">so like this is important</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.560" end="01:47:22.000" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that the doing of</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.480" end="01:47:25.280" style="s2">it itself has to</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.000" end="01:47:28.400" style="s2">be strenuous and disappointing</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.280" end="01:47:29.920" style="s2">and annoying because actually i think</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.400" end="01:47:32.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a case to make where</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.920" end="01:47:34.239" style="s2">if done properly or the most effective</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.800" end="01:47:35.920" style="s2">way you could do this</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.239" end="01:47:37.280" style="s2">and design these things and discover</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.920" end="01:47:41.280" style="s2">these practices</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.280" end="01:47:44.480" style="s2">is through things like serious play</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.280" end="01:47:47.679" style="s2">flow state and inside cascades and</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.480" end="01:47:49.119" style="s2">something like circling and deal logos</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.679" end="01:47:50.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of the progression i want</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.119" end="01:47:54.159" style="s2">to go through you give a</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.880" end="01:47:54.639" style="s2">brilliant definition of play that i</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.159" end="01:47:57.840" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.639" end="01:48:00.000" style="s2">should be way more known and and</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.840" end="01:48:00.880" style="s2">just a reframing of play itself and the</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.000" end="01:48:04.159" style="s2">value of it</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.880" end="01:48:06.560" style="s2">can you speak to that</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.159" end="01:48:08.159" style="s2">um so i mean this this is ultimately</p>

<p begin="01:48:19.760" end="01:48:22.880" style="s2">this is the hard argument um i&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.520" end="01:48:25.119" style="s2">talk out there called why</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.880" end="01:48:26.719" style="s2">you know psychological growth impossible</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.119" end="01:48:27.679" style="s2">has to do with the idea of aspiration</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.719" end="01:48:29.440" style="s2">and transformation</p>

<p begin="01:49:10.639" end="01:49:15.440" style="s2">propositionally they can state it</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.560" end="01:49:15.920" style="s2">right but but they don&#39;t they&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.440" end="01:49:18.960" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.920" end="01:49:21.520" style="s2">they can&#39;t get to the self and that</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.960" end="01:49:22.719" style="s2">and that agent arena relationship that</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.520" end="01:49:25.119" style="s2">they need to be in</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.719" end="01:49:26.560" style="s2">in order to be alleviated from the loss</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.119" end="01:49:28.560" style="s2">of agency</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.560" end="01:49:31.520" style="s2">right that they&#39;re suffering that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.560" end="01:49:34.400" style="s2">they go into therapy</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.520" end="01:49:35.440" style="s2">and so what what does the therapist do</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.400" end="01:49:37.599" style="s2">for them</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.440" end="01:49:38.880" style="s2">why is it problematic well this goes to</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.599" end="01:49:39.840" style="s2">ellie paul&#39;s work and she gives a</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.880" end="01:49:43.040" style="s2">wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.840" end="01:49:44.639" style="s2">uh sort of uh duncan experiments uh to</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.040" end="01:49:46.080" style="s2">get you and understand the difficulties</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.639" end="01:49:48.000" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.080" end="01:49:49.599" style="s2">um she says imagine your friends come to</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.000" end="01:49:51.280" style="s2">you and they give you just</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.599" end="01:49:52.880" style="s2">undeniable evidence that they can do the</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.280" end="01:49:54.880" style="s2">following they can turn you into a</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.880" end="01:49:57.599" style="s2">vampire</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.880" end="01:49:58.800" style="s2">and then she asked should we do it so</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.599" end="01:49:59.360" style="s2">how would you do it well how would you</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.800" end="01:50:01.040" style="s2">think about it</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.360" end="01:50:02.159" style="s2">well here&#39;s the problem you could you</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.040" end="01:50:03.440" style="s2">have all kinds of propositional</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.159" end="01:50:04.320" style="s2">knowledge but notice that that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.440" end="01:50:06.000" style="s2">knowledge you want</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.320" end="01:50:07.440" style="s2">you want to know what it&#39;s like to be a</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.000" end="01:50:09.360" style="s2">vampire you want to know the</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.440" end="01:50:11.119" style="s2">perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.360" end="01:50:12.880" style="s2">right and you want to know what&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.119" end="01:50:14.960" style="s2">like what&#39;s the identity like</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.880" end="01:50:16.719" style="s2">the agent arena participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.960" end="01:50:18.639" style="s2">because your biology and your character</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.719" end="01:50:20.560" style="s2">and everything&#39;s going to be transformed</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.639" end="01:50:21.840" style="s2">and and you can&#39;t know that until you go</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.560" end="01:50:23.520" style="s2">through that transformation</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.840" end="01:50:25.360" style="s2">the problem is if you go through that</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.520" end="01:50:26.560" style="s2">transformation you&#39;re no longer going to</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.360" end="01:50:29.040" style="s2">be a human being</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.560" end="01:50:29.679" style="s2">right so you&#39;re ignorant you&#39;re ignorant</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.040" end="01:50:32.239" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.679" end="01:50:33.280" style="s2">this is not about propositions and</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.239" end="01:50:35.119" style="s2">probabilities</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.280" end="01:50:37.440" style="s2">it&#39;s about perspectives and</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.119" end="01:50:39.360" style="s2">participation in identities</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.440" end="01:50:41.040" style="s2">right you can&#39;t you&#39;re ignorant you</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.360" end="01:50:43.199" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it will be like</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.040" end="01:50:44.639" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing if</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.199" end="01:50:45.520" style="s2">you don&#39;t become a vampire but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.639" end="01:50:48.000" style="s2">the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.520" end="01:50:49.599" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to lose</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.000" end="01:50:50.239" style="s2">when you become a vampire so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.599" end="01:50:52.880" style="s2">caught</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.239" end="01:50:54.400" style="s2">and this is brian&#39;s uh idea right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.880" end="01:50:56.080" style="s2">caught between two worlds</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.400" end="01:50:57.520" style="s2">yeah right it&#39;s in the title of his book</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.080" end="01:50:58.159" style="s2">you know education between two worlds</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.520" end="01:51:01.360" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.159" end="01:51:02.320" style="s2">you&#39;re caught between two worlds so what</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.360" end="01:51:04.000" style="s2">do you do</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.320" end="01:51:05.760" style="s2">well laurie laurie is really sort of</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.000" end="01:51:07.119" style="s2">interested in hammering out that problem</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.760" end="01:51:09.360" style="s2">and making people realize</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.119" end="01:51:10.880" style="s2">that you can&#39;t infer your way through it</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.360" end="01:51:12.000" style="s2">right it&#39;s not it&#39;s not something you</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.880" end="01:51:13.440" style="s2">can infer your way through</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.000" end="01:51:15.199" style="s2">and if people want a more technical</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.440" end="01:51:18.239" style="s2">presentation of that argument look</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.199" end="01:51:19.920" style="s2">to that talk i refer to right but</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.239" end="01:51:21.679" style="s2">so what do we do well what do you do in</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.920" end="01:51:23.360" style="s2">therapy</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.679" end="01:51:25.199" style="s2">well you you might say to me well wait</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.360" end="01:51:26.000" style="s2">wait this is ridiculous i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.199" end="01:51:27.520" style="s2">be a vampire</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.000" end="01:51:29.119" style="s2">yeah but you know what you might become</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.520" end="01:51:30.960" style="s2">that you&#39;re not right now you might</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.119" end="01:51:32.960" style="s2">become a parent</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.960" end="01:51:34.400" style="s2">and right now you&#39;re not a parent and</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.960" end="01:51:35.520" style="s2">all your propositional knowledge about</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.400" end="01:51:37.599" style="s2">being a parent</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.520" end="01:51:39.280" style="s2">isn&#39;t the perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.599" end="01:51:39.920" style="s2">knowing of being a parent and being a</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.280" end="01:51:41.840" style="s2">kid</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.920" end="01:51:43.440" style="s2">does not give you the perspectival and</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.840" end="01:51:45.760" style="s2">participatory knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.440" end="01:51:47.040" style="s2">of being a parent sorry doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.760" end="01:51:50.639" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.040" end="01:51:52.880" style="s2">well i&#39;ll just become a parent then well</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.639" end="01:51:55.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to lose</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.880" end="01:51:56.880" style="s2">yeah and you say well then i won&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.760" end="01:51:59.119" style="s2">ah but then you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.880" end="01:52:01.520" style="s2">missing so what do you do</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.119" end="01:52:02.159" style="s2">well what do people do so this is where</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.520" end="01:52:04.000" style="s2">this is now</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.159" end="01:52:05.920" style="s2">sort of my work and this was influenced</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.000" end="01:52:08.239" style="s2">by winnicott</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.920" end="01:52:10.239" style="s2">but people get a dog and then they take</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.239" end="01:52:11.520" style="s2">family pictures with the dog and they</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.239" end="01:52:12.880" style="s2">name the dog like a person</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.520" end="01:52:14.400" style="s2">and they let the dog sleep with them and</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.880" end="01:52:15.679" style="s2">they often get the dog as a puppy and</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.400" end="01:52:18.320" style="s2">they have to raise it</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.679" end="01:52:19.520" style="s2">and they what are they doing well</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.320" end="01:52:21.199" style="s2">they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.520" end="01:52:23.360" style="s2">enacting a symbol the word symbol on</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.199" end="01:52:25.840" style="s2">means to join two things together</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.360" end="01:52:27.199" style="s2">they&#39;re finding something that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.840" end="01:52:29.440" style="s2">similar enough</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.199" end="01:52:31.360" style="s2">to a child that they&#39;re getting a</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.440" end="01:52:34.400" style="s2">perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.360" end="01:52:36.639" style="s2">taste but it&#39;s not fully a child</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.400" end="01:52:38.000" style="s2">and so they can you know they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.639" end="01:52:39.280" style="s2">they&#39;re not over committed</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.000" end="01:52:41.360" style="s2">they&#39;re not they haven&#39;t passed the</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.280" end="01:52:43.599" style="s2">point of no return</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.360" end="01:52:45.280" style="s2">right because it&#39;s a dog and you know</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.599" end="01:52:46.960" style="s2">you can give your dog away and people</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.280" end="01:52:49.199" style="s2">don&#39;t think you&#39;re an immoral</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.960" end="01:52:50.400" style="s2">person but if you say you know what this</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.199" end="01:52:52.800" style="s2">isn&#39;t working with my kid</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.400" end="01:52:53.840" style="s2">not my kid or what&#39;s wrong with you</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.800" end="01:52:56.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.840" end="01:52:58.840" style="s2">so that&#39;s an example of play we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.960" end="01:53:01.679" style="s2">reduced play to the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.840" end="01:53:02.880" style="s2">frivolousness but many people</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.679" end="01:53:05.679" style="s2">developmental</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.880" end="01:53:06.239" style="s2">psychologist developmental biologists</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.679" end="01:53:09.119" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.239" end="01:53:10.880" style="s2">point out that what play does is it</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.119" end="01:53:13.040" style="s2">allows us to enact</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.880" end="01:53:14.320" style="s2">symbolically and i mean symbol in a deep</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.040" end="01:53:17.599" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.320" end="01:53:20.159" style="s2">the perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.599" end="01:53:20.880" style="s2">aspects of the future self in the future</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.159" end="01:53:24.239" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.880" end="01:53:26.400" style="s2">without having stepped out of and so now</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.239" end="01:53:29.599" style="s2">i can actually compare them</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.400" end="01:53:31.760" style="s2">in play and i and this is serious play</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.599" end="01:53:33.440" style="s2">this is not frivolous play this is the</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.760" end="01:53:36.480" style="s2">serious play that i engage it</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.440" end="01:53:39.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what you do in therapy in therapy</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.480" end="01:53:40.880" style="s2">you seriously play the therapist often</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.920" end="01:53:44.239" style="s2">takes on</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.880" end="01:53:49.040" style="s2">the role right of the roles you need</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.239" end="01:53:51.840" style="s2">analogous to the pet right so</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.040" end="01:53:52.840" style="s2">you need perhaps to engage with serious</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.840" end="01:53:56.000" style="s2">play with your</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.840" end="01:53:59.119" style="s2">mom the perhaps your mom&#39;s dead</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.000" end="01:54:01.440" style="s2">that&#39;s my case what do i do well the</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.119" end="01:54:04.000" style="s2">therapist can take on the role for you</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.440" end="01:54:04.960" style="s2">and you can seriously play with that so</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.000" end="01:54:06.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.960" end="01:54:08.960" style="s2">something that wasn&#39;t possible for you</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.800" end="01:54:10.880" style="s2">while your mom was alive</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.960" end="01:54:12.560" style="s2">but that might be possible you might be</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.880" end="01:54:13.679" style="s2">able to go through a process of</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.560" end="01:54:16.159" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.679" end="01:54:18.239" style="s2">through this serious play so that you</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.159" end="01:54:21.599" style="s2">can move to another self</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.239" end="01:54:23.360" style="s2">another world that is other than how</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.599" end="01:54:24.800" style="s2">you are currently having currently</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.360" end="01:54:27.679" style="s2">internalized your mother</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.800" end="01:54:28.480" style="s2">and see the world in those terms that it</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.679" end="01:54:32.080" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.480" end="01:54:35.119" style="s2">harming you serious play</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.080" end="01:54:38.320" style="s2">is where you enact a symbol</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.119" end="01:54:39.119" style="s2">and you bring about anagage a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.320" end="01:54:42.000" style="s2">opening</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.119" end="01:54:43.360" style="s2">that can draw you in that&#39;s what a deuce</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.000" end="01:54:46.639" style="s2">means education</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.360" end="01:54:48.159" style="s2">to drive can draw you into that other</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.639" end="01:54:51.840" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.159" end="01:54:55.119" style="s2">and so serious play requires that we</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.840" end="01:54:56.000" style="s2">get into what actor calls the paratellic</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.119" end="01:54:57.760" style="s2">mode the meta</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.000" end="01:55:00.080" style="s2">motivational modes we have different</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.760" end="01:55:03.040" style="s2">ways of framing our level of arousal</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.080" end="01:55:04.000" style="s2">so when i when i&#39;m doing something for</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.040" end="01:55:06.400" style="s2">the sake of an external</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.000" end="01:55:07.599" style="s2">purpose and i&#39;m highly aroused that</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.400" end="01:55:09.280" style="s2">means i&#39;m frustrated</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.599" end="01:55:10.639" style="s2">i&#39;m not getting my i&#39;m not getting my</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.280" end="01:55:14.239" style="s2">goal ah</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.639" end="01:55:17.360" style="s2">and so more and more arousal is bad</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.239" end="01:55:18.800" style="s2">and then when i get my goal oh i relax</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.360" end="01:55:21.199" style="s2">i&#39;ve achieved my goal and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.800" end="01:55:23.360" style="s2">wonderful relaxing content</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.199" end="01:55:24.800" style="s2">but notice and i&#39;m not trying to be</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.360" end="01:55:26.080" style="s2">graphic here</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.800" end="01:55:28.000" style="s2">that&#39;s not sort of your attitude when</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.080" end="01:55:29.920" style="s2">you&#39;re having like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.000" end="01:55:32.320" style="s2">you know i&#39;ll say it this way when</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.920" end="01:55:35.280" style="s2">you&#39;re making love with somebody</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.320" end="01:55:36.320" style="s2">like the arousal is really good right</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.280" end="01:55:37.520" style="s2">the excitement</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.320" end="01:55:40.400" style="s2">well you don&#39;t want it to go on forever</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.520" end="01:55:42.159" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying that but now</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.400" end="01:55:43.920" style="s2">the point isn&#39;t to get to the goal state</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.159" end="01:55:45.920" style="s2">and relax afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.920" end="01:55:47.280" style="s2">the point is you&#39;re doing something for</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.920" end="01:55:49.760" style="s2">its own sake</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.280" end="01:55:52.239" style="s2">and therefore the arousal isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.760" end="01:55:55.599" style="s2">frustration at not reaching your goal</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.239" end="01:55:56.800" style="s2">the arousal now means an intensification</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.599" end="01:55:59.599" style="s2">of your involvement</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.800" end="01:56:00.639" style="s2">in the process so that&#39;s why love making</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.599" end="01:56:03.760" style="s2">is also</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.639" end="01:56:06.480" style="s2">serious play because what i&#39;m i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.760" end="01:56:07.920" style="s2">i right we can either do an activity for</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.480" end="01:56:10.239" style="s2">the sake of a goal</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.920" end="01:56:11.440" style="s2">or we can set up an end state just for</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.239" end="01:56:14.080" style="s2">the sake of</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.440" end="01:56:15.920" style="s2">creating a play space where we can do</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.080" end="01:56:18.400" style="s2">something for its own sake</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.920" end="01:56:19.840" style="s2">so when i&#39;m playing i&#39;m doing something</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.400" end="01:56:21.280" style="s2">for its own sake</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.840" end="01:56:23.119" style="s2">what does that have to do with what i</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.280" end="01:56:25.760" style="s2">previously said but i&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.119" end="01:56:29.840" style="s2">paratellic state of playing</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.760" end="01:56:32.000" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to not have a goal</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.840" end="01:56:33.199" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to become a different person</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.000" end="01:56:35.760" style="s2">i&#39;m in the being mode</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.199" end="01:56:36.560" style="s2">and i want to be intensely involved with</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.760" end="01:56:43.599" style="s2">the process</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.560" end="01:56:49.280" style="s2">of becoming itself and so</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.599" end="01:56:52.560" style="s2">it it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a disservice</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.280" end="01:56:57.199" style="s2">to play that our culture has reduced it</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.560" end="01:57:00.159" style="s2">to frivolous entertainment and not to</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.199" end="01:57:01.040" style="s2">think about how we we keep the heritage</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.159" end="01:57:03.599" style="s2">in words</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.040" end="01:57:05.840" style="s2">of what play how play used to be serious</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.599" end="01:57:09.360" style="s2">sp you know you play music</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.840" end="01:57:11.040" style="s2">or you go to scene to play hamlet</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.360" end="01:57:12.320" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s not a those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.040" end="01:57:12.800" style="s2">you know i&#39;m talking about like when you</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.320" end="01:57:15.119" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.800" end="01:57:16.960" style="s2">music seriously you&#39;re doing it for its</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.119" end="01:57:17.840" style="s2">own sake or you&#39;re seeing the play for</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.960" end="01:57:20.719" style="s2">its own sake</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.840" end="01:57:22.719" style="s2">because it&#39;s a symbol on an enacted</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.719" end="01:57:25.360" style="s2">participatory perspectival</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.719" end="01:57:27.280" style="s2">symbol art that can bridge you between</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.360" end="01:57:29.440" style="s2">worlds</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.280" end="01:57:31.119" style="s2">well that&#39;s also the verb in chinese for</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.440" end="01:57:33.840" style="s2">tai chi you don&#39;t do chai</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.119" end="01:57:35.199" style="s2">you don&#39;t make tai chi you you play tai</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.840" end="01:57:37.119" style="s2">chi</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.199" end="01:57:38.960" style="s2">so that&#39;s what serious play is and</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.119" end="01:57:42.239" style="s2">serious play</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.960" end="01:57:45.360" style="s2">has to be the</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.239" end="01:57:48.800" style="s2">fundamental mode for</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.360" end="01:57:48.800" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.280" end="01:57:52.880" style="s2">yeah that was a beautiful tie together</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.360" end="01:57:54.480" style="s2">i&#39;m glad your comment about</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.880" end="01:57:55.920" style="s2">tai chi playing came up i was going to</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.480" end="01:57:59.520" style="s2">bring that up</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.920" end="01:58:00.560" style="s2">um yeah the you know going to a symphony</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.520" end="01:58:02.880" style="s2">is a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.560" end="01:58:04.880" style="s2">example of that it&#39;s you know the thing</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.880" end="01:58:06.960" style="s2">is done for its own sake</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.880" end="01:58:09.920" style="s2">yes alan watts has a nice distinction</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.960" end="01:58:12.560" style="s2">he&#39;s like it&#39;s not serious it&#39;s sincere</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.920" end="01:58:14.159" style="s2">right because it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not ingest</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.560" end="01:58:16.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.159" end="01:58:19.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not getting anywhere yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.800" end="01:58:21.119" style="s2">the the greatest example being if it was</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.119" end="01:58:22.960" style="s2">if the goal of music was to get to the</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.119" end="01:58:24.000" style="s2">end of the song eventually people would</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.960" end="01:58:27.119" style="s2">just produce</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.000" end="01:58:28.880" style="s2">the final symbols at the end</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.119" end="01:58:30.880" style="s2">because they and it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.880" end="01:58:33.280" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.880" end="01:58:34.400" style="s2">and then the goal is to get back to</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.280" end="01:58:36.560" style="s2">silence</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.400" end="01:58:38.159" style="s2">yeah honestly just stay with your</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.560" end="01:58:39.040" style="s2">silence well i&#39;d do it in the first</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.159" end="01:58:42.159" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.040" end="01:58:44.880" style="s2">and and that driving force has also</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.159" end="01:58:46.159" style="s2">expanded on very beautifully in finite</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.880" end="01:58:48.560" style="s2">and infinite games</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.159" end="01:58:49.760" style="s2">oh i was going to mention cars jazz cars</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.560" end="01:58:52.159" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.760" end="01:58:55.040" style="s2">yeah beautiful book highly recommended</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.159" end="01:58:55.040" style="s2">um i think</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.280" end="01:59:03.599" style="s2">part of my criticism</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.400" end="01:59:06.560" style="s2">of the axial age mythos</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.599" end="01:59:08.800" style="s2">and this is a criticism of plato who i</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.560" end="01:59:12.320" style="s2">love deeply and profoundly</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.800" end="01:59:14.320" style="s2">um is the understanding of right</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.320" end="01:59:15.199" style="s2">relationship and sacredness in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.320" end="01:59:17.599" style="s2">perfection</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.199" end="01:59:18.560" style="s2">which are these ideas of completion and</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.599" end="01:59:22.159" style="s2">closure</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.560" end="01:59:24.080" style="s2">um and i think uh</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.159" end="01:59:25.599" style="s2">i&#39;ve met james and uh we were at a</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.080" end="01:59:26.719" style="s2">conference together we both loved each</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.599" end="01:59:28.320" style="s2">other&#39;s talks</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.719" end="01:59:31.599" style="s2">um i hope i&#39;m hoping to talk with him</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.320" end="01:59:35.119" style="s2">again perhaps on voices with her reiki</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.599" end="01:59:36.960" style="s2">um and and so i think james</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.119" end="01:59:38.400" style="s2">given what i&#39;ve read in uh the religious</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.960" end="01:59:39.280" style="s2">case against belief and finite and</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.400" end="01:59:41.280" style="s2">infinite games</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.280" end="01:59:43.840" style="s2">seeing his presentation i think he would</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.280" end="01:59:47.199" style="s2">regard that</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.840" end="01:59:50.560" style="s2">that ethos of perfection and closure</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.199" end="01:59:54.639" style="s2">and completion and rest somehow the</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.560" end="01:59:56.480" style="s2">you know resting is resting in in</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.639" end="01:59:59.040" style="s2">you know in immortality or something</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.480" end="02:00:01.760" style="s2">like that um i think this is to just</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.040" end="02:00:03.679" style="s2">massively miss frame i think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.760" end="02:00:06.480" style="s2">having mode as opposed to the being mode</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.679" end="02:00:07.280" style="s2">i think it&#39;s trying to uh turn the</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.480" end="02:00:11.040" style="s2">infinite</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.280" end="02:00:14.560" style="s2">game of religio into a finite game</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.040" end="02:00:15.440" style="s2">of sort of metaphysical transportation</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.560" end="02:00:19.280" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.440" end="02:00:22.400" style="s2">um and and even the notion of</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.280" end="02:00:25.040" style="s2">you know perfection and immortality</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.400" end="02:00:26.639" style="s2">immortality is just really i get that</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.040" end="02:00:28.000" style="s2">we&#39;re wired to avoid death because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.639" end="02:00:30.960" style="s2">autopoetic beings</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.000" end="02:00:32.320" style="s2">but the idea of an infinity of my</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.960" end="02:00:35.679" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.320" end="02:00:38.960" style="s2">it strikes me as horrific um because</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.679" end="02:00:41.920" style="s2">you know if i was</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.960" end="02:00:43.679" style="s2">immortal i would have to be invulnerable</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.920" end="02:00:45.440" style="s2">i&#39;d have to be invulnerable</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.679" end="02:00:47.119" style="s2">and you know one one of the things that</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.440" end="02:00:47.920" style="s2">you know that guy said stock has made</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.119" end="02:00:53.119" style="s2">really clear</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.920" end="02:00:56.080" style="s2">is you know genuine idea logos</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.119" end="02:00:57.280" style="s2">genuine growth it it&#39;s inseparably bound</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.080" end="02:00:59.119" style="s2">up with vulnerability</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.280" end="02:01:00.560" style="s2">you know the the breaking the you have</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.119" end="02:01:02.159" style="s2">to break the frame</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.560" end="02:01:04.639" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to make the new frame</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.159" end="02:01:06.840" style="s2">and so if i was invulnerable</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.639" end="02:01:08.239" style="s2">i would i would be completely</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.840" end="02:01:12.000" style="s2">self-enclosed</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.239" end="02:01:14.239" style="s2">i i would not be like and then to extend</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.000" end="02:01:14.239" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.480" end="02:01:19.040" style="s2">to extend that disconnection for</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.679" end="02:01:22.000" style="s2">infinity that&#39;s hell</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.040" end="02:01:22.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t want that right i i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.000" end="02:01:24.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.480" end="02:01:26.320" style="s2">but well you say well i&#39;ll make you</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.000" end="02:01:27.679" style="s2">involved i&#39;ll make you vulnerable for</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.320" end="02:01:29.920" style="s2">for an infinite amount of time well</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.679" end="02:01:31.920" style="s2">that&#39;s horrible too because now i have</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.920" end="02:01:34.960" style="s2">an infinite amount of sadness</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.920" end="02:01:36.880" style="s2">and disappointment right and pain</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.960" end="02:01:39.040" style="s2">like i don&#39;t want you know i think what</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.880" end="02:01:39.280" style="s2">i have and this is the buddhist notion</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.040" end="02:01:40.960" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.280" end="02:01:42.560" style="s2">we&#39;re in the right the best place for</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.960" end="02:01:44.960" style="s2">enlightenment right</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.560" end="02:01:46.560" style="s2">we have better than the gods or the or</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.960" end="02:01:49.840" style="s2">the people in the underworld</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.560" end="02:01:52.480" style="s2">i think what i have is exactly mortality</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.840" end="02:01:53.360" style="s2">allows me vulnerability which affords</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.480" end="02:01:55.760" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.360" end="02:01:58.159" style="s2">openness and connection but it is made</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.760" end="02:02:00.000" style="s2">livable by the fact that it&#39;s finite in</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.159" end="02:02:04.080" style="s2">length</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.000" end="02:02:07.199" style="s2">and so i think all we&#39;ve got to get</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.080" end="02:02:11.760" style="s2">and and cars emphasizes how much</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.199" end="02:02:13.599" style="s2">infinite games require vulnerability</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.760" end="02:02:15.040" style="s2">and how they&#39;re different from finite</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.599" end="02:02:17.760" style="s2">games that are trying to bring about</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.040" end="02:02:18.719" style="s2">safety and closure and again see the</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.760" end="02:02:20.320" style="s2">having mode</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.719" end="02:02:22.880" style="s2">one of the things you have to have is</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.320" end="02:02:24.000" style="s2">safety but it&#39;s moral confusion to bring</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.880" end="02:02:27.199" style="s2">that pursuit</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.000" end="02:02:30.320" style="s2">of safety into right relationship with</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.199" end="02:02:31.840" style="s2">the sacred because</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.320" end="02:02:34.159" style="s2">by turning it into the notion of the</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.840" end="02:02:35.840" style="s2">perfect because that&#39;s exactly a deep</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.159" end="02:02:38.880" style="s2">kind of modal confusion</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.840" end="02:02:41.199" style="s2">so i i agree i agree</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.880" end="02:02:42.400" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s beautiful because</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.199" end="02:02:45.360" style="s2">like the these all</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.400" end="02:02:47.920" style="s2">these all come together right the the</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.360" end="02:02:50.400" style="s2">notion of the infinite game is basically</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.920" end="02:02:52.719" style="s2">making and playing a game that the</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.400" end="02:02:54.159" style="s2">maximum number of people can play for as</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.719" end="02:02:57.679" style="s2">long as possible</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.159" end="02:02:58.560" style="s2">yes also game in which the playing of</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.679" end="02:03:00.639" style="s2">the game</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.560" end="02:03:02.000" style="s2">rewrites the rules by which the game is</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.639" end="02:03:05.520" style="s2">played yep</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.000" end="02:03:09.440" style="s2">which sounds exactly like designing</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.520" end="02:03:11.520" style="s2">a dynamic self-organizing post-religious</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.440" end="02:03:12.560" style="s2">faith right those things are those</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.520" end="02:03:15.040" style="s2">things are basically</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.560" end="02:03:15.920" style="s2">synonymous to me yes i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.040" end="02:03:17.599" style="s2">exactly right</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.920" end="02:03:19.920" style="s2">i that&#39;s why i want to talk to james</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.599" end="02:03:22.000" style="s2">again yeah uh</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.920" end="02:03:23.119" style="s2">i think that&#39;s i think that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.000" end="02:03:24.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.119" end="02:03:26.800" style="s2">and then i think i think the last the</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.960" end="02:03:29.040" style="s2">last points i want to bring up here is</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.800" end="02:03:30.719" style="s2">so to actually do this to to design as</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.040" end="02:03:34.560" style="s2">it goes you need</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.719" end="02:03:37.599" style="s2">a way of surfacing insights</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.560" end="02:03:39.840" style="s2">and you need a way of doing that</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.599" end="02:03:42.080" style="s2">in a group right because this is this is</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.840" end="02:03:43.760" style="s2">communal and this leads to</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.080" end="02:03:45.440" style="s2">basically flow state which is</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.760" end="02:03:48.880" style="s2">essentially i think</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.440" end="02:03:51.040" style="s2">i first heard it uh in in your talk</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.880" end="02:03:52.719" style="s2">that it&#39;s basically an insight cascade</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.040" end="02:03:53.599" style="s2">yeah you use the example of a rock</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.719" end="02:03:55.599" style="s2">climber</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.599" end="02:03:56.880" style="s2">and then something that looks like and</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.599" end="02:03:58.239" style="s2">i&#39;ve been separate</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.880" end="02:04:00.480" style="s2">separate from your discussion of</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.239" end="02:04:02.159" style="s2">dialogues i&#39;ve also been watching</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.480" end="02:04:04.719" style="s2">circling and guy thing stock very</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.159" end="02:04:06.560" style="s2">closely because that feels</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.719" end="02:04:08.560" style="s2">that feels on the level of like a meta</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.560" end="02:04:10.480" style="s2">psychotec where it&#39;s i can actually</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.560" end="02:04:13.360" style="s2">discover and identify</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.480" end="02:04:15.280" style="s2">the tools that are needed to it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.360" end="02:04:18.079" style="s2">system that builds a system</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.280" end="02:04:19.520" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an infinite game exactly right</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.079" end="02:04:22.719" style="s2">it&#39;s a meta psychotech</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.520" end="02:04:23.280" style="s2">the idea that i got from a grateful for</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.719" end="02:04:26.719" style="s2">it from</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.280" end="02:04:28.320" style="s2">my friend hall um because you need you</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.719" end="02:04:31.840" style="s2">need a meta psychotech to</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.320" end="02:04:34.880" style="s2">uh to coordinate and curate um</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.840" end="02:04:36.480" style="s2">your uh and to create uh your your</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.880" end="02:04:37.360" style="s2">ecology and practices and again that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.480" end="02:04:38.560" style="s2">not something you&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.360" end="02:04:43.280" style="s2">individually you have to do it</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.560" end="02:04:47.920" style="s2">in distributed cognition very much um</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.280" end="02:04:47.920" style="s2">so yeah the the</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.159" end="02:04:53.840" style="s2">things like circling are</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.719" end="02:04:58.159" style="s2">because i do i do participant</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.000" end="02:05:01.440" style="s2">observation in it as well and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.159" end="02:05:06.000" style="s2">gotten into um you know well</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.440" end="02:05:08.159" style="s2">he&#39;s a good friend of mine guy um</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.000" end="02:05:09.840" style="s2">talking to him about it so i got i got</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.159" end="02:05:11.920" style="s2">to talk to about creator</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.840" end="02:05:14.000" style="s2">uh in depth and i&#39;ve got to participate</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.920" end="02:05:15.440" style="s2">in it um</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.000" end="02:05:18.639" style="s2">thank you thanks especially to people</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.440" end="02:05:18.639" style="s2">like canada and others</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.440" end="02:05:23.920" style="s2">and so i think it&#39;s a way of creating a</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.610" end="02:05:26.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.920" end="02:05:27.199" style="s2">flow state within distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.480" end="02:05:30.320" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.199" end="02:05:33.360" style="s2">which we come to recover</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.320" end="02:05:35.280" style="s2">the serious play of perspectival and</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.360" end="02:05:37.920" style="s2">participatory intimacy</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.280" end="02:05:38.480" style="s2">i think that&#39;s important but i thought</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.920" end="02:05:40.880" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.480" end="02:05:42.719" style="s2">i think so circling is definitely part</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.880" end="02:05:45.199" style="s2">of this but</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.719" end="02:05:45.920" style="s2">and and and i love him for this guy was</p>

<p begin="02:05:45.920" end="02:05:49.119" style="s2">because guy was ultimately trying to</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.280" end="02:05:51.440" style="s2">enact heidi was philosophy</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.119" end="02:05:53.040" style="s2">right he was receptive to a criticism a</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.440" end="02:05:55.280" style="s2">constructive criticism</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.040" end="02:05:56.159" style="s2">and i said because i want to bring and</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.280" end="02:05:58.320" style="s2">he does too</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.159" end="02:05:59.280" style="s2">and i woke this in him i want to bring</p>

<p begin="02:05:59.280" end="02:06:02.639" style="s2">the cultivation of wisdom into circling</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.599" end="02:06:05.760" style="s2">i want</p>
<p begin="02:06:02.639" end="02:06:08.639" style="s2">to get what i see in the platonic</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.760" end="02:06:11.199" style="s2">dialogue i see not only philia</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.639" end="02:06:12.560" style="s2">that if that perspective of</p>

<p begin="02:07:10.079" end="02:07:14.000" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to come up with a psychotech</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.400" end="02:07:16.320" style="s2">which i call dialectic</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.000" end="02:07:18.400" style="s2">which is a way of scaffolding people</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.320" end="02:07:21.119" style="s2">into this process of via logos</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.400" end="02:07:22.239" style="s2">which is where you get the phylia of</p>

<p begin="02:07:22.239" end="02:07:28.079" style="s2">integrated with the aspiration to sophia</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.440" end="02:07:29.119" style="s2">and you get philia sophia and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.079" end="02:07:32.159" style="s2">where you get</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.119" end="02:07:35.840" style="s2">the individual and collective</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.159" end="02:07:38.320" style="s2">transformative love or wisdom that then</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.840" end="02:07:40.800" style="s2">gives you the place from which and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.320" end="02:07:43.040" style="s2">a self-correcting dynamic</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.800" end="02:07:44.400" style="s2">that gives you the place from which</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.040" end="02:07:47.760" style="s2">right you can</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.400" end="02:07:50.239" style="s2">get guidance in how to curate</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.760" end="02:07:50.800" style="s2">create and coordinate an ecology of</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.239" end="02:07:53.599" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.800" end="02:07:55.119" style="s2">and the ecology of practice and the the</p>
<p begin="02:07:53.599" end="02:07:57.520" style="s2">dialectic deal logos</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.119" end="02:07:58.639" style="s2">are inceptively religioned together they</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.520" end="02:08:00.800" style="s2">need each other</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.639" end="02:08:02.560" style="s2">if i if i try to do just the dialogue</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.800" end="02:08:03.520" style="s2">and the dialectic up here without the</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.560" end="02:08:06.840" style="s2">ecology</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.520" end="02:08:09.199" style="s2">it&#39;s going to degenerate into into just</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.840" end="02:08:10.320" style="s2">conversation right having a great</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.199" end="02:08:11.920" style="s2">conversation is a good thing</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.320" end="02:08:13.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s not going to be good but if i</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.920" end="02:08:14.800" style="s2">just have the ecology and i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:08:13.760" end="02:08:18.239" style="s2">the meta</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.800" end="02:08:21.280" style="s2">right psychotech again</p>
<p begin="02:08:18.239" end="02:08:24.880" style="s2">my capacity for having you know</p>
<p begin="02:08:21.280" end="02:08:28.320" style="s2">situating that ecology into a</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.880" end="02:08:30.239" style="s2">a a developmental trajectory of growth</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.320" end="02:08:31.440" style="s2">and self-correction is also going to be</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.239" end="02:08:33.520" style="s2">seriously truncated</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.440" end="02:08:34.480" style="s2">but if i put the two together i get</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.520" end="02:08:36.719" style="s2">something better</p>
<p begin="02:08:34.480" end="02:08:38.719" style="s2">than i get i get a good stalk that is</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.719" end="02:08:41.520" style="s2">greater than the sum of the parts</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.719" end="02:08:42.239" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what dialectic and deal</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.520" end="02:08:44.960" style="s2">logos are</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.239" end="02:08:46.880" style="s2">deal logos is a family it&#39;s a term for a</p>
<p begin="02:08:44.960" end="02:08:49.360" style="s2">family of practices</p>
<p begin="02:08:46.880" end="02:08:50.480" style="s2">uh there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s uh what the</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.360" end="02:08:52.000" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.480" end="02:08:53.679" style="s2">for the emerge people thomas and</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.000" end="02:08:55.920" style="s2">elizabeth are doing in europe</p>
<p begin="02:08:53.679" end="02:08:56.960" style="s2">uh there&#39;s what uh there&#39;s stuff that a</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.920" end="02:08:58.560" style="s2">taylor is doing</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.960" end="02:09:00.639" style="s2">uh where he&#39;s doing circling and then</p>
<p begin="02:08:58.560" end="02:09:04.079" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to drop a topic into circle</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.639" end="02:09:07.440" style="s2">like so deal logos refers to a family</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.079" end="02:09:10.239" style="s2">of these practices in which you engender</p>
<p begin="02:09:07.440" end="02:09:11.599" style="s2">flow within distributed cognition but</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.239" end="02:09:14.880" style="s2">right but like i say</p>
<p begin="02:09:11.599" end="02:09:16.880" style="s2">the interpersonal intimacy</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.880" end="02:09:18.639" style="s2">affords it becomes a lens through which</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.880" end="02:09:22.159" style="s2">you then try to realize</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.639" end="02:09:23.679" style="s2">an inter oncological uh intimacy uh a</p>
<p begin="02:09:22.159" end="02:09:26.560" style="s2">transformational</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.679" end="02:09:28.079" style="s2">intimacy a serious play with the logos</p>
<p begin="02:09:26.560" end="02:09:29.599" style="s2">of being itself or the logos of</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.079" end="02:09:32.719" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.599" end="02:09:36.560" style="s2">um so i</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.719" end="02:09:39.599" style="s2">i i think i&#39;m offering dialectic</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.560" end="02:09:43.119" style="s2">as something that&#39;s trying to make use</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.599" end="02:09:46.560" style="s2">of the socratic template</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.119" end="02:09:48.000" style="s2">uh mostly that play a little bit also</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.560" end="02:09:51.360" style="s2">from the way</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.000" end="02:09:52.719" style="s2">jesus uses dialogue uh to to help to be</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.360" end="02:09:54.719" style="s2">a midwife to help people</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.719" end="02:09:55.920" style="s2">give birth to themselves i tell you this</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.719" end="02:09:58.239" style="s2">you must be born again</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.920" end="02:09:59.520" style="s2">and socrates says he is also a midwife</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.239" end="02:10:00.320" style="s2">that helps people give birth to</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.520" end="02:10:02.800" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.320" end="02:10:04.639" style="s2">so i&#39;m trying to take a template from</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.800" end="02:10:09.199" style="s2">those two sages</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.639" end="02:10:12.320" style="s2">and reinvent your</p>
<p begin="02:10:09.199" end="02:10:16.239" style="s2">dialectic both the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="02:10:12.320" end="02:10:17.840" style="s2">and the intrapersonal aspects of it</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.239" end="02:10:20.079" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what it is that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.840" end="02:10:22.719" style="s2">trying to do and</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.079" end="02:10:25.440" style="s2">i think it is the the place where we do</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.719" end="02:10:29.440" style="s2">the most important serious play</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.440" end="02:10:32.639" style="s2">that is the dynamical ground</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.440" end="02:10:36.239" style="s2">for the ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.639" end="02:10:38.639" style="s2">yeah and it becomes at least it</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.239" end="02:10:40.239" style="s2">in my head it is so important because it</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.639" end="02:10:43.040" style="s2">also affords the</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.239" end="02:10:43.520" style="s2">reciprocal opening that we&#39;ve touched on</p>
<p begin="02:10:43.040" end="02:10:47.199" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="02:10:43.520" end="02:10:47.520" style="s2">in disclosing myself and my truth to a</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.199" end="02:10:49.599" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.520" end="02:10:52.560" style="s2">it gets digested and reflected back to</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.599" end="02:10:53.920" style="s2">me which opens me up and together we</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.560" end="02:10:55.679" style="s2">and again this has to be a communal</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.920" end="02:10:58.800" style="s2">thing right and together we</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.679" end="02:11:00.719" style="s2">we ride the the spiral upward because</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.800" end="02:11:02.000" style="s2">that&#39;s always that always engenders love</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.719" end="02:11:03.119" style="s2">by the way remember we talked about not</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.000" end="02:11:05.119" style="s2">just anger but love</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.119" end="02:11:06.239" style="s2">yeah reciprocal opening this is aaron&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.119" end="02:11:08.400" style="s2">work uh aaron&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.239" end="02:11:10.079" style="s2">last name you know so sort of mutually</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.400" end="02:11:12.960" style="s2">accelerating disclosure</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.079" end="02:11:14.560" style="s2">is how you fall in love not just erotic</p>
<p begin="02:11:12.960" end="02:11:16.320" style="s2">love but also friendship love</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.560" end="02:11:18.000" style="s2">right that&#39;s how that&#39;s how you fall in</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.320" end="02:11:20.400" style="s2">love with something and</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.000" end="02:11:22.079" style="s2">what i want people to do is of course to</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.400" end="02:11:22.639" style="s2">fall in love with each other again by</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.079" end="02:11:24.639" style="s2">leah</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.639" end="02:11:26.320" style="s2">but i also i want them also to fall in</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.639" end="02:11:28.880" style="s2">love with being</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.320" end="02:11:29.599" style="s2">and and you know to fall in love with</p>
<p begin="02:11:28.880" end="02:11:32.880" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.599" end="02:11:34.960" style="s2">with with with sophia uh again</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.880" end="02:11:37.119" style="s2">as well because that&#39;s what they need to</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.960" end="02:11:40.480" style="s2">overcome the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.119" end="02:11:42.880" style="s2">yeah beautifully said beautifully said</p>
<p begin="02:11:40.480" end="02:11:43.599" style="s2">well that was quite the the arc we took</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.880" end="02:11:46.239" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.599" end="02:11:46.880" style="s2">um is there anything you want to leave</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.239" end="02:11:48.880" style="s2">people with</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.880" end="02:11:52.159" style="s2">and he asks that you have anything you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.880" end="02:11:56.000" style="s2">like to point anyone towards</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.159" end="02:11:57.199" style="s2">um so i mean well obviously i think</p>
<p begin="02:11:56.000" end="02:11:58.719" style="s2">people should take a look at awakening</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.199" end="02:11:59.760" style="s2">for the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.719" end="02:12:02.239" style="s2">i think they should take a look at</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.760" end="02:12:04.000" style="s2">voices with ravinki where i&#39;m doing i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="02:12:08.159" end="02:12:13.040" style="s2">of good faith as i can um look for the</p>
<p begin="02:12:10.960" end="02:12:15.440" style="s2">new series that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.040" end="02:12:16.480" style="s2">basically take this whole arc and you</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.440" end="02:12:19.520" style="s2">know and</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.480" end="02:12:21.280" style="s2">right after socrates and view this what</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.520" end="02:12:23.520" style="s2">does that what does it mean</p>
<p begin="02:12:21.280" end="02:12:25.040" style="s2">to bring back dialectic india logos in</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.520" end="02:12:28.239" style="s2">the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="02:12:25.040" end="02:12:30.560" style="s2">um how can we take that ancient</p>
<p begin="02:12:28.239" end="02:12:31.360" style="s2">practice of dialectic and put it into</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.560" end="02:12:33.119" style="s2">fruitful</p>
