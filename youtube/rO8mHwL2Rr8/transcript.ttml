<p begin="00:02:21.520" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.480" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">is a technique that was started by a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:28.959" style="s2">philosophy press professor in portland</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">who was familiar with the socratic</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.959" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">method</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">and i think used it personally with his</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">interactions and he started realizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:37.120" style="s2">hey</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">if you use questions to explore claims</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.120" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">you can probably help another person</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">help that person take another look at</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">their views</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">so um he wrote a book called a manual</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">for creating atheists which</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">he uh he gave a talk at the freedom from</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">religion foundation in 2012. i was just</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:54.160" style="s2">looking at this video</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">i saw i was in that crowd watching him</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.160" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">speak where he was talking a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:02:58.720" style="s2">about his book</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:00.239" style="s2">i think i bought his book then but i may</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.720" end="00:03:03.280" style="s2">have gotten it later i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.239" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">exactly remember but it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.280" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">it&#39;s where you use questions to explore</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">claims with people on sensitive topics</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:10.239" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">rather than arguing with people or</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.239" end="00:03:14.239" style="s2">giving them facts</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">or or talking over them or or allowing</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.239" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">them to misrepresent your position</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:20.000" style="s2">you basically just let the person that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to explain their position</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.000" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">and you ask them questions to drive down</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">to the reliability of their method</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s kind of it in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">nutshell it&#39;s it&#39;s expanded a lot since</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.080" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">he wrote his first book</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:33.519" style="s2">in fact he wrote a second book called</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">how to have impossible conversations</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.519" end="00:03:37.599" style="s2">which i think given the two choices i</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">think i&#39;d advise people to check that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.599" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">book out first</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">because i think he&#39;s taken a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">things that we&#39;ve learned and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">learned</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">since the first book and bake that into</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:51.680" style="s2">his second book so yeah it&#39;s where you</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:52.319" style="s2">you basically explore claims that people</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.680" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.319" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">in a respectful way where you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">questions and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s kind of interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">watch that happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">most people i think can grasp</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">street epistemology better if they watch</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">examples of people doing it rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">just me talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">so if you haven&#39;t already watched some</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">examples i&#39;d recommend that you do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:18.400" style="s2">have you seen a lot of them peter i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:20.079" style="s2">seen a bunch yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:22.320" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s nothing like watching</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:24.080" style="s2">people ponder the deeply held belief</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.320" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">that they&#39;ve held for the longest time</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.080" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">and start to wonder why the hell do i</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">think that this is true</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s usually what happens during</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">these talks</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">and so uh kind of like the the histo</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">historical lineage of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">and we were chatting about this when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">spoke last time uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:42.880" style="s2">i i playfully labeled the street</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">epistemologist as like</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.880" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">friendly new atheists um because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">the new atheists have this vibe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">very combative with challenging people</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">in religious</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">debate stage and then uh sc or people</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">who are trained in it</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">you know the social fluency that hey</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">excuse me we have you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">i got a few questions inquiries and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">very kind of implying uh the principle</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">of charity</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">all these different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">conversational techniques to make the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:07.680" style="s2">person comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">but then really getting at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.680" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">why they believe what they believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">um do you think that&#39;s unfair of me to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">call it like a friendly new atheist like</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:15.199" style="s2">how did you how would you see that kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.199" end="00:05:19.199" style="s2">no no in fact i was really excited when</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">i saw that you characterized</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.199" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">street epistemologists as sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">offshoot of the new atheists because i</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:28.080" style="s2">i think your characterization of the new</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">atheist movement is fairly correct it</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:31.360" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">it was it was aggressive it was in your</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.360" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">face</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">and it it held nothing back um</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">and it got a lot of people&#39;s attention i</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:40.320" style="s2">was more comfortable coming out as an</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">atheist and getting involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.320" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">atheist</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">movement or community because i was</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:47.199" style="s2">watching examples of dawkins and harris</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:50.320" style="s2">and denet</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.199" end="00:05:52.000" style="s2">dillahunty etc that was really exciting</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.320" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">to me as somebody who was watching</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.000" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">people walk around with beliefs that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:58.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t think are true</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">so it got my attention but</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.319" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">what i think happens is that people then</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:03.680" style="s2">try to mimic those aggressive approaches</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">with the people in their lives that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.680" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">and that can really backfire so the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:12.160" style="s2">street epistemology approach</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">um i think is an offshoot of the new we</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.160" end="00:06:16.400" style="s2">sometimes we joke around say</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">the street epistemologist is the new new</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.400" end="00:06:19.840" style="s2">atheist</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:22.160" style="s2">sort of a nicer gentler more empathetic</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.840" end="00:06:24.080" style="s2">type of atheist but</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:25.759" style="s2">there are moments where people who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.080" end="00:06:27.600" style="s2">promoters and practitioners of this</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">method we still slip into our very</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.600" end="00:06:31.759" style="s2">aggressive ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to not debate for the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.759" end="00:06:34.960" style="s2">your life</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">you&#39;re still going to probably do that</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">but if you if you value the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:39.440" style="s2">and you want to help the person take</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">another look at their views</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.440" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">it seems like the se approach is more</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">and um like when i wrote the memetic</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:52.479" style="s2">tribes culture war paper i listed</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:54.160" style="s2">uh sc asymmetric tribe on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">spreadsheet i shared in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:57.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s how i think uh peter picosian</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.360" end="00:07:01.039" style="s2">tagged you into like we got each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:03.120" style="s2">radar i think that that way</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.039" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">um and i&#39;ve interviewed you and peter on</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.120" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">my podcast we chatted</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:08.160" style="s2">and it&#39;d be interesting to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:10.160" style="s2">discuss the distinction between uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.160" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">essie as like a mimetic tribe as like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.160" end="00:07:15.120" style="s2">tribal constellation</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">and sc as an actual method yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.120" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">that&#39;s an important distinction and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">got really excited when i saw your i</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:21.840" style="s2">never thought about</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">i never thought about a culture war or</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.840" end="00:07:25.120" style="s2">memetic tribes until i saw your</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">spreadsheet and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.120" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">the light bulb sort of went off for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">like oh that&#39;s a really interesting way</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:31.599" style="s2">to think about it and i was really</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:33.360" style="s2">pleased to see somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.599" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">looking at street epistemology and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">seeing it as potentially its own</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">sort of tribe or community or movement</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.639" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">because since peter wrote that book in</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">2012 or 2013 thousands of people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.840" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">getting into this approach</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">it&#39;s gaining momentum there definitely</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">is a community</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:54.000" style="s2">there&#39;s thousands of people in a discord</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">server or several discord servers</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.000" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">there&#39;s thousands of people on</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:07:59.440" style="s2">on reddit or facebook or twitter that</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.280" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">are getting involved in it</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.440" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">but just because you might be in the sc</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">community doesn&#39;t mean that um</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:07.599" style="s2">well you don&#39;t have to be in the se</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">community to use the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.599" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">i&#39;m abbreviating street epistemology to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:14.720" style="s2">sc sorry i tend to do that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">but um you can be in any tribe</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.720" end="00:08:18.879" style="s2">and adopt the tools that are being</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">developed by the street epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.879" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">that&#39;s the neat thing about what i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:25.759" style="s2">we&#39;re doing in street epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.840" end="00:08:27.520" style="s2">is that there&#39;s this community that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.759" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">that&#39;s honing these tools</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.520" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">for more effective and productive talks</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:35.279" style="s2">these tools can be used by anyone in any</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">memetic tribe</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.279" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">in fact we want people to use these</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:41.839" style="s2">tools if you learn these tools</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">i&#39;m hoping that you take them back to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.839" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">your tribe</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">and you teach them how to use them as</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">well so i think the street epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">tribe</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">for a lack of a better</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">nomenclature i think um</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">i think that works out really good like</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:00.240" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a really good useful way</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:03.120" style="s2">of viewing it because</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">um we&#39;re out there we&#39;re hammering away</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.120" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">at this we&#39;re trying to put these tools</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.480" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">together and we&#39;re encouraging people to</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">use them</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">and i have some really strong feelings</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">about this tool i think this tool</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">honestly matt i think that this tool is</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">this tool will be around through the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">culture war to the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:23.680" style="s2">it will be it&#39;s not going away it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">definitely not going away</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.680" end="00:09:27.120" style="s2">so i think the sooner that people in</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">these various tribes learn about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.120" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">method</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">of communicating with each other the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:35.519" style="s2">you will have a leg up your tri will</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">have a leg up if you adopt these tools</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.519" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">and use them that&#39;s my personal view on</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:43.040" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">and um so to echo that at first i uh if</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.040" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">are not familiar with the method it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">really tight</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">method it&#39;s a really good method um and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">i do agree it could be repurposed</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:55.279" style="s2">uh by different sort of tribes and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">even suggested that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.279" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">in the past writing uh where like like</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">an agnostic i&#39;m more sort of an agnostic</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.760" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:04.399" style="s2">an agnostic kind of like tribal</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">constellation if you will</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.399" end="00:10:09.120" style="s2">and you can use that you know for for</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">the the sc method for that as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.120" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">but like here&#39;s like a tough question</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:12.720" style="s2">you asked me feel free to give it a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">tough question</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.720" end="00:10:16.079" style="s2">please is the hardest the better is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">sort of like a like a sneaky trojan</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.079" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">horse on your part like like</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">okay like you know take the method and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">then you use it then you&#39;re sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:23.440" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">if you use it earnestly and honestly and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.440" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">authentically you&#39;ll undermine your own</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">epistemology and foundation great great</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:35.920" style="s2">question i&#39;m really glad you asked it um</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:39.519" style="s2">regardless of how i answer this i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.920" end="00:10:40.480" style="s2">uh yes it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a it is a trojan</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.519" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">horse i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.480" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a trojan horse aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:46.959" style="s2">it of of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">because once you start using this method</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.959" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">on other people&#39;s claims you will use it</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">on your own claims</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.399" end="00:10:54.480" style="s2">and you will yeah you&#39;ll start to use it</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">on yourself so in that aspect that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.480" end="00:10:58.160" style="s2">one of the most revealing things about</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">this approach was</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:02.000" style="s2">when you start using it frequently you</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:02.720" style="s2">turn it on your own views and you become</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.720" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">careful about what you claim to know is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">factually the case</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">and that&#39;s an important distinction many</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">times we&#39;re just giving our opinions</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re stating opinions as fact but</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">here&#39;s my perspective when people start</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">learning street epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">you tend to be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:22.959" style="s2">cautious about what you claim to know is</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:24.399" style="s2">the truth and you tend to be a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.959" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">bit more accepting</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.399" end="00:11:27.360" style="s2">of the claims that people are making</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">because they probably just haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.360" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">thought it through</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">or had anyone kick the tires on on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">belief that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">that they&#39;re holding so it&#39;s been a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:40.839" style="s2">been a net positive</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a weird trojan horse in</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.839" end="00:11:44.399" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:46.079" style="s2">um you almost you almost sort of hop on</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.399" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">the horse yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.079" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">you know what i&#39;m saying like you start</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">to realize the benefits to the approach</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.760" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">and then you become a champion of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">within your own tribe and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:55.519" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">people are going to start to see other</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.519" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">people talking about racism</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:05.040" style="s2">um veganism religion</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:06.560" style="s2">trump you name it but we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.040" end="00:12:08.079" style="s2">respectful productive</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.560" end="00:12:09.680" style="s2">productive talks and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.079" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">happening today</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.680" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">i mean look at almost everything you see</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:13.839" style="s2">on the news almost everything that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:16.079" style="s2">see on youtube</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.839" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">is argument and strawmenting</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.079" end="00:12:18.720" style="s2">misrepresenting</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">tearing people down trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.720" end="00:12:21.760" style="s2">people look stupid that&#39;s not exact</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:22.560" style="s2">that&#39;s not at all what we&#39;re doing with</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.760" end="00:12:25.040" style="s2">se</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.560" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">this is try to this is to get clarity in</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.040" end="00:12:29.040" style="s2">your position</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">so that it&#39;s clear to yourself not just</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.040" end="00:12:32.639" style="s2">to me who&#39;s asking you these questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">but to bring clarity to your own views</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.639" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s something that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">valuable now there are some um</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:40.959" style="s2">there are some holes in the armor i</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:42.000" style="s2">suppose of the approach there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.959" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.000" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">aspects of it that i think are um</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.839" end="00:12:49.200" style="s2">might slow us down a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:50.560" style="s2">it&#39;s confusing it could be a little</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.200" end="00:12:51.279" style="s2">boring it might be a little tough to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.279" end="00:12:55.920" style="s2">uh it&#39;s hard to set aside your ego and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:57.519" style="s2">set aside your own view when somebody</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.920" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">says something that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.519" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">like i just uploaded a video where</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">somebody said you can&#39;t be moral without</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:04.880" style="s2">believing that there&#39;s a god well</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">three years ago i would have lost my</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.880" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">[ __ ] if i had heard that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">but now i just i just roll with it and i</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">ask questions and we end up</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">making progress on it so um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:16.399" style="s2">certain hurdles that i think people have</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">to overcome in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:20.480" style="s2">to grasp the method and to use the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:24.480" style="s2">method</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">but once you once you once you much</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.480" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">once you mature enough once you mature</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:30.240" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:32.480" style="s2">to understand what&#39;s going on with this</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.240" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">tool</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.480" end="00:13:35.760" style="s2">it changes you and it changes your</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:37.360" style="s2">interactions for the better</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.760" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s been my experience over</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:41.199" style="s2">the eight years or so that i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:41.199" style="s2">doing this</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">did it um sort of weaken or strengthen</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">the belief system that you had going</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:52.639" style="s2">you learned the method and started</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.720" end="00:13:54.639" style="s2">applying it</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.639" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">which which beliefs like atheism or</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.639" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">something either yeah either</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">atheism as a whole or maybe this uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">certain beliefs that you you</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">might have held there have been some</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">beliefs that have changed my view on</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:07.839" style="s2">views on because i&#39;ve engaged with</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">people on these topics about gun control</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.839" end="00:14:11.199" style="s2">and abortion</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:12.639" style="s2">and god and all this other stuff so when</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.199" end="00:14:14.240" style="s2">you have hundreds and hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.639" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">conversations where you&#39;re using this</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.240" end="00:14:17.680" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">it does it does tend to change your own</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.680" end="00:14:21.440" style="s2">perspective on some things</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:22.959" style="s2">um one thing that i&#39;ve noticed that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.440" end="00:14:23.680" style="s2">tends to happen to most people who learn</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.959" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.680" end="00:14:27.360" style="s2">is they they tend to back off of their</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:30.639" style="s2">dogmatism</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.360" end="00:14:31.199" style="s2">on their own views and that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.639" end="00:14:33.519" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.199" end="00:14:35.199" style="s2">because now i could be more open to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.519" end="00:14:37.279" style="s2">considering somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.199" end="00:14:39.279" style="s2">perspective that maybe hinduism is true</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.279" end="00:14:40.880" style="s2">or or that maybe trump really is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.279" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">best president for our country at this</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.880" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">period of time</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">um having an open mind is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">hurdles i think that you have to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:51.680" style="s2">you have to be willing to adopt that</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">when you use this approach</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.680" end="00:14:54.720" style="s2">you have to be willing to say okay i</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">actually might be mistaken</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.720" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">on these core beliefs that i hold i</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">should really be open to hearing what</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">they have to say now</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:03.519" style="s2">this isn&#39;t agreeing to disagree this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">pushing back</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:07.680" style="s2">but pushing back in a way where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:12.959" style="s2">respectful</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">and again productive uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.959" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">so the other question i had was um</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">about uh the cult so the theme title of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">this whole talk was culture work 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">yeah and uh there&#39;s two memes like uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">i wrote that white paper called the mega</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:29.519" style="s2">tribes culture 2.0 then peter piccolian</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">wrote something called he stole</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">he had a different meaning which i want</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:35.920" style="s2">to talk about in a moment about like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:36.639" style="s2">great realignment and grievance studies</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.920" end="00:15:39.360" style="s2">and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.639" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">yeah yeah uh how i viewed it is like</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:41.680" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:43.279" style="s2">multi-polar war like that spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.680" end="00:15:44.160" style="s2">where there&#39;s like multiple different</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.279" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">tribes</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.160" end="00:15:47.199" style="s2">and reality tunnels that are coexisting</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:49.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.199" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">like right now for example you have uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.040" end="00:15:52.639" style="s2">black lives matter you have antifa</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">you have q anon you have extinction</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.639" end="00:15:56.639" style="s2">rebellion you have all these militias</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:58.079" style="s2">and they don&#39;t are not all buddies with</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">each other they have odd alliances at</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.079" end="00:16:02.079" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:05.120" style="s2">but they have different world views um</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.079" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">and then you hinted earlier that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.120" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">this technique this this method is going</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:11.120" style="s2">to play a critical</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">role in the culture and then so taking</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.120" end="00:16:13.920" style="s2">this frame of all these different</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:15.600" style="s2">reality tunnels coming at you</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.920" end="00:16:18.079" style="s2">how do you how do you think this could</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.600" end="00:16:18.079" style="s2">be the case</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.399" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">all right that&#39;s a good question and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.519" end="00:16:22.959" style="s2">i&#39;ve never really verbalized this so</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">listeners please be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.959" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">charitable because i&#39;m still trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:28.560" style="s2">form</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">my my vision of how this is playing out</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.560" end="00:16:33.360" style="s2">but it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">it seems like um this is how i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.360" end="00:16:36.480" style="s2">envisioning it like after i read your</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">spreadsheet then i&#39;ve been going out and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.480" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">having talks with people on a wide</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">variety of claims</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">and uploading some of those to my</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">youtube channel</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">it seems like some tribes there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">important distinction when we look at</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:51.279" style="s2">how many tribes are in your spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:52.800" style="s2">now i i haven&#39;t checked it recently</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.279" end="00:16:54.639" style="s2">well i haven&#39;t updated it but there was</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.800" end="00:16:55.759" style="s2">like 30-something okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.639" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">this is what i would love to see with</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.759" end="00:16:58.959" style="s2">your spreadsheet i think it&#39;s it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:00.720" style="s2">ties everything together i would love to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.959" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">see you at a column</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.720" end="00:17:05.679" style="s2">that says something like views truth in</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:09.679" style="s2">objective terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.679" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">yes no the tribes that view truth and</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.679" end="00:17:12.400" style="s2">objective terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:14.079" style="s2">are going to be the ones that make it</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.400" end="00:17:16.000" style="s2">through the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:17.839" style="s2">if you if you think narrative can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.000" end="00:17:19.280" style="s2">accepted as truth or you think opinion</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.839" end="00:17:21.199" style="s2">is the same thing as fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.280" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">if you think subjective truth is on</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.199" end="00:17:24.720" style="s2">equal footing as objective truth</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:26.240" style="s2">you&#39;re not you&#39;re probably not going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.720" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">make it through the culture war i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.240" end="00:17:28.640" style="s2">think that that&#39;s the case i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a prerequisite</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">and i think it would be a really fun</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:32.320" style="s2">exercise and i don&#39;t know how you do it</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:34.160" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.320" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">you can talk to 50 people from a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.160" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">and you might get mixed results but</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:38.640" style="s2">that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:40.799" style="s2">because the people who view truth and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.640" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">objective terms within those tribes</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.799" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">can learn these tools and bring them to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.799" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">the people that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.320" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">that i think is going to be the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">delimiter delimiter</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">in those different tribes so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">way of looking at it um</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.039" end="00:17:58.840" style="s2">this is a tool that can be used by</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">anyone in these tribes</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.840" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">now you mentioned like alliances</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:06.160" style="s2">there&#39;s some interesting things going on</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.400" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">in this culture war</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.160" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">there really are like we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:13.120" style="s2">atheists working with theists</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">what do they have in common well they</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.120" end="00:18:18.480" style="s2">think that truth is</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:20.559" style="s2">objective now in my view</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.480" end="00:18:22.400" style="s2">many theists i don&#39;t i don&#39;t i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.559" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">theists think they have the objective</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.400" end="00:18:25.600" style="s2">truth but i don&#39;t think that they do</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.000" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">and i&#39;ve had thousands of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.600" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">with theists who think that they do</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">and it almost comes down to faith and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">that is a that is an unreliable</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:34.480" style="s2">epistemology we can quibble about</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">definitions and everything and i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.480" end="00:18:36.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of theists that disagree</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.640" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">that no faith is the thing that you get</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">after you decide that god is real or</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:46.080" style="s2">but for the most part what i think is</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">we&#39;re going to start if you watch for</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:48.080" style="s2">this peter i think that this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:50.559" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.080" end="00:18:51.760" style="s2">i think you&#39;ll notice that the tribes</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.559" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">that view truth or</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.760" end="00:18:55.520" style="s2">or agree that truth is objective they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:18:57.360" style="s2">going to start coalescing they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">to start working together</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.360" end="00:19:01.520" style="s2">to gosh i i hate this metaphor of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">battle</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.520" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">but um at the moment it seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:07.360" style="s2">the best way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">like i think that these tribes are going</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.360" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">to be clashing with each other</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s largely because of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">we view</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">the nature of reality and whether we</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">think truth is objective or not</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to start noticing very</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:21.919" style="s2">odd alliances</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">those alliances won&#39;t last forever</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:27.200" style="s2">especially when your ally starts</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">slipping into relativism and it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.200" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">that i believe that&#39;s true because i</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">take it on faith in this type of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">but for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:35.360" style="s2">this is what i think you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:35.360" style="s2">start noticing</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:40.320" style="s2">and this is what&#39;s sort of uh it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.960" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">an extent what you said was an extended</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.320" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">version of what peter picosian called</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">culture 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">uh or the great alignment uh and if let</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">me see if i can get it and let me know</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">if i got it</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:51.760" style="s2">please because i i you know maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">internalize what he said and i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.760" end="00:19:55.679" style="s2">repackaging or something but that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.000" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">it&#39;s been months since i&#39;ve read his</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.679" end="00:19:58.880" style="s2">article so yeah if you want to go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">and paraphrase it or something i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.880" end="00:20:02.640" style="s2">be glad to listen to it yeah and so my</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">understanding of that was pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.640" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">what you said but he focused more on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">kind of christians and then atheists and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">how the the atheist movement got split</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:14.080" style="s2">between sort of like the woke</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.200" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">social justice stream and then more of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.080" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">liberal side and then the liberal side</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">they find this odd alliance</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.320" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">with the christians um and then he says</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:25.200" style="s2">this is the great</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">realignment and um i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.200" end="00:20:28.559" style="s2">similar what you said but you have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">more expanded scope like this this</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.559" end="00:20:30.799" style="s2">constellation of tribes are going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:33.200" style="s2">merge around</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.799" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">right well yes and one that has maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.200" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">like a standpoint epistemology or</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">yeah i think i take a more broader</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">perspective but this is one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve noticed with um</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">peter and james and helen and other</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">people who are</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:50.799" style="s2">they&#39;re focusing too much on one tribe</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:52.159" style="s2">the idea that the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.799" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.159" end="00:20:55.679" style="s2">being accepted as fact is something that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:20:59.200" style="s2">cuts across</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.679" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">hundreds of groups millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.200" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">so again i&#39;ve been thinking this through</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">and and um peter always talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">idea of parahisia of like speaking truth</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">in the face of of uh power or something</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.760" end="00:21:15.840" style="s2">so i</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">and these are friends of mine</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.840" end="00:21:19.919" style="s2">if you remember remember back to uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:21.280" style="s2">emmanuel for creating atheists</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.919" end="00:21:23.280" style="s2">this was a book that was teaching this</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.280" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">method of street epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.280" end="00:21:26.960" style="s2">for atheists to use with theists it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.960" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">narrowly focused and atheists like</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:32.000" style="s2">myself picked up on it</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">we started going out and intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:35.280" style="s2">having conversations with theists</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">to figure out if they have a reliable</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.280" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">epistemology for god</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:40.960" style="s2">and one thing that we quickly realized</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">is that the tool can be used for all</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.960" end="00:21:44.799" style="s2">different types of claims</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">in fact if you if you look at people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.799" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">do se</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.840" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the percentage of people</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">who talk about religion</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">is probably less than 40 percent now</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">maybe even 30.</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">we&#39;re shifting to political topics we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:02.480" style="s2">shifting to vaccines mask usage</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">vegan eating meat all this stuff so just</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.480" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">like a manual for creating atheists may</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:09.120" style="s2">have been too narrow or too</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">too laser focused on one group it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.120" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">conceivable that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:17.039" style="s2">um the grievance studies and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.159" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">and this idea you know focusing on woke</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.039" end="00:22:21.600" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:21.919" style="s2">doing doing uh doing this thing about</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.600" end="00:22:25.039" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.919" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">what was it called um</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.039" end="00:22:28.640" style="s2">what was the hoax called grievance</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">studies hoax that was very targeted to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.640" end="00:22:33.280" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:34.559" style="s2">demographic of people why was that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.280" end="00:22:36.559" style="s2">like i understand why they may have</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.559" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">selected that because they&#39;re very close</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.559" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">they are they&#39;re all i think in academia</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:42.400" style="s2">so it kind of makes sense that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">focused on that but</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.400" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">what i&#39;m suggesting here is that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:47.039" style="s2">might want to we might want to zoom out</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.039" end="00:22:50.799" style="s2">i think we&#39;re focused too much on one</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">group and i think there&#39;s a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.799" end="00:22:54.559" style="s2">different groups there are people in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">republican party or the democratic party</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.559" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">for example who view truth in subjective</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:02.960" style="s2">and we could be missing that by being so</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">focused on one small</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.960" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">aspect on one small tribe</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">that concerns me i i think it might be</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">healthy to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">to zoom out a little bit and and see</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s the main</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">factor here and which tribes is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">intersecting</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">and try to tackle it from a broader</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:25.200" style="s2">does that make sense yeah um it reminds</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:26.000" style="s2">me of kind of what happened to peterson</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.200" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">where you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.000" end="00:23:30.080" style="s2">he he wasn&#39;t really a cultural warrior</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">at first when like i knew him before um</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.080" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">he even entered the whole kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">cultural scene but he sort of got</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:37.600" style="s2">captured in the battle and got like</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:39.039" style="s2">hardened in it and i see the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.600" end="00:23:41.679" style="s2">with the cozy and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.039" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">especially james lindsay with his</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.679" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">twitter game</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">so and so what i&#39;m saying what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:50.640" style="s2">getting from you is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:51.440" style="s2">by tethering yourself to the methodology</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.640" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">and not so much</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.440" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">like the the battle field or the battle</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">like the particular battle like in more</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">of the methodology then you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">apply it not just to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:02.799" style="s2">one woke tribe you can apply to like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:03.679" style="s2">humanoid tribe or a reactionary tribe or</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.799" end="00:24:06.559" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.679" end="00:24:08.240" style="s2">right that&#39;s kind of the nature of of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.559" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">street epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.240" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">uh as it is because once you learn the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">technique of asking questions like we do</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:18.480" style="s2">in street epistemology where we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">we don&#39;t get so focused on the claim we</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.480" end="00:24:21.679" style="s2">we&#39;re semi interested in the reasons and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:23.840" style="s2">making sure that that&#39;s the real reason</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.679" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">why you think that your claim is true</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.840" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s the methodology that a person</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:29.039" style="s2">is using</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:31.520" style="s2">to verify the quality of their reasons</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.039" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">for thinking something is true</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.520" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">that is something that cuts across every</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:39.039" style="s2">type of claim that you can make</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">so once you learn street epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.039" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">se um you&#39;ll you&#39;ll start to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">the efficiency of it because it almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">does it doesn&#39;t even matter the claim</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:51.279" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter what claim people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:53.919" style="s2">making what&#39;s what&#39;s more important is</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.279" end="00:24:56.320" style="s2">did you build this belief on a solid</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.919" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">foundation let&#39;s probe that foundation</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.320" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">how reliable is it is your confidence in</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">your claim justified</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a game changer because now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">not talking about specific claims or</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">anything at all like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">and it kind of distances the the person</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">the belief we&#39;re no longer talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">your your view that god is real or that</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">so-and-so is the best president or that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">we need to start teaching uh critical</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">race theory</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:23.919" style="s2">in businesses or something you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">actually get down to the reliability of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.919" end="00:25:30.080" style="s2">the method that a person is using</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">and once people start to realize</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.080" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">that i&#39;m using a method that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:36.880" style="s2">unreliable for this claim</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">oh shoot there&#39;s 30 other claims that i</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.880" end="00:25:41.039" style="s2">use that same method for</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:42.880" style="s2">you start to see how efficient this can</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.039" end="00:25:46.799" style="s2">be so</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:48.159" style="s2">so this is wildly exciting to see</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.799" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">people starting to pick up on these</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.159" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">tools and use them in a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:52.480" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">fields with a variety of different</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.480" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">mimetic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to pivot to the the chat uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.840" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">like i haven&#39;t been following so</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">please plus one any questions plus one</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">yourself so i can kind of like</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.559" end="00:26:22.400" style="s2">it give me pause um</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">he said that culture wars are great</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:26.640" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">uh for being a christian um because</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.640" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">the christians uh are the only tribe in</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:32.480" style="s2">his opinion</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">that loves their enemies uh so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.480" end="00:26:35.039" style="s2">kind of like practicing that that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:38.159" style="s2">christian love</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:39.520" style="s2">um and then like i&#39;m like i&#39;m not here</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.159" end="00:26:41.200" style="s2">to dispute that claim but the question</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.520" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">is is your</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.200" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">for for someone an se is do you do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">think that&#39;s a healthy frame to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.880" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">that the culture war is a good practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:54.799" style="s2">and if so what to practice what excuse</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:54.799" style="s2">me um</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.960" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">well in order to be good at street</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.320" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">epistemology you need you need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:05.760" style="s2">approach it from a place of empathy</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">which i suppose is similar to love um</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:09.279" style="s2">you have to i guess you have to like or</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">love people</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.279" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">if you care enough to engage with them</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">about the claims that they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:17.039" style="s2">that might be one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:18.559" style="s2">expressions of love is to gently push</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.039" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">back when somebody says something</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.559" end="00:27:24.320" style="s2">that&#39;s questionable so</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">i mean listen christians don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.320" end="00:27:28.880" style="s2">lock on love okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">you can be a loving human being and not</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">believe in any god so let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:34.640" style="s2">dispatch with that notion right away</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">what you need to do to be good at this</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.640" end="00:27:39.120" style="s2">and be successful at at</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:40.080" style="s2">respectfully interrogating claims is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.120" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">take your ego</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.080" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">and set it aside so if christians can do</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:45.600" style="s2">that they&#39;re going to be really good at</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:46.960" style="s2">sc</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:49.520" style="s2">if muslims can do that they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.960" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">be really good at se if hindus can do</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.520" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">that or atheists can do that or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:55.679" style="s2">you&#39;re going to probably be really good</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.799" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">at se so um</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.679" end="00:27:59.360" style="s2">i guess there sort of is an element of</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:02.559" style="s2">love when you do this</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.360" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">like you can use this tool and and use</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.559" end="00:28:07.360" style="s2">to harm people i suppose or bash them</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:09.120" style="s2">or make yourself feel good by watching</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">somebody struggle to answer questions i</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.120" end="00:28:14.640" style="s2">suppose that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">but generally i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.640" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">most of the people that i&#39;ve met that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">get into this</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:21.039" style="s2">do this because they want to help other</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:22.799" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.039" end="00:28:24.240" style="s2">and not from the point of view of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.799" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">i&#39;ve got it all figured out</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.240" end="00:28:27.279" style="s2">so let me go help these poor misled</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">folks</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">claims that i make</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.960" end="00:28:37.120" style="s2">i want paul to learn these these these</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:39.600" style="s2">tools so that he can use it the next</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.120" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">time he&#39;s talking to a mormon</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.600" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">or a muslim or an atheist</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.559" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">metaphorical truth uh i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.320" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">brett weinstein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">uh term i don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:13.919" style="s2">with it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">and i&#39;m asking i wonder if the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.919" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">pursuit of truth is anthony&#39;s highest</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.440" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">the pursuit of truth the pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:23.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we could ever know</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">anything for sure so i don&#39;t think we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.840" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">ever</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">actually be able to touch the truth i</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">think it would get fairly close to it</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:31.520" style="s2">but the pursuit of it is one of my</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">highest</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.520" end="00:29:36.399" style="s2">values yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">figuring out which views that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.399" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">holding that i can&#39;t justify</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:43.600" style="s2">to myself and getting rid of those so</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:46.159" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one of my highest</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.600" end="00:29:46.640" style="s2">that is one of my highest values is</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.159" end="00:29:49.440" style="s2">objective</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.640" end="00:29:49.840" style="s2">and yes i&#39;ve heard of metaphoric truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.840" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">uh what&#39;s the other one i heard dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:54.720" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:56.080" style="s2">the most recent video that i uploaded</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.720" end="00:29:58.559" style="s2">somebody was mentioning well</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.080" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">it&#39;s this do you mean dramatically true</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:01.840" style="s2">i&#39;m like no i mean like the objective</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:04.880" style="s2">factual truth of the matter</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.840" end="00:30:06.720" style="s2">so i do see a lot of people it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.880" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.720" end="00:30:10.880" style="s2">it&#39;s really really interesting what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:13.279" style="s2">noticing with theists where</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.880" end="00:30:14.559" style="s2">i think theists realized that they this</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.279" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">is this is a bold claim and i&#39;m willing</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.559" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">to have somebody challenge</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">challenge me on this later but theists</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:20.000" style="s2">it seem</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">they don&#39;t have evidence to back up</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.000" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">their claim</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">many people base their theistic views on</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:27.279" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:29.440" style="s2">which when we define it we realize it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.279" end="00:30:32.320" style="s2">probably an untestable trust</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.440" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">trust and untestable trust and that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.320" end="00:30:36.559" style="s2">unreliable</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:38.240" style="s2">and now what i see is lots of theists</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.559" end="00:30:39.600" style="s2">getting really excited about this idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.240" end="00:30:41.600" style="s2">of dramatic truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.600" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">or or what did you call it what was the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.600" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">other one that you did you call it</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:46.880" style="s2">dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.440" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">metaphorical metaphoric truth um</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:50.159" style="s2">i just i have these little box of tic</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:52.000" style="s2">tacs have you seen</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.159" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">have you seen these running around the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">internet lately we&#39;ve been throwing mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:58.000" style="s2">memes up and stuff sometimes we meet</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.480" end="00:31:00.080" style="s2">people who say</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.000" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">it&#39;s true to me because i get value from</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.080" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">or um it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:09.679" style="s2">truth that type of stuff uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">i&#39;m a better person because i think that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.679" end="00:31:12.640" style="s2">it&#39;s true and that&#39;s good enough for me</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">to think that it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">so when we meet people who view truth in</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">subjective terms like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:20.240" style="s2">we usually ask something like do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:22.720" style="s2">think the total number of pieces in this</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.240" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">box is either even or odd and it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">be both</p>

<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">experiment can help people</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">realize that they are viewing truth in</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:34.399" style="s2">objective terms for most</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">everything else in their life but when</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.399" end="00:31:37.360" style="s2">it comes to the deeply held beliefs that</p>

<p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:24.799" style="s2">now again these are ideas that have been</p>

<p begin="00:33:24.799" end="00:33:29.120" style="s2">for years now and it wasn&#39;t really until</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:30.159" style="s2">i saw your your spreadsheet and started</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.120" end="00:33:31.279" style="s2">thinking about all these different</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.159" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">tribes and how they&#39;re viewing these</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">that it&#39;s sort of coalescing i could be</p>

<p begin="00:33:35.360" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think that i am though this i</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.760" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">really think that this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:44.399" style="s2">this is a really useful lens to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:44.399" style="s2">look at it through</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.360" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">rain you had a question hey anthony</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.880" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">um i wanted to ask about</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">um objectivism because you&#39;ve used that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:03.519" style="s2">word a bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:04.320" style="s2">and um i&#39;m curious if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.519" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.320" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">between objectivism and scientific</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">materialism</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:12.240" style="s2">um and i&#39;m curious what you think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.240" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">pure um empiricist view like uh the only</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.359" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">thing that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:23.280" style="s2">is what we can measure and observe</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:25.119" style="s2">there&#39;s i i always hold out a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.280" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">of myself to be open to the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.119" end="00:34:28.639" style="s2">there might be something more than the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">physical world</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.639" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">that we can rigorously test as best we</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">can well</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:36.639" style="s2">test as best we can using the tools of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">the scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.639" end="00:34:40.240" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know how we would actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:41.280" style="s2">be able to verify that it&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.240" end="00:34:46.000" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">some sort of scientific or or um</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.000" end="00:34:51.040" style="s2">or you know rigorous testing process to</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">see if it&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.040" end="00:34:55.200" style="s2">so i&#39;m open to hearing and i&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.760" end="00:34:56.879" style="s2">to thousands of people who think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.200" end="00:34:58.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a supernatural realm or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.879" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">something more than</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.160" end="00:35:02.960" style="s2">than this one world or this one life</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:02.960" style="s2">that we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.599" end="00:35:07.839" style="s2">i i haven&#39;t become jaded on it let me</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.599" end="00:35:09.359" style="s2">just say but</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.839" end="00:35:11.119" style="s2">when you when you run into so many</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.359" end="00:35:14.560" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.119" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">who hold views that they can&#39;t test</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.560" end="00:35:18.240" style="s2">methodologies that they can&#39;t test the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:19.839" style="s2">reliability of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.240" end="00:35:21.520" style="s2">um yet they&#39;re so confident that they</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.839" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">have the factual truth of the matter</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.520" end="00:35:26.240" style="s2">it&#39;s quite frustrating to see it time</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.560" end="00:35:30.400" style="s2">and time again</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.240" end="00:35:31.280" style="s2">so um that&#39;s kind of how i view things</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.400" end="00:35:34.079" style="s2">yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">um the time to actually hold a high</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.079" end="00:35:36.320" style="s2">degree of confidence in the truth of</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:37.839" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.320" end="00:35:40.160" style="s2">is when it could be demonstrated to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.839" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">the case why would we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.160" end="00:35:43.839" style="s2">anything else now</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">i&#39;m open to there being a god or or</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.839" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">there being some sort of supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:50.640" style="s2">realm or maybe karma really is real</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">or something along those lines but um if</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.640" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">we can&#39;t demonstrate to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">we probably shouldn&#39;t be so confident</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:36:03.359" style="s2">that it&#39;s factually true</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:06.720" style="s2">um can i follow up on that peter</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.359" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">um thanks that makes sense um</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.720" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m a realist for what it&#39;s worth so</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.599" end="00:36:12.720" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">i uh i don&#39;t tend to to fall on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.720" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:17.839" style="s2">um side of things so much um but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:20.400" style="s2">wondering about</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.839" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">uh again that sort of objectivism as the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.400" end="00:36:26.240" style="s2">independent</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">um the independent truth of things</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.240" end="00:36:31.200" style="s2">that they&#39;re true um independently of us</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">of the observer</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.200" end="00:36:36.800" style="s2">and um so like everything you said about</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:40.480" style="s2">being able to verify</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.800" end="00:36:41.920" style="s2">uh those claims uh seems to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">i agree that&#39;s the only way to get to</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.920" end="00:36:45.839" style="s2">truth but the verification process</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">itself would seem to involve</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.839" end="00:36:49.280" style="s2">a subjective observer have you thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.839" end="00:36:51.280" style="s2">about that problem of</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.280" end="00:36:54.240" style="s2">where the subjective observer fits in</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.280" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">with the objective scientific study</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.240" end="00:36:58.400" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re always going to have that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.520" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">element of of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.400" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">individuals observing what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">and then their subjective interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:07.599" style="s2">of it but it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">if there&#39;s if there&#39;s attributes of of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.599" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">repeatability of testability to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">feasibility</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:16.480" style="s2">seeing if other people can reproduce</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.079" end="00:37:41.760" style="s2">and we recognize that it could be</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.839" end="00:37:43.760" style="s2">influencing our perception of the true</p>

<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:06.079" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.800" end="00:44:07.680" style="s2">um i think just socratic question</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.079" end="00:44:08.960" style="s2">i was trained as an engineer and also</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.680" end="00:44:09.760" style="s2">you know with science and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.960" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">that and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.760" end="00:44:13.040" style="s2">to me socratic questioning just seems</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:17.200" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.040" end="00:44:19.359" style="s2">the natural way of behaving in the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.200" end="00:44:20.800" style="s2">and and i think it&#39;s also one of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.359" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.800" end="00:44:24.560" style="s2">i i i&#39;ve encountered a lot in my life</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:26.880" style="s2">just people who</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.560" end="00:44:28.720" style="s2">say outlandish things and so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.880" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">it&#39;s my way of like</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:34.160" style="s2">um engaging with them well i</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:34.880" style="s2">i turn off my own position like i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.160" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.880" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t care what&#39;s true or not let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s play with this</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">but usually what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.400" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">contradictions are revealed</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">and then you go further in those</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:46.720" style="s2">questions and depending on how</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:48.640" style="s2">emotionally intelligent the other person</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.720" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">is they either get angry at you or</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:51.760" style="s2">walk out of the room or if they&#39;re open</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.760" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">they um</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.040" end="00:44:59.119" style="s2">are committed to an ideal or a value</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.240" end="00:45:01.839" style="s2">such as</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.119" end="00:45:02.720" style="s2">integrity and soundness and honor and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.839" end="00:45:06.240" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.720" end="00:45:09.599" style="s2">then they will actually try to discover</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.240" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">what the truth is with you but i</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.599" end="00:45:14.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">i could what do you find with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.640" end="00:45:20.480" style="s2">that and your encounters i guess</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.960" end="00:45:24.079" style="s2">with the world and your approach</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.480" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">my my experience tells me that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.079" end="00:45:30.839" style="s2">people do want to believe true things</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:33.920" style="s2">and that when it comes down to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.839" end="00:45:35.359" style="s2">um okay there people</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:37.040" style="s2">in my experience people do want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.359" end="00:45:39.280" style="s2">believe true things and they often think</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:41.119" style="s2">that they have the truth</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.280" end="00:45:42.640" style="s2">but then there&#39;s another layer i guess</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.119" end="00:45:44.560" style="s2">of people who say</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.640" end="00:45:46.079" style="s2">i&#39;m starting to understand that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">have good reasons for thinking that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.079" end="00:45:48.640" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:50.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s more important for me to hold</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.640" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2">this belief and think that it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">like the value that i get from it</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.480" end="00:45:55.040" style="s2">supersedes the need for me to be holding</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:45:58.079" style="s2">on to</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.040" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">objectively true beliefs so in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.079" end="00:46:00.400" style="s2">respect like there&#39;s there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.400" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve met people who say i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">karma is real and five minutes later</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">just after them defining what it meant</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">they said</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:11.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t believe that anymore like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting quality to see in</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.920" end="00:46:14.720" style="s2">people but then again</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:16.079" style="s2">some people they have they feel that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.720" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">they&#39;ve been wronged in their in their</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.079" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">lives and there&#39;s the sense of justice</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.920" end="00:46:20.640" style="s2">that needs to be there</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:22.079" style="s2">and i can&#39;t interact with the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.640" end="00:46:23.040" style="s2">unless i think that there&#39;s karmic</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.079" end="00:46:26.240" style="s2">punishment</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.040" end="00:46:28.319" style="s2">happening because like i i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.240" end="00:46:29.200" style="s2">the resources to get back to at my</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.319" end="00:46:31.520" style="s2">attacker</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.200" end="00:46:34.319" style="s2">but karma&#39;s going to take care of it so</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.520" end="00:46:38.160" style="s2">there are some people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.319" end="00:46:39.280" style="s2">who uh they&#39;re trapped in their own</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.160" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">deception</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.280" end="00:46:43.599" style="s2">and they&#39;re happy being there and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a disturbing thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.599" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">sometimes i you know when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:48.079" style="s2">practice this enough you find that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:51.200" style="s2">need to actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.079" end="00:46:53.440" style="s2">vent to people who also practice it</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:55.520" style="s2">because uh it can kind of mess with your</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.440" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">mind when you start realizing</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.520" end="00:47:00.319" style="s2">how many confidently</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">confidently i don&#39;t mean the word</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.319" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">ignorant in a bad way</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:05.440" style="s2">look up the definition that&#39;s how i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">using it confidently</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.440" end="00:47:10.800" style="s2">ignorant people navigating the world and</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">voting and they&#39;re teaching their kids</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.800" end="00:47:15.839" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:17.680" style="s2">and we&#39;re we&#39;re in a tough spot</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.839" end="00:47:19.040" style="s2">things are not looking good for for</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.680" end="00:47:22.839" style="s2">humanity here</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.040" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">we need to get our [ __ ] together so</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.839" end="00:47:26.480" style="s2">um people with people who are</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.839" end="00:47:28.240" style="s2">approaching</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.480" end="00:47:30.319" style="s2">these conversations with others that</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.240" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">they disagree with from a place of love</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.319" end="00:47:33.839" style="s2">and empathy</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">and they use these tools and they can</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.839" end="00:47:37.599" style="s2">they can stick in the conversation long</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:39.920" style="s2">enough to keep their own ego</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.599" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">out of it and be a mirror to the person</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.920" end="00:47:43.760" style="s2">that they&#39;re speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">that is what i think is going to help</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.760" end="00:47:46.079" style="s2">break the impasse that we&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.440" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:50.319" style="s2">and again this isn&#39;t just something for</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:51.839" style="s2">atheists or the street epistemologists</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.319" end="00:47:53.599" style="s2">the street epistemology community is</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.839" end="00:47:56.880" style="s2">developing these tools</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.599" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">but we want people across the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.880" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">to learn them and not just learn them</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:04.160" style="s2">use them and maybe even help us develop</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:06.559" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.160" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">further that&#39;s that&#39;s the conundrum that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.559" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">i think we&#39;re at now like</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:11.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve been developing this thing and i</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">think we&#39;ve got it pretty good and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.520" end="00:48:13.440" style="s2">may</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">look back in five years and just cringe</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.440" end="00:48:16.559" style="s2">at the way that we&#39;re doing it but</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:17.760" style="s2">that&#39;s okay like we&#39;re heading in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.559" end="00:48:19.280" style="s2">right direction</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.760" end="00:48:20.880" style="s2">people are learning it and people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.280" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">being entertained by it and people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.880" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">kind of curious about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:25.920" style="s2">and they&#39;re seeing these videos and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">maybe even having good conversations</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:31.839" style="s2">but if we can&#39;t get people from</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:33.599" style="s2">the understanding phase to the usage</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.839" end="00:48:35.280" style="s2">phase</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.599" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to really make much of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.280" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">difference we need to actually start</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:40.880" style="s2">using it and implementing it</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">and teaching people how to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.880" end="00:48:44.559" style="s2">make it acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">to have a 30 minute respectful dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.559" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">on one claim</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:49.359" style="s2">rather than jumping jumping from one</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:51.920" style="s2">claim to the other and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.359" end="00:48:54.000" style="s2">you know it you know going for views and</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.920" end="00:48:56.240" style="s2">and the more bombastic this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.000" end="00:48:57.920" style="s2">is the more people will look at it</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.240" end="00:49:00.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s crushing us right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.920" end="00:49:01.839" style="s2">that&#39;s crushing that&#39;s cr uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.160" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">okay i&#39;ll stop talking about that that</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.839" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">that&#39;s my little hobby horse</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.520" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">cool um i i had a question um</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:12.640" style="s2">and jen actually like that just when i</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">was thinking it he dropped the quote</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.640" end="00:49:16.559" style="s2">from ken wilbur that</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:19.040" style="s2">went along the uh the lines of um no one</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.559" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">is uh smart enough to be 100 wrong</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.040" end="00:49:21.839" style="s2">right it&#39;s kind of like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.160" end="00:49:23.520" style="s2">people the broken clock thing tells the</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.839" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">time right twice type thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">um and so do you think there&#39;s a risk at</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">like if someone has the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">epistemology or not a clear one</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:35.119" style="s2">dismissing their worldview wholesale</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:36.640" style="s2">even though they might arrive at</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.119" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">the truth through a various different</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.640" end="00:49:38.240" style="s2">means like they might have stumbled on</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.240" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">and if you just sort of like oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to write epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:45.440" style="s2">go away and then that could be an area</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:46.480" style="s2">that you&#39;re not even focused on because</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.440" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not an interest</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:50.079" style="s2">so do you think there&#39;s a risk to this</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:51.680" style="s2">method yes so</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.079" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">what i think you&#39;re getting at there is</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.680" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">let me summarize what i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:56.160" style="s2">saying and then correct me if this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:58.559" style="s2">it that&#39;s like an essay question too</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.160" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">but um what i think you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.559" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2">could somebody use the approach of</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:03.920" style="s2">street epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">and lower a person&#39;s or help a person</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.920" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">lower their own confidence</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.599" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">in a claim that they think is true and</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">it really is true</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:14.079" style="s2">that that can that can absolutely happen</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:16.559" style="s2">um and it does occasionally happen and</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.079" end="00:50:17.839" style="s2">when it does i i feel a little bad</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.559" end="00:50:20.559" style="s2">but again i don&#39;t really know what the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.839" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">truth is either but um</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.559" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">somebody could discover that i have an</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:24.880" style="s2">unreliable way of concluding that god is</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:27.440" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.880" end="00:50:28.640" style="s2">and because i&#39;ve determined oh gosh that</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.440" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">really is a horrible</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.640" end="00:50:32.559" style="s2">methodology i should probably be less</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">certain in that claim</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.559" end="00:50:37.440" style="s2">the claim could still be factually true</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:39.119" style="s2">but what we&#39;re hoping with this with</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.440" end="00:50:40.960" style="s2">this approach is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.119" end="00:50:43.359" style="s2">we can maybe this is sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.960" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">process of elimination of methodologies</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.359" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">okay like well faith as i&#39;m defining it</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.200" end="00:50:48.800" style="s2">there is of just believing without</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:49.280" style="s2">evidence maybe that&#39;s like an unreliable</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.800" end="00:50:51.839" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.280" end="00:50:52.800" style="s2">but what&#39;s a better way of justifying my</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:56.000" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.800" end="00:50:57.520" style="s2">than faith for that claim maybe i can be</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.000" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">inspired to go find better</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.520" end="00:51:03.119" style="s2">reasons and more reliable epistemologies</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:04.160" style="s2">for confirming those reasons and i can</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.119" end="00:51:06.480" style="s2">really have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.160" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">a really truly justified confidence in</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.480" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">this claim but that is a risk like</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:13.280" style="s2">um there&#39;s one video that i uploaded</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:14.720" style="s2">where it was like a 10 minute talk and</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.280" end="00:51:15.680" style="s2">there was this woman walking around this</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.720" end="00:51:18.079" style="s2">campus</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.680" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">and she was um she was trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.079" end="00:51:21.440" style="s2">people to register to vote</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:22.960" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">valuable thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.960" end="00:51:26.319" style="s2">and she walked up to me i think it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">our second talk the first talk was about</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.319" end="00:51:29.760" style="s2">karma or something</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:31.599" style="s2">or the law of attraction but she wanted</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.760" end="00:51:34.000" style="s2">to talk about why everybody should vote</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.599" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">and by the end of a 10-minute talk she</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.000" end="00:51:37.040" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s really not so important that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.040" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">people vote or not</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:43.760" style="s2">and i let her walk away with that</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">thought because i&#39;m sort of a purist in</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.760" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">that way like</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:50.559" style="s2">let her let her go and figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:52.480" style="s2">now you know maybe we lost out on her</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.559" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">registering five or ten more people</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.480" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">for voting that day um there could be</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">some serious</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:52:04.240" style="s2">or significant um fallout i suppose of</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:05.359" style="s2">backing off on claims that are true but</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.240" end="00:52:07.359" style="s2">because we have an unreliable</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.359" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">epistemology we lower our confidence in</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.359" end="00:52:10.240" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:11.040" style="s2">i think that can happen but i guess i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.240" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.040" end="00:52:17.599" style="s2">i think that that risk is is</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:19.119" style="s2">a lot it&#39;s a lot less of an issue</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.599" end="00:52:20.559" style="s2">than running around with beliefs that</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.119" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">we&#39;re certain are true because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.559" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">based on really</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">faulty epistemologies but i&#39;m one i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:27.200" style="s2">willing to you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.599" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">we we have people who are watching what</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.200" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">we&#39;re doing in street epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:32.720" style="s2">and they&#39;re con some some people are</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.119" end="00:52:34.319" style="s2">very excited about it like i am</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.720" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">and some people have some concerns about</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.319" end="00:52:39.760" style="s2">it too we don&#39;t just shun the people who</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">have criticisms we want to encourage</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.760" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.960" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">this approach has gotten better from</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:46.319" style="s2">people surfacing their concerns about</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:48.079" style="s2">the approach</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.319" end="00:52:50.079" style="s2">pull up a video from five years ago of</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.079" end="00:52:51.760" style="s2">somebody doing street epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.079" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">and then try pulling up a video of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.760" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">today and i think you&#39;ll notice</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s moving in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.280" end="00:53:04.960" style="s2">great question by the way these are</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:08.000" style="s2">really good questions um</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.960" end="00:53:09.119" style="s2">like if anyone has any uh questions so</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.000" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">rain i want to hold on to that question</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.119" end="00:53:10.800" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:12.000" style="s2">don&#39;t have another juicy question the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.800" end="00:53:12.880" style="s2">chat&#39;s going crazy right now so i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.000" end="00:53:16.319" style="s2">even follow it</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.880" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">um so yeah maybe something about bias</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.319" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:22.640" style="s2">uh to piggyback on what you just said um</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:23.920" style="s2">and so i have an acting background in</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:25.359" style="s2">improv and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.920" end="00:53:27.359" style="s2">and then one thing when you go into</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.359" end="00:53:28.000" style="s2">improv especially you really get a</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.359" end="00:53:30.720" style="s2">sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.000" end="00:53:32.079" style="s2">like a somatic sensitivity on status and</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.720" end="00:53:33.599" style="s2">like status games</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.079" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">and then when when you kind of then you</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.599" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">kind of sniff out when people are</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:39.040" style="s2">playing status games</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:40.079" style="s2">um so i want i wonder if there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.040" end="00:53:43.200" style="s2">status bias</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.079" end="00:53:44.640" style="s2">in in something like so michael uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.200" end="00:53:46.400" style="s2">i think bachmann he&#39;s a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.640" end="00:53:48.559" style="s2">theorist political scientist and he has</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.400" end="00:53:50.000" style="s2">a term called stigmatized knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">and basically it&#39;s knowledge that it</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.000" end="00:53:53.920" style="s2">kind of exists outside of like</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:55.839" style="s2">established institutions like academia</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.920" end="00:53:56.400" style="s2">or uh you know like new york times or</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.839" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.400" end="00:54:00.400" style="s2">so these are like wild conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.839" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">theories woo all that type of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.400" end="00:54:04.319" style="s2">and i noticed that there&#39;s like a bias</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:05.520" style="s2">towards stigmatized knowledge that some</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.319" end="00:54:07.520" style="s2">people have it&#39;s like a knee-jerk</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.520" end="00:54:10.400" style="s2">reaction anything that falls outside</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.520" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">of established authority is just forget</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.400" end="00:54:12.640" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:14.960" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the on the flip side</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.640" end="00:54:17.119" style="s2">there&#39;s people that anything that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.960" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">from established authority they just</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.119" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">just need your rejection of it</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:22.800" style="s2">and i find like there&#39;s like a status</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:23.119" style="s2">move on either something weirdly on</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.800" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.119" end="00:54:29.680" style="s2">either side of it so i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:30.559" style="s2">street epistemology um flags that kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.680" end="00:54:32.079" style="s2">of like inherent</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.559" end="00:54:33.839" style="s2">bias because i know i don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.079" end="00:54:35.280" style="s2">the the sc community but i know people</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.839" end="00:54:35.839" style="s2">on the new atheist community they had</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.280" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">sort of that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.839" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">anything that stigmatized knowledge i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:42.079" style="s2">not even going to look at it um</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.839" end="00:54:43.599" style="s2">in case a point like uh the q anon i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.079" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">definitely not a q an honor but they</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.599" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:47.920" style="s2">epstein for example like almost a year</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">before he he was</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.920" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">kind of brought into lightweight but he</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:53.599" style="s2">did um and if you just dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.079" end="00:54:55.119" style="s2">that whole movement you might have</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.599" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">missed something that was happening</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.119" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:01.920" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m not entirely sure what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.760" end="00:55:03.440" style="s2">asking me so can you phrase it as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.920" end="00:55:06.960" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.440" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">yeah so i guess um</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.960" end="00:55:12.559" style="s2">how uh like bias and like an under</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:13.520" style="s2">an attachment to status could make you</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.559" end="00:55:16.160" style="s2">dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.520" end="00:55:17.119" style="s2">certain claims yeah and then does street</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.160" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.119" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">bring awareness to your own bias it</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:25.839" style="s2">well from i can only sort of answer that</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:27.119" style="s2">for myself it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.839" end="00:55:28.880" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely brought attention to my</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.119" end="00:55:31.119" style="s2">own bias so like for example i was</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.880" end="00:55:33.119" style="s2">actually reluctant to talk about my view</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.119" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">of james and peter because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.119" end="00:55:36.559" style="s2">friends of mine</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">we&#39;ve hung out together you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.559" end="00:55:38.880" style="s2">help each other occasionally on on</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:40.240" style="s2">various projects</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.880" end="00:55:43.680" style="s2">not so much james but probably more</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.240" end="00:55:43.680" style="s2">peter but um</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.040" end="00:55:50.319" style="s2">i see i see the the the liability that</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">bias has</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.319" end="00:55:53.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m i guess personally i&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:56.000" style="s2">willing to acknowledge it</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.440" end="00:55:57.040" style="s2">and try to overcome it but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.000" end="00:56:00.240" style="s2">it&#39;s alluring</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.040" end="00:56:02.079" style="s2">bias is alluring you might think</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.240" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">something is more true because the</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.079" end="00:56:05.839" style="s2">person that tweeted it has more</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.839" end="00:56:07.359" style="s2">followers</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.839" end="00:56:09.200" style="s2">than you would expect or something like</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.359" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">that or they have a blue check mark</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.200" end="00:56:13.119" style="s2">so yeah i think there is a tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:15.839" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.119" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">to to weight the things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.839" end="00:56:18.559" style="s2">hearing more</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:20.400" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely a i think a</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.559" end="00:56:21.599" style="s2">psychological tendency to give more</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.400" end="00:56:24.079" style="s2">weight to the things that</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.599" end="00:56:25.200" style="s2">just confirm what we already think is</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.079" end="00:56:27.040" style="s2">the case</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.200" end="00:56:28.160" style="s2">but that is that is definitely something</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:29.599" style="s2">that we&#39;re aware of when we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.160" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">these conversations sometimes we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.599" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">entire</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">conversations about bias</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:35.920" style="s2">i think i uploaded a video where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:37.119" style="s2">all we talked about it was in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.920" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">context of like uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.119" end="00:56:41.359" style="s2">school exams or something but it became</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:42.960" style="s2">useful later when we shifted to his</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.359" end="00:56:44.240" style="s2">claim that god was real</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.960" end="00:56:46.079" style="s2">and we started talking about well look</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.240" end="00:56:48.000" style="s2">what bias do i have as a questioner what</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.079" end="00:56:49.839" style="s2">bias do you have is the claimant</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.000" end="00:56:51.599" style="s2">how do we mitigate our biases how do we</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.839" end="00:56:53.680" style="s2">try to account for those</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.599" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">um my friend reed who&#39;s actually in here</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.680" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">i know he was doing a virtual reality</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:56:59.760" style="s2">essie i think he was testing out using</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:57:01.119" style="s2">vr goggles and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:02.799" style="s2">you can&#39;t really you can go out in</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.119" end="00:57:04.480" style="s2">public but some people don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.799" end="00:57:06.720" style="s2">and he had this wonderful conversation</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.480" end="00:57:09.680" style="s2">with these young people</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.720" end="00:57:10.319" style="s2">he was in a vr room and what was the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.680" end="00:57:12.559" style="s2">claim like</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.319" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">he noticed uh the the this girl that he</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.559" end="00:57:16.319" style="s2">was talking with</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:17.839" style="s2">said that uh she saw a tick tock where</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:19.119" style="s2">somebody was moving things with their</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.839" end="00:57:20.960" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.119" end="00:57:22.480" style="s2">and though i think one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.960" end="00:57:23.680" style="s2">justifications for thinking that it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.480" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">true is because</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.680" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">this person had a lot of followers so</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">this is something that we see time and</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:31.599" style="s2">time again in these interactions and</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">yeah we definitely want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.599" end="00:57:35.680" style="s2">acknowledge it and point it out but not</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:37.839" style="s2">in a way where it&#39;s demeaning</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.680" end="00:57:38.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know if you were raised in</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.839" end="00:57:40.400" style="s2">a different culture do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.960" end="00:57:41.680" style="s2">you might be viewing your claim</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.400" end="00:57:43.440" style="s2">differently today</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.680" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a question that we often ask that</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.440" end="00:57:48.160" style="s2">kind of gets to the heart of bias</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:49.440" style="s2">and this goes to your point too that it</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.160" end="00:57:51.040" style="s2">would be good that a lot of the mega</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.440" end="00:57:52.400" style="s2">tribes had this tool</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.040" end="00:57:54.160" style="s2">because they might have a bias that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:56.079" style="s2">opposite than you know the bias that or</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.160" end="00:57:57.200" style="s2">someone from the atheist camp uh and</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.079" end="00:57:59.839" style="s2">then they can apply it</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.200" end="00:58:00.480" style="s2">to each other yeah what i&#39;m hoping is</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.839" end="00:58:02.079" style="s2">that there</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.480" end="00:58:03.520" style="s2">there will be people there will be</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.079" end="00:58:05.599" style="s2">there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.520" end="00:58:06.640" style="s2">there are probably skeptical emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.599" end="00:58:09.440" style="s2">intelligent people</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.640" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">and every tribe on your sheet and tribes</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.440" end="00:58:15.040" style="s2">that you haven&#39;t even mentioned yet</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:16.960" style="s2">um i&#39;m i&#39;m hopeful that</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.040" end="00:58:18.480" style="s2">this method will appeal to those folks</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.960" end="00:58:20.400" style="s2">and they bring it in so like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.480" end="00:58:22.079" style="s2">almost like a trojan horse of sorts but</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.400" end="00:58:22.960" style="s2">like it&#39;s not a nefarious trojan horse</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.079" end="00:58:25.599" style="s2">because i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.960" end="00:58:26.720" style="s2">like it&#39;s a really respectful useful</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.599" end="00:58:28.559" style="s2">tool</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.720" end="00:58:32.240" style="s2">um when i hear people critique the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.559" end="00:58:32.240" style="s2">method they almost always</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.480" end="00:58:35.920" style="s2">don&#39;t fully understand it or maybe</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.680" end="01:00:32.319" style="s2">uh was asking her question was uh is</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.040" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">street epistemology</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.319" end="01:00:36.160" style="s2">moral and there&#39;s a bit of an argument</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:38.480" style="s2">and um well</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.160" end="01:00:40.400" style="s2">not an argument like uh you know coming</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.480" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">to a greater truth and</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.400" end="01:00:46.079" style="s2">my stance was i believe that uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not inherently moral uh it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.079" end="01:00:49.440" style="s2">necessarily coming to</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:51.200" style="s2">something higher or better because i</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.440" end="01:00:51.920" style="s2">believe that a skilled practitioner can</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.200" end="01:00:54.960" style="s2">bypass</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.920" end="01:00:55.440" style="s2">truth seeking and weaponize sc so they</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.960" end="01:00:57.760" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.440" end="01:00:59.680" style="s2">like uh they could give off the pretense</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.760" end="01:01:02.319" style="s2">that they&#39;re seeking a greater truth</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:05.520" style="s2">while manipulating someone else so i was</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.319" end="01:01:05.520" style="s2">wondering your thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.319" end="01:01:11.280" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a really good point and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.640" end="01:01:13.359" style="s2">something that we we frequently discuss</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.280" end="01:01:15.599" style="s2">in the various sc communities whether</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.359" end="01:01:18.720" style="s2">it&#39;s reddit or discord or facebook or</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.599" end="01:01:19.839" style="s2">whatever um or even privately we have</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.720" end="01:01:22.799" style="s2">chats like</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.839" end="01:01:23.440" style="s2">how can we make this more ethical how</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.799" end="01:01:25.520" style="s2">can we</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.440" end="01:01:27.200" style="s2">how can we build in an ethical component</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.520" end="01:01:28.960" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.200" end="01:01:30.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know the answer to that other</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.960" end="01:01:33.119" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.880" end="01:01:35.280" style="s2">maybe pointing you to the things that</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.119" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">you may notice that we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.280" end="01:01:39.040" style="s2">in our interactions one thing that at</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:42.559" style="s2">least i try to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.040" end="01:01:45.280" style="s2">is i try to be extremely transparent</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.559" end="01:01:46.319" style="s2">when i when i start maybe people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.280" end="01:01:47.599" style="s2">understand what i do but i</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.319" end="01:01:49.599" style="s2">usually like start up a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.599" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">with somebody i have a camera and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.599" end="01:01:53.760" style="s2">explain that i&#39;m i&#39;m looking to surface</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:54.480" style="s2">a claim that they make that they think</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.760" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">is true</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.480" end="01:02:00.000" style="s2">that i can respectfully challenge with</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.079" end="01:02:03.119" style="s2">questions so i try to be very</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.000" end="01:02:05.280" style="s2">um i guess like</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.119" end="01:02:07.039" style="s2">i try to over ex may sometimes even over</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.280" end="01:02:08.559" style="s2">explain but i try to explain what</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.039" end="01:02:11.680" style="s2">they&#39;re getting into</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.559" end="01:02:12.319" style="s2">and and having them consent in now they</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.680" end="01:02:14.079" style="s2">may still</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.319" end="01:02:16.079" style="s2">be consenting to something that they</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.079" end="01:02:17.280" style="s2">think is what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.079" end="01:02:18.640" style="s2">like they think that maybe this is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.280" end="01:02:20.319" style="s2">little puff piece and i can sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.640" end="01:02:22.079" style="s2">share my narrative my story</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.319" end="01:02:23.599" style="s2">and i&#39;m gonna get this nice warm fuzzy</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.079" end="01:02:25.039" style="s2">feeling and then by the end of it</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.599" end="01:02:26.720" style="s2">they&#39;re like oh gosh like i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.039" end="01:02:28.960" style="s2">realize i was gonna go that way</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.720" end="01:02:31.280" style="s2">i suppose that could happen um there</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.960" end="01:02:32.720" style="s2">have been times where people said</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.280" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">um i think i&#39;d rather look at your</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.720" end="01:02:34.799" style="s2">videos first and then come back and do a</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:36.559" style="s2">talk</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.799" end="01:02:38.160" style="s2">and people have done that and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.559" end="01:02:39.920" style="s2">come back or people have done that and</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.160" end="01:02:42.480" style="s2">they do come back</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.920" end="01:02:42.480" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.039" end="01:02:47.920" style="s2">i think trying to explain</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.559" end="01:02:49.599" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re attempting to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.920" end="01:02:51.039" style="s2">with these questions is probably one</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.599" end="01:02:54.160" style="s2">that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.039" end="01:02:56.640" style="s2">helps make this more ethical but</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.160" end="01:02:58.720" style="s2">i also think that if you over explain</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.640" end="01:03:00.960" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing you can confuse people</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.720" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">and that you don&#39;t want to confuse</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.960" end="01:03:03.440" style="s2">people i don&#39;t i want i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2">anyone confused</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.440" end="01:03:09.200" style="s2">i want clear-headed rationally thinking</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.799" end="01:03:10.160" style="s2">as best as possible and try to minimize</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.200" end="01:03:13.039" style="s2">the emotion</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.160" end="01:03:14.880" style="s2">of the talk as much as possible so um</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.039" end="01:03:17.200" style="s2">like tricking somebody into a dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.880" end="01:03:18.799" style="s2">is not something that i&#39;d recommend</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.200" end="01:03:20.240" style="s2">obtaining consent i think is really</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.799" end="01:03:21.119" style="s2">important and maybe on the on the flip</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.240" end="01:03:23.760" style="s2">side of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.119" end="01:03:24.240" style="s2">after the talk ask them if they want to</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.760" end="01:03:26.079" style="s2">ask you</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.240" end="01:03:28.559" style="s2">questions back because it can be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.079" end="01:03:30.880" style="s2">two-way and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.559" end="01:03:32.480" style="s2">give them a way to contact you later</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.880" end="01:03:35.119" style="s2">because sometimes these conversations</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.480" end="01:03:38.319" style="s2">can be so</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.119" end="01:03:40.000" style="s2">um unnerving maybe</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.319" end="01:03:42.160" style="s2">like they&#39;re very thought provoking</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.000" end="01:03:45.280" style="s2">conversations and if if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:47.599" style="s2">suddenly discover after a 10-minute talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.280" end="01:03:49.200" style="s2">i can&#39;t justify this belief not only to</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.599" end="01:03:50.400" style="s2">that stranger with the camera that was</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.200" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">asking me these questions</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.400" end="01:03:55.440" style="s2">but i can&#39;t justify it to myself anymore</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:57.760" style="s2">that could be extremely that could be</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.440" end="01:03:59.920" style="s2">extremely upsetting to people</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.760" end="01:04:01.520" style="s2">who have views that are tied to their</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.920" end="01:04:05.440" style="s2">identity</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.520" end="01:04:08.559" style="s2">so myself and i think the the community</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.440" end="01:04:10.079" style="s2">the community and at large were open to</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.559" end="01:04:12.960" style="s2">considering ways to make this</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.079" end="01:04:15.200" style="s2">more ethical just one more thing on that</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.960" end="01:04:17.760" style="s2">unless you want to go deeper</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.200" end="01:04:19.599" style="s2">i think it&#39;s kind of interesting that</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.760" end="01:04:22.319" style="s2">this topic of the morality of</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.599" end="01:04:23.039" style="s2">the approach or the ethics of it comes</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.319" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.039" end="01:04:26.240" style="s2">for street epistemology and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:30.480" style="s2">come up with</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.240" end="01:04:31.839" style="s2">debate or arguing or or ridiculing</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.480" end="01:04:34.319" style="s2">people really seem to be concerned about</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.839" end="01:04:36.000" style="s2">the ethics of it when they watch the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.319" end="01:04:37.039" style="s2">encounters or they see what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.000" end="01:04:40.640" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.039" end="01:04:42.160" style="s2">um which i think might suggest that</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.640" end="01:04:43.680" style="s2">there&#39;s something really profound about</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.160" end="01:04:45.440" style="s2">it um</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.680" end="01:04:46.880" style="s2">but then again like we may look back in</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.440" end="01:04:48.480" style="s2">a number of years and think</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.880" end="01:04:49.760" style="s2">uh you really missed some critical</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.480" end="01:04:51.039" style="s2">things you should have said this you</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.760" end="01:04:55.200" style="s2">should have done that</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.039" end="01:04:56.880" style="s2">maybe maybe um we reach a point where</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.200" end="01:04:58.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a code of ethics or something</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.880" end="01:05:00.559" style="s2">but you have to remember</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.720" end="01:05:02.559" style="s2">this these are just people that have</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.559" end="01:05:04.319" style="s2">that have read a couple books</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.559" end="01:05:06.640" style="s2">and have started having talks and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.319" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">kind of coalescing as a community</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.640" end="01:05:10.400" style="s2">this is this is we&#39;re at the very early</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:12.559" style="s2">stages</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.400" end="01:05:13.440" style="s2">of this thing and i i don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.559" end="01:05:15.440" style="s2">it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.440" end="01:05:17.599" style="s2">i i think i know where it&#39;s going in</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.440" end="01:05:21.200" style="s2">terms of the culture war and all this</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.599" end="01:05:23.280" style="s2">um but it&#39;s gonna it&#39;s gonna keep</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.200" end="01:05:26.319" style="s2">evolving it&#39;s evolved tremendously</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.280" end="01:05:26.319" style="s2">in the last five years</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.559" end="01:05:33.839" style="s2">all right uh jeff falloff albert</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:36.160" style="s2">um yeah um yeah that was awesome thank</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.839" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">you anthony um so um</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.160" end="01:05:40.000" style="s2">just uh the thing that i got from that</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:42.480" style="s2">is um you know because when i think</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.000" end="01:05:45.599" style="s2">about this i think that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.480" end="01:05:46.880" style="s2">very prone to biases so i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.599" end="01:05:50.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.880" end="01:05:52.240" style="s2">it&#39;s just very difficult for us to</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.000" end="01:05:54.319" style="s2">go into any one of the like like a</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.240" end="01:05:57.839" style="s2">street epistemology session</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.319" end="01:06:00.160" style="s2">and and really in truly good faith</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.839" end="01:06:01.039" style="s2">not be trying to convert someone because</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.160" end="01:06:02.480" style="s2">you know because like</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.039" end="01:06:04.319" style="s2">everyone has their own you know everyone</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.480" end="01:06:06.079" style="s2">has their own belief structures and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.319" end="01:06:07.440" style="s2">and we could we could say we could</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.079" end="01:06:08.720" style="s2">profess that oh i&#39;m trying to get to a</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.440" end="01:06:11.520" style="s2">higher truth</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.720" end="01:06:13.520" style="s2">i i think that it&#39;s extremely difficult</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.520" end="01:06:15.039" style="s2">for that to be the case</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.520" end="01:06:16.720" style="s2">yeah so i&#39;ll just think yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.039" end="01:06:17.839" style="s2">that&#39;s just what i thought about this no</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.720" end="01:06:18.400" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a really good point</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.839" end="01:06:23.119" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.400" end="01:06:25.520" style="s2">uh you know some of us can be</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.119" end="01:06:27.200" style="s2">once you do this enough especially if</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.520" end="01:06:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a repetitive claim that people make</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.200" end="01:06:29.839" style="s2">like living in texas i run into a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.960" end="01:06:32.160" style="s2">theists</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.839" end="01:06:32.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve been i&#39;ve i&#39;ve become really really</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.160" end="01:06:35.920" style="s2">good at</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.960" end="01:06:36.640" style="s2">having conversations with theists and</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.920" end="01:06:38.319" style="s2">driving</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.640" end="01:06:40.079" style="s2">fairly quickly down to the to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.319" end="01:06:41.599" style="s2">reliability of their method</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.079" end="01:06:42.880" style="s2">and possibly leaving them with a pebble</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.599" end="01:06:44.000" style="s2">in their shoes so that they can figure</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.880" end="01:06:45.599" style="s2">it out on their own</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.000" end="01:06:47.920" style="s2">that might also sort of lean towards the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.599" end="01:06:51.920" style="s2">ethics of this is like</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.920" end="01:06:55.039" style="s2">generally when we have a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.920" end="01:06:55.359" style="s2">with somebody and they discover on their</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.039" end="01:06:57.920" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.359" end="01:06:59.119" style="s2">using their own terminology and reasons</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.920" end="01:07:00.960" style="s2">and methods and</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.119" end="01:07:03.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not a misrepresentation at all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.960" end="01:07:04.640" style="s2">like we want to try to be a mirror to</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.119" end="01:07:06.559" style="s2">the to the stuff that we&#39;re hearing from</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.640" end="01:07:08.480" style="s2">the person</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.559" end="01:07:09.920" style="s2">once they discover or they begin to sort</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.480" end="01:07:11.839" style="s2">of realize that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.920" end="01:07:14.000" style="s2">i can&#39;t justify my confidence in this</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.839" end="01:07:17.039" style="s2">claim that&#39;s typically when we</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.000" end="01:07:19.920" style="s2">end the talk so that they can go and</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.039" end="01:07:22.799" style="s2">think about it or maybe talk to a pastor</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.920" end="01:07:24.240" style="s2">or an imam or or sit on it for a year</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.799" end="01:07:25.599" style="s2">before they feel comfortable talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.240" end="01:07:30.240" style="s2">about it again</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.599" end="01:07:33.599" style="s2">um i think it would be harder to</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.240" end="01:07:35.839" style="s2">to um yeah i think it would be harder to</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.599" end="01:07:40.079" style="s2">say that this is an ethical</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.839" end="01:07:42.400" style="s2">endeavor if you noticed us</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.079" end="01:07:44.880" style="s2">taking advantage of somebody who&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.400" end="01:07:46.640" style="s2">a state of doubt</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.880" end="01:07:49.200" style="s2">that i think that&#39;s crossing a line</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.640" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">there i i hope we never see essie reach</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.200" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">the point where</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:54.559" style="s2">people are weaponizing it but you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:57.440" style="s2">to remember it is a tool</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.559" end="01:07:59.200" style="s2">it can be weaponized but like i said i</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.440" end="01:08:00.720" style="s2">think in order to be good at it</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.200" end="01:08:02.079" style="s2">you you sort of have to approach it from</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.720" end="01:08:03.119" style="s2">a place of empathy and i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.079" end="01:08:05.280" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.119" end="01:08:06.319" style="s2">can you still be empathetic and</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.280" end="01:08:07.680" style="s2">unethical</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.319" end="01:08:10.240" style="s2">maybe you can i think it might be a</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.680" end="01:08:14.319" style="s2">little bit more difficult</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.240" end="01:08:17.120" style="s2">yeah awesome thank you so much anthony</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.319" end="01:08:18.560" style="s2">sure thing oh i was gonna say can i just</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.120" end="01:08:21.359" style="s2">add one more thing like</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.560" end="01:08:23.199" style="s2">um a good question to ask if you are</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.359" end="01:08:24.799" style="s2">wondering about whether it&#39;s ethical to</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.199" end="01:08:26.640" style="s2">challenge somebody on their views</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.799" end="01:08:28.159" style="s2">is you can just explain to them totally</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.640" end="01:08:29.679" style="s2">what you&#39;re planning to do</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.159" end="01:08:31.679" style="s2">i learned this technique it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.679" end="01:08:33.279" style="s2">street epistemology some people even are</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.679" end="01:08:34.640" style="s2">wondering whether it&#39;s ethical</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.279" end="01:08:36.080" style="s2">it&#39;s where you ask questions and it</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.640" end="01:08:37.120" style="s2">might leave you in a state of doubt or</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.080" end="01:08:38.799" style="s2">wonder</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.120" end="01:08:40.640" style="s2">but then again if you share too much you</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.799" end="01:08:42.480" style="s2">could be you could be priming them for</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.640" end="01:08:45.520" style="s2">that kind of response so</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.480" end="01:08:47.199" style="s2">this this is very tricky um</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.520" end="01:08:50.960" style="s2">this is a very good question to ask like</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.199" end="01:08:52.719" style="s2">say something like or ask something like</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.960" end="01:08:54.640" style="s2">is it important for you that your</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.719" end="01:08:56.159" style="s2">beliefs are as close to the factual</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.640" end="01:08:59.199" style="s2">truth of the matter as possible</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.159" end="01:09:01.440" style="s2">do you value that and</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.199" end="01:09:03.600" style="s2">and see what they say you may be</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.440" end="01:09:05.440" style="s2">surprised by the response that you get</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.600" end="01:09:06.960" style="s2">but generally if somebody says yeah like</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.440" end="01:09:08.880" style="s2">i do want to believe</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.960" end="01:09:10.719" style="s2">i want my beliefs to align with truth as</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.880" end="01:09:12.400" style="s2">much as possible</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.719" end="01:09:13.920" style="s2">that&#39;s usually a green light if i&#39;m ever</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.400" end="01:09:14.799" style="s2">in doubt whether i should engage with</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.920" end="01:09:16.960" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.799" end="01:09:17.839" style="s2">that&#39;s usually something that i&#39;ll i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.960" end="01:09:19.199" style="s2">try</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.839" end="01:09:21.040" style="s2">if they say that they want to believe</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.199" end="01:09:22.000" style="s2">true things and they&#39;re willing to pay</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.040" end="01:09:23.679" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.000" end="01:09:25.440" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to rebuild if they have</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.679" end="01:09:28.880" style="s2">to and maybe pay the cost</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.440" end="01:09:30.159" style="s2">of that then i usually progress but i go</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.880" end="01:09:31.759" style="s2">at the speed that they&#39;re comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.159" end="01:09:33.279" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.759" end="01:09:34.560" style="s2">that&#39;s another i guess challenge of this</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.279" end="01:09:35.600" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry to kind of i feel like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.560" end="01:09:37.279" style="s2">rambling here</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.600" end="01:09:40.719" style="s2">but i also feel like i&#39;m sharing some</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.279" end="01:09:40.719" style="s2">useful stuff um</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.120" end="01:09:44.400" style="s2">it can be really tempting to go really</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.799" end="01:09:45.679" style="s2">fast at this approach when you get good</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.400" end="01:09:48.880" style="s2">at it</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.679" end="01:09:50.480" style="s2">because you know it&#39;s like the writing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.880" end="01:09:52.560" style="s2">on the wall it&#39;s so evident</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.480" end="01:09:54.960" style="s2">but they just haven&#39;t discovered it yet</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.560" end="01:09:58.239" style="s2">so um sometimes you can be so</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.960" end="01:10:00.000" style="s2">proficient with this approach that</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.239" end="01:10:01.440" style="s2">you can maybe you can actually hurt</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.000" end="01:10:03.199" style="s2">people by doing it</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.440" end="01:10:04.880" style="s2">so check with you check with your</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.199" end="01:10:06.800" style="s2">conversation partner frequently</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.880" end="01:10:08.400" style="s2">do you mind i if i ask you two more</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.800" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">questions or</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.400" end="01:10:10.960" style="s2">you know i noticed that you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:12.000" style="s2">crossed your arms there would you like</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.960" end="01:10:13.440" style="s2">to wrap it up or</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.000" end="01:10:16.719" style="s2">is this getting too uncomfortable for</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.440" end="01:10:18.239" style="s2">you you can do that so check in with</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.719" end="01:10:19.440" style="s2">your conversation partner and make sure</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.239" end="01:10:22.080" style="s2">that they&#39;re okay</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.440" end="01:10:23.840" style="s2">with what you&#39;re doing i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.080" end="01:10:26.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a um</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.840" end="01:10:28.400" style="s2">another value that&#39;s needed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.480" end="01:10:30.560" style="s2">equally as strong as the value for</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.400" end="01:10:31.920" style="s2">truth seeking truth uh because what you</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.560" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">described there kind of relates to what</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.920" end="01:10:34.239" style="s2">paul asked about emotional intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:36.800" style="s2">kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.239" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">having a feel of where someone&#39;s at um</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.800" end="01:10:40.080" style="s2">and having care</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.840" end="01:10:42.320" style="s2">learning to read people a little bit too</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.080" end="01:10:42.320" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.560" end="01:10:45.040" style="s2">yeah so the question is you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.679" end="01:10:46.400" style="s2">instrumentalizing that skill set in</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.040" end="01:10:48.080" style="s2">order to get to the truth</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.400" end="01:10:50.000" style="s2">um that&#39;s one thing or do you think</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.080" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">there has to be an equal value</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.000" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">that engenders that care naturally</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.560" end="01:11:01.520" style="s2">for the practitioner you mean yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.600" end="01:11:02.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i don&#39;t i don&#39;t see how</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.520" end="01:11:04.560" style="s2">you could become a practitioner of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.960" end="01:11:06.000" style="s2">method if you don&#39;t yourself value the</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.560" end="01:11:07.040" style="s2">truth of the matter</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.000" end="01:11:09.360" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.040" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">prerequisite is that you yourself value</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.360" end="01:11:11.760" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:14.320" style="s2">and you yourself are willing to pay the</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.760" end="01:11:16.800" style="s2">cost of abandoning a view</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.320" end="01:11:18.560" style="s2">that you can&#39;t justify to yourself even</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.800" end="01:11:21.679" style="s2">though it might ostracize you from</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.560" end="01:11:22.960" style="s2">the very tribe that you identify with um</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.679" end="01:11:25.120" style="s2">how many of us who are watching are</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.960" end="01:11:26.960" style="s2">listening had had to do that it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.120" end="01:11:28.400" style="s2">easy thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.960" end="01:11:30.000" style="s2">you have to rebuild you might have to</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.400" end="01:11:32.000" style="s2">find new friends you might have to learn</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.000" end="01:11:34.560" style="s2">learn a new a new language so to speak</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.000" end="01:11:38.000" style="s2">like new new lingo</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.560" end="01:11:39.760" style="s2">um it could be scary to to realize that</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.000" end="01:11:41.040" style="s2">i can&#39;t justify this belief and i need</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.760" end="01:11:44.159" style="s2">to find a new tribe</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.040" end="01:11:47.520" style="s2">a tribe of people who question who value</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.159" end="01:11:49.520" style="s2">who value uncertainty and doubt and and</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.520" end="01:11:51.520" style="s2">see dogma is problematic</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.520" end="01:11:54.480" style="s2">they&#39;re the community is there we&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.520" end="01:11:55.520" style="s2">here there are people who do that</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.480" end="01:11:57.040" style="s2">but that that&#39;s sort of as a</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.520" end="01:11:58.320" style="s2">prerequisite you have to value truth and</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.040" end="01:12:00.239" style="s2">i think you have to</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.320" end="01:12:02.560" style="s2">you have to respect that other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.239" end="01:12:05.920" style="s2">value of truth are different</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.560" end="01:12:08.239" style="s2">and and uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.920" end="01:12:09.600" style="s2">and respect that as much as you can it</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.239" end="01:12:10.719" style="s2">could be upsetting when you see people</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.600" end="01:12:12.560" style="s2">who are like</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.719" end="01:12:14.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t care if it&#39;s true or not i can</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.560" end="01:12:15.679" style="s2">sleep better at night when i go to bed</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.320" end="01:12:17.280" style="s2">thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.679" end="01:12:19.760" style="s2">the creator of the universe is watching</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.280" end="01:12:20.719" style="s2">over me and they really mean it</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.760" end="01:12:23.679" style="s2">it could be it could be a little</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.719" end="01:12:26.159" style="s2">disheartening but</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.679" end="01:12:26.880" style="s2">i guess i&#39;m more optimistic that more</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.159" end="01:12:30.239" style="s2">people do</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.880" end="01:12:33.840" style="s2">want to believe the truth of the matter</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.239" end="01:12:34.480" style="s2">despite the cost i guess let me see if i</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.840" end="01:12:37.520" style="s2">can rephrase</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.480" end="01:12:39.520" style="s2">my question is that like truth is</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.520" end="01:12:40.719" style="s2">a key value of a street epistemologist</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.520" end="01:12:42.880" style="s2">the key value of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.719" end="01:12:44.719" style="s2">and it&#39;s a value that um that you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.880" end="01:12:45.360" style="s2">know gesturing towards strongly when you</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.719" end="01:12:48.400" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.360" end="01:12:49.120" style="s2">engaged in this method but does it need</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.400" end="01:12:52.159" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.120" end="01:12:54.480" style="s2">held by another value um</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.159" end="01:12:56.400" style="s2">you know like something that a value</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.480" end="01:12:59.520" style="s2">that naturally engenders</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.400" end="01:13:00.880" style="s2">care empathy you know like paul evander</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.520" end="01:13:02.800" style="s2">clay talked about love</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.880" end="01:13:04.320" style="s2">um or are you just instrumentalizing</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.800" end="01:13:04.719" style="s2">empathy and all this stuff in order to</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.320" end="01:13:08.320" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.719" end="01:13:11.920" style="s2">that value of truth leveraging empathy</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.320" end="01:13:14.159" style="s2">in order to have a really good talk</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.920" end="01:13:15.920" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s probably something every</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.159" end="01:13:17.520" style="s2">every person who learns this approach is</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.920" end="01:13:18.320" style="s2">going to have to answer for themselves</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.520" end="01:13:20.960" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.320" end="01:13:23.120" style="s2">am i leveraging the empathy that i have</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.960" end="01:13:24.719" style="s2">that i&#39;m capable of</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.120" end="01:13:26.719" style="s2">to challenge people&#39;s views that i</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.719" end="01:13:28.000" style="s2">happen to disagree with i think it can</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.719" end="01:13:30.239" style="s2">be used that way</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.000" end="01:13:32.000" style="s2">you can weaponize this approach you can</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.239" end="01:13:35.360" style="s2">you can probably use it for nefarious</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.000" end="01:13:35.360" style="s2">means um</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.920" end="01:13:39.760" style="s2">i mean i i don&#39;t think that i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.760" end="01:13:40.960" style="s2">that like i i think that when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.760" end="01:13:42.960" style="s2">talking with people about their views</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.960" end="01:13:44.719" style="s2">i&#39;m genuinely interested in their</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.960" end="01:13:47.280" style="s2">reasons and their methods</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.719" end="01:13:48.400" style="s2">and helping them discover that their bad</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.280" end="01:13:51.600" style="s2">reasons like unr</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.400" end="01:13:54.080" style="s2">uh their um their poor reasons</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.600" end="01:13:55.840" style="s2">and their unreliable epistemologies like</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.080" end="01:13:57.840" style="s2">that that excites me</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.840" end="01:13:58.880" style="s2">when i can see somebody thinking about a</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.840" end="01:14:02.560" style="s2">deeply held belief</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.880" end="01:14:04.000" style="s2">and giving it some thought like hmm</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.560" end="01:14:06.320" style="s2">you&#39;re asking some good questions here</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.000" end="01:14:07.360" style="s2">like that&#39;s a really fun i mean it feels</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.320" end="01:14:10.800" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.360" end="01:14:12.840" style="s2">but um you know on the same hand</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.800" end="01:14:14.880" style="s2">you have to sort of recognize that your</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.840" end="01:14:17.360" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.880" end="01:14:19.840" style="s2">the the types of questions that we ask</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.360" end="01:14:22.960" style="s2">can be problematic for some people</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.840" end="01:14:24.960" style="s2">you could actually harm people</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.960" end="01:14:26.000" style="s2">i think with this approach you have to</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.960" end="01:14:28.320" style="s2">be focused you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.000" end="01:14:29.120" style="s2">really paying attention to the dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.320" end="01:14:31.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.120" end="01:14:32.480" style="s2">i think that that&#39;s that&#39;s my own view i</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.280" end="01:14:33.520" style="s2">think that there are some practitioners</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.480" end="01:14:35.840" style="s2">of us here like</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.520" end="01:14:36.719" style="s2">forget the consent forget the ethics of</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.840" end="01:14:38.159" style="s2">it like i just want to</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.719" end="01:14:40.480" style="s2">see people squirm a little bit when i</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.159" end="01:14:42.239" style="s2">ask them you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.480" end="01:14:43.840" style="s2">why they&#39;re not wearing their mask at</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.239" end="01:14:44.800" style="s2">walmart or something you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.840" end="01:14:48.719" style="s2">there are some people who sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.800" end="01:14:51.120" style="s2">enjoyed that but uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.719" end="01:14:52.719" style="s2">i don&#39;t know like par a big part of me</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.120" end="01:14:56.320" style="s2">sort of realizes that uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.719" end="01:14:59.040" style="s2">i i am very likely</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.320" end="01:15:01.360" style="s2">holding views of reality that i cannot</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.040" end="01:15:05.280" style="s2">justify to myself</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.360" end="01:15:06.560" style="s2">um i i want people to help me figure</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.280" end="01:15:08.320" style="s2">that out so i can stop</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.560" end="01:15:10.400" style="s2">putting as much weight on those views</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.320" end="01:15:12.239" style="s2">that are influencing my behavior</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.400" end="01:15:14.000" style="s2">and i guess i sort of assume that people</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.239" end="01:15:15.679" style="s2">feel the same way but</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.000" end="01:15:17.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t you really need to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.679" end="01:15:19.120" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.280" end="01:15:20.640" style="s2">almost maybe sort of like an agreement</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.120" end="01:15:22.480" style="s2">at the start this is what i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.640" end="01:15:23.760" style="s2">talk about here&#39;s the potential outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.480" end="01:15:25.760" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.760" end="01:15:27.199" style="s2">i&#39;ll be here for you after if you need</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.760" end="01:15:32.239" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.199" end="01:15:33.840" style="s2">um but whether or not yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.239" end="01:15:35.040" style="s2">you&#39;re asking some good questions i i</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.840" end="01:15:36.800" style="s2">don&#39;t know if i could answer that</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.040" end="01:15:38.719" style="s2">question any further than i&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.800" end="01:15:39.920" style="s2">brought you there</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.719" end="01:15:41.360" style="s2">and i guess the metaphor that comes to</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.920" end="01:15:42.080" style="s2">mind is like martial artists at least a</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.360" end="01:15:44.159" style="s2">traditional</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.080" end="01:15:45.840" style="s2">martial artist like they teach you to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.159" end="01:15:48.239" style="s2">effective with your body</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.840" end="01:15:50.400" style="s2">um but they have you know this whole</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.239" end="01:15:53.440" style="s2">ecology of values that are</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.400" end="01:15:56.560" style="s2">surrounded by that like honor integrity</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.440" end="01:15:59.840" style="s2">um in order not to disabuse your</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.560" end="01:16:02.880" style="s2">or abuse i should say that skill set</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.840" end="01:16:04.880" style="s2">well street epistemology people who are</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.880" end="01:16:06.080" style="s2">into psychotherapy may notice some</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.880" end="01:16:07.679" style="s2">similarities</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.080" end="01:16:09.440" style="s2">i&#39;m actually curious if there&#39;s anyone</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.679" end="01:16:11.120" style="s2">here who who has experience in</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.440" end="01:16:14.080" style="s2">motivational interviewing or</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.120" end="01:16:14.080" style="s2">or psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.600" end="01:16:18.719" style="s2">there seems to be some parallels there</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.199" end="01:16:21.120" style="s2">but one thing that i noticed that</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.719" end="01:16:22.960" style="s2">people who are psychotherapists they</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.120" end="01:16:24.800" style="s2">have a formal education</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.960" end="01:16:26.080" style="s2">there there may actually be a code of</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.800" end="01:16:27.679" style="s2">ethics</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.080" end="01:16:29.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t actually know if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.679" end="01:16:30.560" style="s2">but i would think that if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.120" end="01:16:34.000" style="s2">professional</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.560" end="01:16:35.440" style="s2">psychotherapist you you probably</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.000" end="01:16:37.360" style="s2">is that the case i don&#39;t know like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.440" end="01:16:38.960" style="s2">thinking that um there&#39;s a professional</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.360" end="01:16:42.320" style="s2">aspect to some of these</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.960" end="01:16:44.000" style="s2">techniques where um there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.320" end="01:16:45.199" style="s2">oversight there&#39;s some there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.000" end="01:16:48.480" style="s2">standards</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.199" end="01:16:49.520" style="s2">and we don&#39;t have that here like again</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.480" end="01:16:50.880" style="s2">people are reading books they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.520" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">watching videos and they&#39;re attempting</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.880" end="01:16:55.199" style="s2">it and we&#39;re like seeing what&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:57.600" style="s2">and what&#39;s not and we&#39;re refining it</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.199" end="01:16:58.320" style="s2">um there&#39;s no ethics board at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.600" end="01:16:59.679" style="s2">for se</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.320" end="01:17:02.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if there ever will be or if</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.679" end="01:17:03.679" style="s2">there should be maybe there maybe</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.159" end="01:17:05.120" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll be kicking ourselves that we</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.679" end="01:17:05.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t set something up sooner i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.120" end="01:17:09.520" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.840" end="01:17:10.719" style="s2">but i think if we always at the back of</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.520" end="01:17:14.239" style="s2">my mind i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.719" end="01:17:14.960" style="s2">if we if we tighten this down too much</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.239" end="01:17:18.239" style="s2">at the start</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.960" end="01:17:20.880" style="s2">it could limit our ability to creatively</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.239" end="01:17:20.880" style="s2">evolve it</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.360" end="01:17:26.560" style="s2">so maybe at the start it might be a</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.520" end="01:17:28.560" style="s2">little bit unethical i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.560" end="01:17:31.199" style="s2">like maybe the ethicalness of this will</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.560" end="01:17:34.400" style="s2">sort of increase as our</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.199" end="01:17:36.960" style="s2">as our formalization of the process</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.400" end="01:17:38.480" style="s2">increases too i&#39;m not exactly sure but</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.960" end="01:17:40.239" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.480" end="01:17:42.000" style="s2">the the thing that&#39;s getting people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.239" end="01:17:44.800" style="s2">attention and the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.000" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">developing this approach further</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.800" end="01:17:48.239" style="s2">is that there really are no rules at the</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.800" end="01:17:50.000" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.239" end="01:17:52.480" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good or a bad</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.000" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">thing i&#39;m my sense is that it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.480" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">good thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.840" end="01:18:02.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.040" end="01:18:04.400" style="s2">oop uh i think we lost you anthony</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.800" end="01:18:07.199" style="s2">can anyone else here anthony give me a</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.400" end="01:18:07.199" style="s2">little no</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.719" end="01:18:14.239" style="s2">um wait</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.320" end="01:18:17.280" style="s2">a couple of moments and then we might</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.239" end="01:18:21.520" style="s2">close out because we</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.280" end="01:18:21.520" style="s2">passed some 50 minute mark</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.480" end="01:18:28.159" style="s2">i was getting some juicy territory</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.600" end="01:18:29.520" style="s2">storm took him out maybe thunder strike</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.159" end="01:18:32.480" style="s2">hope it wasn&#39;t a direct one</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.520" end="01:18:34.000" style="s2">okay so um i&#39;m going to put anthony in</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.480" end="01:18:37.760" style="s2">the the waiting room bring him back</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.000" end="01:18:37.760" style="s2">in see if he</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.000" end="01:18:41.840" style="s2">comes back if not</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.480" end="01:18:47.280" style="s2">anthony are you there</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.360" end="01:18:56.239" style="s2">yeah mute yourself</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.679" end="01:19:01.280" style="s2">oh you&#39;re on mute still anthony</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.360" end="01:19:04.400" style="s2">you gotta unmute okay there we go there</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.360" end="01:19:06.719" style="s2">we go you&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.400" end="01:19:08.000" style="s2">you think i&#39;m a novice of this um i just</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.719" end="01:19:10.239" style="s2">got up to check and see what was going</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.000" end="01:19:11.440" style="s2">on and it turns out that uh my wife just</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.239" end="01:19:12.800" style="s2">got home from work and she said that</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.440" end="01:19:15.679" style="s2">it&#39;s raining outside so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.800" end="01:19:17.280" style="s2">i guess it might be weather related um i</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.679" end="01:19:22.560" style="s2">don&#39;t know where i dropped off there but</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.280" end="01:19:24.880" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.560" end="01:19:25.840" style="s2">yeah like um i can&#39;t i can&#39;t remember we</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.880" end="01:19:28.719" style="s2">dropped off either</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.840" end="01:19:29.360" style="s2">uh how about uh we end off with one more</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.719" end="01:19:32.320" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.360" end="01:19:32.719" style="s2">and then um oh yeah the thing i wanted</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.320" end="01:19:35.679" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.719" end="01:19:36.640" style="s2">with that is that just to summarize uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.679" end="01:19:38.880" style="s2">what i heard</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.640" end="01:19:40.080" style="s2">sort of like a code of ethics hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.880" end="01:19:41.199" style="s2">been developed or hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.080" end="01:19:43.040" style="s2">naturally emerged that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.199" end="01:19:44.640" style="s2">commonly agreed upon because the focus</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.040" end="01:19:46.000" style="s2">has been refining the method and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.640" end="01:19:47.199" style="s2">excitement about that</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.000" end="01:19:48.960" style="s2">and then there&#39;s an interesting point</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.199" end="01:19:50.960" style="s2">that you made that if you focus too much</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.960" end="01:19:54.560" style="s2">on the code of ethics that kind of might</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.960" end="01:19:55.679" style="s2">um ameliorate uh the focus on actual</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.560" end="01:19:58.719" style="s2">the actual kind of improvement of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.679" end="01:20:00.560" style="s2">method that&#39;s my concern</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.719" end="01:20:02.159" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s warranted or not</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.560" end="01:20:03.120" style="s2">like maybe we can do both at the same</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.159" end="01:20:05.120" style="s2">time where</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.120" end="01:20:07.280" style="s2">we&#39;re integrating a code of ethics into</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.120" end="01:20:08.719" style="s2">the application of the approach</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.280" end="01:20:10.639" style="s2">while at the same time we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.719" end="01:20:11.520" style="s2">encouraging experimentation and</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.639" end="01:20:14.639" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.520" end="01:20:16.000" style="s2">i mean maybe it&#39;s possible my sense is</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.639" end="01:20:18.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.000" end="01:20:19.760" style="s2">this is maybe where it dropped off but i</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.080" end="01:20:21.600" style="s2">think my sense is that</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.760" end="01:20:23.360" style="s2">we&#39;re probably in a really good spot now</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.600" end="01:20:24.719" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.360" end="01:20:26.719" style="s2">all sorts of people from around the</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.719" end="01:20:27.920" style="s2">world and all sorts of different tribes</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.719" end="01:20:28.960" style="s2">are learning the approach and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.920" end="01:20:30.560" style="s2">practicing it</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.960" end="01:20:32.400" style="s2">and then hopefully they&#39;re sharing what</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.560" end="01:20:34.239" style="s2">seems to be working what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.400" end="01:20:36.719" style="s2">like that&#39;s that&#39;s a really good spot to</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.239" end="01:20:38.719" style="s2">be in but will we always be here</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.719" end="01:20:39.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t know we might actually see some</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.719" end="01:20:42.960" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.840" end="01:20:44.320" style="s2">codified standard of ethics or something</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.960" end="01:20:46.159" style="s2">to be a practitioner but</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.320" end="01:20:47.600" style="s2">like okay so we come up with it how do</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.159" end="01:20:49.040" style="s2">you enforce it like are we going to</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.600" end="01:20:51.120" style="s2">throw people in jail for</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.040" end="01:20:53.679" style="s2">you know not not following the street</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.120" end="01:20:56.960" style="s2">epistemology code of ethics</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.679" end="01:20:59.040" style="s2">so it it almost seems kind of funny</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.960" end="01:21:00.890" style="s2">but i understand people&#39;s concerns about</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.040" end="01:21:02.719" style="s2">it i absolutely do</p>

<p begin="01:21:22.080" end="01:21:27.120" style="s2">bunch of your videos a few years ago</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.400" end="01:21:28.719" style="s2">so oh gosh um maybe watch something more</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.120" end="01:21:29.920" style="s2">recent hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.719" end="01:21:31.840" style="s2">i like to think it&#39;s changed a little</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.920" end="01:21:34.880" style="s2">bit soon</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.840" end="01:21:36.719" style="s2">okay um anthony are you doxtastically</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.880" end="01:21:39.760" style="s2">open to the belief</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.719" end="01:21:40.880" style="s2">that there is no such thing as objective</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.760" end="01:21:44.159" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.880" end="01:21:45.760" style="s2">or that trying to find something like</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.159" end="01:21:50.239" style="s2">objective truth</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.760" end="01:21:50.239" style="s2">is not like useful</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.639" end="01:21:58.239" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m open to both</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.880" end="01:22:00.320" style="s2">i&#39;m open to both ideas that uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.239" end="01:22:01.679" style="s2">that maybe subjective truth is the best</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.320" end="01:22:05.280" style="s2">way to navigate the world</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.679" end="01:22:06.880" style="s2">for human beings that uh hey you know as</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.280" end="01:22:09.920" style="s2">long as you get value from it</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.880" end="01:22:11.600" style="s2">and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.920" end="01:22:14.639" style="s2">you&#39;re less stressed you know as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.600" end="01:22:15.840" style="s2">navigating the world like</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.639" end="01:22:18.480" style="s2">i guess it all depends on what your</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.840" end="01:22:22.639" style="s2">values are like if i value</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.480" end="01:22:22.639" style="s2">longevity and uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.440" end="01:22:27.280" style="s2">i got yeah i don&#39;t want to get too far</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.000" end="01:22:29.840" style="s2">off our field but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.280" end="01:22:31.120" style="s2">i think i&#39;m open to the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.840" end="01:22:32.880" style="s2">subjective truth</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.120" end="01:22:35.040" style="s2">might be more valuable than objective</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.880" end="01:22:36.639" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.040" end="01:22:38.080" style="s2">there was there was a second piece uh to</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.639" end="01:22:38.560" style="s2">your question there what was the other</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.080" end="01:22:41.760" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.560" end="01:22:45.440" style="s2">yeah so um or</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.760" end="01:22:48.320" style="s2">sorry it&#39;s kind of dark here um the</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.440" end="01:22:48.800" style="s2">so the example you used earlier was like</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.320" end="01:22:50.560" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.800" end="01:22:52.800" style="s2">box of tic-tacs and knowing whether or</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.560" end="01:22:56.159" style="s2">not there is an even or odd number</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.800" end="01:22:59.199" style="s2">um and i think it</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.159" end="01:23:03.920" style="s2">in my opinion it&#39;s kind of a big stretch</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.199" end="01:23:07.040" style="s2">to say like um oh</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.920" end="01:23:08.880" style="s2">that knowing the how many</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.040" end="01:23:10.639" style="s2">tic tacs are in a box can be</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.880" end="01:23:11.600" style="s2">extrapolated to things sort of like oh</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.639" end="01:23:12.719" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.600" end="01:23:14.639" style="s2">should be done or what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.719" end="01:23:16.400" style="s2">prescriptive things</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.639" end="01:23:17.920" style="s2">like we should have a value in objective</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.400" end="01:23:19.760" style="s2">truth um and</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.920" end="01:23:21.120" style="s2">one example i sort of thought of was do</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.760" end="01:23:23.840" style="s2">you know the</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.120" end="01:23:25.199" style="s2">it might be insist uh thinking fast and</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.840" end="01:23:27.679" style="s2">slow but</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.199" end="01:23:30.000" style="s2">the people if you try and get people to</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.679" end="01:23:33.280" style="s2">like identify</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.000" end="01:23:34.800" style="s2">like describe or draw the back of a</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.280" end="01:23:36.639" style="s2">penny with abe lincoln&#39;s face and like</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.800" end="01:23:38.400" style="s2">where the different things are</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.639" end="01:23:39.679" style="s2">right they don&#39;t really pick up on those</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.400" end="01:23:41.760" style="s2">little details</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.679" end="01:23:43.920" style="s2">right so to me it seems like like the</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.760" end="01:23:47.360" style="s2">tic tac box might be something</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.920" end="01:23:48.480" style="s2">um like you know trivial that is not</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.360" end="01:23:51.840" style="s2">really useful to</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.480" end="01:23:53.760" style="s2">for people to know um</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.840" end="01:23:54.880" style="s2">do you sorry i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.760" end="01:23:55.840" style="s2">that was a question but do you have any</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.880" end="01:23:58.960" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.840" end="01:24:00.560" style="s2">i do i mean the the tic tac test</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.960" end="01:24:02.000" style="s2">of asking people if they think the total</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.560" end="01:24:04.000" style="s2">number of pieces is either</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.000" end="01:24:05.199" style="s2">even or odd and it can&#39;t simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.000" end="01:24:08.400" style="s2">both be both</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.199" end="01:24:10.960" style="s2">is a very simple example</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.400" end="01:24:13.360" style="s2">to try to see if a person agrees that</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.960" end="01:24:15.120" style="s2">truth is objective</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.360" end="01:24:16.960" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not the best example i mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.120" end="01:24:18.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve used examples in the field where i</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.960" end="01:24:20.800" style="s2">said something like uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.400" end="01:24:21.600" style="s2">like i met this one woman on the trail</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.800" end="01:24:24.000" style="s2">and she</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.600" end="01:24:25.360" style="s2">was here from poland or something and</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.000" end="01:24:26.639" style="s2">she specifically wanted to see</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.360" end="01:24:28.159" style="s2">armadillos</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.639" end="01:24:30.239" style="s2">and then we started talking and she</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.159" end="01:24:32.159" style="s2">started going relativistic</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.239" end="01:24:33.760" style="s2">she later asked me not to upload the</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.159" end="01:24:36.159" style="s2">video so i&#39;m just i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.760" end="01:24:37.840" style="s2">it tears me apart but we started talking</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.159" end="01:24:40.719" style="s2">about armadillos and if she thinks that</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.840" end="01:24:42.400" style="s2">they&#39;re live bearers or egg layers</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.719" end="01:24:44.080" style="s2">and she&#39;s like i don&#39;t know what i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.400" end="01:24:45.199" style="s2">sure i&#39;m like i actually don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.080" end="01:24:46.880" style="s2">it is either</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.199" end="01:24:48.719" style="s2">however would you agree that it&#39;s one or</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.880" end="01:24:51.120" style="s2">the other and it can&#39;t be both</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.719" end="01:24:52.320" style="s2">so you can still use real world examples</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.120" end="01:24:55.520" style="s2">like for example</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.320" end="01:24:58.080" style="s2">um did russia</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.520" end="01:24:59.520" style="s2">did trump collude with russia either he</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.080" end="01:25:01.360" style="s2">did or he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.520" end="01:25:02.639" style="s2">like i mean there&#39;s a there&#39;s a factual</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.360" end="01:25:05.760" style="s2">matter to it</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.639" end="01:25:07.760" style="s2">but um it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.760" end="01:25:09.120" style="s2">explore the quality of a person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.760" end="01:25:11.920" style="s2">reasons for thinking</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.120" end="01:25:14.159" style="s2">that something is true if they if they</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.920" end="01:25:17.840" style="s2">defer to the subjectivity</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.159" end="01:25:19.280" style="s2">of our reality so for example</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.840" end="01:25:21.360" style="s2">a very good question we might ask</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.280" end="01:25:23.280" style="s2">somebody is like you know the hindu is</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.360" end="01:25:24.880" style="s2">just as confident that their god is real</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.280" end="01:25:26.560" style="s2">and they also base their</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.880" end="01:25:28.159" style="s2">they also use faith to come to their</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.560" end="01:25:29.280" style="s2">conclusion and</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.159" end="01:25:31.440" style="s2">for somebody who would answer the</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.280" end="01:25:32.639" style="s2">question about the tic tacs and say</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.440" end="01:25:34.480" style="s2">it could both be even and odd</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.639" end="01:25:35.920" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.480" end="01:25:37.520" style="s2">when you ask them a question that we</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.920" end="01:25:38.880" style="s2">call the outsider test for faith they</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.520" end="01:25:41.600" style="s2">will often say well</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.880" end="01:25:43.199" style="s2">the hindu is correct and i&#39;m correct</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.600" end="01:25:44.080" style="s2">we&#39;re both correct that our gods are</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.199" end="01:25:46.000" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.080" end="01:25:48.639" style="s2">even though these are contradictory gods</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.000" end="01:25:50.719" style="s2">and and i think the</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.639" end="01:25:51.840" style="s2">at least the christian might say well</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.719" end="01:25:53.600" style="s2">there&#39;s only one god</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.840" end="01:25:56.080" style="s2">where&#39;s the hindu might the hindu might</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.600" end="01:25:58.560" style="s2">allow for the the christian god</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.080" end="01:25:59.679" style="s2">so one thing that we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.560" end="01:26:01.600" style="s2">with with se</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.679" end="01:26:03.040" style="s2">and sometimes it&#39;s a liability maybe but</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.600" end="01:26:04.320" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to take really complex</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.040" end="01:26:07.520" style="s2">topics</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.320" end="01:26:10.159" style="s2">and and make them understandable</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.520" end="01:26:11.360" style="s2">so that we can discuss the beliefs that</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.159" end="01:26:13.120" style="s2">we&#39;re holding and the confidence that</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.360" end="01:26:16.480" style="s2">we&#39;re putting in the beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.120" end="01:26:18.239" style="s2">um is it is the best is it the best tool</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.480" end="01:26:18.560" style="s2">or the best example the most realistic</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.239" end="01:26:22.000" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.560" end="01:26:23.760" style="s2">no but it&#39;s very simple and it usually</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.000" end="01:26:25.600" style="s2">helps getting people thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.760" end="01:26:29.360" style="s2">these these views</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.600" end="01:26:32.560" style="s2">of objective and subjective truth</p>

<p begin="01:27:15.280" end="01:27:18.400" style="s2">with for the people who are listening on</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.800" end="01:27:21.679" style="s2">the recording and people in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.400" end="01:27:24.880" style="s2">room right now um</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.679" end="01:27:24.880" style="s2">any thoughts um</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.600" end="01:27:29.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i mean we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.239" end="01:27:31.520" style="s2">outside perspectives to help make this</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.840" end="01:27:32.960" style="s2">better i think that&#39;s been a continuing</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.520" end="01:27:33.840" style="s2">theme throughout this whole interview</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.960" end="01:27:35.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.840" end="01:27:37.040" style="s2">you know this this was largely started</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.440" end="01:27:38.960" style="s2">in the atheist community but it</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.040" end="01:27:40.080" style="s2">we don&#39;t want it to stay there like i</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.960" end="01:27:42.000" style="s2">think that could be that could be the</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.080" end="01:27:45.600" style="s2">worst thing for street epistemology</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.000" end="01:27:46.159" style="s2">to to stay in one cloistered into one</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.600" end="01:27:48.560" style="s2">tribe</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.159" end="01:27:50.400" style="s2">like we want people from around the if</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.560" end="01:27:52.480" style="s2">you&#39;re in black lives matter</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.400" end="01:27:54.159" style="s2">join the street epistemology server if</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.480" end="01:27:56.960" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re a trump fan</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.159" end="01:27:58.080" style="s2">join the street epistemology server um</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.960" end="01:28:01.120" style="s2">that would be my advice</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.080" end="01:28:03.520" style="s2">is help us make this better and and</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.120" end="01:28:06.000" style="s2">bring these tools to your tribes</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.520" end="01:28:08.960" style="s2">so that you can challenge them on the</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.000" end="01:28:08.960" style="s2">claims that they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.840" end="01:28:13.360" style="s2">and uh two things that i&#39;ll kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.440" end="01:28:14.000" style="s2">suggest is a potential uh collaboration</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.360" end="01:28:18.000" style="s2">with the stone</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.000" end="01:28:21.520" style="s2">and the sc um one one thing um</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.000" end="01:28:23.040" style="s2">uh edward rush uh the guy who created uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.520" end="01:28:24.320" style="s2">empathy circles that dan was talking</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.040" end="01:28:25.440" style="s2">about uh he&#39;s gonna come to the store</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.320" end="01:28:26.960" style="s2">and he&#39;s gonna do training empathy</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.440" end="01:28:29.040" style="s2">circle training for the stoa</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.960" end="01:28:30.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s like a technique um it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.040" end="01:28:32.400" style="s2">gamifies carl rogers</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.800" end="01:28:33.760" style="s2">active listening where you just repeat</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.400" end="01:28:35.199" style="s2">what the other person said in your own</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.760" end="01:28:36.960" style="s2">words so they feel understood</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.199" end="01:28:38.400" style="s2">um just to kind of build that listening</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.960" end="01:28:39.760" style="s2">understanding muscle so we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.400" end="01:28:42.239" style="s2">get training in that here</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.760" end="01:28:43.199" style="s2">and i&#39;m a fan of the um sc technique and</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.239" end="01:28:45.040" style="s2">that would be cool if there could be</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.199" end="01:28:47.920" style="s2">some kind of sc training for the stoa</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.040" end="01:28:48.960" style="s2">village um i&#39;d be very because as you</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.920" end="01:28:51.360" style="s2">can kind of tell just from the questions</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.960" end="01:28:53.600" style="s2">that you&#39;re getting we got like a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.360" end="01:28:56.080" style="s2">juicy oddball people uh like coming in</p>

<p begin="01:29:06.960" end="01:29:11.679" style="s2">yeah i would love to have some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.320" end="01:29:12.880" style="s2">training even if it&#39;s informal yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.679" end="01:29:15.520" style="s2">we have people from the community i</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.880" end="01:29:17.120" style="s2">noticed dolly&#39;s in here he&#39;s been having</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.520" end="01:29:19.199" style="s2">is it weekly dolly maybe just nod your</p>

<p begin="01:29:21.040" end="01:29:24.560" style="s2">weekly training sessions</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.480" end="01:29:25.679" style="s2">where people interested in this approach</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.560" end="01:29:28.880" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.679" end="01:29:31.120" style="s2">can practice street epistemology</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.880" end="01:29:31.920" style="s2">there are there&#39;s an effort to develop a</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.120" end="01:29:33.920" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.920" end="01:29:36.320" style="s2">so that we can like a web app type of</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.920" end="01:29:38.560" style="s2">course for people to learn this approach</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.320" end="01:29:40.320" style="s2">and then uh by all means please watch</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.560" end="01:29:42.480" style="s2">the videos like watching people talk</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.320" end="01:29:44.159" style="s2">about all different types of claims</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.480" end="01:29:45.520" style="s2">and having them explored where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.159" end="01:29:47.120" style="s2">getting heated it&#39;s not getting</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.520" end="01:29:50.800" style="s2">contentious</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.120" end="01:29:52.560" style="s2">um the rabbit hole goes very deep for</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.800" end="01:29:53.360" style="s2">street epistemologies let me put it that</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.560" end="01:29:56.400" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.360" end="01:30:00.159" style="s2">there are people who are very eager</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.400" end="01:30:03.120" style="s2">to teach you how to do this and uh</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.159" end="01:30:03.360" style="s2">and help us make it better yeah and then</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.120" end="01:30:06.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.360" end="01:30:07.360" style="s2">other uh um thing i i and this is</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.000" end="01:30:09.520" style="s2">something we can talk offline</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.360" end="01:30:11.280" style="s2">is having maybe some kind of like battle</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.520" end="01:30:12.800" style="s2">royale where people like christians paul</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.280" end="01:30:14.800" style="s2">vander clay comes in and some</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.800" end="01:30:16.239" style="s2">sd comes in and they have displayed the</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.800" end="01:30:17.840" style="s2">method have conversations</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.239" end="01:30:19.360" style="s2">before i&#39;m so glad that you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.840" end="01:30:20.400" style="s2">that because i&#39;ve been talking to some</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.360" end="01:30:22.080" style="s2">of the people who</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.400" end="01:30:23.440" style="s2">have been involved in this community for</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.080" end="01:30:24.880" style="s2">a number of years</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.440" end="01:30:26.320" style="s2">and uh i don&#39;t want to take credit for</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.880" end="01:30:28.719" style="s2">it but i don&#39;t remember exactly who said</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.320" end="01:30:31.840" style="s2">it but somebody has suggested</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.719" end="01:30:33.760" style="s2">and i love this idea like maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.840" end="01:30:35.040" style="s2">street epistemology community can be the</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.760" end="01:30:36.000" style="s2">place where people from these different</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.040" end="01:30:38.480" style="s2">memetic tribes</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.000" end="01:30:39.679" style="s2">come to in order to bounce their ideas</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.480" end="01:30:42.159" style="s2">off of people</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.679" end="01:30:43.280" style="s2">and you don&#39;t even necessarily have to</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.159" end="01:30:44.960" style="s2">know the approach</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.280" end="01:30:47.520" style="s2">we might actually be able to assign a</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.960" end="01:30:49.520" style="s2">facilitator of some sorts where</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.520" end="01:30:51.360" style="s2">there can be an intermediary talking to</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.520" end="01:30:54.239" style="s2">the black lives matter</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.360" end="01:30:55.360" style="s2">uh proponent and somebody from antifa</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.239" end="01:30:57.520" style="s2">maybe or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.360" end="01:30:59.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t know um it&#39;s conceivable with</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.520" end="01:31:00.239" style="s2">the technology that we have and</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.120" end="01:31:02.480" style="s2">and the ease with which we can</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.239" end="01:31:03.840" style="s2">communicate where maybe we can bring</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.480" end="01:31:06.719" style="s2">these different groups together</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.840" end="01:31:08.239" style="s2">in the in these different sc communities</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.719" end="01:31:10.239" style="s2">and sort of hash these things out</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.239" end="01:31:11.679" style="s2">and maybe record it wouldn&#39;t that be</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.239" end="01:31:13.199" style="s2">cool to to</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.679" end="01:31:15.280" style="s2">to show people from these different</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.199" end="01:31:16.400" style="s2">tribes talking respectfully and making</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.280" end="01:31:19.280" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.400" end="01:31:20.960" style="s2">yeah totally um and if you ever want to</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.280" end="01:31:21.760" style="s2">use a still as a prototype or you know</p>
